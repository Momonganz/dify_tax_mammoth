www.ird.govt.nz \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 October 2023 D ear T hank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 7 September 2023, requesting an update on the data for Early Childhood Education (ECE) providers Inland Revenue provided to you in response to your 16 December 2022 request, as follows: Please can you provide an update to this official information for the data you hold for 2022 / 2023. Please use the most updated methods – as discussed with Nicola Hutcheon on 24 January, with the updated data received by ECC on 8 March. It is important that we are comparing data sets extracted by the same methods, to ensure consistency and accuracy. On 18 September 2023, you clarified your request to exclude data for the 2022-23 tax year as Inland Revenue does not yet hold comprehensive income tax information from taxpayers for this year and to instead include data for the 2021 -22 tax year. The debt data is point-in time and does not have the same coverage issues. Information Consistency The first reply to your December request was based on Business Industry Classification (BIC) codes but did not provide sufficient coverage on ECE providers. Our second reply of 8 March 2023 used an expanded range of BIC codes. As mentioned, Inland Revenue does not yet hold comprehensive income tax information from taxpayers for the 2022-23 tax year because entities represented by tax agents have up to a year to file their income tax returns, and for these entities the 2022-23 returns are not due until 31 March 2024. Taxpayers can file their returns earlier, and there is a particular incentive to do so for taxpayers who feel they may have overpaid their 2022-23 provisional tax and who are seeking a refund or perhaps a smaller provisional tax calculation for the 2023-24 year. Taxpayers without tax agents were required to file by 7 July 2023. A consequence of the settings is that early (incomplete) data from income tax returns is biased towards either smaller parties (e.g., those not using an agent) and/or towards taxpayers with a downwards trend in taxable activity. Biased data will not meet your needs for consistency and accuracy. Information being released Income tax Tables 1 and 2 in the Appendix include data for the 2021-22 tax year and provide updates to data previously provided for 2019-20 and 2020-21 tax years due to updated taxpayer filing activity. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The tables are again based on business customers filing IR4 - company tax returns, IR9 - club/society returns or IR6 - Trust returns where the customer has used any of the following business industry codes (BIC): • Q871020 - child minding centre, excluding home-based, • P801010 - kindergartens or accredited pre-primary school education, or • P801020 - pre-schools providing accredited pre-primary education. The information provided in Tables 1 and 2 is filtered by taxpayers using these BIC codes, and by those who have filed any of these three types of income tax returns. Again, I have not provided data for partnerships as IR7 – partnership returns do not contain a tax figure because the income tax liability is passed through to the individual partners. As you have previously confirmed that individuals will not likely be the demographic that you are seeking, I have also excluded unincorporated individuals and partners of partnerships, as there are likely to be many additional variables such as salary/wage income that could distort their individual tax liability. I have again taken the approach to apply the trust tax rate of 33% to calculate tax for trust IR6 returns regardless of any attribution through to underlying beneficiaries. Table 1 includes nil returns, and Table 2 excludes them. Table 2 may be more useful for your previously stated intent if you want to focus only on those entities with non-zero tax obligations. The income variable provided is taxable income. This is calculated after any brought forward losses have been claimed which may have reduced taxable income to nil. Any current-year net loss is also treated as nil taxable income in these tables. The tax variable is residual income tax. This is tax payable by the entity directly and is net of any withholding tax credits from any income streams on which the tax has already been paid. Debt Aligning with the data I am providing for tax, I am releasing debt information for companies, trusts and clubs/societies that have used with BIC Codes Q871020 (child minding centre, excluding home-based), P801010 (kindergartens or accredited pre- primary school education), and P801020 (pre-schools providing accredited pre-primary school education). To align with Inland Revenue’s standard debt reporting methodology, the debt information provided is the total value of debt as at the last day of each respective tax year, rather than the debt attributed to that tax year. The debt information has been separated by tax product including Income Tax, Employer (PAYE), and GST. The remainder of smaller tax products have been grouped into the “Other” category. The average, median and quartile information provided applies to the total debt value. Table 3 in the Appendix provides the ECE providers debt figures for tax years between 2014 and 2023. While preparing the updated information for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, an issue was identified with the information that was previously sent to you. Apologies for this error. Debt was incorrectly counted in items instead of customers, so if a customer had a debt in more than one period, they would be counted more than once. As a result, total number of customers and the mean value of debt was incorrect. The total debt, and the lower and upper quartile information are correct and unchanged. The table has been updated to reflect the correct number of customers, and the correct mean value of total debt.
