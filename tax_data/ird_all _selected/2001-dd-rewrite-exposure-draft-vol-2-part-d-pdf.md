General permission (2)Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Origin:(1) BD 2(1)(b)(i), (ii). (2) new. Defined terms:amount, business, counted income, deduction, derived, general permission, incurred, person. Comment:As noted in the general commentary, the drafting of subsection (1) reflects the current section BD 2 (1)(b) and authorises a deduction only to the extent to which counted (formerly gross) income is derived. In view of the exempt income limitation in draft section DA 2 (3), it may not be necessary for the rewritten section to take this approach. It may be sufficient to authorise a deduction if there is a nexus with any income. Comment is sought on this suggestion. Subsection (1)(b) is, arguably, superfluous. DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 262 DA – General rules Private limitation (2)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature.

This rule is called the exempt income limitation. Employment limitation (4)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. This rule is called the employment limitation. Withholding tax limitation (5)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving schedular income subject to final withholding. This rule is called the withholding tax limitation. Indemnity limitation (6)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is recoverable under insurance or a right of indemnity. This rule is called the indemnity limitation. Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7)Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission.

DA 4 Treatment of depreciation loss Depreciation loss subject to general rules (1)For the purposes of applying the general permission and general limitations, an amount of depreciation loss quantified under subpart EF (Depreciation) for an item of property is treated as if it were actually a loss. Capital limitation not applying automatically (2)However, the capital limitation does not apply to such an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item of property is itself of a capital nature. Origin:(1) BD 2(1)(a). (2) BD 2(1)(a). Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, depreciable property, depreciation loss, general limitation, general permission.

This subsection is overridden by subsection (2). Exceptions (2)Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure that a person incurs in connection with the following matters: (a)a matter arising from a return of income or a return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that was fraudulent or wilfully misleading: (b)an offence under any of the Inland Revenue Acts: (c)a shortfall penalty assessed under this Act, the Tax Administration Act 1994, or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (but not an assessment that is later cancelled): (d)an objection, challenge, or appeal that is inconsequential or frivolous: (e)a matter arising under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to the extent to which it relates to a taxable activity that does not constitute a business for the purposes of this Act.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 270 DB – Specific rules for expenditure types Link with subpart DA (4)This section supplements the general permission and overrides the private limitation and the employment limitation. The other general limitations still apply. Origin:(1) DJ 5(1). (2) DJ 5(3). (3) DJ 5(4). (4) new. Defined terms:amount, business, deduction, employment limitation, general limitation, general permission, goods and services tax payable, income tax liability, income year, incurred, Inland Revenue Acts, person, private limitation, return of income, taxable activity, taxable period. Comment:Expenditure remains deductible in the income year in which it is incurred, even if the expenditure relates to another income year. However, the direct timing rule to that effect, contained in the opening words of current section DJ 5 (1), has been omitted, because the timing is sufficiently addressed by the general ‘incurred’ timing rule in draft section BD 4 (2) (Allocation of deductions to particular income years). Draft subsection (1)(a) now refers to the calculation of income tax liability as well as the determination of liability. This is consistent with the principles of self-assessment and brings the provision into line with the language already used in draft section BB 2 (1) (Principal obligations). Current section DJ 5 (2), which provides that reimbursements and recoveries of amounts previously allowed as a deduction under section DJ 5 are income, has been rewritten as section CG 4 (Recovered expenditure: determining tax liabilities). DB 4 Chatham Islands dues Expenditure on dues (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred on dues that are levied under the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 relating to goods that the person uses in connection with carrying on a business.

Cost of goods (3)Expenditure to which subsection (1) applies must not be taken into account in calculating the cost of the goods for the purpose of any deduction relating to the goods.

Comment:The reference in current section DJ 3 (1) to the Chatham Islands County Council Empowering Act 1980 is obsolete and has been omitted. The timing rule in current section DJ 3 (1), which allocates the deduction to the income year in which payment is made, has been isolated and is now expressed in a separate subsection (2).

DB 13 Payments for non-compliance with covenant for repair When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a)a lessee of land uses it to derive income; and (b)the lease contains a covenant requiring the lessee to maintain the land or to make repairs to improvements on the land, including painting and general maintenance; and (c)the lessee does not comply with the covenant; and (d)the lessee is, consequently, liable to make a payment to the lessor; and (e)either— (i) the lessee, during the term of the lease or after it ends, makes the payment to the lessor; or (ii)the lessor recovers the payment from the lessee during the term of the lease or after it ends. Cost of repairs (2)The lessee is allowed a deduction for the payment to the extent to which it relates to maintenance or repairs and to the extent to which the lessee would have been allowed a deduction for the expenditure had the lessee incurred it during the term of the lease.

Defined terms:capital limitation, deduction, derived, general limitation, general permission, income, income year, incurred, lease, lessee, lessor, term of the lease. Comment:Lessees who become liable to pay money to their lessors because of non- compliance with a covenant to maintain or repair land are allowed a deduction for any payments that they make and that relate to the maintenance and repairs by current section EO 5 (1). Current section EO 5 also directs that the deduction is allocated to the income year of payment, subject to a discretion for lessees to spread the deduction over the three preceding income years. The deduction is now allowed in this separate section in Part D (Deductions). This is consistent with Part B (Core provisions). The primary timing rule that the deduction is allocated to the income year in which the lessee makes payment is also included here. This is consistent with draft section BD 4 (2) (Allocation of deductions to particular income years). The timing rule allowing lessees to allocate the deduction to earlier income years is set out in a separate timing rule in Part E (Timing and quantifying rules). The rule is in draft section EK 18 (Payment by lessee for non- compliance with covenant for repair). DB 14 Lessors’ offsetting deduction: payments for non-compliance and change in use When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a)a lessor receives a payment for non-compliance with a covenant for repair that is counted income under section CC 2 (Payments for non-compliance with covenant for repair); and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DB – Specific rules for expenditure types 277 (b)in the income year in which the lessor receives the payment or in any of the following 4 income years,— (i)the lessor does not use the land to which the payment relates to derive counted income, but continues to own the land; and (ii)the lessor incurs expenditure in maintaining the land or in making repairs to improvements on the land, including painting and general maintenance; and (iii)the lessor would have been allowed a deduction if the land had been used for the purpose of deriving counted income; and (iv)a person is not allowed a deduction for the expenditure except under this section. Maintenance or repairs (2)The lessor is allowed a deduction in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred.

Current section EN 1 also identifies the payments for non-compliance as income, directs that the payments are recognised as income in the income year of receipt, and allows the spreading of the income. The deduction is now allowed in this separate section in Part D (Deductions). This is consistent with draft Part B (Core provisions).

The timing rule in current section EN 2 (3B), which directs that the deduction be spread when the corresponding income has been spread, has not been rewritten, as the income-spreading provision (the proviso to subsection (1) of current section EN 2) is itself obsolete and has not been rewritten.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DC – Employee or contractor expenditure 301 Eligibility (3)Employees must be eligible to participate equally in the scheme, that is, full-time permanent employees on an equal basis with every other full- time permanent employee, and, if the scheme applies to part-time employees and seasonal employees, part-time employees on an equal basis with every other part-time employee, and seasonal employees similarly with every other seasonal employee. Any minimum period of employment or service before employees are eligible to participate must not be more than 3 years’ full-time work or, for other employees, an accumulated period that is the equivalent of 3 years’ full-time work. Loans to employees (4)A loan to an employee to buy shares must be free of interest and other charges. If the loan is required to be a minimum amount, that amount must not be more than $624. Employees must be able to repay the loan by regular equal instalments at intervals of 1 month or less over a period of between 3 years and 5 years from the date of the loan, although they may choose to repay some or all of the loan before the due date for repayment. Shares held on trust (5)During the period of restriction, the trustee of the scheme must hold the shares in trust for the employee, and pay directly to the employee any dividends (which may not be put towards the repayment of any sum owed to the company or to the trustee). The dividends are treated as having been derived by the employee. The employee must not dispose of their rights or interests in the shares. When period of restriction ends (6)The following paragraphs apply when a period of restriction ends: (a)at the end of the period of restriction, the trustee must transfer the shares to the employee, unless the employee is no longer employed by the company.

Alternatively, at the option of the legal representative or former employee, the trustee must buy the shares at the market value on the date of purchase. The purchase is subject to the repayment of any outstanding loan under the scheme for the shares: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 302 DC – Employee or contractor expenditure (c)if the period of restriction ends because the employee ends their employment for any other reason, the trustee must buy the shares at the market value at the date on which the employee ended their employment, subject to the repayment of any outstanding loan under the scheme for the shares. Purchase price when trustee buys shares (7)If the trustee buys the shares in any of the circumstances in which employment is ended as described in subsection (6), the purchase price must not be more than the price paid for the shares by the employee. Withdrawal from scheme (8)An employee must be able to withdraw from the scheme on giving 3 months’ notice to the trustee. The employee is then treated for the purposes of the scheme as if they ended their employment with the company on the date the notice takes effect, and subsections (6)(c) and (7) apply. Hardship (9)With the employee’s agreement, a trustee may vary the terms of the repayment of a loan under the scheme, or may allow the employee to withdraw from the scheme as if they had ended their employment in the circumstances described in subsection (5), if the trustee is satisfied that the employee’s continued participation in the scheme would result in serious hardship.

Defined terms:amount, deduction, employee, employer, general limitation, general permission, superannuation scheme. Comment:Current section DF 1 ousts the general deductibility rule and, as a result, current section DF 2 is needed to permit the deduction specifically. Once the initial ouster is dispensed with for amounts that an employer pays to a fund, all that is required is a limitation preventing deduction if the employee’s rights are not secured. In contrast, however, a specific deduction provision is required for amounts that an employer sets aside as a fund because there is no expenditure (no amount passes from the employer to another person) and the general rules do not allow a deduction. In this case, a rule is required that the deduction is allowed provided the rights are secured.

DE 7 Logbook term When logbook term applies (1)A logbook term is a period to which the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle established by the logbook applies. The term lasts up to 3 years and starts and ends as described in subsections (2) and (3). Start of term (2)A logbook term starts on the date that is the latest of the following days: (a)the first day of the income year in which a person starts to keep a logbook: (b)the day that a person buys or acquires the motor vehicle (unless the vehicle is a replacement vehicle (see section DE 10)): (c)the day immediately after the last day of the previous logbook term: (d)a day that a person specifies. End of term (3)The logbook term ends on the date that is the earliest of the following days: (a)the day that a person disposes of the motor vehicle without replacing it: (b)the day that is 3 years after the first day of the income year in which the logbook term started: (c)a day that the Commissioner specifies under section DE 8: (d)a day that a person specifies.

DE 8 Inadequate logbook Non-representative logbook proportion (1)If the Commissioner considers that the proportion of business use recorded in a logbook does not, or does no longer, represent the average use of a motor vehicle for business purposes during an income year that falls within a logbook term, the Commissioner may,— (a) within the logbook term, direct a person to keep a further logbook and specify the period for keeping the logbook; or (b)if satisfied that the logbook is not representative, treat a person as not having kept a logbook that applies to the logbook term. Further logbook (2)If the Commissioner directs a person to keep a further logbook, and the proportion of business use calculated under that logbook is less by 20% (or more) than the proportion under the first logbook, the Commissioner may find that the first logbook either— (a)represented the average use of the motor vehicle for business purposes for only part of the logbook term; or (b)did not represent that use at all. First case: partly representative logbook (3)If subsection (2)(a) applies, the Commissioner may determine a date on which the application of the first logbook ended, and the further logbook applies to a new logbook term that starts on the day after that date. Second case: non-representative logbook (4)If subsection (2)(b) applies, the Commissioner may direct that the further logbook should apply for the logbook term to which the first logbook originally applied.

Origin:DH 3(4). Defined terms:business purposes, business use, motor vehicle. DE 10 Replacement vehicles For the purpose of establishing the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, a replacement vehicle is treated in the same way as the vehicle it replaced if— (a)the logbook is likely to be representative of the average travel for business purposes and other purposes for the remainder of the logbook term; and (b)from the date of replacement, a person keeps a record of the total distance travelled by the replacement vehicle for each income year (or part of an income year) of the remaining logbook term.

Mileage rates DE 11 Mileage rate method Using mileage rates (1) If a person’s business travel is not more than 5,000 kilometres in an income year, they may use the mileage rate method to calculate the expenditure or loss on a motor vehicle that represents the proportion of business use of the motor vehicle. Calculating the mileage (2)Under the mileage rate method, the person must keep details of the business use of the motor vehicle, and calculate the mileage travelled for business purposes for the income year. The amount of the deduction under this method is found by multiplying the mileage rate by the distance that reflects the proportion of business use to total use of the vehicle for the income year.

No deduction (2)A person who uses a limited recourse loan in acquiring, producing, or marketing a film or a right in a film is not allowed a deduction under any section of this Act for revenue film expenditure or capital film expenditure under sections DS 6 to DS 9. Origin:(1) new. (2) new. Defined terms:capital film expenditure, deduction, feature film, film, film production expenditure, film reimbursement scheme, incurred, limited recourse loan, New Zealand, person, revenue film expenditure, right in a film. Comment:Current section GD 12 appears in a rewritten form in the consequential amendments in volume 3 together with draft section GC 11A (Non-market transactions to acquire rights in films), draft section GC 11B (Manipulation of arrangements to acquire rights in films), draft section GD 12A (Film production expenditure if payments postponed or contingent), and draft section GD 12B (Manipulation of arrangements to incur film production expenditure). DS 2 Acquiring rights in films Expenditure incurred in acquiring film right (1)A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur in acquiring a right in a film, if the film is completed (whether it is completed before, when, or after the film right is acquired). This section is overridden by sections DS 3 to DS 9. Allocation of deduction (2)The deduction is allocated under section EK 4 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring rights in feature films) or section EK 5 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring rights in films other than feature films). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 353 Certain expenditure excluded (3)This section does not apply to expenditure that a person incurs in acquiring a right in a film if— (a) the person operates a television station, a network, or a cable television system, and the film right is mainly acquired to enable the film to be broadcast in New Zealand; or (b) the film is intended to be shown as an advertisement; or (c)the expenditure is film production expenditure. No other deductions (4)A person is not allowed a deduction if the film is not completed. Link with subpart DA (5)Subsection (1) overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. For subsection (1) amounts, subsection (4) overrides the general permission. Origin:(1) EO 3(1), (4), (5), (7). (2) new. (3) EO 3(1), (2), (9). (4) EO 3(1), (3). (5) new. Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, completed, deduction, film, film production expenditure, film right, general limitation, general permission, incurred, New Zealand, person, right in a film. Comment:The main change in this rewritten provision, compared with current section EO 3, is the removal of the cost of production element. This allows for the drafting of the provision to be significantly simplified. For example, the depreciation recovery provision in current section EO 3 (8), which relates only to film production, does not need to be retained in draft section DS 5, which now deals exclusively with the acquisition of film rights. DS 3 Film production expenditure Film production expenditure (1)A person is allowed a deduction for film production expenditure that they incur if the film is completed and the person has a right in the film on or before the film is completed. This section is overridden by sections DS 4 to DS 9. Reimbursed expenditure (2)If, before the film is completed, a person (person A) reimburses another person (person B) for film production expenditure that person B incurs, the reimbursement is treated as film production expenditure incurred by person A for the purposes of subsection (1). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 354 DS – Film industry expenditure Allocation of deduction (3)The deduction is allocated under section EK 6 (Film production expenditure for New Zealand films) or section EK 8 (Film production expenditure for films other than New Zealand films).

Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, completed, deduction, film, film production expenditure, general limitation, general permission, incurred, New Zealand, person, right in a film. Comment:The depreciation recovery provision in current section EO 4 (8) has been omitted, with reliance being placed instead on the general depreciation recovery provisions in subpart EF (Depreciation). This is preferable to the stand-alone approach in current section EO 4 (8). Also, current section EO 4 (8) is not consistent with self-assessment. DS 4 Clawback of deductions for film reimbursement schemes General rule (1)A person who disposes of property under a film reimbursement scheme must reduce the total deductions that they are or have been allowed under section DS 2 or section DS 3, or would have been allowed if this section did not exist, using the formula in section DS 5. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 355 When rule does not apply (2)Subsection (1) does not apply to a deduction for expenditure excluded under section DZ 3 (Film reimbursement scheme: when clawback rule does not apply).

Defined terms:Commissioner, deduction, film reimbursement scheme, person, time bar. Comment:The incorporation of paragraph (b) of the current definition of ‘right’ in section OB 1 into the film expenditure provisions in draft section DS 5 and draft section DZ 3 (Film reimbursement scheme: when clawback rule does not apply) allows the drafting of this provision to be simplified—for example, there is no need for a provision equivalent to current section EO 4A (2)(a)(ii). The definition of ‘film reimbursement scheme’ now appears in section OB 1 (see the amendments to section OB 1 (Definitions) in volume 3). DS 5 Calculation of clawback amounts on film reimbursement schemes Formula (1)When section DS 4 (1) applies, the total deductions must be reduced to the amount calculated using the formula— total deductions – total consideration. Definition of items in formula (2)In the formula,— (a) total deductions is the total amount of deductions that the person is or has been allowed under section DS 2 or section DS 3 or would have been allowed if section DS 4 did not exist: (b) total consideration is the total amount of consideration for the disposal of the property that the person derives and that is not film income. Order of reduced deductions for previous income years (3)In subsection (1), deductions must be reduced in the same order as they would have been allowed. Origin:(1) EO 4A(3), (4). (2) EO 4A(3). (3) EO 4A(5). Defined terms:amount, deduction, derived, film income, film reimbursement scheme, income year, person. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 356 DS – Film industry expenditure Comment:The calculation of the clawback amount has been simplified. It applies to the total amount of the deductions allowed at any time. DS 6 Deductions for film expenditure if amount not at risk Amount of deduction (1)A person who uses a limited recourse loan in acquiring, producing, or marketing a film or a right in a film must subtract, under section DS 7, the amount of the loan from the deductions for revenue film expenditure and for capital film expenditure that the person would be allowed under this Act if this section did not exist. Amount of deduction on repayment of loan (2)The person is allowed, under section DS 8, a deduction that is equal to the amount of any repayment by them of part or all of the limited recourse loan, but not more than the total amount subtracted under subsection (1). Link with subpart DA (3)Subsection (1) overrides the general permission Subsection (2) supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply to subsection (2) amounts. Origin:(1) DK 1(2), (3). (2) DK 1(5). (3) new. Defined terms:amount, capital film expenditure, capital limitation, deduction, film, general limitation, general permission, limited recourse loan, person, revenue film expenditure, right in a film. Comment:This section now explicitly applies to revenue-type losses (that is, losses covered by current section BD 2 (1)(b)). This would seem to be sensible given that section DS 3 also includes such losses and that section DS 3 is subject to section DS 6. It may be argued that the limited recourse loan provisions constitute a timing rule rather than a deductions rule. However, our view is that, because these provisions artificially subtract and allow deductions (rather than simply defer deductions for actual expenditure), their primary function is to limit deductions (unless the limited recourse loan is repaid) and the allocation function is secondary. DS 7 Method of subtracting loan amounts from deductions Order in which loan amounts subtracted from deductions (1)When section DS 6 (1) applies, the amount of the loan made in an income year must be subtracted from the deductions that the person would otherwise be allowed for expenditure of the following type and in the following order: (a)from deductions for revenue film expenditure that the person incurred in a previous income year and did not pay on or before Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 357 the start of the income year, if the loan was borrowed to pay for the expenditure: (b)from the deductions for capital film expenditure that the person incurred in a previous income year and did not pay on or before the start of the income year, if the loan was borrowed to pay for the expenditure: (c)from deductions for revenue film expenditure that the person incurred in the income year: (d)from deductions for capital film expenditure that the person incurred in the income year. Cumulative subtractions (2)The application of section DS 6 (1) is cumulative, so that— (a)the loan amount must be subtracted in each case from the total amount of the deductions that the person would otherwise have been allowed for each type of expenditure reduced by any previous subtractions under that section; and (b)the order in subsection (1) applies accordingly. Origin:(1) DK 1(4). (2) DK 1(4). Defined terms:amount, capital film expenditure, deduction, income year, incurred, person, revenue film expenditure. DS 8 Deductions for repayments Order of deductions for repayment (1)When section DS 6 (2) applies, the deduction that the person is allowed in relation to the repayment must be for expenditure of the same type and deductions must be in the same order as that for which the person was not allowed a deduction under section DS 6 (1) in any previous income year. Cumulative application (2)The application of section DS 6 (2) is cumulative, so that— (a)the amount of the deduction that the person may be allowed under that subsection for each type of expenditure is the total amount that the person was not allowed for that type under section DS 6 (1) in any previous income year, reduced by any amounts that the person was allowed as deductions under section DS 6 (2) in any previous income year; and (b)the order in subsection (1) applies accordingly. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 358 DS – Film industry expenditure Repayment of a loan with another limited recourse loan (3)A loan is treated as not having been repaid for the purposes of section DS 6 (2) to the extent to which a limited recourse loan is used directly or indirectly to repay the loan.
