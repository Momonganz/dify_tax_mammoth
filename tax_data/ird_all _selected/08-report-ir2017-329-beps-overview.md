### Base erosion and profit shifting – overview of current reports

* * *

1\. This report accompanies three papers providing further updates on the development of policy proposals introduced in three Government discussion documents on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS):

*   _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ (released in September 2016);
*   _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_ (released in March 2017); and
*   _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (released in March 2017).

2\. We reported to you on 9 March 2017 with a summary of submissions received on the discussion document _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ (T2017/460, IR2017/133 refers). We also reported to you last week with a summary of submissions on the two March 2017 discussion documents (T2017/1630, IR2017/361 refers).

3\. This package of reports seeks policy decisions on a range of proposals relating to all three discussion documents, including a number of suggested refinements to address issues raised by submitters. The attached reports are:

*   BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1576, IR2017/325);
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1577, IR2017/330); and
*   BEPS – recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements (T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

4\. These reports also seek your approval for officials to prepare a set of four papers seeking Cabinet’s agreement to policy decisions and to include the BEPS proposals in a tax bill later this year. Subject to your decisions and assuming you are comfortable with all the proposals, we anticipate the following timeline:

| Date | Milestone/action |
| --- | --- |
| Thursday 29 June | Joint Ministers’ meeting to discuss these reports and policy recommendations |
| Week commencing 10 July | Provide the following Cabinet papers and RISs to Ministers:<br><br>*   Cover paper with overview of BEPS package<br>*   Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance<br>*   Interest limitation<br>*   Hybrid mismatches |
| Thursday 20 July | Deadline for lodging Cabinet Papers in CabNet |
| Wednesday 26 July | EGI |
| Monday 31 July | Cabinet |

#### Further consultation

5\. We recommend that, following Cabinet decisions in July, further consultation is undertaken on outstanding policy issues and technical design details relating to the BEPS package. We will report back to you on that consultation and any further feedback we receive on the proposals.

6\. A number of submitters have also expressed interest in consultation on an exposure draft of the planned BEPS bill. We have signalled to submitters that an exposure draft could be provided on specific aspects of the proposals that are likely to be of most interest – for example, the permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule proposed in the discussion document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_.

7\. To stay on track with the planned commencement date of income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, the BEPS bill will need to be introduced and have its first reading by 14 December 2017. Due to this timing constraint, we are not proposing that submitters be consulted on an exposure draft of the entire bill. However, targeted drafting of specific sections where consultation will provide the most value is possible within this timeframe.

8\. In the attached reports on interest limitation, and transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance, we have focused on the major issues relevant to the policy decisions to be made by Cabinet in July. We have not addressed all submissions on the March 2017 discussion documents that relate to technical or operational detail. We will advise you on such submissions following detailed design and further consultation with submitters. The hybrids report seeks more detailed final policy decisions because it has already been subject to a second round of consultation.

#### Fiscal implications

9\. Some of the revenue for these proposals has already been included in Budget 2017 forecasts:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$ million – increase / (decrease)
| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 and out years |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |
| Other BEPS measures | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |
| **Total revenue effect** | 0   | 0   | 50  | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

10\. If our recommendations in these four reports are agreed to and adopted by the Government, then the forecasts could be adjusted further by these amounts:

| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 and out years |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$ million – increase / (decrease)
| BEPS measures – transfer pricing, permanent establishments, and interest limitation | 0   | 0   | 45  | 90  | 90  | 90  | 90  |
| BEPS measures – hybrid instruments | 0   | 0   | 19  | 19  | 19  | 14  | 0   |
| **Total additional revenue effect** | 0   | 0   | 64  | 109 | 109 | 104 | 90  |

11\. The additional revenue from certain hybrid instruments is a result of agreeing to the OECD hybrids recommendation 1 proposal with the grandparenting approach for these instruments recommended in the attached paper on hybrids. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.

12\. The total would come to the maximum revenue forecast for new BEPS measures that we have previously advised ($190 million per year for out years) and exceed this revenue forecast for the first four years in which the BEPS measures will apply. We are recommending in the report BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1576, IR2017/325 refers) that we continue to consult on details of the thin capitalisation proposal. Depending on the outcome of this consultation, the revenue forecast could be $10 million per year lower.

#### Economic implications

13\. It is inevitable that the higher tax payments resulting from these measures will make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. At the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, random reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. Given this, we believe implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests.

#### Administrative implications

14\. The changes proposed in the BEPS discussion documents and recommended in these reports are not expected to increase administrative costs or require any significant systems changes for Inland Revenue. This is because the reforms change the way some taxpayers self-assess their tax liabilities that they report to Inland Revenue.

15\. We note, however, that a common theme in submissions on all three discussion documents was that administration of the proposals would place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s audit and investigation functions. Our view is that any required increase in Inland Revenue’s resourcing as a result of the BEPS package will be accommodated within existing baselines. We will report back if these administrative implications are expected to change.

#### Application date

16\. Cabinet has noted that the reforms are expected to commence from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on an expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

17\. At the time the March 2017 discussion documents were released, this application date was not publicly known. However, many submitters anticipated the Government would seek an early application date and argued in their submissions that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these proposals to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We expect to receive more feedback on the planned application date and other transitional issues in the next round of consultation.

#### Proactive release

18\. We recommend that the Government consider proactively releasing submissions on the BEPS discussions documents and the MLI officials’ issues paper, the BEPS Cabinet papers, and policy reports (including the pre-Budget 2017 Cabinet paper and policy report (T2017/949, IR2017/237)). This could be done at the time of announcements Ministers may want to make in relation to the package.
