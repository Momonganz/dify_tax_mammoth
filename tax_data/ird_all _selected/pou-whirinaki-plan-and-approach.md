The approach to BT S4.1.2 Early Life Support (ELS) is based on a similar approach to R4 Pou Whirinaki has been adapted to thechange context and scaled appropriately for the level of change and impact: •The approach to S4.1.2 Pou Whirinaki will aim to build enduring IR capability, ie where possible we are looking to support, coach and QA permanent IR staff who will shadow us (or visa versa) while we ensure the outcomes are met. •FAST willpr oject manage readiness before go live, initial planning meetings will run to address the plan and approach to help mitigate resourcing risks as we transition to the new IR structure.Once initial planning is complete and agreed by EPPC a fortnightly status meeting for final readiness activities will be runas we approach go live. Nominated resources for each support area will lead and own their readiness work. Where possible we will be including BAU teams to lead or shadow roles. •As agreed at EPPC there will be a Pou Whirinaki Sub-E LT in place for this release to allow quick escalation of issues during hypercare. •EPPC and the Sub-ELT will approve the exit of HyperCare and the exit of Early Life Support as per the agreed exit criteria on the following slides. Pou Whirinaki/Early Life Support Approach 1.Implement one extended ELS team that is both internally and externally focused supported by an integrated process and outputs. Clear roles and responsibilities to be agreed. The ELS Central team that is already in place will be responsible for coordination and management of the framework and process including the extended ELS process. 2. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and the Enterprise Priorities Performance Committee (EPPC) will support the extended ELS team. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Working together across IR we provide assurance that we are actively identifying and mitigating risks, monitoring our progress, effective resolution of issues and ensuring a co-ordinated approach during this time. •Customers–Our customers know what they have to do and they can do it. •People –Our people tell us they are being supported, are confident they can raise issues and are able to support eachother and our customers. •Stakeholders- Our key stakeholders tell us they are well informed, their customers are supported and where necessary, they are comfortable acting on our behalf. •Operations– Our work programme delivers key business events and manages customer demand. •Technology– Our systems are actively monitored and any issues are resolved quickly. •Hypercare/Solution Stabilisation –Issues are resolved through business-led prioritisation. Pou Whirinaki Success \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 •ELT have agreed that the impact for S4.1.2 alongside key business events and possible new Covid initiatives requires a similar integrated support approach to that used for R3 and R4 Pou Whirinaki. •This approach brings together monitoring, support and response for our customers, staff, systems and eventsthrough go live and peak cycle business events from October 2021 to January 2022. •Pou Whirinaki S4.1.2 will operate using the following principles also used previously: –Current accountabilities are maintained – use existing teams, people and services, and leverageour ELS processes where these are available and fit for purpose –Coordinated– t o augment existing or add new capabilities using the disciplines of Change Management Team to support S4 –Single source of truth– coordinating all statuses and communications, prioritisation decisions and administration of change control –Transparent & proactive – to build confidence and trust with our customers, stakeholders and our people –Outcomes focused –to set an example for our people in collaborative and adaptive ways of working, consistent with our new organisation. •Pou Whirinaki S4.1.2 will use the learnings from previous releases to run the support teams and meetings online taking advanta geof the efficiencies we found doing this regardless of whether we are in the office or working remotely. Context and Principles \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 •Provision of a central management and coordination function, a HyperCare period and increased support period focusing on: –Prioritisation in coordination with the business –Triage and assignment of issues –Management of business and technical issues with resolver groups –Business Operations support –Customer support –IR People support –Management of Major and Sensitive Issues –Working closely with the Major Incident team –Provision of communications and reporting to key stakeholders –Prod QA of new products and updated products •Pou Whirinaki will also provide planning to increase monitoring and support around Key Business Events •Pou Whirinaki support approach will operate on the basis that all staff are working online.
