Details about investment income will need to be provided more often and electronically, including any joint account holder information. 2. You need to report only for the months in which you make a payment and withhold tax. 3. The existing non-declaration rate for not providing an IRD number of 33% increases to 45% for RWT on interest. 4. Some administrative changes have also been made:  removing the requirement to provide some end of year withholding tax certificates  introducing an RWT exemption register  improved error correction processes. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/investment-income-reporting RWT - what it is RWT is a tax deducted from some kinds of investment income before the investor receives it. Why we have it Deducting RWT means that people who receive investment income do not have to pay all the tax in a lump sum at the end of the year. Also, people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. 5 Income that must have RWT deducted Any income that fits the definition of resident passive income must have RWT deducted from it. Resident passive income is defined as an amount paid to a resident of New Zealand that consists of: interest, dividends a taxable Māori authority distribution that is not a retirement scheme contribution a replacement payment paid to a person under a share-lending arrangement. This guide does not cover RWT on dividends. Read our guide Resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends - IR284 for information on this. Resident passive income includes all types of interest except interest that is: paid on a debt for goods or services purchased, such as trade credit on hire purchases paid to a transitional resident paid to a tax pooling intermediary under a specified lease or finance lease paid on Bonus Bonds interest or a redemption payment on money lent by a non-resident to the New Zealand Government or a New Zealand public authority interest that is exempt from income tax under any Act other than the Income Tax Act 2007. any amount expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act, to the extent of the exemption so provided paid on an overpaid levy under section 173 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 paid to someone who has been granted exemption from RWT paid between two companies within the same group of companies paid to a non-resident (anyone who has been out of New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period and has had no enduring relationship with New Zealand in that time) derived from outside New Zealand by a non-resident payable by a taxpayer on any unpaid tax payable by us under section 84 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 6 Registering as an RWT payer You must register with us as an RWT payer if you pay out more than $5,000 a year in interest, and: you pay the interest as part of a taxable activity (such as a trade, profession or business, or an activity carried out by a not-for-profit body or local authority), or we’ve granted you RWT exempt status, or you’re a non-resident but are carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. If you’re not already registered as an RWT payer, you must contact us and register as soon as your interest paid out for the year exceeds $5,000. You will not have to account for RWT on the interest you paid out before you reached the $5,000 threshold. Banks, building societies and trustee companies that have been granted RWT exempt status must register as RWT payers, regardless of how much resident passive income they pay in a year. Also, any taxpayer who has been granted RWT exempt status and whose income is, or estimated to be, more than $2 million for any year must register as a payer if they pay out any resident passive income. Note If you’re not required to register and you pay interest, you may still have disclosure obligations in your income tax return. Register as an RWT payer online through myIR or, fill in a Resident withholding tax - interest payer registration - IR450 form and send it to us. Record keeping With any RWT deductions you make, you must keep records for the: total interest you pay total amount of RWT and date it was deducted full name and last known address of the recipient recipient’s IRD number. 7 If you pay interest to someone who has been granted RWT exempt status and their IRD number is listed on the RWT exemption register you must also record: the full name and address of the person or organisation you pay interest to the total interest you pay the date RWT would have been deducted their IRD number. You must also keep details of all other financial arrangements that you’ve paid interest on at any time during the year. You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 8 Part 2 – Filing and payments Note Investment income information must be provided to us electronically. Deducting RWT One of the first things you need to do once you’ve registered as an RWT payer, is to ask all the people you pay interest to for their IRD numbers and contact details. You must deduct RWT from all the interest you pay that is not exempt. Taxpayers who earn interest can elect their own RWT rate by completing a Choose your RWT deduction rate - IR456 form. Individuals Individuals can choose a rate of 10.5%, 17.5%, 30% or 33%. Electing the correct rate for the total income earned for the tax year ensures that the correct amount of tax is deducted from the interest. If the rate selected is too low, the individual may have a tax bill to pay at the end of the income year. If an individual does not elect an RWT rate, but they’ve given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 17.5% for existing accounts, or 33% for new accounts. If an individual has not provided you with their IRD number, RWT must be deducted at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Companies Companies must notify their interest payers that they are a company. A company can elect either the 28% or 33% RWT rate. If a company does not choose an RWT rate, but they have notified you that they’re a company and given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 28%. If a company has not supplied their IRD number, deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45%. Note Companies that are trustees are not required to notify the interest payer of their company status and may use the 17.5%, 30% or 33% rate. If the trust is a testamentary trust, it may also elect the 10.5% rate if appropriate. Companies that are Māori authorities are not required to notify their company status and may choose 17.5%, 30% or 33%. This reflects the obligation on trustees to act according to the tax position of the trust’s beneficiaries. 9 All others All other taxpayers can elect a rate of 17.5%, 30% or 33%. If they do not make a choice, but they have given you a valid IRD number, deduct RWT at 17.5% for existing accounts, or 33% for new accounts. From 1 April 2020 the non-declaration rate increases to 45%. Non-declaration rate You must deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate of 45% for anyone who has not given you a valid IRD number. If you deduct RWT at the non-declaration rate because a recipient has not given you an IRD number, but they do later, you cannot refund the extra RWT deducted. This is because at the time you made the deduction, the non-declaration rate was correct. The recipient can only recover the extra tax deducted at the end of the year in their income tax assessment. Interest recipients electing inconsistent RWT rates It’s important that individuals and organisations you pay interest to, elect an RWT rate that is consistent with their taxable income. Using the correct RWT rate can help them avoid a tax bill at the end of the year. We regularly check RWT rates against the income details we hold to make sure a consistent RWT rate is being used. If someone is using an inconsistent RWT rate, we’ll advise you to change it and let you know which rate they should be on. You’ll need to change their RWT rate to the new rate as soon as possible. We’ll also let them know that the rate they elected is inconsistent with their estimated income and that we’ve asked you, as their interest payer, to change it. We’ll also ask them to check their RWT rate on our website. If they disagree with the RWT rate we’ve chosen, they can request that their interest payer change it. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 10 RWT rates Rate for deducting RWT Who should use this rate 10.5% Individuals who have a reasonable expectation of their annual income being $14,000 or less\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Testamentary trusts may elect this rate if they provide their IRD number. 17.5% Individuals whose annual income is from $14,001 to $48,000\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Individuals, Māori authorities and trusts who have not elected a rate but have provided their IRD number (if they have not opened a new account since 31 March 2010).  Trusts and testamentary trusts may elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 28% Companies may elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 30% Individuals whose annual income is from $48,001 to $70,000\* if they’ve provided their IRD number.  Trusts and Māori authorities can elect this rate if they’ve provided their IRD number. 33% All interest recipients can elect this rate. They must provide their IRD number to choose this rate.  Individuals whose annual income is $70,001 or over\*.  Use this rate for all interest recipients who open a new account after 31 March 2010 who do not elect a rate. 45% For all interest recipients who have not provided their IRD number. \* You’re not required to confirm an individual’s income level; you can accept the rate they provide. If you’re a Māori authority, you can use an RWT rate of 17.5% to deduct RWT from distributions of $200 or less. You can also use this rate for distributions of over $200 where the member has provided their IRD number, otherwise use 33%. When to deduct RWT You must deduct RWT at the time you pay resident passive income to the recipient. For this purpose, “pay” means to: distribute to credit to an account deal with in a person’s interest or on their behalf. If you make automatic interest payments, you must deduct RWT and credit only the net amount to the recipient’s account. 11 Monthly information From 1 April 2020 you must provide us with your investment income interest payment information electronically by the 20th of the following month the interest was paid. You will need to provide: your name, IRD number and contact address the total amount of interest paid and tax withheld for the period. This is not a cumulative total. For each person or entity you paid interest to: their name and contact details, such as email, street address and mobile phone number the amount and type of income paid to them the tax withheld from it the date the tax was withheld their IRD number their date of birth if you have it the tax rate used the name, IRD number, date of birth and contact details of any joint owners if you have them. To allow for transition into the new requirements, the tax years ending 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020, now have a due date for the IR15S and the IR15 of 15 May. From 1 April 2020: the information will need to be provided to us electronically (unless we exempt you from electronic filing) you’ll need to withhold tax at 45% for those who have not provided their IRD number you will no longer be required to file a nil return. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 12 RWT exempt status Do not deduct RWT from any interest you pay to taxpayers who have been granted RWT exempt status. This means they are exempt from having RWT deducted from their interest and dividend income. The following taxpayers can get an exemption by completing an Application for exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest and dividends - IR451: amateur sports promoters Board of Trustees charitable estates community housing providers registered with the Community Housing Regulatory Authority community trusts companies that are a member of the Public Trust group, the Public Trustee or the Maori Tr u s t e e finance houses or brokers friendly societies or credit unions funeral trusts gaming machine operators horse or greyhound racing clubs improvement or research promoters local or public authorities local or regional promotion bodies not-for-profit organisations portfolio investment entities (PIE) public purpose Crown-controlled companies registered banks or building societies statutory trustee companies tertiary education institutions. Taxpayers can also apply if they: have earned or think they’ll earn more than $2 million a year have losses, or a RWT refund, of $500 or more are exempt from paying tax under an Act other than the Tax Acts. Charitable organisations on the Charities Services register do not need to apply. They are given RWT exempt status and added automatically to the RWT exemption register. 13 Unincorporated bodies If an unincorporated body of persons, such as a partnership or a joint venture, has RWT exempt status, the exemption is granted in the name of the body and not in the name of the individual members. If the body is a trustee, the exemption is granted in the name of the trust. Checking the RWT exemption register The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Use this register to confirm who has an active RWT exempt status and to identify people and organisations who no longer have an exemption. Most exemptions from RWT are issued for an unlimited period and remain active on the register unless they’re cancelled. These active exemptions don’t show an end date. If the exemption is granted for a limited period, an end date (or expiry date) will also be shown. The register is updated overnight every business day (Monday to Friday) providing you with near real-time information. Make sure that the person you’re paying the resident passive income to is the person listed on the register. Note From 1 April 2020 the online RWT exemption register replaced physical certificates of exemption for RWT. We no longer issue certificates of exemption or publish a list of cancelled certificates in the New Zealand Gazette. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 14 Cancelling RWT exempt status If we cancel an exemption, you must deduct RWT from any further interest you pay to that person or organisation. We may cancel an exemption if the person or organisation: no longer meets the conditions for which it was issued has provided misleading information in the application for exemption doesn’t meet the $2 million target (where the exemption was granted on the basis of estimated income of more than $2 million) or fails to supply satisfactory evidence of annual income fails to pay any income tax payable by the due date. When we cancel a person’s or organisation’s RWT exempt status, we also update their status on the RWT exemption register. Once this cancellation appears on the register, you have five working days to amend your records and start deducting RWT where appropriate. Due dates for payment All withheld tax must be paid by the 20th of the month following the month in which the interest income was paid to the investor. However, if the amount of resident withholding tax is under $500 a month, you can pay RWT in 2 six-monthly instalments. Note If the due date falls on a weekend, or statutory or public holiday, the due date is the next working day. RWT of $500 or more per month If you deduct RWT of $500 or more each month, you must pay the deductions made in each month by the 20th of the following month. 15 Example – monthly payer Each month, the ABC Building Society deducts RWT of more than $500 when it credits interest to its customers’ accounts. It must pay the RWT deductions to us as follows: Month RWT deductedTotal RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment June 2019$2,500$2,50020 July 2019 July 2019$2,500$2,50020 August 2019 RWT of less than $500 per month If you deduct RWT of less than $500 each month, you may pay on a six-monthly basis. 1 April to 30 September - due for payment on 20 October 1 October to 31 March - due for payment on 20 April. However, if the RWT deductions you’ve made accumulate to $500 during a six-month period, you must send them in by the 20th of the month after the month they reach $500. Note Once you’ve paid the RWT deductions to us, the $500 accumulation threshold recommences. Example – six-monthly payer Matt Weaver’s Carpet Company deducts less than $500 each month, so they must pay the deductions to us by the two regular six-monthly payment dates. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment December 2019$200Nil– January 2020NilNil– February 2020$200Nil– March 2020Nil$400 20 April 2020 (regular six-monthly payment date) RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 16 Example – deductions over $500 accumulated Collcar Investments Ltd deducts RWT of varying amounts. Some months the RWT deducted is more than $500, other months it is less. They must pay the RWT to us on the 20th of the month that follows the month when their accumulated deductions exceed $500, and on the regular six-monthly payment dates. Month RWT deducted Total RWT deductedTotal paid to usDue date for payment January 2020$300Nil– February 2020$300$600 20 March 2020 (more than $500 accumulated) March 2020$200$200 20 April 2020 (regular six-monthly payment date) April 2020$200Nil– May 2020$550$750 20 June 2020 (more than $500 accumulated) No RWT to pay If you have no RWT to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: internet banking credit or debit card direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: your IRD number the account type you are paying the period the payment relates to. 17 If you make a mistake when deducting RWT From 1 April 2020 you can correct errors occurring within a tax year, regardless of their size. There is no need to let us know about these errors. Correcting errors from earlier years Errors relating to earlier years can be corrected if the total value of the adjustment does not exceed the larger of: $2,000, or 5% of the payer’s withholding liability for the tax type that the error relates to (for example RWT or NRWT) for the year in which the first payment is made. How they are corrected depends on whether they result in too much or too little tax being deducted, and the type of income. These processes only apply to errors made by payers of investment income. If you discover you have not deducted enough RWT, you can: 1. Deduct it from later payments made to the person 2. Ask the person to pay the amount that was not deducted 3. Adjust the amount of taxable income (only for non-cash dividends). Whichever option is chosen, the correction must be made before the next due date for reporting investment income to us (provided it’s reasonably practicable to do so). You’ll need to let us know: your name, IRD number and contact address the name and contact address (email, street address or mobile phone number) of the person who received the income the IRD number and date of birth of the person who received the income (if you have it) the adjustments made to the investment income information originally provided. Example - option 1 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from future payments Shane makes monthly interest payments to Sarah of $100. Sarah has an RWT rate of 33%. Shane mistakenly pays $89.50 to Sarah, having only deducted 10.5%. The amount of the under-deduction is $22.50 (i.e. $33 − $10.50). Realising his mistake, he corrects it by withholding an additional amount from the next payment made to Sarah. Shane withholds $55.50 from the next interest payment to Sarah, being $33 + $22.50. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 18 Example – option 2 - too little tax being deducted and recovered from investor Company A Ltd pays a dividend of $1,000 to Kelvin in June 2020. The dividend includes $280 of imputation credits attached and needs to have RWT deducted of $50. The company’s accountant accidently deducts RWT of only $5 and pays Kelvin a net amount of $715 - $45 more than he should have received. The company’s accountant contacts Kelvin in July 2020 to inform him of the error. Company A Ltd then pays the extra $45 to Inland Revenue and must recover the additional amount from Kelvin before March 2021. Example – option 3 - too little tax being deducted and taxable non-cash dividend adjusted Company B Ltd provides $100 worth of shares in another company (Company C Ltd) to one of its resident shareholders. It does not realise that the amount provided is a non-cash dividend until the company’s accountant informs them at the end of the tax year when they’re preparing the company’s accounts. Company B Ltd can submit investment income information on the non-cash dividend by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year. The company will show the amount of the non-cash dividend being $149.50, with RWT of $49.50 payable to Inland Revenue. Because this adjustment occurs outside the tax year that the non-cash dividend relates to, Company B Ltd will also have to provide Inland Revenue with information so it can allocate the non-cash dividend and tax credits to the correct tax year for the company’s shareholder. Deducting too much tax If you discover you have withheld too much RWT, you can refund it any time before the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, provided you have not provided the person who received the income with: an end-of-year withholding tax certificate for RWT, or a shareholder dividend statement, or a statement to a member who received a taxable Māori authority distribution. You must let us know the amount of the refund at the time you pay it so that we don’t also provide a refund. If you do not refund the amount by the 20th of April following the end of the tax year in which the error occurred, you must tell us and the recipient how much needs to be refunded. If the over-deduction has already been paid to us, we will: pay the refund to the payer if future payments to the person have been adjusted pay the refund to the person who received the income if future payments haven’t been adjusted. 19 Penalties and interest Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We’ll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Amounts of $100 or less Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Penalty for not filing electronically There is a penalty of $250 for each time investment income information is not supplied to us electronically and you do not have an exemption. If you are unable to supply your investment income information electronically, you can apply for an exemption. In considering your request we will assess: your capabilities the digital services available to you the compliance costs to you. Relief from late payment If late payment of RWT is due to circumstances beyond your control, we have the discretion to remit late payment penalties. To have your case considered, write to us explaining the reasons for the late payment. Remission or cancellation of use of money interest Interest will be remitted, or legally forgiven, only in exceptional circumstances and at our discretion. Remission occurs when interest is correctly imposed but a decision is made to relieve you of the liability to pay. For example, if we have given you incorrect advice, causing a return or payment to be late. You must be able to provide evidence to support the fact that incorrect advice was given. Failing to account for RWT deductions RWT that you have deducted is money held in trust for the Crown and there are penalties if you use it for any purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue. RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 20 Failing to deduct RWT If the RWT rules require a deduction to be made, the payer and recipient cannot arrange between themselves not to deduct RWT. In addition, fines and penalties may be incurred by anyone who fails to account for RWT deductions by: making a false or misleading application for exemption falsely claiming to be the recipient named on the RWT exemption register holding exemption and failing to tell us when they no longer meet the conditions under which it was granted obtaining or attempting to obtain a credit for RWT deducted from someone else’s resident passive income. For more information If you would like more information about penalties and interest, see our booklet Penalties and interest - IR240. Ceasing to be a payer You’ll stop being an RWT payer if you cease to: carry on any taxable activity in New Zealand, for example, by disposing of it, closing it down or moving it overseas and don’t have exemption have a valid exemption and you’re not carrying on any taxable activity. In either of these situations you must: file your monthly income information by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer pay us any RWT you are holding, by the 20th of the month after the month in which you stopped being a payer 21 Part 3 – Special cases Joint accounts Note From 1 April 2020, you will need to provide the details of all joint account holders, so we can identify investments held in joint ownership. You will also need to provide us with information such as an account number and how many holders are on the account. Deduct RWT at the rate nominated by the account holders. Since 1 April 2018 you should be ensuring you get the IRD numbers for all people in a joint account. You do not need to split the interest between the holders as we will do this. For example, if we have information for three owners of a joint account, we will split the income and tax credits evenly among the owners – a third each. If a resident and a non-resident hold a joint account, deduct RWT from all interest paid on the account. The non-resident may claim a refund from Inland Revenue by completing either an Income tax return for non-resident individual taxpayers - IR3NR or an IR386 form. If a person has a valid exemption and has a joint account with someone who does not, deduct RWT from all interest you pay on the account. You only pay interest without deducting RWT if all account holders are exempt. Non-residents Interest paid to non-residents is non-resident passive income, so it’s not subject to RWT. Instead, you must deduct NRWT. If you’re not familiar with NRWT, read our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. The NRWT rates vary from country to country depending on where the person is resident. For lists these countries and the rate of NRWT to deduct, go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt RWT ON INTEREST – PAYER’S GUIDE 22 Foreign currency If paying interest in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, deduct RWT in the same currency. The tax deduction certificate must show both the income and deduction in New Zealand dollars. If you have deducted RWT in a foreign currency, you must still pay it to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. Convert these deductions at the close of trading spot rate on the first working day of the month after the month in which you made the deductions. Most trading banks and financial institutions provide these on their website. Agents or trustees If you receive resident passive income as an agent or trustee for another person, you only have to deduct RWT from the payment if the payer should have deducted it and either failed to, or did not deduct the full amount. This liability to deduct includes situations where the payer did not have to deduct RWT because of specific provisions. If a person who has a exemption from RWT receives interest as trustee of a trust that is not a bare trust, they do not have to deduct RWT before passing it on to the trust. (A bare trust is a trust where the trustee’s only duty is to convey the property of the trust to the beneficiary.) An agent or trustee who carries on a taxable activity through a fixed establishment in New Zealand (whether resident or non-resident) must deduct RWT from interest payments made on behalf of another person. Custodians withholding and investment information reporting requirements Generally, custodians that are exempt from RWT and receive investment income on behalf of their clients are required to withhold tax and pay this to the Commissioner along with providing investor investment income information for on-payments or transfers of the income to their clients. Only where a third party agrees to take on and completes these requirements, or another custodian above you in the chain takes on these requirements will you be relieved from them. If sufficient tax has already been withheld and paid by the investment income payer, then a custodian or third party who has taken on the requirements need only provide the investor information. There are certain variations to the reporting requirements that can apply. Refer to the technical specifications for your channel of filing the information for the details. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No.4. 23 Disclosures in your income tax return Transactions in financial arrangements If you have a exemption from RWT and you acquire or dispose of a financial arrangement, or make a redemption payment under a financial arrangement, you might have to send some information with your income tax return for the year in which the transaction took place. However, you do not have to send the information if the other party to the transaction: is the issuer of the financial arrangement, or has exemption at the time of the transaction and the interest would have otherwise been subject to RWT. In all other cases, the information to send is: the other person’s full name and last known address the other person’s IRD number (they must give you this within 10 working days of your asking for it) the date of the transaction the total amount you paid or received in the transaction (excluding fees). You should also clearly show that you are providing this information as part of a financial arrangement.
