Variation to Determination EE002 - Payments to employees for working from home costs during the COVID-19 pandemic (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================================================================================

In order to provide certainty for employers and employees the Commissioner has issued Determination EE002A. This determination varies and extends [Determination EE002: Payments to employees for working from home cost during the COVID-19 pandemic](/determinations/miscellaneous/determination-ee002-payments-to-employees-for-working-from-home-costs-during-the-covid-19-pandemic)
, by removing all references to the need for the employee to be working from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and extending the payment period of a reimbursing payment through to 17 March 2021. Note that this determination applies only where an employer chooses to make a payment to an employee.
