Ko tēnei te Pūrongo ā-Tau 2021-22 a Te Tari Taake.

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue - our story
----------------------------------------

At Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue, we're passionate about Aotearoa New Zealand being a great place to live and work.  We're making it simpler for everyone to pay tax that pays for the things they value, like health care, education and protecting the environment.

For almost 150 years we've protected the integrity of the tax system, so New Zealanders can trust that everyone is contributing what they are meant to. We support people and businesses with initiatives such as tax credits for working families, child support payments, student loan repayments, and support for businesses impacted by COVID-19.

We are learning to weave te Tiriti o Waitangi principles and te ao Māori through everything we do. We recognise that New Zealand and its communities are diverse, so we are listening to these communities and working to provide a tax system that works for everyone.

We know most New Zealanders believe paying their tax is a good thing. They know we're here to help them. They also know that, when people choose not to meet their obligations, we'll take action.   

We think paying taxes and getting what you're entitled to shouldn't take a lot of work, which is why we've been changing every part of how we do things. We're using data and analysis in new ways to make it easier for people to get things right and harder to get them wrong.   

Businesses no longer have to fill out a lot of forms—we have software to do this for them. People don't need to work out if they are due a refund—this happens automatically. If people are paying or getting too little or too much, we can fix it before it becomes a problem.   

Now we've made things simpler, people don't need to get in touch as often. We're able to spend more time with the customers who need our help. 

Our people work in teams from different parts of the organisation, combining skills and knowledge to do a great job. Being agile, resilient and curious means we're able to help New Zealanders get things right, even when times are challenging.

Every day, we work with our colleagues across the Public Service, the tax community and organisations throughout New Zealand to continually improve the tax system for New Zealanders.

We're proud to work at Inland Revenue, knowing we help to make Aotearoa New Zealand a great place to live and work, now and in the future.
