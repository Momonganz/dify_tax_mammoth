document combines both the risk strategy, which describes Inland Revenue (IR)’s overall approach to managing risks, and the risk management plan which describes how risks and issues are managed within the B usiness Transformation Programme (BT). The purpose of this document is to support effective risk and issue management. This document supports the Programme Management Plan (PMP) that defines the baseline for the Programme. The Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework, which took effect from May 2014 (Policy scheduled for review in May 2021). 2 BT Risk Strategy 2.1 Introduction IR contributes to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand. Its role is to provide high- quality tax and social policy services to the Government and all New Zealanders. IR works with customers and other organisations to make compliance easy and to give New Zealanders confidence that everyone pays and receives the right amount. IR’s vision is to be a world-class revenue organisation, recognised for service and excellence. IR’s Business Transformation Programme aims to deliver this vision and will build the capabilities required to deliver the goals set out in IR for the Future. Risk is inherent in any programme. All projects have some degree of uncertainty due to the assumptions associated with them and the environment in which they are executed. The risk management approach recognises that change initiatives of any size, but particularly major transformation programmes are high-risk undertakings; and that a focused effort is required to ensure effective and successful delivery of the Programme and associated business benefits. It is recognised that Programme risks cannot be eliminated entirely, but many of them can be anticipated and reduced. The overall goal of undertaking risk management is to maximise the probability of achieving success within the baselined scope, schedule and resources. Likewise, risk management practices are designed to support decision-making within the Programme by providing integrated risk and consequence assessments throughout the Programme lifecycle. 2.2 Programme’s Risk Rating Risk Rating from Risk Profile Assessment (RPA) High Overall the Programme is considered to be inherently high risk. Accordingly, considerable emphasis has been placed on developing the capabilities required to manage and mitigate risks and issues. The Programme’s management of risk has been recognised as “an exemplar” in the last six Gateway reviews ( most recently in March 2020). The Programme’s current risks profile can be found here: Programme Risk Meeting Dashboard Page 7 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.3 Programme’s Risk Management Framework Risk management is the considered management response to possible future events. The risk management process is the systemic and structured practice to identify, assess and respond to risks. At a strategic level, the Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMF). To maintain this alignment, the Programme: • has adopted and applied the ERMF. This includes the Risk Management Process as described by ISO 31000:2009 (refer to Figure 1 below) and ISO Guide 73:2009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks • uses the CR&A Enterprise and Project Risk Rating Tools to assess risks and issues at Programme, Stage / Sub-Programme and workstream-levels (refer to Appendices A -E) • describes the risk and issue activities undertaken by the Programme in the Risk Management Plan. Figure 1 - The risk management process Page 8 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.4 Quality Management Quality is a key aspect to ensuring the artefacts produced by a Programme are of a high quality and meet the expectations of stakeholders. For Business Transformation, quality is managed on two different levels. Firstly, the Programme seeks Assurance for its stakeholders through conducting planned reviews, engaging independent quality assessments and meeting the Government Gateway requirements. Secondly, the Programme seeks internal quality control through ensuring the artefacts that are produced are of a high standard through the setting of guidelines, quality checklists and peer review. 2.4.1 Assurance Management Best practice according to Managing Successful Programmes requires that major programmes have a clear and coordinated approach towards assurance. This has been reinforced by key learning’s from major programmes of work across the public sector. The Quality Assurance Process will ensure: • There is an overall plan for implementing proactive assurance activities. • There is capacity for conducting planned and ad hoc reviews. • Ongoing Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and internal reviews are undertaken. • Ongoing reviews of our vendors and business partners. • Gateway reviews are undertaken of the Programme. • That progress is continuously monitored by Central Monitoring Agencies (Corporate Centre). Assurance will be coordinated as part of the BT Programme Management Office (BT PMO) function and will be incorporated into regular programme planning and reporting to the Programme Leadership Team (PLT), Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Risk and Assurance Committee, Joint Ministers, Central Agencies and other governance groups as required. An Assurance Management Plan is in place for the Programme and is reviewed regularly. 2.5 Vendor Management The Programme undertakes effective contract management through its monthly account review meetings and partner score carding to ensure the relationships with programme suppliers are handled professionally, that consultant performance meets programme expectations and that all services are provided within an effectual contractual framework and in line with Government policy. Account Review Meetings are held monthly to manage the Programme’s commercial arrangements and relationships with key service providers. These meetings cover engagement effectiveness, cost management, schedule attainment and delivery performance, scope and change management, team performance, risk and issues management, delivery assurance and administration and compliance. The meetings also review the status of commercial activities (acceptances, change requests and invoicing), budget forecasts and actuals and resource planning and changes. Page 9 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Transformation is accountable for the management of third- party suppliers through the Head of Commercial and Procurement. Vendors are required to comply with the processes and standards set out in this Risk Management Plan and the Programme Management Plan. Page 10 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 BT Risk Management Plan The purpose of this BT Risk Management Plan is to describe the specific management activities that will be undertaken to support the execution of the Programme’s Risk Strategy. Specifically, it sets out: • the approach to be used for identifying, reviewing and managing risks and issues at Programme, Release / Stage / Sub-Programme and workstream levels. • the roles and responsibilities for risk and issue management within the Programme • the reporting process. This risk and issue management process has been established to ensure that: • a robust risk and issue identification process is carried out as part of Programme planning, with an acceptable level of “due diligence” applied • pr ocesses are in place for risks and issues to be analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis • relevant risk and issue information is reported by all workstreams within the Programme, and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies • risks and issues are prioritised and reported at the correct level for decision-making in a timely manner • there is active debate and analysis of risk and issue information at Programme governance and executive management levels. 4 Defining Risks and Issues 4.1 Definition of a risk and an issue Risk: Something that may happen in the future which could impact on objectives if it occurred Issue: Something that has already happened and is impacting on objectives 4.1.1 Statement The risk and issue statement is a clear articulation of four key elements: Part of the definition Description There is a risk/issue .... The risk/issue description should be clear, succinct an d precise. The triggers are: • \[trigger 1\] • \[trigger 2\] ... The trigger describes the causes of the risk/issue. The consequences are: • \[consequence 1\] • \[consequence 2\] ... The consequence describes the impact of the risk/issue event. Page 11 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Part of the definition Description Risk linked to the milestones: • \[deliverable name\] – \[date\] • \[key event name\] – \[date\] ... Or, for an issue: The issue must be resolved by: \[key event name\] – \[date\] ... Each risk is linked to one or more milestones to show when the risk may eventuate as an issue. The risk proximity can be a specific event, milestone from the schedule, or it can be identified as “on-going” if it can happen at any time during the life of the current release. Each issue is linked to a single milestone by when the issue must be resolved. 4.1.2 Proximity The risk/issue proximity is the date linked to the next milestones described in the statement. This date reflects when it is assumed that the risk may eventuate as an issue, or when the issue must be resolved. The mitigations developed (i.e. closed or open/in-progress) should have their completion due date prior to the proximity date. It is the mitigation owner’s responsibility, in conjunction with the risk/issue owner, to track mitigations to completion. 4.1.3 Category Each risk/issue is assigned to a category as described in IR’s ERMP/F. The Enterprise risk categories are applied to risks/issues classified at Programme and Sub- Programme level, and the Project risk categories are used for a workstream risk/issue. 4.1.4 Closed Mitigation A closed mitigation is an existing policy, process, device, practice or other action that is in place to reduce a risk occurring or to reduce the impact of the issue. 4.1.5 Open or In-Progress Mitigation Open or in-progress mitigations are the set of options that may mitigate or resolve a risk/issue if implemented. An open or in progress mitigation should be an “actionable” plan that can be effectively translated into formal action items and to which ownership for execution can be assigned. 4.2 Specific definitions for a risk or an issue For the purposes of this framework, the following definitions are used to define a risk or an issue: 4.2.1 Risk levels Three levels of risk will be assessed for each risk: 1. Inherent risk level: Level of risk without any mitigations in place. 2. Current risk level: Level of risk with mitigations already in place. Page 12 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3. Residual (or Target) risk level: Predicted level of risk once all current and planned mitigations are implemented. 4.2.2 Risk Assessment Two dimensions will be assessed for each risk: Likelihood (Probability) and Consequence (Impact). 1. Likelihood: Probability of the risk happening. Refer to the Likelihood Matrix definition as presented in Appendix B. 2. Consequence: Impact of the risk happening. To assess the consequence of a risk at either Programme or Release / Stage / Sub-Programme levels, refer to the Enterprise Consequence Assessment Matrix as presented in Appendix C. To assess the consequence of a risk at workstream level, refer to the Project Consequence Assessment Matrix as presented in Appendix D. 4.2.3 Risk Matrix All risks use the ERMF risk assessment matrix as presented in Appendix A, B, C and D . The matrix considers both likelihood and consequence, to provide an overall risk rating. 4.2.4 Risk/Issue Levels in JIRA BT has the following levels to place to manage risks and issues in JIRA: • Programme: R isk s and issues at Programme-level can either impact “all of the Programme” or impact a Major Release’s delivery and requires the Programme Leadership’s attention (e.g. at Programme Risk Meetings), to mitigate or accept. In JIRA, Programme level risks can either be classified as “PLT” or “PGC”. Refer Section 5.2 for further guidance on reporting of PLT and PGC risks. • Release / Stage / Sub-Programme: At this level, a workstream cannot self-manage its risks and issues (e.g. a deliverable cannot be met) and requires the support of the Release / Stage / Sub-Programme to help manage. • Workstream: At this level, a workstream can manage its risks and issues without requiring the support at Release / Stage level. 4.2.5 Responding to a risk The Risk Owner 1 has four options for the risk, these are: Avoid: This is when the Risk Owner decides that to continue with the activity is too great a risk to their business delivery. In these instances, the Risk Owner is required to formally state why the activity is to be avoided. This may require wider organisational endorsement. Tolerate: This is when the Risk Owner decides that the existing mitigations are sufficient or effective. The need to introduce any further mitigations is either not cost effective, not proportionate to the consequences of the risk itself, or contingencies can be employed if the risk is realised to meet the business appetite to manage any resulting issues. Consideration must be given to the consequences of not mitigating the risk further. Treat: This is when the Risk Owner decides that further actions are necessary to reduce the likelihood of the event occurring or reduce the impact if it occurs. Mitigations are then 1 Refer to section 8, Roles and Responsibilities Page 13 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] identified and progressed. Factors affecting a decision to further mitigate a risk will include costs, resources, practicality, existing methods used, etc. Consideration must be given to the consequences of mitigating the risk further. Transfer: This is where the Risk Owner decides that the risk is better managed by another entity. This can be anything from another business unit or group, an external provider such as an insurance company or IT provider, or storage and building specialists. This may require wider organisational endorsement and involvement. In choosing to transfer a risk the balance between cost and practicality is a key factor. In some instances, IR may already be using providers both within and outside IR that are providing specialist services. This will introduce new risks relating to service delivery as a result of the dependence on external providers. 4.2.6 Issue rating The issue rating will be based on the analysis of the impacts and the determination of the level of consequences as described in the ERMF. The overall rating of the issue is: 1. Low - Any impact which is assessed as Minimal within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 2. Medium - Any impact which is assessed as Minor within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 3. High - Any impact which is assessed as Moderate within the relevant Consequence Matrix. 4. Very High – Any impact which is assessed as Major within the relevant Consequence Matrix 5. Extreme - Any impact which is assessed as Severe within the relevant Consequence Matrix. Note: For Programme, Sub-Programme and/or Release level issues, use the consequence matrix within the Enterprise Risk Rating Tool ( Refer Appendix C). For workstream-level issues, use the consequence matrix within the Project Risk Rating Tool (refer Appendix D). 5 Risk and issue management processes 5.1 Identification A variety of methods will be used to identify and evaluate risks and issues. These will include meetings, interviews, brainstorming, workshops, and discussions at Programme Risk Meetings (PRM), with the PLT, BT PMO, workstream teams, business, or other stakeholders. The Programme will continuously and proactively assess critical areas identified to determine specific risks and issues, analyse their potential impacts, determine mitigation actions, and monitor them. To help with the risk and issue identification process, the following sources of information should be referred to: • audit and internal assurance recommendations (e.g. prior independent quality assurance recommendations) • Programme plans and scope documents Page 14 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Lessons learned from prior BT releases/stages • existing issues in JIRA • exis ting risks in JIRA • risk prompts as presented in the ERMF. After initial identification, management and mitigation is managed through regular meetings, and monitoring at the various levels of the Programme. 5.2 Reporting path to PRM and PGC (or higher) Risks and issues should be reported up when one or more of the following criteria apply: Reporting up of Risks / Issues to Programme /PRM Reporting up of Programme Risks / Issues to PGC (or Higher) For a risk • risks are systemic (across more than one workstream and impact a major START Release/Stage) • risks rated as Extreme at residual level • risks stop a deliverable impacting the critical path from being met • risks have the following themes: o on -going resource constraints o serious customer, business or external stakeholder impact o legislative implications o public perception/media implications. • The current risk level of a Programme risk is assessed at Extreme, are to be reported to the Performance and Investment Committee (PIC) and Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR). • Programme risks confirmed by PRM members as “Major” for ongoing monitoring purposes. For an issue • issues are systemic (across more than one workstream and impact a major START Release/Stage) • issues rated as Extreme • issues stop a deliverable impacting the critical path from being met • issues have the following themes: o on -going resource constraints o serious customer, business or external stakeholder impact o legislative implications o public perception/media implications. • issues at workstream or Release/ Stage level that are already monitored at Programme-level and identified to be merged or for closure • Programme issues rated as Extreme to be reported to PIC and CIR • All Programme issues to be reported to PGC Page 15 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Reporting up of Risks / Issues to Programme /PRM Reporting up of Programme Risks / Issues to PGC (or Higher) Reporting All risks and issues for reporting to the PRM are submitted via JIRA, for the BT PMO to review. The workstream Project Co-ordinators are responsible for facilitating this process and maintaining all risk and issue information below Programme level. All Programme-level risks and issues reported to PGC (or higher) are included in the PGC Programme Risk Reporting. The BT PMO is responsible for facilitating this process and supporting the Programme to maintain its Programme-level risk and issue information. The following principles should apply prior to escalating a risk or issue at Programme-level: • all risks and issues should be accepted by the risk owner in JIRA as active risks or issues. • before escalating a risk or issue to the PRM, discuss the risk or issue proposed with the relevant representative in the BT PMO. It is possible that it could already be reflected within the existing Programme-level risks and issues captured in JIRA. • Ensure that the respective risk owner has a good understanding of the risk or issue they will be presenting to P RM. Note: Once the PRM has accepted the risk/issue it becomes a Programme-level risk/issue. There should be no duplication of risks or issues between the Programme and the workstream. 5.3 Closure The BT PMO will report to PRM where Programme risks or issues are proposed for closure when the owner confirms in JIRA that the risk event will no longer occur / the issue has been resolved. Once the closure of a Programme risk or an issue is agreed by PRM, it will be reflected in JIRA to ensure that the Programme’s profile is up to date and consistently reported. All other risks and issues below Programme level, must be approved for closure by the relevant owner in JIRA. 6 Risk and issue monitoring Risks and issues do not remain static therefore ongoing monitoring and management will be required throughout the Programme lifecycle. This monitoring ensures that the Programme’s risks and issues are being effectively managed. Page 16 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.1 Monitoring process The following table describes the monitoring tasks required at regular intervals: Role Frequency Activities Workstream Leads Monthly Workstream Leads (with support from Project Co- ordinators) to review and update their assigned risks in JIRA. As Required Workstream Leads (with support from Project Co- ordinators) report changes to Programme risks and issues (i.e. new, changed, for closure) to the BT PMO. BT PMO to facilitate owner endorsed Programme risk/issue changes to the PRM, for acceptance BT PMO Monthly The BT PMO will meet with Programme risk owners to review and update their Programme risks, issues and supporting mitigations. BT PMO update the details in JIRA to reflect the confirmed changes. Monthly BT PMO reports to PGC changes to the Programme’s risk and issue profile (new, changed, and closed) during the month, as approved by PRM, in the PGC Programme Status Report. Refer Section 7.1 Reports, for further details The Portfolio Office will receive Programme status reporting, to incorporate into their overall enterprise portfolio delivery reporting to the PGC. Monthly BT PMO provide CR&A with the Programme’s risk profile. Monthly BT PMO facilitate a review of a selection of Programme-level risks at each PRM meeting. BT PMO update the details in JIRA to reflect the confirmed changes. Quarterly BT PMO provide the Risk and Assurance Committee a quarterly update on PGC-level programme risks. Ad hoc BT PMO facilitate other risk and issue workshops as required. 6.2 Capturing of risk and issue information Risks and issues across the Programme are actively managed in JIRA (https://jira.nsp.ird.govt.nz) with a snapshot of this information being reported to various governing forums (refer section 7 Reporting below). On 13 March 2017, the Programme received permission f rom the Deputy Commissioner, Corporate Integrity and Assurance to use JIRA as the primary tool for managing Page 17 of 36 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] programme/project risks and issues, as JIRA is utilised by the Programme as a wider tactical tool to better oversee and link risks, issues and dependencies. The BT PMO provide CR&A with a list of current Programme risks and the supporting mitigations, as well as information on PGC tagged Programme-level risks as part of Risk and Assurance Committee reporting. The Programme-level risk and issue updates are co-ordinated by the BT PMO, in conjunction with the risk owners and assignees. Risks and issues below Programme level are managed by the project leads, with the support of their Project Co-ordinators. 7 Reporting 7.1 Reports Risk and issue reporting provides the Programme with an opportunity to communicate the status of its key risks and issues, the mitigations taken and the impact of the mitigations to the overall risk and issue assessment. Reporting is carried out to coincide with the PGC meeting dates. The following reports are available and produced as planned and/or when requested: Report Description Fortnightly / Monthly Workstream Reporting Workstream reporting shows: • 8- key status (prior period, current period), with supporting status commentary • an overall summary of key achievements over the reporting period, and future focus. • key risks and issues for reporting (where applicable).
