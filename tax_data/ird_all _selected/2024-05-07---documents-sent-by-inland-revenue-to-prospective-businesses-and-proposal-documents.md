24OIA2110 Page 1 of 3 7 May 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 12 April 2024. You requested the following (numbered for ease of response): 1.Please provide me with a copy of the documents that Inland Revenue provided to prospective submitted as part of the RFP process referred to on GETS as RFx ID 27630251. This RFP/tender closed on Tuesday, 1 August 2023 and the contact person was Michelle Knapton/TendersMGT@ird.govt.nz. 2.Please provide me with a copy of the winning proposal from each of the three selected providers (Haemata Tāpui Limited, Online Reo Agency Limited, TupuOra Education and Development limited). I understand that you may need to react commercially sensitive information. Item 1 Attached is a copy of the documents that were provided to prospective submitters as part of the RFP process. These documents were available with the GETS notice relevant to the Te Arapiki tenders. The attachment titled Request for Proposal – Te Arapiki is the main document. The attachments marked as appendices A-E are the relevant appendices that are discussed in the main attachment. Item 2 Consideration has been given on the release of the three winning submissions for Te Arapiki, however releasing the detailed information about the tenderer’s business (for example, detailed information about its internal organisation, plans, or products, or explanations as to how it proposes to meet Inland Revenue’s expectations and requirements) may confer a competitive advantage on the tenderer’s competitors, with a corresponding adverse effect on the tenderer. Competitors could copy or adopt the tenderer’s submission in future negotiations or tenders, which would unreasonably prejudice their commercial position. Releasing information that tenderers would regard as confidential, due to its commercial sensitivity or otherwise, could make tenderers cautious about sharing detailed information with Inland Revenue in the future, which would make it harder for Inland Revenue to make informed Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 1 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Request for Proposal (RFP) The Design and Delivery of Learning Assets for Te Arapiki TEARA - 001 RFP Release Date: 28-06-23 Deadline for Questions: 11 07-23 Deadline for Proposals: 12PM 25-07-23 Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 2 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Table of Contents SECTION 1: Purpose of this document .................................................................................... 5 What we need ................................................................................................................................ 5 What’s important to us .............................................................................................................. 5 Why should you bid ..................................................................................................................... 5 SECTION 2: Context ....................................................................................................................... 6 Who we are ..................................................................................................................................... 6 Our timeline .................................................................................................................................... 7 How to contact us ........................................................................................................................ 7 SECTION 3: The RFP Process ...................................................................................................... 8 Developing your proposal ......................................................................................................... 8 Deadline for questions ................................................................................................................ 8 Later changes to the RFP or RFP process ........................................................................... 9 Submitting your Proposal .......................................................................................................... 9 Address for submitting your proposal ................................................................................ 10 SECTION 4: Our Requirements ................................................................................................ 11 Background ................................................................................................................................... 11 Supplier Attributes ..................................................................................................................... 11 Scope .............................................................................................................................................. 11 Requirements ............................................................................................................................... 12 SECTION 5: Our Evaluation Approach ................................................................................... 13 Evaluation Model ........................................................................................................................ 13 Pre-Conditions ............................................................................................................................. 13 Modular Responses .................................................................................................................... 13 Evaluation Criteria ..................................................................................................................... 14 .............................................................................................................

Take time to read and understand the RFP. In particular: ▪ develop a strong understanding of Our Requirements detailed in Section 4. ▪ in structuring your Proposal consider how it will be evaluated. Section 5 describes our Evaluation Approach. For helpful hints on tendering and access to a supplier resource centre go to: www.procurement.govt.nz / for suppliers. If anything is unclear or you have a question, ask us to explain. Please do so before the Deadline for Questions. Email our Point of Contact. If an answer to a question in one section is identical for another, Respondents should repeat the relevant text in the question response area. Do not refer to an answer provided in another section, e.g. “see question 1.1 for response”. Where additional information is needed before an adequate response can be made to any question, please attempt to obtain that information from IR through the process outlined at Section 2 rather than including assumptions in your Proposal. Your Proposal must, however, identify where you have made assumptions, and the impact of those assumptions. A response which is too general, like “it depends upon IR” or “more information required”, will be considered inadequate. Deadline for questions Each Respondent should satisfy itself as to the interpretation of the RFP. If there is any perceived ambiguity or uncertainty in the RFP document/s Respondents should seek clarification before the Deadline for Questions. All requests for clarification must be made by email to our Point of Contact. We will endeavour to respond to requests in a timely manner, but not later than the deadline to answer Respondents’ questions in Section 2, if applicable. If we consider a request to be of sufficient importance to all Respondents, it may provide details of the question and answer to other Respondents. In doing so we may summarise the Respondent’s question and will not disclose the Respondent’s identity. The question and answer may be posted on GETS and/or emailed to participating Respondents. A Respondent may withdraw a request at any time. In submitting a request for clarification, a Respondent is to indicate, in its request, any information that is commercially sensitive. Inland Revenue will not publish such commercially sensitive information. However, Inland Revenue may modify a request to eliminate such commercially sensitive information and publish this and the answer where Inland Revenue considers it of general significance to all Respondents. In this case, however, the Respondent will be given an opportunity to withdraw the request or remove the commercially sensitive information. Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 9 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Later changes to the RFP or RFP process If, after publishing the RFP, we need to change anything about the RFP, or RFP process, or want to provide suppliers with additional information we will let all suppliers know by placing a notice on the Government Electronic Tenders Service (GETS) at www.gets.govt.nz. If you downloaded the RFP from GETS you will automatically be sent notifications of any changes through GETS by email. Submitting your Proposal In submitting your Proposal, you must use: ▪ the Response Form provided as Appendix A. This is a Microsoft Word document. ▪ the declaration provided as Appendix B. This is a Microsoft Word document. ▪ the excel template for your pricing information, provided as Appendix C. Check you have provided all information requested, and in the format and order asked for. A response must be provided for every requested item of information in this RFP. Having done the work, don’t be late – please ensure you get your Proposal to us before the Deadline for Proposals! Each Respondent is responsible for ensuring that its Proposal is received by us at the correct address on or before the Deadline for Proposals. We will acknowledge receipt of each Proposal. By submitting a Proposal you accept that your Proposal is bound by the RFP Process, Terms and Conditions (RFP-Terms) contained in Section 8. There is no expectation or obligation for Respondents to submit Proposals in response to the RFP solely to remain on any prequalified or registered supplier list. Any Respondent on such a list will not be penalised for failure to submit a Proposal. We intend to rely on your Proposal and all information you provide (e.g. correspondence and negotiations). In submitting a Proposal and communicating with us each Respondent should check that all information it provides to us is: ▪ true, accurate and complete, and not misleading in any material respect ▪ does not contain Intellectual Property that will breach a third party’s rights. Where we require the Proposal to be delivered in hard and soft copies, you are responsible for ensuring that both the hard and soft copies are identical. Where we stipulate a two envelope RFP process the following applies: ▪ you must ensure that all financial information and pricing components of your Proposal are provided separately from the remainder of your Proposal, ▪ financial information and pricing must be contained either in a separate sealed envelope or as a separate soft copy file (whichever option has been requested by us), the pricing information must be clearly marked ‘Financial and Pricing Information.’ This Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 10 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] is to ensure that the pricing information cannot be viewed when the package containing the other elements of the Proposal is opened. Address for submitting your proposal Proposals must be submitted by email to the following address: TendersMGT@ird.govt.nz Proposals sent by post or fax, or hard copy delivered to our office, will not be accepted. Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 11 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] SECTION 4: Our Requirements Background Te Arapiki is a capability development framework that all staff and leaders in IR and the organisation itself can use to plan, develop and monitor progress and development against Māori Crown capabilities. Te Arapiki means the stairway and is a levels-based training framework to support IR people to uplift their Maōri cultural capability. It aligns with Te Arawhiti guidance and Public Sector Act requirements. Supplier Attributes We are open to a single partner or a consortium arrangement to provide the development of learning assets and workshops across New Zealand. If we feel one provider may not be able to deliver specific assets within the full suite of learning, we may choose to procure multiple providers or work with selected providers to deliver a consortium approach. While this project is largely driven out of Wellington, wānanga will be delivered across New Zealand, so some travel within New Zealand or national reach will be required. IR is technology enabled and can also utilise tools like MS Teams to support delivery from anywhere in New Zealand. It is expected the delivery partner or partners will have subject matter expertise across a range of disciplines: • Tiriti of Waitangi and te reo me ōnā tikanga Māori knowledge, to develop accurate learning assets at a range of levels from foundation to capable, as described in Appendix E; • Project/programme management to support the IR Te Arapiki Delivery Lead in the successful delivery of learning assets against key milestones • Learning Design to ‘surround’ learners with different learning assets and to work with IR to align detailed learning design to IR’s ‘Learning Cluster’ approach to Learning & Development; • Workshop design and facilitation to develop and deliver learning for staff at Foundation level, and to coach IR staff to deliver these workshops on an ongoing basis; • Change management – to support the Change Lead and change management activities prior to launch of Te Arapiki; • Agile and co-design – to support the pull and iterative development (including pilot of learning assets prior to release) and to work with IR and potential multiple vendors. We expect the provider has immediate capacity to deliver the services sought in this RFP. Scope In scope is the delivery of a range of learning assets to uplift IR staff’s Te Ao Māori capability and understanding of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Inland Revenue RFP – Te Arapiki 28-06-2023 Request for Proposal Template version 20190630 Page 12 of 38 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Requirements While all potential solutions will be considered, IR’s preference is for a solution which includes: • Learning assets to be developed in accordance with the high and mid-level learning design, in partnership with IR; • Learning asset deliverables that are custom made to be owned by IR and uploaded to existing learning platforms; • Pre-existing learning assets to be owned or licenced (e.g. te reo Māori) as identified by the provider in this RFP; • Costs calculated based on estimated time and hours to design and develop assets where possible, with any ongoing costs calculated separately. • Supporting wānanga and workshops to be developed and delivered in partnership with IR. The solution should provide learning assets against the subject matter and in the format provided at Appendix E. IR would prefer to see the first learning assets/opportunities made available to staff no later than Q1, 2024. Dependent of the approach of the successful Respondent(s) this might be either partial or full implementation of the Te Arapiki programme. Other information New Intellectual Property arising because of the Contract will be the property of Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue is looking to share the new Intellectual Property across some other Crown entities where appropriate.

Rather, we wish to obtain the best public value over the whole-of-life of the Contract. This means achieving the right combination of fit for purpose, quality, on time delivery, quantity, and overall affordability. If a Respondent offers a price that is substantially lower than other Proposals (an abnormally low bid), we may seek to verify with the Respondent that the Respondent is capable of fully delivering all Inlathe Requirements and meeting all of the conditions of the Proposed Contract for the price quoted. Required Pricing Information Respondents are to provide their price as part of their Proposal. In submitting the Price the Respondent must meet the following: ▪ Respondents are to use the pricing schedule template provided (Appendix C). ▪ The pricing schedule is to show a breakdown of all costs, fees, expenses and charges associated with the full delivery of the Requirements over the whole-of-life of the Contract. Include any ongoing licence fee. It must also clearly state the total Contract price exclusive of GST. ▪ Where the price, or part of the price, is based on fee rates, all rates are to be specified, either hourly or daily or both as required. ▪ in preparing their Proposal, Respondents are to consider all risks, contingencies and other circumstances relating to the delivery of the Requirements and include adequate provision in the Proposal and pricing information to manage such risks and contingencies. ▪ Respondents are to document in their Proposal all assumptions and qualifications made about the delivery of the Requirements, including in the financial pricing information. Any assumption that Inland Revenue or a third party will incur any cost related to the delivery of the Requirements is to be stated, and the cost estimated if possible. ▪ Prices should be tendered in NZ$. Unless otherwise agreed, Inland revenue will arrange contractual payments in NZ$. ▪ Where a Respondent has an alternative method of pricing (i.e., a pricing approach that is different to the pricing schedule) this can be submitted as an alternative pricing model. However, the Respondent must also submit a pricing schedule that conforms. ▪ Where two or more Respondents intend to lodge a joint or consortium Proposal the pricing schedule is to include all costs, fees, expenses and charges chargeable by all Respondents.

If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any of: (a) the terms and conditions set out in this Section 8: RFP Rules; and (b) any other section or provision of this RFP, the order of priority for the purposes of determining which will prevail will be the order in which they appear above. 7.

Inland Revenue has the right to share a Respondent’s Response with other New Zealand Government agencies provided that any commercially sensitive information in a Response is not disclosed to that agency unless there is an obligation of confidentiality from that agency to Inland Revenue in respect of the commercially sensitive information 13. Nothing in Rule 12 or otherwise will prohibit Inland Revenue's use but not disclosure other than as specified in Rule 12 of such commercially sensitive information marked ‘Commercial in Confidence’ for the purposes of considering, analysing and evaluating Proposals, and for any other purpose related to this RFP, the RFP Process or the Procurement Process, or any contract (if any) entered into with the Respondent as a result of the Procurement Process.
