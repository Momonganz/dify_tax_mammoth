1 START release plan - sequencing options For discussion IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 Transformation is well underway ▪There are four broad stages in Inland Revenue’s transformation –digital services, tax, social policy and a final wrap up. ▪Transformation is enabled in the main by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. ▪Central to the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s technology is delivery of a new tax and social policy platform called START. ▪In addition to START, a number of other changes are being made to support digital services and intelligence-led outcomes. ▪GST was the first major release of START in February 2017. ▪From now on there will be more than one START release in each stage so that the amount of change being introduced for both customers and Inland Revenue can be carefully managed. ▪The remaining stages of transformation will overlap and be implemented in a series of START and other releases from 2018 to 2021. ▪Major START releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years to align with the beginning of the tax year.

We will know more in September/October 2018 when we have more detailed information. •Until then, we recommend the current release plan as the best option. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 5 Options will be assessed against how well they deliver against Ministers’ priorities. They must: make it easier to make changes to tax and social policy including time to implement new products ensure revenue collection has a higher degree of certainty ensure social policy can be quickly directed at those in need Government priorities Alternative sequencing options for social policy are possible within some set parameters Options must be within the mandate approved by government. They must: not exceed the approved funding achieve benefits as early as possible end by December 2021 or earlier deliver all tax and social policy products in START enable the decommissioning of heritage technology enable Inland Revenue’s digital capability to be leveraged for the benefit of the NZ public November 2015 business case Options will be assessed against their risks and their impacts on customers and Inland Revenue. They must: minimise business risk –the ability to absorb change minimise delivery risk – implementation do- ability have the least impact on revenue have the best positive impact and least negative impact on our customers minimise coexistence costs –manual and technical Risks and impacts Options will be assessed against how much they improve customer experiences. They must: make it easier for customers to understand what their obligations and entitlements are and why reduce compliance costs for customers over time significantly improve customers’ experiences and enable them to self-help for the majority of the time mean there is little need for customers to contact Inland Revenue Customerexperiences IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 6 There are three possible options for sequencing Child Support, KiwiSaver, and Student Loans The options do not include Working for Families ▪Options for the optimum time to move Working for Families have already been considered. To minimise the difficulties for customers from having to work off both old and new systems and to ensure payments continue to be timely and accurate, Working for Families will move with income tax in START release 3. No option proposes moving two products in START release 5 ▪Should this be required, it could impact our ability to complete transformation by December 2021. The work completed by \[Information redacted\] on the EMS process confirms that Child Support can be decoupled from PAYE – so option 1 is viable ▪Decoupling Student Loans from PAYE can be done with some impact. Decoupling KiwiSaverfrom PAYE will have a big co-existence impact. ▪These options all assume PAYE processing moves in release 4.

The key markers that will trigger a reassessment of the release plan are: 1.Government priorities will be clearer following the 2017 General Election. 2.The successful implementation of START release 2. 3.The completion of income tax solution design and definition (for START release 3) in START, and Working for Families solution design largely completed. This will give us a gauge of how easy or difficult it is to implement social policy products in START, and how much can be re-used from the Working for Families solution design to support KiwiSaver, Child Support and Student Loans. 4.Business system testing for START release 3 has begun. 5.An early diagnostic on how Child Support, KiwiSaverand Student Loans will work in START has been completed. Until these have been completed, we will not have sufficient information to reassess the current START release plan. The START release plan will be reviewed at the conclusion of each START major release, or at least yearly, to ensure the sequence remains relevant. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 10 Operating two core tax and social policy systems means operational risk has increased due to co-existence ▪Co-existence (the need for old and new systems to work together) is amongst the most complex challenges to be managed for both us and customers. Ideally, we ensure that customers are not aware of the two different systems. ▪Migrating products and services to START as quickly as possible will limit the time that systems need to co-exist, is the best way to manage risk, and will minimise any confusion or disruption for customers. ▪The priority is delivery of the core tax and social policy platform –START. ▪Only by improving and modernising our technology can we significantly enhance experiences for customers and meet their needs. ▪Halting part way through implementation will increase operational risk, be costly because two core systems will have to be supported and maintained, and may potentially constrain government’s agility to make change. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 11 Metric Current Plan Option1 Option 2–Reverse Child Support & Student Loans Option 3 –RescheduleKiwiSaverto Release 5.0& Student Loans / ChildSupport to Release 4.0 Rank & Rationale Scope All products will be delivered within confirmed programme scope for all three options Risk – Technical Low Moderate Conceptually, reversing child support & student loans drives a very low level of difference into the design and underlying technical risk for the co- existence solution. This ranking reflects that we have not performed analysis at the same level of detail as Option 1 to confirm coexistence technical implications. High Moving KiwiSaver to Release 5 means separating it from PAYE processing in Release 4. This would drive a significant increase in technical coexistence complexity and the number of returns processing and financial integration points that would need to be developed between START and FIRST. Release Sequencing Options –Co-existence Impact Assessment Based on the release sequencing options, this table outlines a comparative view of technical risk and delivery cost associated with the required co-existence solution (for non-START applications). This is expressed as: (a)Qualitative risk ranking: degree of risk (1 = lowest →3 = highest), or; (b)Cost, expressed as an approximated factor of baseline funding.
