Te Tari Taake Tax principles interim annual report draft Page 2 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Taxation Principles Reporting Act: interim report Background Over the past three decades there have been several working groups formed to comment on how to improve the tax system. They tend to form their advice for change around principles of efficiency, fairness, simplicity and cohesiveness in the tax system. The Taxation Principles Reporting Act ("the Act"), enacted in August 2023, requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide the Minister of Revenue with a report on New Zealand's current tax settings in relation to a set of tax principles. The principles are assessed through the approved taxation principles measurements in section 12 of the Act. The objective of this report This inaugural report provides information on the tax principles that underpin the design of a tax system. It does not offer any judgement on whether the current New Zealand tax system achieves those principles. This report is intended to help inform conversations and debate by providing relevant data in one place. The reporting obligations The Act stipulates that the report produced by Inland Revenue must take one of two forms and be either an "interim" report or a "full" report (with the "full" version being required once every three years, beginning in 2025). This hybrid reporting model was designed to ensure that available annual data is captured and reported, while ensuring that departmental resources for more comprehensive reporting are used efficiently with less frequent reporting. This inaugural report is an interim report. Unless otherwise specified, we have used data from tax years where we have complete records. The most recent year for which we have complete records is the tax year ending (for most taxpayers) 31 March 2022. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 3 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft What are tax principles? Tax principles are generally understood as the overarching values or aims which a tax system should pursue. These inform the tax policy frameworks which economists, tax professionals and policy makers use to develop and evaluate tax policy proposals. Trade-offs are usually required between the principles. Some of the tax principles in Schedule 1 of the Act can be traced back to at least Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, while others are more recent innovations. Efficiency The principle of efficiency provides that revenue should be raised at the least possible social cost to society. Ultimately, regardless of whether they are levied on companies, transactions, individuals or families, taxes are paid by people. The social cost of taxation is at a minimum when the only cost of raising a dollar is the dollar paid from the person ultimately bearing the cost of the tax. Efficiency costs are from people changing their behaviour 1 in response to a tax. Taxpayers lose more than just the tax revenue raised. They lose the surplus they were receiving from any activity curtailed by the tax. This is a net loss to society not compensated by the tax revenue collected. Equity Horizontal equity The concept of horizontal equity provides that people in similar positions should be treated similarly. This implies that people who earn similar amounts of income should pay a similar proportion of their income in tax. Whether a country's tax system is regarded as horizontally equitable between two people will depend in part on judgments about whether these people are in similar positions. Vertical equity Vertical equity provides that people in different positions should be treated differently. A common perspective is that this means that people with higher incomes should pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than those with lower income. This is known as progressivity and is observed when the average rate of tax rises as income increases. Revenue integrity 1 Assuming that the tax is not an externality tax designed to discourage activities with spillover costs. Our income and consumption taxes are not these sorts of taxes. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 4 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft This concept looks at how reliably the tax system is able to raise the level of revenue required to meet the government's expenditure programme over the longer term. This includes the tax system's contribution to whether the government can respond to unexpected events through sustainable fiscal strategy. It also looks at whether the taxes are applied fairly and with integrity, or whether there are large gaps or lack of enforcement that means some groups do not contribute to the tax system when they should. Compliance and administration costs Compliance costs refer to the costs which taxpayers incur in meeting their tax obligations (for example, the price of seeking professional services). These costs include non-monetary costs (e.g. the time and stress which taxpayers incur in determining and meeting their obligations). Administration costs are the costs faced by a tax authority (e.g. Inland Revenue) in administering the tax system. Both categories of costs should be minimised as far as possible. For a tax authority, minimising costs ensures that public funds are used efficiently. For taxpayers, it lowers the total costs of meeting their liabilities. Certainty and predictability The principles of certainty and predictability refer to the ability of taxpayers to reliably determine their tax liabilities in advance. This can have important implications for investors' willingness to make long-term decisions, which will in turn affect the level of economic activity within a jurisdiction. As it is difficult to measure the level of certainty and predictability within a jurisdiction directly, discussion of this principle often occurs with reference to qualitative information. Flexibility and adaptability The principles of flexibility and adaptability are about tax systems keeping pace with technological and commercial developments. Although the structural features of a tax system should be enduring, it is important that a tax system is flexible enough to allow governments to respond to changes within society. 2 This could include changes in technology and business models and changes in society, such as aging population and changes in international mobility. 2 OECD.

Te Tari Taake Page 5 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Assessing the principles As it is difficult to assess some principles directly, the Act describes the categories of information which are relevant to the principles. This was designed to allow the report's authors to report relevant information without limiting the tools at their disposal. The measurements specified in section 12 of the Act to be used are: • Income distribution and income tax paid • Distribution of exemptions from tax and of lower rates of taxation • Perceptions of integrity of the tax system, and • Compliance with the law by taxpayers. This report addresses each in turn. Income distribution and income tax paid The principle to which this measurement most closely relates is equity. In particular, the income distribution and the amount of income tax paid provides a measure of progressivity, which in turn informs judgments about vertical equity. Progressivity in taxation has a specific technical definition: it is achieved when the average tax rate increases as income increases. New Zealand's tax system achieves its progressivity through increasing marginal tax rates. By applying increasing marginal tax rates, average tax rates increase as taxable incomes increase. This ensures that those with higher taxable incomes face higher average tax rates - they contribute a proportionally larger share of their income to taxes. When average tax rates increase, a tax system is said to be "progressive". Some level of progressivity is desirable because it supports vertical equity. Vertical equity is the concept that taxpayers with different levels of ability to pay should be taxed differently, aligning tax liabilities more closely with individuals' financial capabilities. Before looking at marginal income tax rates and their impact, it is important to understand the broader taxable income distribution in New Zealand, as represented in Figure 1 below. The graph shows the distribution of taxable income up to $300,000. This captures 99.3% of taxpayers and 92. 7% of personal taxable income. Taxable income itself is defined by tax law and is not the same as economic income, although there will be a s ignificant overlap of the two concepts. 3 3 The standard economic definition of income used in public economics is the Haig-Simons' definition. This defines income as the increase in wealth plus consumer spending over a given period of time (e.g. a year). See R.M. Haig. (1921) The Concept of Income-Economic and Legal Aspects R. M.

Columbia University Press. Inland Revenue's recent High-wealth individuals research project � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 6 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft It is important to note that certain spikes tend to dominate the graph. These spikes are due to specific income amounts paid to a lot of people (such as those at the level of universal New Zealand Superannuation payments) and the graph should be interpreted with this context in mind.

Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 7 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Figure 2 below shows how the marginal income tax rates and thresholds create an upward sloping average tax rate for the taxable income range of $0 - $300,000. Figure 2: Average tax rates rise as income increases 35.0 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 0.0 Average tax rates from 2012 - 2022 32.3% Over time, as incomes grow through inflation or real increases, average tax rates increase unless the marginal tax rate structure is changed. Progressivity falls unless thresholds are adjusted upwards. We can see the particular effect that strong inflation can have by looking at the change in distribution of taxpayers' incomes from 2012 - 2017, as compared with the change in 2017 - 2022. Figure 3 shows the distribution of taxpayers' salary and wage incomes for 2012, 2017, and 2022, with the average tax rate of the most common regularly employed worker highlighted. 4 From 2012 to 2017, the average tax rate of the most common income of a regularly employed worker increased by 0.1 percentage points. But from 2017 to 2022 it increased by 1.2 percentage points. The significant increase is because the peak that includes the most common regularly employed worker shifts to the higher marginal tax rate of 30%. The average tax rate then increases rapidly as incomes rise from there and marginal income is taxed at 30% instead of 17.5%. 4 Looking only at salary and wage income removes the large spikes associated with particular government payments like NZ Superannuation and other taxable welfare payments.

Whether that improves or worsens vertical equity depends on a view about how much progressivity is desirable. Progressivity and the distribution of tax paid Some commentators use the percentage of tax revenue contributed by a segment of taxpayers to indicate progressivity. However, rising average tax rates provides a more accurate measure, because the percentage of tax paid is not a measure of progressivity unless we know the proportion of taxable income earned by each segment (i.e. the underlying distribution of the tax base). For example, in 2022, as shown in Figure 4 below, the top decile of taxable income earners paid 44 percent of personal income taxes. But this does not offer a complete picture of progressivity. Such a distribution could also result from a flat tax system if the top decile of taxpayers received 44 percent of the total taxable income. Figure 4 captures both tax paid and taxable income earned, showing the top decile earned 33 percent of total taxable income. The combination of these (paying 44 percent of total personal income tax, earning 33 percent of total taxable income), is a better indicator of progressivity than the 44 percent measure by itself. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 10 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Note that many of those in decile one have losses 5 • Figure 4: Taxable income earned and income tax paid by each decile TAX PAID I TAXABLE INCOME EARNED a, E 8 -= a, "' X "' � 8 12% 13% 7 �11% 6--6% ........ 9% 5 - 4% --- 7% 4 aiis% 3 a.64% 2 1. % 3% i I o % I 1% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 44% 33% 35% 40% 45% 50% There are two further factors relevant to progressivity. First, if the tax base could be altered to better reflect taxpayers' actual ability to pay, the system's progressivity might be more effectively realised. In New Zealand, the major debate relevant here is whether realised capital gains should be included in the tax base. 5 We have also removed from the distribution people with an automated annual square-up of tax withheld at source whose total taxable income was less than $100. These are often children or others whose only taxable income is from a small balance in an interest-bearing bank account. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 11 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Second, taxpayers who are more able to control their taxable income 6 might do so to remain below higher tax thresholds. This is evident in the observable "bunching" at certain income levels. An example of "bunching" can be seen in the graph below. Figure S: Reported incomes bunch at the threshold of $180,000 after the introduction of the 39% rate � 7,000 a, "' "' 6,000 ::, ·:;; 5,000 a, 4,000 ::, 3,000 BEFORE the 39% rate was introduced, numbers of taxpayers reporting higher 2,000 incomes tend to decline as incomes rise, with some variability 1,000 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 N' ID' g '$ �-.,.. .,.. .... .... .... .... .... = = = = = Taxable income 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 ,-; ir, o' q-' ,..\_ ,..\_ 00 00 .... .... .... .... = = = = AFTER the 39% rate was introduced, we see a significant spike in numbers of taxpayers reporting income close to the threshold 0 0 0 8 8 8 (¥J N' ID' 00 a, a, .... .... .... = = = 0 8 8 N = 2022 tax year 2021 tax year Prior to the introduction of the 39% personal income tax rate, the number of taxpayers reporting higher incomes tended to decline (albeit with some variation in the data). However, following the introduction of the 39% rate in the 2021-22 income tax year, there was a "spike" in the numbers of taxpayers reporting income just below the $180,000 threshold. This suggests that some taxpayers are structuring their income to avoid paying the 39% rate of tax. 6 For example, those taxpayers who operate a business through a company and can control the timing and amount of shareholder salaries and dividends. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 12 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Distribution of exemptions and lower rates Tax exemptions and lower rates of taxation for specified groups or activities are similar to government spending. These mechanisms, broadly categorised as "tax expenditures", represent the government's financial commitments through the tax system, benefiting various social or business segments. Exemptions and lower rates are relevant to the principles of both equity and efficiency. The link to equity is the implications for vertical and horizonal equity if some taxpayers receive exemptions or lower tax rates. The efficiency question is whether having higher taxes on some taxpayers to raise enough revenue so that others can have lower taxes or be exempt results in higher total costs from taxation than a more neutral system. But also relevant is whether exemptions in any particular case are justified because the compliance and administration costs are higher for those particular taxpayers receiving the exemption. The Treasury regularly provides an annual tax expenditure statement as part of the budget process. There are different ways of categorising tax expenditures. In the annual tax expenditure statement they are categorised into "social", "business", and "other". To provide further information about their distribution, we present an alternative categorisation of tax expenditures: • in the nature of welfare payments, • to encourage private charity, • to internalise "spillovers", and • to promote particular activi ties or industries.7 Only some of the tax expenditures are quantified in the annual tax expenditure statement. This is because some expenditures (particularly those that are tax credits) require information to be provided to Inland Revenue while others do not. In this report, we take a closer look at tax expenditures: in the nature of welfare payments, to encourage private charity, and to internalise "spillovers" through subsidies. This last category is motivated by situations where the full benefit of an activity is not captured by the parties to a transaction. In this case, the level of the activity will be inefficiently low. It will be inefficiently low because the parties do not face the wider marginal benefits and costs of their activity. Total benefits for wider society could be increased by subsidising the activity. The usual example given of this (and the primary activity of this nature subsidised through the tax system in New Zealand) is research and development expendi ture. 7 This includes activities or industries where the tax expenditure is to reduce compliance costs. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 13 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Tax expenditures in the nature of welfare payments were falling until 2018 An example of "tax expenditure" is the use of welfare focused tax credits. The graph below shows tax expenditure through Working for Families Tax Credits and the Independent Earner's Tax Credit. This declined from the 2013-14 financial year until the family income package was introduced in the 2018-19 financial year, which raised abatement thresholds. This lifted expenditure briefly before it began to decline again.

It allows registered charities to operate without paying income tax. 2. Donations tax credit and deductions: This category includes the donations tax credit for individuals and the deductions available to companies and Maori authorities for donations to registered donee organisations. This second category has risen by approximately $100m since the 2013/14 financial year but has been broadly stable over the last five years. � Inland Revenue � a.'

This has resulted in increasing average donations tax credit claimed as shown in Figure 8.

This credit aims to increase company spending on R&D by reducing the cost of R&D faced by companies. The logic behind this is that there are spillover benefits not captured by firms undertaking R&D. Because of this, firms will do an inefficiently low amount of R&D. This tax expenditure has risen significantly since the introduction of the tax credit in the 2018/19 financial year, with over $1.4 billion claimed since the tax credit first became available.

Taxpayer perceptions influence taxpayer compliance, which in turn affects the government's ability to raise revenue. However, perceptions of integrity are also clearly related to equity (and people's perceptions of it) and efficiency. Because taxpayers' behaviour is influenced by their perception of others' behaviour, a tax system will be more efficient when it has integrity and people understand that others comply with their obligations and cannot step around tax rules. This is because taxpayers will spend less resources trying to avoid or evade obligations. In addition, a high integrity system will require fewer resources to ensure taxpayers meet their obligations, lowering administration costs. Perceptions of integrity have been stable over time The information below shows the results of Inland Revenue's Customer Experience and Perceptions survey over the last four years. The metrics are broadly stable, but some have declined slightly over the past four years. However, in some cases, signs of recovery are evident in the most recent quarterly data. Taxpayers' trust in the tax system rose 10% in the July - September 2023, suggesting a recovery from the fall in the preceding quarter. 8 Figure 10: Trust in the tax system has fallen slightly fallen over the past four years 100 90 80 70 60 "-.,,/ 60 so 40 30 20 10 0 8 Respondents are asked about the extent to which they trust Inland Revenue and provided with a seven-point scale (1 being do not trust Inland Revenue at all, 7 being trust Inland Revenue completely).

Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake Page 18 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft Taxpayers' perceptions of consequences for taxpayers who do not meet their obligations have declined slightly but remain largely consistent. Figure 13: Perceptions of consequences for taxpayers 100 90 80 70 60 so 40 30 20 10 0 Compliance with the law 75 This measurement relates to revenue integrity, efficiency, and compliance and administration costs. High compliance with the law improves revenue integrity, increases efficiency, and reduces compliance and administration costs. Comprehensive data on compliance with the law is difficult to collect but disputes are falling Disputes Disputes refer to disagreements between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. These can be initiated by Inland Revenue following audit activity, or by taxpayers in filing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NoPA). In each case, either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer will have disagreed with the tax position taken by the other party. The frequency and value of disputes can have important implications for such principles as efficiency, compliance and administrative costs, and certainty. However, drawing clear conclusions from the number of open disputes at any one time can be challenging. For example, a large number of open disputes could be interpreted as the tax environment being uncertain and creating the ambiguity necessary to allow large numbers of disputes to arise. Or, it could be interpreted as an increased focus on compliance activity on the part of Inland Revenue, or a greater inclination to engage in disputes on the part of taxpayers. � Inland Revenue � a.' Te Tari Taake Page 19 of 32 Tax principles interim annual report draft The graph below shows the number of open disputes since July 2020. These are disputes which have been initiated by either the taxpayer or Inland Revenue and which have not proceeded to litigation. Figure 14: The number of open dispute cases has declined 350 300 250 200 150 100 so 0 182 In general, there is a trend toward a reduction in the number of open disputes. This could be due to a range of factors, including the impact of Inland Revenue's Business Transformation Programme, COVID-19 disruptions and the resulting focus less on compliance activity when taxpayers have got things wrong, and more on designing systems to try to get things "right from the start".
