\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] March 2019 Customer Engagement Approach for GWS design BT DX Sub-programme, Digital Ecosystem Services \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Purpose oThis brief describes how & when IR will engage with various customers groups w.r.t.R4 GWS scope. oIt only covers 1:n services where we intend to collaborate (either co-define or co-refine) with a variety of externals to ensure a robust, meaningful set of services are created. oThe approach aligns to other documents such as: BT Internal and External Stakeholder Engagement Plan and Internal Communications Plan for START Release 4 (D-xxx, due March 2019); BT Account Management Strategy; Release 3 Income Tax DES Engagement Approach; BT KiwiSaverScheme Provider Engagement Plan. oThe inputs (and outputs) from this engagement plan are created from (and inform) standard BT / DES deliverables such as: BFDs; Solution Blueprints; Build Packs; BST Scenarios. Recommendation oThe DX Sub-programme recommends that the TEWC endorsethe proposed engagement approach and plan DES Engagement Plan - 2 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] GWS R4 Scope Summary - 3 - \[Information redacted\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] GWS Scope vs Engagement Approach - 4 - Release 4 scope has been defined at a product level; GWS delivery activities will also be scheduled in this way: KiwiSaverTransition, Replacement, New Services Income Tax Alerts, Notification, Information etc Tax at Source Employment, PAYE, III etc MyResponsibilitiesReplacement for the My Tax function Gateway Capability Developer Portal, Test Services, Service Now etc HOWEVER, we will often use generic solutions to meet multiple customer needs e.g.: oMyResponsibilitiesmight cover “what’s my SL balance” as well as “how much tax do I need to pay via internet banking”; oTDS might cover transactional information for KiwiSaver History as well as Tax Accounting; oThe same Alerts service might be used for PAYE employers as well as Income Tax agents. Financial Sector Payroll Sector Accounting Sector Developer Portal Generic GWS PAYE/ Employ- ment KiwiSaver Student Loans MyRespon- sibilities III Income Tax Where appropriate, we will engage across customer groups, especially to create generic services that meet multiple segment / product needs Note: We will leverage appropriate customer research (surveys, data analysis, industry engagement etc) to understand the prioritiesand needs of end-users of any gateway service, e.g. •Tax agents who use practice management software; •Employers who use payroll software; •Student Loan customers who use internet banking. However it’s important to remember that GWS are wholesale services – it’s up to the connecting party to decide how to represent the information in their systems and/or to their customers; and to test appropriately! \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] GWS Engagement Environment - 5 - Stakeholder models are complicated •Lots of players – BT, IR and customer •Some are involved in many topics (Channel Owner; Architects. •Others only in one or two (certain Product Owners and Account Managers. •All of them have other jobs to do as well (BAU activities; Release 3 delivery; R4 core START / myIRdesign; other compliance work; own business priorities!) Tight 5 Engagement Leads for each topic ensures: •our design leaders are aligned on priorities, design, schedule and resources; •we are aligned on how – and if/when! –to seek customer insights to inform the best possible design; •we maintain momentum on key customer-facing issues that need to be resolved and/or escalated to BT governance (especially DA/EWC); •light-touch, high value; lots of detailed work is happening behind the scenes! •For big ticket items we’ll have a fortnightly 1- hour meeting (KiwiSaverB2B, INC GWS); •For lighter-touch items we’ll have a monthly 30min meeting (PAYE, Dev Portal) or hook into existing project meetings (myResponsibilities). \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Ideate: 1.Problem/Needs – (IR & Customer) 2.Solutions Options Design Approach - 6 - A consistent approach with different entry points depending on whether the outcome requires a deep "co-design", moderate "co-refine", or light "convert" design approach: Identify Customer Groups Incubate Conceptual Design BFD/ Blueprint (requirements) Lightweight sessions to tease out important issues early. Do we understand: a)Customer Problem/Needs b)Possible solution options Workshopto present rough proposed solution for feedback Workshop to present detailed solution forfeedback 1 Define Design Challenge Build Pack v0.8 (Solution) P'ship Testing V1 "Co-Design" "Co-Refine" "Convert" start here start here start here 2 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Rules of engagement - 7 - Starting point and boundary lines for co-design and co-refine are: oAgreed scope items only (where do we re-list this?) oNo change to IR’s role in service value chain unless pre-agreed REF: IR’s role in Kiwisaverservice value chain and need for prior agreement on this oService design alignment with IR target outcomes oService design in accordance with approved design patterns and architectural guidelines oNo design choices or promises made in workshops (we always adhere to BT design governance) oService design has to contemplate change and adoption effort for all impacted parties oNo delivery commitment to partners prior to approved design oImpartiality and level playing field for all participants \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] GWS Release 4 Engagement Timeline - 8 - Ensuring coverage in engagement models •Lots of people support multiple R4 engagement topics e.g. William, Ryan, Tim, Karen, Coordinator •and/or they are handling R3 in parallel e.g. Annabel, Mat, Tania, Returns SMEs •We can’t practically manage >1 engagement per week so need to plan this out carefully up-front! •We need to book IR and Customer attendees as well as venues well in advance!! This schedule takes into account: •R4 design completion deadlines e.g. KiwiSavertransition build starts in June; but Income Tax GWS build starts in October •R4 scope priority i.ework on Must Do before Should Do •R3 activity by customer group e.g. Accounting SWDs are busy with E-File and TDS •Method by service significantly less engagement for Convert compared to Co-Refine or Co-Define Legend •Size of bubble = size of engagement •Colour = initiative stream Kiwisaver Tax on Income PAYE My Responsibilities
