The forum sets out a number of options for change to improve the current tax system and invites you to post your thoughts and comments. The Government’s economic vision for New Zealand includes a tax system that supports and strengthens economic growth. A key step to achieving this vision was the Government’s Budget 2010 which included a package of tax policy measures to re-balance the tax system.

We are only a small company but it is one job I don't have to worry about. The cost per month for this service is very minimal and I don't have to worry about holiday pay workings etc. Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 3 Brian. I guess this is just a tweak to the current payroll systems used by businesses. However, I find the current IRD ir-File system clunky and hard to use compared with other secure online websites (such as SOME banks websites). I hope IRD check out the competition and strive to be in the top layer for ease-of-use. Results: Agree: 11 Disagree: 4 cantaloupe As an employer of workers on a kiwifruit (KF) orchard I would have to say that the whole system of employee tax has become quite painful. Initially I could get in companies to do thinning etc and like any other company they would sort out their own tax. With some changes a few years ago WT (Withholding Tax) was brought in to this sphere of operation to cause companies to be taxed WT by the orchard owner. This now means I have a montly load of crap to sort out for the IRD and they seem to want this information back very quickly. The painful aspect I see with this whole WT system is that the requirements for when it should apply are bizarre to fathom out. Take as an example the IRD web site... Company A provides services under a contract which involves a high capital outlay (ie large use of machinery). As this contract is deemed to have a high capital outlay and low labour input, payments made to Company A in this circumstance will not have tax on schedular payments deducted. However, if the use of the machinery was incidental, with the supply of labour making up most of the contract, then payments made to Company A for this contract would have tax on schedular payments deducted. If you then look the recommended list of WT type payments from the back of the IR330 which is supposed to summarize the WT payments under Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. On this list there is nothing about horticultural activities where a large capital investment has been made. Indeed the closest match would be... Agricultural contracts for maintenance, development, or other work on farming or agricultural land - rate 15c if IRD number supplied or 30c otherwise in the dollar. For a bobcat operator performing contracted work on agricultural land is he exempt or not fro WT (schedular payments)? Where this is heading is that the intrepretation of rules generated by IRD are so loose at times that not even IRD can consistently respond with the same answer. This does not make the job of payroll, which I never wanted to be involved in in the first place, very easy. Rest assured that if you do get it wrong there will be at least 5 penalties waiting to be charged ! An excellent example of this is where WT needs to be taken out (now called schedular payments which is even more difficult to understand what it means). I have been in touch with IRD on several occassions for the answer where a person/company, falling under the category of needing schedular payments deducted, has a special tax deduction certificate. The IR330 indicates that the STC tax code should be used but elsewhere on the website the following is stated... The tax code to use is "WT" even if they have a certificate of exemption or a special What do you think of having your payroll and accounting software manage your employees' deductions? | Making tax easier http://makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/...usinesses-employers/what-do-you-think-having-your-payroll-and-accounting-software-manage-your.html\[24/10/2013 11:01:15\] Mon, 21/06/2010 - 12:28#7 Mon, 12/07/2010 - 19:15 #8 Mon, 21/06/2010 - 16:13 #9 Mon, 12/07/2010 - 19:02 #10 1 2 next › last » About this site Discussion document General tax questions Conditions of use Contact us Your privacy Keep up to date RSS feeds View the list For more information on government services go to tax rate.

I much prefer to have an Information booklet that I can mark with a post-it and highlight so that I can refer back to it next time. I think it is very short sighted of the IRD to not make PAYE tables available.

Results: Agree: 17 Disagree: 0 willy2212 The answer in simple terms is yes. The things that bug me now are: - The online returns are not user friendly - you need to put too much information in. You know who I am, put that information in before I start and I can complete the return. A classic example of this is the GST return - the paper one you send me has all my details in it already. - If I am in the online channel, keep me there - don't push me to paper or the phone line. Let me interact with you where I want to interact, not where you want me to Results: Agree: 22 Disagree: 0 Taniwha I decided today to try doing my return online. It was a very difficult process. I am self-employed with one employee, and each month I fill out an IR345 plus the monthly schedule. I expected to find a page which displayed the same information and I could fill in the numbers - and avoid writing them twice as I currently do. There appear to be separate requirements for PAYE, Kiwisaver deductions and Kiwisaver employer contributions. The same is true for electronic payments. Having filled out the paper form again, I went to the bank to pay electronically. I have to make three separate payments as opposed to the one cheque I send you. So you have substituted three separate pages, and three transactions, for one paper one. Doesn't look easier to me. Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 1 NRGIZE My experiences with filling in IRD forms on line are that they are much harder and more time consuming than completing paper forms or working in excel.

Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 0 P Gardner I want to take the opportunity to comment on the filing of PAYE returns monthly. Although I was originally advised that our Non profit organisation would be coded as irregular payer it never happened. In fact I went overseas and reminders were sent about non furnishing of returns. There has been no opportunnity to indicate this once a year payer status through the online service. We make one payment at the end of each year by way of honorarium and one PAYE payment but I must login 11 times to file NIL returns which is obviously a waste of my time. I also recieve 12 IR345 forms and 12 Return addresed envelopes - waste of resources/postage. There must be some discretion to allow "employers" the ability to pre set when they will be making PAYE liable payments and request an IR345 on demand. If the ability to request an irregular status already exists then it is an indictment on the web site that I could not find it.

I think there are two issues here: Firstly, less paper and more dependence on digital could contribute to global warming, not help it (this is an area of current debate)...I would like to know how this increase in digital dependence will affect IRD's carbon footprint, especially in terms of the increased server traffic and need for new servers (not sure exactly how this works) Second is a two-pronged issue: 1. Not everyone has fast internet or access to reliable computers. Yes, they could go to a library (unreliable too) or an internet cafe (extra cost) but what are the stats on the amount of people who this will be a disadvantage for? Are lower socio-economic groups going to struggle to fulfil the requirements? What is the current/proposed state of NZ broadband to allow this high traffic flow? 2. What percentage of the population are not digitally literate? Will there be paper options available for those people e.g. people who choose not to have an email address or who are worried about having their personal data online (don't use internet banking etc.) When you say secure, how exactly does that work? In terms of the actual return itself, it is purely another format of the same thing we do now, so still requires all the other paperwork to be able to fill it out. So, no change of time there, except if we don't have to wait for a personal tax summary (maybe these could be online?)

The proposal suggests that any update an individual makes to their personal tax information (via Inland Revenue website) will be automatically passed to their employers payroll software and the said software will be able to calculate the correct deductions without the employer being aware of what the deductions are for. Sure the software can adjust the calculation of deductions but this would be done by setting specific flags and/or values for the employee so it would not be hidden from the employer (or the payroll clerk) at all. However, the fact the proposal does not directly address the issue defined does not mean it is not a good proposal. Allowing individuals full control of their tax information online is a great idea but it must contain the facility to send (with attachments) and receive secure communications. I do think that once a taxpayer has agreed to deal online with IR then ALL their communication should be in that space e.g. confirmation of changes, statements, reminders etc – assuming the IR site provides the ability for them to be able to download/print any of the communications i.e. they can print themselves a hard copy if they want to. While there will always be a segment of taxpayers who for whatever reason will not use this technology perhaps there could be an incentive for switching to on-line technology e.g. quicker refunds, guaranteed turnaround times on queries, extended payment time for terminal tax. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 2 Viferpilot As a sole trader I presently use a spreadsheet as my cash book (downloaded a elegant template found on the Internet that seems to canvass everything I need). But what if IRD provided an online cashbook type service instead. One that was just as easy to use i.e. one that was totally integrated with all tax/ACC obligations so that sorting out my bimonthly GST returns would be 'automated'. An assessment at year end would be much simpler / automated too perhaps? ( this year I guess I'm going to have to tweak my spreadsheet when GST changes ... whereas an IRD service would do it once/right for everyone using such a service ... surely, nationally, this would save a lot of collective energy / effort ). Surely the hassles of keeping records for 7 yrs etc would also get solved too? (assuming everything will be digital, and our digital identities will be secure and our records digitally archived correctly, etc) Currently I have to copy/paste stuff from my spreadsheet into IRD's online forms. Similarly, at the end of the year to do my tax return online. Then of course IRD insist that I keep a paper copy (signed) of all my returns etc. Lets get off the fence ... either we're going digital or we're not! ... lets move away from a halfway house. I imagine that the whole process could be seriously renovated ... at least for relatively straightforward folk like me who are happy to work online and happy to authorise IRD to pull together RWT, ACC, taxable Dividends, banking records (GST EFTPOS transactions etc), to help automate the tax reconciliation processes. Isn't this what networked computers are good for! And I don't care where in the cloud the processing is done, as long as everything is totally secure, totally private and totally within the sovereignty of NZ.

The consultation ran from 9 June to 23 July, and is now closed. The consultation website, and comments posted on it, can still be viewed, but no new comments can be added. The Government is evaluating the comments posted on the forum, and these comments will help to guide the Government in its approach to reforms to the tax administration system. We will put a link here to any announcements made about this project. This Government consultation forum is about improving the administration of the tax system and making it more certain and speedy for you to interact with Inland Revenue. The forum sets out a number of options for change to improve the current tax system and invites you to post your thoughts and comments. The Government’s economic vision for New Zealand includes a tax system that supports and strengthens economic growth. A key step to achieving this vision was the Government’s Budget 2010 which included a package of tax policy measures to re-balance the tax system. The next step is improving the administration of the tax system so that interaction with it is more certain and speedy for taxpayers. This includes increasing the use of electronic services by taxpayers when they are interacting with Inland Revenue. Some of the ideas set out in this consultation forum may take several years to implement. Implementation of the ideas will be based on the feedback we receive and the technology available. However, the ideas on this consultation forum all illustrate the broad direction that the Government is seeking for the administration of the tax system, so it supports the Government’s vision for economic growth.

What do you think about being able to access, receive confirmations, and amend your Inland The proposed changes to the administration of the tax system affect nearly all taxpayers. This consultation forum focuses on changes that will affect individuals, businesses and employers, the not-for-profit sector, and software developers. Key proposals for improving the tax administration are to: reduce the use of paper and increase the use of online services and technology; reform the PAYE and personal tax summary process, including the possible option of making PAYE a final tax for many taxpayers; and introduce a new framework for Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies, including consideration of appropriate safeguards of privacy. The details of the proposals for the identified groups are set out below. Individuals Self-management by individuals of most of their tax and social policy affairs through their own secure area in Inland Revenue’s website, much like internet banking. Individuals’ customer service experience would be faster and more certain. Use of better technology by employers to reduce errors in the PAYE system. The technology would be supported by Inland Revenue. A possible new approach to the taxation of individuals under which, for some, PAYE would be treated as a final tax. This approach would not apply to groups of taxpayers when the PAYE rules may give inaccurate outcomes. Taxpayers who receive additional income for example, from rents, will still square-up their non-wage and salary income at year–end. Discussion around Inland Revenue being more open with tax information to improve the efficiency across government by reducing the need for individuals to provide the same information multiple times. Privacy concerns will be an important consideration for the Government. Businesses, employers and the not for profit sector Software that takes care of routine processes. For example, PAYE compliance tasks such as the need to file an employer monthly schedule separately could be managed by software that automatically communicates with Inland Revenue. The software would have an option of providing information to Inland Revenue every pay-day. Inland Revenue would help employers get PAYE information right.

Inland Revenue would do this by providing information about employees’ PAYE obligations directly to a business’s payroll software, after appropriate validations. A move by businesses, employers and the not-for-profit sector to providing information electronically rather than by paper. The Government is raising for discussion whether mandating the use of electronic communication is acceptable and, if so, when. Businesses and not-for-profit organisations can expect better service from Inland Revenue as resources are freed up from checking errors and processing paper as a consequence of the proposals set out. Not for profit entities often have high staff turnover, so having software which manages more of the routine processes and supports better use of software will be of particular value. Software developers Inland Revenue would support software developers so they can develop and improve products for their clients. Inland Revenue is proposing strategic partnerships with these groups starting with payroll businesses. A key element to the proposals is that software developers would develop software that will be able to deal with routine tax compliance tasks, such as providing PAYE information directly into Inland Revenue systems without the need to access separate Inland Revenue systems. The Government is asking for views from software developers about how the strategic partnership to develop this software might work and what can be done to encourage employers to move from a paper to an electronic environment.

It is a long-term project, and some of these ideas may take several years to implement. The forum is being run on behalf of the Government by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue. Comments made, and votes recorded in this online consultation forum will be used to develop ideas about how to achieve the Government’s economic vision for New Zealand, deliver better services to taxpayers and greater value from the public service. If there is support for the proposals set out on this site, legislative change will be required to provide more flexibility around the PAYE rules, to allow Inland Revenue to share information more widely, to make PAYE a final tax for some, and to provide Inland Revenue the ability to mandate electronic filing by employers.

HomeOverviewIndividualsBusinesses & employersNon-profitSoftware developers Wayne Dobson Our payroll software already has the ability to manage employee deductions. Once loaded this saves a lot of time and hassle. It would be useful to expand this, perhaps by adding the ability to connect to I.R.D (securely from within the software) when loading a pay run to receive corrections or feedback (regarding this and the previous pay run) or to add the ability to confirm the correct use of tax codes such as WT and STC. This could save a lot of time, stress and penalty fees, knowing that I.R.D has confirmed the correct application before the run has been posted. This kind of connectivity would also be useful to send our ir-File directly from payroll. Results: Agree: 5 Disagree: 0 cheetah100 The following is the text of a patent application I made but never followed up after initial rejection. You are free to use this idea as you see fit: Background of the Invention New Zealand Income Tax laws present a substantial obligation and risk to small business employers. The obligation of preparing PAYE returns every month, the obligation of correctly calculating the amount of tax to deduct from employee wages, the risk of penalties should those tasks not be performed correctly, and the risks that insufficient funds are set aside to cover tax payments resulting in penalties and possibly criminal sanctions. For large companies these obligations and risks have dedicated staff to handle them. The staff are expert in the preparation of PAYE information and will have automated computer systems to help with the preparation of the information. Small business owners however often lack the expertise and experience and so can get into difficulties, running the very real risk of large penalties and possibly even criminal sanctions if the proper returns are not filed and the right amounts of income tax are not paid. This is a discouragement to small businesses employing new staff. The Government now has a system where employees need not file income tax returns every year if they earn no other income except as an employee. This has greatly simplified collection of revenue for the Government from employees, and reduced the burden of preparing tax returns for hundreds of thousands of employees.

Summary of the Invention The invention is a system in which a company uses a bank operated automated service to handle income tax reporting and payment. The benefits of the invention will be the automation of monthly returns to the Government and the automatic handling of payments going to employees. This eliminates the possibility of tax not being properly paid. This in turn will eliminate the need for financial or criminal penalties and thus reduce the risks to a small business. The invention will typically be implemented by the bank used by the company concerned. According to the first aspect of the invention a bank will allow a company to set up special automatic payments for its employees. In addition to the normal information collected for an automatic payment such as bank account number, amount to pay and pay period, the bank will also collect the IRD number of the employee, the tax code, student loan information, and other information related to the employee tax obligations. The second aspect of the invention is that the bank will deduct the gross pay from the employers account in the same way that it would for a normal automatic payment. The bank will then transfer the net pay into the employee account and deposit the tax deductions with the IRD in the name of the employer, as if the employer had paid the amount themselves. The third aspect of the invention is that the bank will prepare reports for the employer detailing payments to each employee in order for the company to maintain their own record of pay and to provide deduction information to employees. The bank may also provide information to the employees directly in the form of a \[electronic\] payslip.

I even note that the dates at the head of each group of subjects (presumably embedded there by the organisers of this forum), are all for the year 2012. If presumed intelligent computer operators cannot get the facts right, what hope is there for the less competent of us? During my working years, the comment was often made about computer operations, that 'garbage in, garbage out'. This is still true today, and I wonder how long it will take for a compulsory computer system of taxation to grind to a dead stop, caused by a gridlock of faulty data input from thousands of untrained operators. For most of us we need to have confidence that the end result will be correct, and will be achieved with a minimum of effort and cost to each of us. We certainly do not wish to have more confusion as the end product. I am not certain at this time that IRD have a positive vote of confidence from taxpayers concerning this matter.

In theory I object to the idea of mandatory electronic filing but am presently at no risk of speaking out against it. The IRD have just had a conference with software developers and it is quite likely (I had to pull out so can't say for sure) there were organisations there lobbying for mandatory electronic filing. Chances are they will go ahead with it. The good news is that you will have no problems achieving this without ongoing costs even if you don't want to use a 3rd party service - you can always use the IRD's online tools which I'm sure they will eventually redesign and make more intuitive (website = great - online tools = terrible) Results: Agree: 8 Disagree: 1 clare hewitt the question is about electronic filing for ALL tax payers.

There would have to be a massive change in IRD's attitude & competency in use of electronic mediums before I would be comfortable in giving too much inofrmation to them on line.

Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 flea In principle I agree that all businesses should have to use electronic filing. However I don't think business should be forced to purchase software to get the ability to file electronically. My company only has 2 employees, both of which are on salary so the monthly pay is really simple and I don't need to have software to work out any of it or track holidays etc. I just keep it a spreadsheet however I do file the paye and gst return electronically using the IR's online forms. I don't want to have to use payroll software. I am quite capable of working out the deductions correctly and unless the software gave me the benefit of being able to do the employee's banking transactions for me (as quickly and cheaply as I can already do them via internet banking) or being able to set up the banking transaction to pay IR then I see absolutely no benefit in using a software package. As I do all the company's banking electronically, I would love my internet banking system to track some of this information. For example, let me setup my employee's details e.g. their salary & deductions, and their bank account number. Then each month when I pay them, I call up the employee, check (and if necessary edit their pay details), press GO and have the bank's software create the payment to the employee, file the necessary information with IR and set up a future dated payment to IR for the paye – all done! I'd even be prepared to pay the bank a reasonable fee for this service. Alternatively, if the banks were prepared to play ball with IR, then IR could set up online a really simple pay sheet system. Login to IR, call up your employees, make any changes required, press GO, it calculates the deductions & net pay, connects to Would it be acceptable to make electronic filing mandatory for all taxpayers? | Making tax easier http://makingtaxeasier.ird.govt.nz/...sinesses-employers/would-it-be-acceptable-make-electronic-filing-mandatory-all-taxpayers@page=1.html\[24/10/2013 11:02:53\] Thu, 08/07/2010 - 16:27#18 Thu, 08/07/2010 - 18:07 #19 Thu, 08/07/2010 - 20:36 #20 « first ‹ previous 1 2 3 next › last » About this site Discussion document General tax questions Conditions of use Contact us Your privacy Keep up to date RSS feeds View the list For more information on government services go to your bank and sets up the employee payments & the future dated paye payment (all in a pending state).

Stuart Bale I work with Acclipse, who provide Income Tax preparation and management software to NZ Tax Agents. Part of Acclipse Tax retrieves 'statement' data for tax entities from the IRD Portal that Tax Agents regularly use. Those tax agents using Acclipse Tax find this a big time saver and convenience, as the information they need is at their finger tips, and we are able to integrate the data directly into their workflow. There would be some distinct benefits if this data was accessible in a more efficient method than we are using today, such as a web service. Stuart Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 flea My company would have no issue with developing software that provides increased tax functionality and being able to communicate directly with IRD. However we do have concerns regarding where the liability would lie if incorrect tax information ends up being filed with IRD. There is always a fine line between providing software that meets legislative requirements while providing enough flexibility for the employer to be able to manage their own employees - currently the employer accepts they are ultimately liable for the information provided to IRD. If by providing more tax functionality in the software, the employer becomes unable to control or override the information, they will surely then expect the liability to lie with the software developer but as a developer we would not be comfortable with taking on the liability of any employer that uses our software.

Why can't our eftpos cards contain a memory chip that stores transaction data ie the receipts. The data could be uploaded and sorted by your computer. You could know how much tax you need to put away in real time, no more faded receipts from sitting in the car on a hot day, no more paying $60 an hour to have the accountants secretary sort through things - The benefits are on going and I believe a system like it is inevitable.

Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 1 100000596760411... We have successfully been developing complex tax functionality into our software for many years. As mentioned earlier there are risks, however these are manageable. As Stuart has said the missing link is the ability to allow these applications to interact with the information on the IR data stores. Some kind of quality control over tax logic is required so providing developers with test data sets and certification is a good idea.

Providing a website users can log into and enter / update information will allow people to do what they do now via another medium. It will be more efficient for both parties and I am a strong supporter of it. However what could revolutionise the way individuals deal with the IR is to move these communications behind the scenes. There is a small (but growing) segment of the community that currently use software to manage their personal finances.

What about an option of an annotated help system that people could turn on, offering explanations for different steps? Even with a paper system, there are individuals such as people with disabilities, who require assistance to do their returns. I think the same group of people who have accounts do their tax work would probably continue to do so, maybe there could be a seperate log-on which would be for an authorised accountant to access? Perhaps there would be groups of people who would qualify for an accountant to deal with online accounts in the same way they would deal with the paper accounts? I know that using an accountant is somehow factored in to tax. Like any website, speed can be an issue without broadband, but waiting weeks for a piece of paper, versus waiting 10 minutes for a page to load, I know which one I would prefer.

I would very much like it if my summary of earnings from IRD included all the income from these sources, and indeed computed my likely refund or tax to pay, given that my summary of earnings represents my total earnings. Then all I would need to do is confirm that, and filling in my tax form would be trivial. Admittedly such a system would not cope with people with overseas shares, but perhaps eventually it would be possible to include shares from the most obvious country, namely Australia.

Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 2 Midge If you have a joint bank account or a personal bank account and do not supply your IRD number to your bank then they will tax you at the highest rate. If you supply your IRD number then you can choose which rate you expect to be taxed at for the year on your Interest. But this is still irrelevant because once you do your tax return at the end of the year.. all your interest income and tax already paid on that interest is included so if you pay too much you will get it back in the refund anyway. If you have a joint bank account then the interest and tax credits are split between the both of you 50/50 and again this will be balanced off in your tax return. Your question - How are people going to get a refund if too much tax is deducted? That is the main reason people get a refund.... because they have had too much tax deducted throughout the year. (unless they are eligible for a tax rebate of course) Same thing goes with Dividends and Imputation credits.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. jethrocarr As the manager of a young software development company I would very much like to see a documented API based off an open standard (eg SOAP, REST, XML) which is avaliable to any company to use for communiticating with IRD. New Zealand has companies ranging from large corporates developing accounting packages down to small one or two people development houses working on ecommerce systems and lightweight accounts applications. It is important to be fair to both types of companies, making the API available to any company along with public documentation is the best way to do this. From what I can tell so far reading this website, it seems that this is the way that IRD is planning to proceed, if so, then it sounds fantastic and I look forwards to seeing how this progresses. -- Jethro Carr ( jethro.carr@amberdms.com) Results: Agree: 13 Disagree: 0 barnaclebarnes I agree with Jethro. We need access to the systems via easy to use (RESTful web services please) interfaces. IRD should not partner with large software providers exclusively as a first step as their needs will vary from some of the smaller players. The services should: RESTful Web Services The services should support REST based interfaces. REST has won the web API wars and is the easiest for people to pick up.

Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 3 barnaclebarnes Sandbox There should be a sand boxed environment for testing that is open for developers to use. The 3am Test The API/service (at least the sandbox) should be available to start using at any time with no authorisation. In this way developers can get started on their own, develop their software and do all of the testing without having to talk to anyone. The more barriers you put up the less innovative services will appear. Documentation Good documentation with code examples in a number of languages (C#, Ruby, PHP, Python) is a must. Providing libraries that can be downloaded, are open source and hosted in shared environment such as Github will really help drive the developer ecosystem forward. And if you want decent comments allow more that 1000 characters ;-) Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 2 matthewhaigh I agree with the sentiment here - good observations guys - lets have an API - hopefully RESTful with authentication using OAuth or something similar. I would like to understand how the igovt identification service could be used with this service. I note some disagreement from the existing comments - if you disagree with this - would really like to hear your opinion - what are we missing from this discussion? Noting the moves of the Australian Government about Standard Business Reporting (SBR) - of which NZ has signed up too - I assume that the XBRL mechanism will be implemented - to allow filing of returns and other information to a 'government gateway'. If this was the case - I would like to see some information on the data representation - not just the DTD - but how the IRD and government agencies will like to see this information represented and interpreted.

The most successful web 2.0 platforms provide a powerful API that allows developers to intergrate third party applications and extend the base platforms in ways the creators never imagined.

Let’s make these dreams possible! 2)Change management for your customers . Much of the population will embrace this change, ensure the ones that don’t are given enough attention.

We want to access several government systems and pull data in via API's. Ideally we would use standards such as oAuth to let users authenticate and give access to various data.

The tax compliance side of payroll is relatively easy compared to the Holiday Act requirements and therefore unless a small employer requires software to assist them with the holiday side of things why would they bother paying for payroll software when they can manage a couple of employees very easily manually (using printed tax tables or IRD calculators) and still file their EMS electronically. So while I am sure employers who already use payroll software would appreciate their software having enhanced tax compliance functionality (i.e. direct access to IRD) I doubt very much that that this type of enhanced functionality would create any significant new market for developers. There is possibly a small potential market for a developer to provide very simplistic "tax only" type software (i.e. not doing any holiday tracking etc) but unless the cost of this was tiny why would any small employer bother. In regard to general accounting software and tax compliance there are a few possible enhancements around GST, FBT, Prov Tax filing etc but again this would be popular with existing software users but would probably not really entice a new market.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. portia What is meant by small? Apart from very small refunds - perhaps $10 - if a person can be bothered going through the hoops that it takes to get a refund, Inland Revenue should be obliged to make it, especially if it is all going to be done on-line in the future. Results: Agree: 33 Disagree: 2 Taxpayer92 If a taxpayer is going to provide a bank account number, then the IRD should make a payment. Yes, make cheques by mail subject to a minimum amount. Results: Agree: 21 Disagree: 1 Bea They should not collect debts that are less than the cost of collecting them. They should, however, issue refunds when requested. That money is owed to the taxpayer and is not the government's to keep. Cheques by mail should not be subject to a minimum amount. A taxpayer should not be required to give the IRD their bank account number in order to extract a refund out of them - they should be entitled to keep their bank account number private from the Inland Revenue. IRD has powers to dip into people's bank accounts for various reasons under tax legislation - taxpayers should not be forced to allow IRD to build up a database of their private bank account numbers that IRD can then use in the future.

I personally wouldnt ask for a cheque but until they are no longer supported by the banking system, then IRD should still issue a cheque if requested - but maybe that takes a little longer as a disincentive. IRD should look at different turn around times for different types of customer If I file online, on time, supply all the required information and provide a bank account then I want my money in 2-3 days If I file on paper, maybe its 2-3 weeks. If I ask for a cheque maybe I need to wait another 2-3 weeks. I think most people would opt for the bank account direct deposit option if they could be given faster turn around times. This is how its done in Australia. Results: Agree: 14 Disagree: 2 Kim No. Firstly you need to define what 'small' is. You maybe talking about anything up to $200+. Also you say that the improved system will ensure that there is no error between PAYE and business software - this is difficult to believe. There are myriads of ways to qualify for a tax refund and everyone so have the right to be able to check they have paid the correct amount of tax and claim a refund if needed. This is simply IRD trying to cut down their workload of which I imagine a far bit consists of people filing for Personal Tax Summaries at the end of the financial year. Move it to online to increase efficiencies but don't take away our right to check we've paid the correct amount of tax. Results: Agree: 18 Disagree: 1 hbblue I am proof that business software dose not always calculate PAYE correctly, last year I had a bill from IRD for $911.50, this year I am preparing for another $700- $750. We can not controll how much tax our employer takes each week, but if that is short at the end of the year IRD expect us to pay the short fall. Maybe if the empolyer was responceable for the short fall they would keep better track of, 1 What an employee had earnt 2 How much tax had been paid 3 How much tax should have been paid Results: Agree: 4 Disagree: 5 Hughmama Actually the way tax works is it is a yearly square-up. Software can only approximate how much tax should be deducted each week/pay in order to get to as close as possible to the amount as calculated over a year. Unless you are being paid an unchanging amount every pay over the year they will invariably estimate incorrectly, as will the IRD online tools when used for weekly tax estimations.

Wait a minute but you might have some tax on interest received from a bank (if your lucky).... oh boy this is already getting complicated. Simplification of the tax structure should go hand in hand with these changes. For example why not just charge a standard 15% on any interest received from a bank if your expected income was less than $50,000 pa and 25% if your income is expected to be higher.

Not happy. Results: Agree: 3 Disagree: 0 hbblue Over the past 3-4 years I have had to deal with 2 IRD departments, 1 for tax and 1 for child support. As the pay-roll system my employer uses seems to be failing for my income, which is affected by verying hours as I work on a call-out situation, for the past 2 years I have been landed with tax short falls of approx. $1,000 year. Money I now have to try to pay. How can I, or IRD, ensure that this dose not happen in the future. After all I can not controll how much my employer taxs my income each week, and if this is short at the end of the year I now have to find it. As for having to deal with Child Support as well, it is very stressful as they are not interested that I am trying to pay $1,000 back for tax as well as $900 a month to them. I feel that there needs to be some consideration when the average worker is landed with such large bills to 1 Govt. department while trying to pay another. IRD has the job of gathering money from the workers of N.Z. to sustain our Welfare State, but should this be done by adding stress to the workers who are the main sorce of that income.

Zero-rating means that GST is charged at zero-percent. Girl – “Ok. I’m under the registration threshold at the moment, will those suppliers count and mean that I may need to register. Call Centre Operator – “Those suppliers are still considered as turnover regardless of being zero rated. If your turnover is over $60,000 dollars in a 12 month period then you must register, however you may wish to consider voluntary registration if your turnover is below $60,000 dollars”. Girl – “I think Australia has different GST rules to us - can you tell me about Australian GST”. Call Centre Operator - You can find information on Australian GST by going to www.gststartup.gov.au. You may also find the customs website helpful at www.customs.govt.nz “ Girl – “Oh ok, I see, thanks for that”. Girl hangs up the phone looking confused. “Later that day” flicks onto the screen Screen then shows girl reading through a printed document and looking confused. She then calls a number on the telephone. A message is received: “I’m sorry you have called outside the operating hours”. Girl puts it down quickly looking annoyed. She goes back to computer and clicks into the IRD website again. Girl looks confused, sighs, puts head in hand. TOMORROWS WORLD flashes onto the screen Introduction Scene starts showing the girls pencil sketches in a folder followed by a page of the Molly’s costings, shipping costs, suppliers, marketing, legal stuff and tax on another page which she has written. Scene then shows Molly sitting at her desk looking through these documents. She then moves left to her laptop on the table and starts typing. She is on the IRD “GST” web page, types in search of “I want to sell products in Australia" 4 links appear and Molly clicks on "Information about GST for goods exported to Australia" The text box appears with two options asking you need to register or, if you would like to find out more information on GST. Scene then shows Molly writing on her pad looking pleased. Molly clicks on "Register for GST" The Gst registration is updating and processing online, Molly smiles as it flicks back to the computer to show she has been registered. Scene shows Molly smiley and happy that it is so easy. The next scene she is sitting at her desk in front of her open laptop, writing notes, nods with happy smiley face typing at her laptop. “A few days later” flashes onto the screen. Molly is sitting at laptop at desk in a different dress, typing and moving the mouse. Suddenly she screams and jumps out of her chair. She calls a number on the telephone beside her. Person at other end (Mum) answers “Hello Wendy speaking” Back to scene of Molly at desk on telephone saying “Guess who just scored their first international contract” Mum – “Molly, that’s fantastic love” Molly - “they said they loved my designs, they said I was really professional and thorough and they appreciated how quickly I got back to them.” Mum – “I knew you could do it. I guess this means you need to hire someone in to help fill the order in a hurry”. Molly – “that’s the next thing I need to get onto I suppose. Hiring someone. The deadline is really tight, I had better start getting an advert together. Talk to you later. Okay”. Mum – “Okay love, see you later”. Molly puts down the telephone.

I have a preference for online forms and submissions. I do not want to see IRD cutting off telephone services though. There is always the odd-ball issue that will come up and therefore will need further clarification. Plus, it can be quite frustrating going through the website looking for 'specific' information...especially when the website is not user-friendly and full of bling bling (flashy icons) in your face. Results: Agree: 8 Disagree: 1 Brian. Phone contact with IRD is essential for us to get 'immediate' response to problems or queries.

As the call centre people are alot of the time are reading from scripts, perhaps some of the load of the call centres could be split to robots that ask questions and get responses by way of keybord input and screen. The call centres will still be required when the scripts don't quite met the questions being asked. Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 4 GWY\_Trusts Many non-profit organisations require two signatories for 'all' transactions. The Charities Commission recognises this in requiring specific acknowledgement that on- line annual returns are being made with prior approval. The 'two signatories' rule makes operation of on-line bank accounts impossible. Further, electronic records are subject to corruption and machine failure making hard copies necessary for both audit and long-term storage purposes. Results: Agree: 11 Disagree: 3 admini The two signatories rule does NOT make operation of on-line bank account impossible. I am Treasurer for TWO non-profits where any TWO of several signatories are required to authorise ALL payments and both Westpac & ANZ both offer services to cater for this. BTW Westpac was by far the most simple to set up and user friendly to operate. ANZ took weeks to arrange. Results: Agree: 3 Disagree: 0 Mozee1 For good accounting practices, governance and transparency, it is critical that two signatories are required. It comes down to how the organisation sets up their authority rules and how accessible the authorisers/creators are in processing payments etc. Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 2 ronpen While it may be possible to set up the service to have two signatories operate the on-line system, the fact remains that for many not-for-profit organisations, the signatories often do not live in the same town or city. Getting any two of them together to operate the on-line system is therefore probably more difficult than using the present manual system. Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 0 Litterarum I agree that the use of online banking for two signatories is possible for businesses, but not always viable for not-for-profits. I am a treasurer of a very small not-for-profit, and the fees that would be charged by our bank for changing across to a business account (which they require to do two signatures online), and additional fees for operating an online banking verification system are simply not worth while for our size of organisation.

If it beats talking to a computer and cutting down the wait time on the phone then I'm all for it. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 1 ronpen I do not think that this would be a good idea, as it would probably be a chat line between taxpayers, as I do not expect that IRD will have operators waiting at monitors to join in at all times. It is also likely that the chances of having another taxpayer on line who could comment on any particular problem at a given time would be extremely very small. In other words it would be just as frustrating as the present telephone system.

Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 0 fannington So let me get this straight. IRD is going to work with software developers so that we have to access our files via our accounting program. What that means, of course, is that everyone will have to buy a new version of their accounting program just to comply with government edicts. Good scam for the software people. I only wish this would mean MYOB would work better and be more intiutive. My experience with MYOB is that they certainly won't get it right (or make it easy) in the first several versions. But then again, they're all about selling users "essential" up-dates, aren't they.

LikeSign Up to see what your friends like. Hughmama Well I was one of the design team working on this issue (more specifically EMS) in 2007/2008 for IRD. It was clear then that people are comfortable with their current systems, be they informal paper based or fragmented electronic. Change requires a good deal of attention and self control. Moving from something that you need pay virtually no attention to while doing it - kind of muscle memory - to something that you have to apply great scrutiny to in order to ensure compliance within your context - until it also becomes "safe" is not something people will just wake up and decide to do. If it's the IRD that wants to provide the incentive for this change they are going to have to pay generously, whether that be financially or otherwise. In all honesty the IRD have little chance at figuring this one out themselves. Fortunately I think others will find reason and means to do it for them. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 0 100001082712603... I really like this idea of employee self management. However, I don't like the idea of having to purchase "integrated software". If the bulk of employee information is due to be stored in the IRD system, then the IRD should provide the few remaining tools to calculate the pay run... e.g. 1 - Employer enters gross pays. 2 - IRD calculates deductions and kiwisaver contributions and produces a direct credit schedule to the employer.

Even better if - if the IRD could collect details regarding sick days, holidays, stats, etc, and provide a clear report to employees and employers on their current status, allowance and legal obligations. Thus being a fair and impartial record. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 100001082712603... The IRD could automatically email employees their pay slips (or a monthly summary), and correctly adjust tax rates for employees with multiple jobs, so that it is clear what an employees total tax is on a total income from multiple jobs. With the IRD maintaining the relationship between the employer and employee, there would be greater participation by all individuals, and complete transparency of the way the system works. The IRD should also take care of garnishing employees wages for court fines also, and all communications regarding that, again so that an employees circumstances remain private, and the employers admin time is reduced. Thank you for the opportunity to have a say. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 0 cansoc It would be helpful when entering EMS data online if there was an option to select employees alphabetically instead of only by IRD number, as this is the way our payroll software (MYOB EXO Employer Services) prints out the report. Yes, it would be good to have the report downloaded directly into IRD's website so we don't have to double handle it. Results: Agree: 0 Disagree: 0 NRGIZE The IRD will have to improve their systems so that they work as well as Excel does in tracking payroll, deductions and vacation and sick days. Have a look at Westpac's banking site to see how easy it is to make a payment to the IRD and then compare it to how complicated it is to fill out the IRD PAYE form online. IRD is slow and complicated. Westpac has all the information on one page and proof on payment prints on one page.

After spending signficant funds on software to go electronic I now find my self printing more documents for client approval as the majority of my clients are not online or need further skills to be internet sucessful (boomers and X). Those costs are significant and while some overhead has been absorbed by me, the client is paying for the digital divide. This is producing compliance cost increases. My practice relied on IRD statements to confirm to the client that IRD has there information, now these will be produced by me.

They would therefore have a common date for PAYE and GST as opposed to different dates currently. Such a facility would ease cash flow for SMEs like us and, probably to a small extent, the Government. Company tax would be a little more problematic due to fluctuations in income and expenses: I would prefer this to be an annual return based on the results for the whole year. The reduction in forms would be of marginal benefit and I would still like the option of printing a return as a more permanent record.

Tax compliance, Kiwsaver, Holidays Act compliance, student loans, child support, allowances, and the list goes on, are a minefield to navigate in this day and age.

For this reason we prefer not to use online software such as Smartpayroll, to manage or complete this process for our business. I also have to complete all of our accounting reconciliations at year end for audit so I like to know what's actually happened and not find errors or whatever 6 months down the track. Our business uses IMS payroll software to manage the payroll process, which takes care of all the tax deduction calculations, kiwisaver, all types of leave calculations etc, as long as everything is set up correctly to start with. This system creates electronic files for simply uploading online at the IRD website. There is still the option to manually edit these files if necessary. We use Moneyworks Gold (yes we love Macs!) accounting software. Again, GST compliance is simple and we now use the online GST form to submit to IRD rather than the paper form. These processes for us are quick and easy, whilst still maintaining a level of control over the process. I think IRD have done a great job at getting their online services up and running and coming up with improvements. Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 8 GR1952 As a tax agent we use SmartPayroll. Once set up, it is a breeze. It is web based. They deduct 100% of the payroll each pay period, pass on the payment to the IRD when due & take care of all the forms. The cost each month is minimal. We take about an average of 10 mins per week to administer each payroll we oversee. SmartPayroll do have direct customers. Their phone number is 0800 10 10 38 or website www.smartpayroll.co.nz .

If you bank provides accounts for businesses, they will have this capability as nearly every business requires two signatories for cheques. We now use ASB's Fastnet Business. I am on a board of a couple of other not-for-profits and when the branch from different bank said they couldn't do online banking for two signatories, I suggested we move to a bank that could provide the service. Very quickly the problem of resolved and we were offered an account suitable for our requirements. Depending on which bank you are with, you may need to pay a small monthly fee but it is covered in the savings made in not using cheques. Results: Agree: 7 Disagree: 0 746598114@facebook We use online systems for Payroll and Accounting. PAYE is easy but GST is a manual process as although we can file on line, we can't integrate it with Xero. So it would be good to have the same upload capability for our GST. Also, why can't the IRD deal electronically with other Government departments to supply information, particularly the Department of Statistics when relating to payroll. There is no need for them to post us paper based forms to fill in about wages and hours worked when this information can be supplied electronically through the payroll system.

I was very disappointed in how unfairly IRD handled my query. Given that I was on the standard option for provisional tax and tried to follow all the rules in the documents I had, I was still penalized by $3500 interest and having to pay $30000 before the official due date to stop paying ridiculous interest rates. I am now working in a project environment where a lot of my collogues are also independent contractors. When I discussed it in the group how badly I was treated by IRD, I found out that I am not the only one that has stepped into the trap. I suggest that IRD review the approach to the Second year of operation for provisional tax calculation methods and communications to small business and the self employed. It is an untold trap I will not easily forgive the IRD for. Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 2 Ctasnz I agree.

The provisional tax system is a dog, which is probably being a bit hash on our for legged fiends, obviously designed by some malevolent accountant it is time it was made simpler and more business friendly. eg give business an option of making regular monthly or bimonthly payments based on pevious years income and a balance amount when the tax return is completed, An option of revisiting with the IRD the scheduled payment if annual income has significantly changed. Would it hurt for IRD to send an auto email reminder if payment has been missed with a 48hr grace period to pay, most of us are able to pay tax online so a red hot reminder that penalty interest will kick in would see a high percentage of payment and a significant reduction in angry taxpayer phone feedback.

Deitrich von Stade Is it the amount thats important or is it that the customer is defaulting and not making any attempt to sort their debt out. In terms of being able to report to credit reports maybe it needs to be for amounts that are significant, or several years overdue? Id hate to think theyd report me if I was 2 weeks late on a small income tax bill. Shouldnt IRD also be looking for other ways to recover outstanding debts? Putting a debt recovery charge on top of PAYE deductions would be a way to achieve this. Dont know if this is actually done/common practice now? Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 3 Bea I strongly disagree with this proposal. IRD already has a penalties regime to discourage late payment. There is also the frequent circumstance where in a family business, there is a credit in one taxpayer and a debt in another, or a credit in one period and a debt in another or a credit in one tax type and a debt in another and they have yet to be offset against each other. IRD would be disclosing the debts to credit reporters when no net debt exists. If lenders who use credit reporters wish for assurance that there is no tax debt, they are perfectly able to seek proof from the borrower such as a letter from a chartered accountant or a printout of tax balances.

Privacy is such a delicate issue and there are a myriad of situations such as those mentioned above, which are hard to quantify. If it is up to the individual to disclose IRD debts when applying for credit, some people would choose to withold this information, so making it available would protect lenders from these potential liabilities. With the increase in online data being shared, privacy is an ongoing issue that should be open for serious public debates, especially in these cases. I do think that IRD debts should affect individual's credit ratings, the same as for any seriously overdue amount that gets sent to Veda Advantage for example. That way, creditors get a full picture and are then able to make an informed decision. I think it would depend on the total debt, length of debt etc. the same as for debts that currently get sent to collection agencies. There is no reason why IRD debts should be excluded from this. They should definitely be included somehow. What else are they talking about sharing? This is only one example. I would like to know please in plain bullet points what exactly they propose to share and to whom, thanks. It seems a bit vague to me right now. At the moment it sounds like the opposite of a secrecy rule! Back to the point at hand, I think the same lengths of time and amounts as what are dealt with by Veda for other debts should apply to IRD, maybe there is a standard? They must have some sort of scale, or is it purely done by timeframe? Creditors should be entitled to a full picture of applicants liabilities, regardless of dollar amount. If other debts have to be verified, why shouldn't IRD debts? Many individuals in this country spend outside their means. The subprime mortgage crisis in the US was a reminder that there needs to be safeguards in place. This particular disclosure would save a lot of people a lot of heartache, but what other information and to whom are you proposing is shared?....thank-you. I can't agree to something unless I know what it is. Results: Agree: 6 Disagree: 2 Andrew Elphick There are alot of reasons why someone does to not furnish a return on time just as there are vaid reasons to issue default assessments to encourage filing of the returns. I wonder what percentage of IRD debt is default assessments. Would be fair that given all the circumstances are not avaialbale that IRD be given the opportunity to destroy credit ratings on a default assessment? In addition a crystalised debt may have hardship will the credit report destroy a persons rating after the write off by hardship? Will CSA debt which is at an all time high be added and hence reduce any chance at all of lending money to repay the debt? Are you advocating that if you don't pay your tax your credit rating wll be destroyed and hence it is better to go no assets procedure or bankrupt, after all there is nothing more to lose! Hasn't IRD social responsibilities?mmm Results: Agree: 5 Disagree: 2 NoName I think if that person hasn't done anything to sort out a debt they've got with ANYONE - let alone IRD - then IRD hsould be able to do anything/everything they can. I pay my taxes why shouldn't everyone else. But this should only be allowed when a significant length of time has gone past, and if the income tax return or GST return or whatever has actually been done. And only by an actual person at IRD - some things must be done automatically and get stuffed up when that happens. But then IRD can already go to someone's boss and take the money out of their wages - your credit card can't, so giving you a bad credit rating is the only thing they can do.

Last year the select commitee was taking submissions for changes to Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration Act) 1986, for varied reasons including that Veda Advantage was data mining the motor vehicle register to sell the infromation to companies for direct marketing purposes. The first I was aware of this was when I received an offer from Cigna for a life insurance and they used my first name. This raised warning bells as I always go by my middle name which is Michael. I contacted them and found out they had obtained my details from Land Transport Motor Vehicle Registry via Veda. I also received an offer for a pre approved charge card from American Express in a similar fashion. A few years ago I also discovered how easy it is to screw up someones credit rating, again it was Veda Advantage involved (Known as Baycorp then). All the perpretrator has to do was make up a phony invoice with my company's name on it, and send it to Veda with the correct phone number but fake address, and presto - screwed credit rating I had engage a lawyer to threaten them with legal action. Ironically Veda were also pursuing the perpetrator's business for $100k. I recived a phone call from Veda, I strongly denied the debt, and that was the last I heard so I thought the matter was finished. Unfortunately I hadn't replied to their letter (I didn't recieve it) and they did what they did, no proof whatsoever required for the phony 'debt'. In short while credit rating agencies may serve a useful purpose to commerce but they are also a law on to themselves and they are not to be trusted. My Mother's last law job in law was working in the legal side of debt collection. She also told me about Baycorp and co's cowboy antics. It will be a big mistake for the IRD to give them or any of their ilk any implied credibility.

First of all, I must congratulate IRD for taking the initiative of creating this site and exploring new ways to making tax issues easier! \*Big round of applause to you all\* I'm a campaigner of Disability issues. I found this site through Facebook. When I visited the video section I was stunned to see lingual-segregation in practice. What is lingual-segregation? It is the action of seperating forms of language (visual, spoken, written). The use of video's is fantastic - how it's been done is not. I noticed there was a transcript below the video. If there is a transcript - then what purpose does the video serve? I highly recommend that the video has open captions inserted. There are 239,000 New Zealanders over the age of 15 with a form of hearing loss who require assistance to fully participate in normal activities. Assistance such as /subtitles captions and NZ Sign Language (NZSL is an official language of NZ). NZ has also adopted the NZ Disability Stragety. To date, no where on this site recognises either of the official languages, disability stragety or recognises NZ's signatory of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 1 in 5 New Zealanders have a Disability. If you do the maths, almost under 1 million citizens of NZ are being barriered. Yet, they pay tax... I would like to request the site admins to look into this to make information and discussions more accessible to these 1 in 5.To resolve the site accessibility, I recommend that the admins contact Jan Scown from Office for Disability Issues. ODI has done alot of work over the years to making government departments accessible. My concerns are valid as the disability community pays alot of tax, yet full access to tax matters in not provided. For years I've had lots of problems understanding IRD forms etc as I'm limited in communication face to face due to being Deaf. Please make IRD accessible to all. Thank you Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 0 Forum admin Kim, thanks for your feedback.

The main purpose of the transcripts was to provide access to the video content for visually impaired people who rely on screen readers, although the transcripts also provide an alternative for those with hearing loss. However, your point about lingual separation and providing captions on the videos themselves is a good one, and we will aim to implement that when we next launch a site which uses videos.

Single income families should be able to split the income across the couple. This is only fair, if the partner that isnt earning isnt able to claim any kind of benefit because they are treated as a couple. My family would be much better off if we were divorced.

Recent experience when dealing with CODES calculated by IRD based on monthly employer returns and notified to the employer for mandatory application resulting in significant overpayment suggests that IRD systems take no account of changed circumstances and the stage in the Tax Year in which they occur . The case in point related to a young entrant to full time employment in January 2010. Income to that point was minimal (under $9,000). After the first month of Full Time employment and the employers return to IRD this seemingly was interpreted by what appears to be a computerised function to represent Annual Income of $30,000. The mandatory change advised to the employer resulted in an over deduction of a significant three figure sum which has now been refunded, but the proposal to make deductions final would have precluded that. IRD procedures for dealing with approaches to report changed circumstances are also flawed. Their letter to the employer based upon a false assumption must be acted upon by the employer. The onus to correct falls upon the employee who must present another declaration.

One of the basic principles of the privacy act is that no inofrmation is held under a common unique identifier. This would be necessary to enable this kind of sharing. If other government agencies need to see my data they can put in an official request and then the IRD would have to follow the principles of the Privacy Act to supply that information. The more automated sharing of data is allowed, the more margin for error exists. Also the more information that is held in one place about someone, the greater the exposure to possible identity theft by anyone who obtained unlawful access to that information.

Filling out a paper based form gives me certainty and I can double check that I have put all the figures in the right place. Mistakes made on a paper form are easily rectified - I rub figures out and write in the correct figures.

Without deadlines nothing happens and while it might initially cause negative feedback it will become accepted – a bit like analogue TV being turned off and lots of people having to go out and buy new TVs. During the transition period the IR should work with private sector to come up with a "kiosk type" business module which will provide terminals for taxpayers to use and also have relevant expertise available to help people (could be just a direct phone line back to IRD?). A small fee could be charged for this service (so the provider can cover their costs) and the taxpayer should get a tax rebate for making use of the service (so the tax payer is not out of pocket, maybe even give them a bonus rebate for be brave enough to try it!). The kiosks could be anywhere in the community e.g. a local store, an accountants office, bank, library etc - basically anywhere that a business is prepared to offer the service from. The kiosk would obviously have to be secure and only allow access to IR (unlike internet cafes or libraries where they can connect to anywhere and get infected with key loggers etc). It could perhaps even be franchise type business? There would obviously need to be a huge effort put into public awareness and maybe even some sort of travelling road show to show people how the kiosks works and what the benefits are etc. The kiosk would be great even for those with their own internet access that are temporarily away from home/office?

If I'm understanding this correctly, any loss I make wouldn't be claimable against my salary which would mean I would have to sell the house as I could no longer afford it. My tennant has lived there for ten years. They can't afford to buy a home of their own as their income is even lower than mine. Having one rental property is part of my retirement fund. Im not a professional property developer, nor am I a slum lord with dozens and dozens of houses and apartments. This would be reason enough to move to Australia where I can still make this kind of lifestyle and financial choice.

Results: Agree: 1 Disagree: 3 portia The ability to claim back a refund should not be based on the time worked, but the amount of the refund. Many people, especially beneficiaries work intermittently and this proposal could deny these people - those who need every dollar they can get - their refund. Results: Agree: 10 Disagree: 2 Jim I strongly disagree that PAYE should be a final tax. Working less during the year while taxing at a full year rate will punish anyone over the month threshold discussed. Sure, IRD wants to reduce its compliance costs and to hold onto small refunds that have high marginal costs for refunding. In my opinion, that's tough. We work to earn a living, and that is money we earned. Keeping more than the absolute calculated correct amount is both lazy and immoral. It is up to IRD to design systems that make their job easier at their own end, without penalising the hard working public. If you want to collect as much tax as possible, fine. But it is not a one way street. We have burdens to bear to comply with your tax law, you have a burden to make sure we can get back as much benefit as we can. If we have refunds available, we should be able to claim them, end of story. So to answer the question, everyone should be able to file an income tax return. If you have small amounts due from us, and the cost benefit of you collecting them is not worth your trouble, then that is your call, not ours. $50 might not mean anything to such a huge organisation, but it will buy shoes for the kids, food, or at least some benefit in our lives. Such a move would only provide benefit to IRD, not the public who, believe it or not, you are here to serve. Results: Agree: 28 Disagree: 6 760357388@facebook It's not 'their' tax law.

If you had any other form of income, or earned more than $200,000 in one year, you were required to file. There are some more details which I can't recall, but rather than taking away the ability to file, why not take away the requirement? That way you will not be making people give up on a potential refund, remove paperwork for a lot of people, and free up some precious time for IRD employees to help those with real problems. Probably you'll get a lot of people with part time work or irregular employment leaving money in the system also. Added bonus for the govt coffers! Results: Agree: 9 Disagree: 1 Bea I agree with the above two that everyone should be able to file a return if they want to, but that under certain circumstances they should not be required to file a return. There are already circumstances under which people are not required to file a return, so I think the current rules are close to adequate. IRD's online system needs to be improved to make it easier for individuals to calculate whether they have overpaid tax or not, so they can easily make the choice. Changes that would be beneficial are: raising the threshold of overseas interest/dividends earnt before you are required to file a return (currently only $200), and not being required to file a return to bring forward a loss from the previous year or excess imputation credits from the previous year (they should be brought forward automatically without the taxpayer being required to do anything). Results: Agree: 17 Disagree: 1 portia The more I think about this, the more I think it will be unfair unless Inland Revenue is able to demonstrate that the changes it is going to make to PAYE deductions reduce the current inaccuracies. The figures given in paragraph 7.11 of the discussion document show that just 20% of taxpayers had close to the correct deductions made. Of the other 80%, 31% were overdeducted and 49% underdeduction - with the averages being $188 and $108 respectively. I don't know anyone who would not claim a refund of $188, and this is just the average - some refunds must be much greater than this. Therefore, taxpayers must continue to be able to claim their refunds until such time as PAYE is significantly more accurate. Results: Agree: 14 Disagree: 1 portia The comment by the Forum Administrator to Deitrich von Stade that the proposals wouldn't affect her ability to offset rental losses against wage and salary income is not quite correct. In the discussion document, at paragraph 7.15, "Bill" is to receive a credit based on the amount of PAYE that should have been deducted from his employment income. In other words, any under or overdeduction is to be ignored and tax paid on the rental income at "Bill's" marginal tax rate. Presumably losses will also be cashed up at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.

Mid rate changes in tax rates creating compoiste rates of tax, new rebates such an independent earner rebates as well as the seasonal nature of NZ's economy toeghther with the movement to part time employment in the service sector are producing alot more chance of under or overpayment.

For example, if someone works different hours each week, or has a change in pay rate. There would be no way the PAYE system would be able to correctly calculate the annual income tax if the weekly income is varying up and down. My understanding of the proposal is that those who have other income or losses eg rental income, dividends, self employed or overseas income in addition to their salary and wages, would still file an IR3 exactly the same as they do now. These people have the opportunity to square up their salary and wages income as part of that process. The same option needs to be available to anyone who ONLY has salary and wages income, even if its only optional.

Deitrich von Stade Of course IRD should be able to issue any media statement that it thinks is in the best interest of NZ tax payers. If that means issuing a press notice to say that a newspaper or a TV got some facts wrong then go for it. The NZ public has the right to know, and we should hold IRD accountable. They should be able to use any form of communication that will help them meet those accountabilities - that includes the use of social media, which to my surprise IRD seems to completely avoid at present. Results: Agree: 12 Disagree: 2 Bea The taxpayer's right to confidentiality should be paramount and should not be breached under any circumstances by IRD. If someone is seriously ripping off the tax system as in the example, then it becomes public through due process of the Courts. IRD should not pre-empt this. If IRD had the right to release a taxpayer's personal information in this way, it would be able to use that right to lean on the taxpayer. Nobody would wish to publically debate the actions of the IRD for fear of the IRD leaning on them in this way.

We've upped it from 1,000 to 5,000. Results: Agree: 2 Disagree: 0 flea Any form of quality management of this nature always creates additional workload for the developer as it needs to be built into their software development lifecycle process and I question the need for this type of control. Does being a "registered developer" or having "IRD approved" attached to your product really add value to the customer? Sure it might increase customer confidence for buying products sold off the shelf via retail outlets or online, but as for the developers that don't use those channels for their sales is it really of any benefit? As a developer of many years we are confident in our own ability to develop software that meets legislative requirements without the need to be certified/endorsed – fundamentally if our software was not meeting the requirements we would not have any customers. If it is deemed necessary to have a quality management system then I think the Australian Tax Office system works fairly well. It breaks down the various areas of compliance (as Jethrocarr has suggested) and as a developer you can register your product, after testing your product using the test scenarios provided by the ATO, for whichever areas are relevant to your product. Under the ATO model you don't normally register a specific version of your product and as a developer it is your responsibility to ensure that once you have registered your product any subsequent versions/updates remain compliant (always using the latest published test scenario). It is also the developer's responsibility to ensure any new/updated test scenarios published by the ATO are tested against their product.
