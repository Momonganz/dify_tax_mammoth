Complete your return online You can complete your return online at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: IR3NR 2017). You will need your document lodgement number (DLN). This is a14-character number printed at the top right and bottom of your paper return. Have you received any income from the sale/ disposal of property? You’ll need to show any income from taxable property sales at Box 24 of your return, if you haven’t included it elsewhere in your return. You may also need to complete a Property sale information (IR833) form if you haven’t already done so. Under the bright-line test for the sale/disposal of property, if you sold/disposed of a residential property, which you acquired on or after 1 October 2015, before the end of the income year, you’ll need to account for any gain. Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an “offshore RLWT person” and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. Enter the amount of any RLWT deducted from the sale price, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount deducted, show the combined amount. Print the total in Box 21A. Show the name of your withholder(s) in the “name of payer” box. Need more information?
