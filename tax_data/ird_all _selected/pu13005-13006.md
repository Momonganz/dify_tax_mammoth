1 Note (not part of the Rulings): These two public rulings, BR Pub 13/05 to BR Pub 13/06, deal with certain aspects of the income tax treatment of the standard form contract for public- private partnerships prepared by the Treasury. These two rulings do not consider the tax implications of any funding agreements or other contracts entered into by the parties. For example, these rulings do not address the potential application of the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE, goods and services tax (GST), the financial arrangements rules or the general anti avoidance provision in s BG 1. Any person entering into a public-private partnership with the New Zealand Government is strongly advised to apply for a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure to provide certainty on issues that are not addressed in these rulings. INCOME TAX – STANDARD PROJECT AGREEMENT FOR A PUBLIC–PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP - COMPANIES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 13/05 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CB 1, CH 2, DA 1, DA 2, DB 50, EA 2 and EA 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the design, construction, operation and maintenance of an asset (the Facility) by a company (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) under a public–private partnership agreement with Her Majesty, The Queen in Right of New Zealand acting by and through a government department (the Crown). The Arrangement is governed by a standard form contract prepared by the Treasury (the Project Agreement). Key clauses of the Project Agreement and relevant definitions have been included in Appendix B to the Commentary of this Ruling. This Ruling will not apply if the clauses of the Project Agreement that are referred to in this Ruling are altered in a material way. The Project Agreement has three main components:  The Design and Construction (D&C) Phase involves the SPV providing design and construction supplies in return for a lump sum design and construction payment (the D&C Payment).  The Facility Lease is the lease into which the SPV and the Crown enter and under which the SPV prepays an amount representing the rental the SPV will pay to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment).  The Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Phase involves the SPV providing operational and maintenance services over a period of approximately 25 years in return for a regular payment (the Unitary Charge). The date on which the O&M Phase starts is referred to as the Service Commencement Date. 2 Each of the three components is summarised below. The Project Agreement details the rights and obligations of the SPV and the Crown. Design and Construction Phase During the D&C Phase, the SPV will design and construct the Facility in accordance with the Project Agreement on behalf of the Crown. The Facility consists of all of the structures that are to be designed, constructed, commissioned and maintained by the SPV in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreement, and includes the entire physical infrastructure, the grounds and all of the fixtures, fit-out, plant and equipment. The SPV will be solely responsible to the Crown for the design and construction of the Facility, including the provision of infrastructure, plant, equipment and other related obligations, to the standard required by the Project Agreement. Throughout the term of the Project Agreement, the SPV will not own the Facility or the land on which the Facility will be built (the Crown Site) (cl 11.1). Under cl 11.2(a) of the Project Agreement, any Fixtures that the SPV supplies before the start of the Facility Lease (whether or not affixed to the land) (the Initial Fixtures) will remain the property, and in the ownership, of the SPV until the date of payment of the D&C Payment. For the purposes of the Project Agreement, Fixtures includes all buildings (including component parts of buildings), other structures, improvements, and roads. If the Crown fails to pay the D&C Payment in full when it is due, the SPV can exercise its ownership rights and remove the Initial Fixtures (cl 11.2(b)). The ownership of the Initial Fixtures retained by the SPV under cl 11.2(a) will be automatically transferred to the Crown on the date of payment of the D&C Payment (cl 11.2(c)). The D&C Payment is a single, contractually fixed, lump sum that the Crown must pay to the SPV on the Service Commencement Date. The D&C Payment is paid to the SPV by the Crown in consideration for the completion of the Facility and the transfer of the ownership in the Initial Fixtures (cl 12.3). No milestone or progress payments are provided for under the Project Agreement. The amount of the D&C Payment is determined by direct reference to the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding fit-out) together with the SPV’s funding costs during the D&C Phase. Under cl 12.5(c), the Crown and the SPV agree that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest to the extent that it exceeds the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility. The SPV does not apply a separate margin in respect of the D&C Phase. The D&C Payment is set off against the amount payable by the SPV as the Rental Prepayment for the Facility Lease, as described below. To construct the Facility, the SPV will incur expenditure in connection with designing, obtaining, affixing, constructing and implementing the Initial Fixtures. Other than the costs of fit-out and any funding costs, the expenditure incurred by the SPV on the Facility during the D&C Phase is referred to in this Ruling as the D&C Expenditure. Facility Lease Clause 12.2 of the Project Agreement provides for the Crown and the SPV to enter into a lease in respect of the Facility on or before the date of operational completion. Operational completion is the point at which the SPV has met all the completion criteria specified in the Project Agreement. 3 On the Service Commencement Date, the SPV will be obliged to pay the Rental Prepayment to the Crown, representing the rental to be paid under the Facility Lease (cl 12.3 of the Project Agreement). The Rental Prepayment is (in whole) a payment in the nature of rent that the SPV will make for the use and enjoyment of the land covered by the lease, and substitutes for the rent that the SPV would otherwise need to pay over the term of the lease. Clause 12.4 of the Project Agreement provides for the D&C Payment and the Rental Prepayment to be set off against each other. The total amount of the Rental Prepayment payable by the SPV will equal the amount of the D&C Payment payable by the Crown. Operation and Maintenance Phase During the O&M Phase, the SPV must provide ongoing operational and maintenance services to the Crown as described in the Project Agreement. Broadly, the operational and maintenance services are those services necessary to meet the asset management requirements and will vary depending on the type of asset being constructed. Under cl 49.1 of the Project Agreement, the Crown will pay the SPV a regular payment for the ongoing services provided (the Unitary Charge). The Unitary Charge will be paid following receipt by the Crown of a valid invoice (as defined in cl 49.2) issued by the SPV in accordance with cl 49.3. Payment of the Unitary Charge may be monthly or quarterly, depending on the nature of the Facility. The amount of the Unitary Payment may include incentive payments and will be subject to abatement if the SPV does not meet key performance measures. The total amount of the Unitary Payment over the O&M Phase is expected to recover all of the SPV’s costs in relation to the project and provide for its profit margin. Termination of the Project Agreement The Project Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Facility Lease and the O&M Phase, at which time any fit-out will be transferred to the ownership of the Crown for no consideration. The Project Agreement may also be terminated early if either party defaults on its obligations. For the purposes of this Ruling, the Arrangement does not include any early termination that may take place, and this Ruling does not rule on the consequences of early termination. Other contracts To fulfil its obligations under the Project Agreement, the SPV will enter into funding agreements and subcontracts. For the purposes of this Ruling, the Arrangement does not include these other agreements or subcontracts or any ownership structures that may be entered into. These agreements and subcontracts, together with the Project Agreement, will be an “arrangement” as defined in s YA 1 (the wider arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Ruling does not apply where the Project Agreement is part of a wider arrangement that is a “tax avoidance arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) such that subpart BG applies to void the wider arrangement. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. 4 D&C Payment  A portion of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. To the extent that the D&C Payment is not income under the financial arrangements rules: - the D&C Payment will be income of the SPV under s CB 1(1) and will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2); and - for the purposes of s CB 1, the SPV will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. D&C Expenditure  The D&C Expenditure is deductible under s DA 1(1), provided that s DA 2(2) to (6) does not apply. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the D&C Expenditure.  The SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures is “revenue account property” as defined in s YA 1. For the purpose of s DB 23, the cost of this revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure.  Section EA 2 applies to the D&C Expenditure, because the D&C Expenditure is the cost of the “revenue account property”. Under s EA 2(2), the deduction for the D&C Expenditure will be allocated to the year in which the Service Commencement Date takes place, because that is when the SPV disposes of the “revenue account property”.  Section GC 1 will not apply to the disposal of the SPV's interest in the Initial Fixtures. Rental Prepayment  The Rental Prepayment is deductible under s DA 1(1). The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the Rental Prepayment.  The accrual expenditure rules (in ss EA 3, CH 2 and DB 50) apply to the Rental Prepayment each year from the Service Commencement Date. To the extent of the unexpired amount (determined under s EA 3(4)) of the Rental Prepayment at the end of an income year, an amount of income is derived by the SPV in that income year and the SPV is allowed a deduction for this amount in the subsequent income year.  The SPV must spread the Rental Prepayment on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease term in order to determine the value of the unexpired portion of expenditure under s EA 3. Unitary Charge  The Unitary Charge will be assessable income of the SPV under s CB 1.  For the purpose of s BD 3, the SPV will derive the Unitary Charge in the income year in which it issues a valid invoice to the Crown. 5 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 21 October 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on 21 October 2013.

Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CB 1, CH 2, DA 1, DA 2, DB 50, EA 2 and EA 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the design, construction, operation and maintenance of an asset (the Facility) by a partnership (as that term is defined in s YA 1) (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) under a public–private partnership agreement with Her Majesty, The Queen in Right of New Zealand acting by and through a government department (the Crown). The definition of “partnership” in s YA 1 includes a limited partnership and a joint venture that chooses to be treated as a partnership. The Arrangement is governed by a standard form contract prepared by Treasury (the Project Agreement).

Termination of the Project Agreement The Project Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Facility Lease and the O&M Phase, at which time any fit-out will be transferred to the ownership of the Crown for no consideration. The Project Agreement may also be terminated early if either party defaults on its obligations.

How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. D&C Payment  A portion of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. To the extent that the D&C Payment is not income under the financial arrangements rules: - each partner’s share of the D&C Payment (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) will be income of the partner under s CB 1(1) and will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2); and 9 - for the purposes of s CB 1, each partner will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. D&C Expenditure  Subject to s HG 11 in the case of a “limited partnership” (as defined in s YA 1), each partner’s share of the D&C Expenditure (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is deductible under s DA 1(1), provided that s DA 2(2) to (6) does not apply. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) does not apply to the D&C Expenditure.  Each partner’s share of the SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is “revenue account property” as defined in s YA 1. For the purpose of s DB 23, the cost of this revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure.  Section EA 2 applies to the D&C Expenditure, because the D&C Expenditure is the cost of the “revenue account property”. Under s EA 2(2), the deduction for the D&C Expenditure will be allocated to the year in which the Service Commencement Date takes place, because that is when the “revenue account property” is disposed of.  Section GC 1 will not apply to the disposal of each partner’s share of the SPV’s interest in the Initial Fixtures. Rental Prepayment  Subject to s HG 11 in the case of a “limited partnership” (as defined in s YA 1), each partner’s share of the Rental Prepayment (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) is deductible under s DA 1(1).

Unitary Charge  Each partner’s share of the Unitary Charge (calculated in accordance with s HG 2) will be assessable income of the partner under s CB 1.  For the purpose of s BD 3, each partner will derive the Unitary Charge in the income year in which the SPV issues a valid invoice to the Crown. 10 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 21 October 2013.

Howard Davis Director, Taxpayer Rulings 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 13/05 AND BR PUB 13/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 13/05 and BR Pub 13/06 (the Public Rulings). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in Appendix A to this commentary.

The Treasury has prepared a standard form contract to govern all public– private partnership (PPP) projects in New Zealand (the Project Agreement). Key clauses of the Project Agreement are included in Appendix B. The Project Agreement will form the basis of the agreement between the Crown and the preferred or successful bidder (the special purpose vehicle – SPV) in any future PPP project. 2. The Project Agreement also forms the basis of the Arrangement on which the Public Rulings are issued. The Public Rulings set out the income tax treatment of the main components of the Project Agreement. Tax Administration Act 1994 3. Under Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), the Commissioner has the ability to make binding rulings. The purpose of this ability is to provide taxpayers with certainty about the way the Commissioner will apply taxation laws and to help taxpayers to meet their obligations under those laws (s 91A). 4. Under s 91D, the Commissioner can make public rulings on how a taxation law applies to any type of person and any type of arrangement. Public rulings interpret how a taxation law applies to a specific type of arrangement that has a wide general application. The Public Rulings are public rulings that set out how the income tax laws apply to the standard form Project Agreement, as the Project Agreement will be used as the basis for all future PPP projects. Provided that the relevant clauses of the Project Agreement are not amended in a material way, the Public Rulings 12 will apply to give certainty to future preferred bidders regarding the application of the taxation laws contained in the Public Rulings. 5. Under s 91E, the Commissioner can make private rulings on how a taxation law applies to a specific person(s) and a specific arrangement on which the ruling is sought. A private ruling can be applied for by a preferred bidder in relation to the specific structure being entered into, to give certainty on the application of the taxation laws to that structure (particularly in relation to taxation laws that are not included in the Public Rulings). For more information on private rulings, see our booklet Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715) which is available from the Inland Revenue website. 6. The term “taxation law” is defined in s 91C, which provides that the Commissioner can make a ruling on most provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. For current purposes, the key exception is that the Commissioner is unable to make a ruling where the matter is or could be the subject of a determination under s 90AC (which relates to the application of the financial arrangements rules). This means that the Commissioner is unable to provide a binding ruling in respect of many issues relating to the application of the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW, but must instead make a financial arrangements rules determination under s 90AC in order to give taxpayers certainty. 7. Therefore, in order for a bidder to obtain certainty in relation to the application of the taxation laws in any particular PPP project, it is likely that a combination of the Public Rulings, a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination will be necessary. 8. Any preferred or successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a private ruling and a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure to provide certainty on any issues that are not addressed in the Rulings. The Crown may require the successful bidder to obtain a favourable private ruling in respect of issues not addressed in the Public Rulings. Application of the Legislation 9. The term SPV is used in this commentary as a generic term to refer to the successful bidder who enters into a Project Agreement with the Crown. It is used in this commentary to refer to either a company or a partner’s share in a partnership, as relevant. SPV is carrying on a “business” 10. The term “business” is defined in s YA 1, and includes “any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit”. The leading New Zealand case on the meaning of “business” is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). 11. In Grieve, Richardson J held that determining whether a business existed involved a two-fold enquiry into the:  nature of the activities carried on; and  intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. 13 12. By entering into the Project Agreement with the Crown, the SPV will be responsible for the design and construction of the Facility and the provision of ongoing operational services to the Crown over a period of approximately 25 years. The SPV will also intend to make a profit from entering into the Project Agreement through the receipt of the Unitary Charge. 13. Therefore, the SPV will have the requisite level of activities and intention to profit and will be carrying on a “business” (as defined in s YA 1). This will be the case even if all of the obligations under the Project Agreement are subcontracted to other persons. Application of the financial arrangement rules 14. The Project Agreement is a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3, and will be part of a wider financial arrangement that also includes any funding agreements and subcontracts the SPV enters into. 15. The Design and Construction (D&C) Phase of the Project Agreement is a financial arrangement as defined in s EW 3. Under the D&C Phase, the SPV will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the Facility). The SPV and the Crown agree that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (cl 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The effect of cl 12.5(c) will be that part of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. It is likely that Commissioner would determine that the amount of income will be equal to the capitalised interest that the parties agree is included in the D&C Payment. However, to obtain certainty on this point, the SPV is strongly advised to apply for a financial arrangements rules determination, which will determine the value of the Facility (under s EW 32(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and s 90AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994), the amount of income derived under the financial arrangement rules and how that income should be spread over the term of the D&C Phase. 16. It is likely that no income or expenditure arises under the financial arrangement rules in subpart EW in relation to the Facility Lease and the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Phase of the Project Agreement, for the following reasons:  The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). The Rental Prepayment is solely attributable to that excepted financial arrangement, so is not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules in accordance with s EW 6(2).  The O&M Phase is a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1) of services and is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(22). In accordance with s EW 6(3), amounts solely attributable to this excepted financial arrangement are taken into account under the financial arrangement rules. However, because the consideration the SPV pays (that is, the services provided to the Crown) is equal in value to the consideration the SPV receives (the Unitary Charge), there is no amount to spread under the financial arrangement rules. 14 17. Therefore, the SPV must recognise amounts paid and received under the Facility Lease and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement as income derived or expenditure incurred under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside the financial arrangement rules) in accordance with the Public Rulings. 18. Any successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a financial arrangements rules determination in respect of its specific structure. See Special Determination S22: “Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public–private partnership” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 9 (October/November 2012)) for an example of a financial arrangements rules determination issued in respect of a PPP project dealing with similar issues. Design and Construction Payment 19. As noted in para 15, to the extent that the D&C Payment consists of capitalised interest, the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW apply to the D&C Payment. The remainder of the D&C Payment will be an amount that the SPV derives from a business, so will be income under s CB 1(1). The D&C Payment will not be of a capital nature under s CB 1(2). 20. Other than any amount required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules, the SPV will derive the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date in consideration for performing its obligations under the Project Agreement and the transfer of the SPV’s ownership interest in the Initial Fixtures. Design and Construction Expenditure 21. Clause 11.2 of the Project Agreement makes it clear that the SPV retains ownership of the Initial Fixtures and disposes of that ownership on the Service Commencement Date in consideration for the D&C Payment. The ownership interest retained by the SPV in the Initial Fixtures (under cl 11.2) is “revenue account property” (as defined in s YA 1). The “cost” of the revenue account property is equal to the D&C Expenditure. Therefore, s DB 23 applies to override the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). 22. As the SPV is in business, the D&C Expenditure will be deductible under s DA 1. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1) will not apply to the D&C Expenditure, because of the application of s DB 23. Whether the other limitations in s DA 2 apply to the D&C Expenditure will depend on the nature of the structure and other arrangements the SPV enters into, which is outside the scope of the Public Rulings. 23. Section EA 2 applies to determine the timing of the deduction for the D&C Expenditure. Section EA 2(2) provides that the SPV will be entitled to a deduction for the cost of revenue account property in the earlier of the income year in which the person disposes of the property or the property ceases to exist. 24. Under the Project Agreement, the SPV will dispose of the “revenue account property” for the D&C Payment on the Service Commencement Date. Therefore, the SPV will be entitled to claim a deduction for the D&C 15 Expenditure in the income year in which the Service Commencement Date occurs. Matching of Design and Construction Expenditure and Payment 25. The effect of the above conclusions are that the D&C Expenditure will be deductible to the SPV in the same income year that the SPV receives the D&C Payment, being the income year in which the Service Commencement Date occurs. Rental Prepayment 26. The courts have held that if a taxpayer incurs rental expenditure as part of their income-earning process that expenditure will be of a revenue nature: FCT v South Australian Battery Makers Pty Ltd (1978) 78 ATC 4,412; Wattie v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,712. 27. The Rental Prepayment is (in whole) a payment in the nature of rent that the SPV will make for the use and enjoyment of the land covered by the Facility Lease, and substitutes for the rent that the SPV would otherwise need to pay over the term of the Facility Lease. That the Lease Prepayment is “prepaid” in one lump sum does not change its character for tax purposes: JP Hancock v General Reversionary and Investment Co Ltd \[1919\] 1 KB 25; J Gadsden & Co v CIR \[1965\] NZLR 385; National Australia Bank Ltd v FC of T (1997) 37 ATR 378. 28. As the SPV is in business and the Facility Lease is part of its income- earning process, the Rental Prepayment will be deductible under s DA 1. The Rental Prepayment will not be subject to the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). 29. Section EA 3 applies in relation to the timing of the deduction for the Rental Prepayment. Where s EA 3 applies, s EA 3(3) states: The unexpired portion of a person’s expenditure at the end of an income year— (a) is income of the person in the income year under section CH 2 (Adjustment for prepayments); and (b) is an amount for which the person is allowed a deduction in the following income year under section DB 50 (Adjustment for prepayments). 30. The Rental Prepayment is made in respect of the Facility Lease, which is a “good” for the purposes of s EA 3 (being an interest in land and therefore real property). The Rental Prepayment is not made in respect of services, a chose in action or an allowance reimbursing employees. Therefore, the unexpired portion must be determined in accordance with s EA 3(4). 31. Section EA 3(4) states that an amount of expenditure on goods is unexpired at the end of an income year if the:  person has not used up the goods in deriving income; and  goods are not destroyed or rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income. 16 32. The term “used” in the context of s EA 3(4) means being expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets: Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 (CA). 33. In the context of a lease of property, the goods are used up evenly over the term of the lease. The unexpired portion at the end of an income year will cover the portion of the expenditure that relates to the portion of the lease that is yet to take place. 34. Therefore, the “unexpired” portion of the Rental Prepayment, in terms of s EA 3(4), will be the portion that relates to the outstanding term of the lease at the end of each income year. This means the Rental Prepayment will be spread evenly over the term of the lease (on a straight-line basis). Unitary Charge 35. Because the SPV is in business, the Unitary Charge will be income of the SPV under s CB 1. 36. Section BD 3 requires every amount of income to be allocated to the income year in which it is derived. Case law on the meaning of the term establishes that an amount is “derived” when the income-earning process is complete. Once the SPV has undertaken the operational and maintenance services and issued the Crown with a valid invoice (as defined in cl 49.2 of the Project Agreement), the income-earning process will be complete and the Unitary Charge will have been derived. Section BG 1 37. It is the Commissioner’s opinion that the Project Agreement is not a “tax avoidance arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) for the purposes of s BG 1. However, as noted in the Public Rulings, the Project Agreement is part of a wider arrangement that also consists of any funding agreements and subcontracts that the SPV may enter into. 38. For the purposes of s BG 1, the wider arrangement will be an “arrangement” (as defined in s YA 1) and the Commissioner could potentially conclude that the wider arrangement entered into by the SPV is a “tax avoidance arrangement” that is void pursuant to s BG 1. 39. Although the Commissioner considers it unlikely, if s BG 1 applied to the wider arrangement, any reconstruction under s GA 1 could potentially affect the conclusions reached in the Public Rulings in relation to the income tax treatment of the Project Agreement. The Commissioner is unable to reach a conclusion on the application of s GA 1 and the appropriate reconstruction to make without knowing the full details of the “tax avoidance arrangement” entered into. For this reason, the Public Rulings do not and cannot rule on the potential application of s BG 1. 40. It is the Commissioner’s view that s BG 1 is unlikely to apply to any arrangement where:  the funding agreements are straight-forward loans entered into on an arm’s length basis with third-party lenders on market terms; 17  any related party funding does not have any artificial features and is entered into on an arm’s length basis on market terms; and  any subcontracts are entered into on an arm’s length basis on market terms. 41. However, because each particular PPP arrangement entered into will differ, the Commissioner needs to consider the facts of any arrangement entered into before reaching a definitive conclusion on the potential application of s BG 1. Any successful bidder is strongly advised to apply for a private binding ruling in respect of its specific arrangement if it wants certainty regarding the Commissioner’s view on s BG 1.

The Public Rulings will not apply if these clauses of the Project Agreement are altered in a material way. 1. Clause 11 states: 11. Construction of Facilities for Crown 11.1 Ownership of Facility (a) The Facility shall be designed and constructed by the Contractor under and in accordance with this Agreement on behalf of the Crown. (b) Subject to the rights of the Contractor set out in this Part 5, the Crown will at all times before and after the Service Commencement Date own the Facility (excluding the Fitout, to which clause 11.2(e) applies) and the Crown Site. 11.2 Ownership of Fixtures and Fitout (a) Any Fixtures supplied by the Contractor prior to the commencement of the term of the Facility Lease (Initial Fixtures) will remain the property, and in the ownership, of the Contractor (notwithstanding any affixing to the Crown Site) until the earlier of: (i) the date of payment in full of the Design and Construction Payment; and (ii) the date of payment in full of the Compensation Sum, (such date being the Transfer Date). (b) The Crown acknowledges and agrees that the Contractor shall, until the Transfer Date, have the right (in addition and without prejudice to its other rights and remedies under the Project Documents, including the rights of access set out in Part 7 (Access to Site and Site Issues)) to enter and re-enter on to the Crown Site and remove and repossess the Initial Fixtures, but only if and to the extent the Crown fails to pay in full: (i) the Design and Construction Payment in accordance with clauses 12.3 (Payments on Service Commencement Date) and 12.4 (Set- off); or (ii) the Compensation Sum in accordance with clause 79.1 (Payment of Compensation Sum), in each case within 5 Business Days after the due date for payment of such amount under this Agreement. (c) Upon the Transfer Date, the Contractor shall immediately transfer to the Crown its ownership of the Initial Fixtures together with all associated rights in and to the Initial Fixtures and the Crown Site reserved under clause 11.2(b). The Initial Fixtures will automatically vest in the Crown on the Transfer Date, by operation of this clause, without the need for any additional action by any person. (d) The expenditure incurred by or for the Contractor in connection with the Initial Fixtures will be included in the Design and Construction Payment. (e) Any Fitout on the Crown Site will belong to the Contractor until the earlier of the Actual Termination Date and the Expiry Date.

(f) Any Fixtures in respect of which the Contractor has incurred expenditure, other than for repairs and maintenance, after the commencement of the Facility Lease will be treated as owned by the Contractor rather than the Crown for the purposes of this Agreement. 28 On the earlier of the Expiry Date and the Actual Termination Date, any such Fixtures, to the extent ownership is vested in the Contractor, will be transferred by the Contractor to the Crown, for no additional consideration, as part of the Disengagement Deliverables in accordance with clause 85 (Contractor’s Disengagement Deliverables), the terms of Schedule 24 (Disengagement) and the requirements of the Disengagement Plan. 2. Clause 12 states: 12. Facility Lease and payments on Service Commencement Date 12.1 Prior to Service Commencement Date The Contractor will, prior to the Service Commencement Date, have the rights to access the Crown Site set out in Part 7 (Access to Site and Site Issues). 12.2 Entry into Facility Lease (a) On or prior to the Crown issuing the Operational Completion Notice, the parties must enter into the Facility Lease. The Facility Lease will have a term commencing at 9.00am on the Service Commencement Date and terminating on the earlier of the Actual Termination Date and the Expiry Date.

(b) GST payable as between the parties in respect of the Rental Prepayment and the Design and Construction Payment will be addressed in accordance with clauses 49.8 (Zero rating of Facility Lease) and 49.9 (Design and Construction Payment – GST). 12.5 Financial Arrangements Rules For the purposes of the financial arrangements rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, the parties agree that: (a) they are independent parties dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to the Project; (b) the Rental Prepayment is the lowest price the parties would have agreed for the rental of the Facility for the term of the Facility Lease, on the date of this Agreement, if payment had been required in full at the time 29 the first right in the Facility Lease passes from the Crown to the Contractor; (c) the Design and Construction Payment includes capitalised interest to the extent that it exceeds the agreed design and construction costs (which by definition exclude Fitout and debt funding costs) of the Facility; (d) the Rental Prepayment is the value of the rental under the Facility Lease and therefore does not include any capitalised interest; and (e) in the case of the Contractor only, it will compute its taxable income for the relevant period on the basis that the total consideration includes capitalised interest as set out in clause 12.5(c) above and it will file its Tax returns accordingly. 3. Clause 49 states: 49.

(c) Unless section 5(23) of the GST Act applies to the supply of the Facility Lease, if for any reason it is determined that the supply of the Facility Lease is chargeable with GST other than at a rate of zero per cent, the Contractor shall be entitled to recover (and the Crown will pay to the Contractor) the amount of any direct costs (including penalties and interest, legal or other advisory costs, and any costs of financing the additional GST amount), resulting from the supply of the Facility Lease being chargeable with GST other than at a rate of zero per cent, on the Contractor providing reasonable evidence to the Crown of the Contractor’s liability for such costs. 49.9 Design and Construction Payment - GST (a) Each party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Design and Construction Payment is consideration for a taxable supply (the Supply) under the GST Act; (ii) it will not seek to treat the Supply as zero rated for GST purposes; and (iii) on or before the Service Commencement Date it will be registered under the GST Act on a monthly return cycle and on an “invoice” accounting basis.

(c) The Contractor will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that any Rates or Taxes for which the Crown is liable under clause 49.10(a) are invoiced directly by the relevant Governmental Entity to the Crown. Where any invoices for which the Crown is liable under clause 49.10(a) are addressed to the Contractor rather than to the Crown, the Crown will meet the invoiced costs by way of an Additional Payment. 4.
