Kaimahi a tētahi kaituku mahi nō tāwahi e noho ana i Aotearoa New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer
================================================================================================================

If you live in New Zealand and your overseas employer does not need to register as an employer in New Zealand, you need to register as an IR56 taxpayer.    
  
You will not need to register as an IR56 taxpayer if your employer registers as an employer with us or arranges for someone else to manage your employment-related tax.   
  
From 1 April 2023, if you are a New Zealand-based employee of an overseas employer and received non-cash benefits (also known as a fringe benefit), you will have to include these benefits as gross income in your Employment Information – IR348 (EI) return. You will also need to include any employer superannuation contributions.

-------------------

From 1 April 2024, if you are required to deduct tax and have not done it, you will have 60 days to file the required return and make the payment before penalties are applied if certain criteria are met.

Calculating non-cash benefits from your employer 
-------------------------------------------------

If you receive any kind of non-cash benefit, for example health insurance, you must include the value of the benefit as part of your gross income in your EI return.  

If the non-cash benefit is paid regularly, for example monthly, simply include the value of the non-cash benefit as gross income in your EI return and tax accordingly. You can use the PAYE calculator to do this.

[Self-calculate IR56 PAYE](https://www.ird.govt.nz/roles/tax-agents/self-calculate-ir56-paye)

If it is a lump sum, you will need to calculate the PAYE on it separately to your salary. Then you will need to combine these in your EI return.

Any shares or share options you get from your employer for free or below market value are employee share scheme (ESS) benefits and are employment income. You must include the taxable value of the ESS benefit in your EI return.

You can choose to:

*   deduct PAYE at the time the benefit is recorded in your EI return
*   not deduct PAYE and instead pay the tax at the end of the year.

If you choose not to deduct PAYE, this may result in you becoming a provisional taxpayer.

If you receive a Working for Families entitlement and receive any kind of non-cash benefit, you will need to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form. Any non-cash benefits received are not adjustable in your student loan obligation.

Calculating superannuation
--------------------------

If your employer contributes to a superannuation scheme or fund, you need to account for [Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)](/api/glossary/item?id={B1FC84AD-4393-48A3-92EF-2EF29C640520})
.

There are 2 options: 

*   add this in the EI ESCT field 
*   choose for it to be taxed as PAYE. This means your income is increased and is now included for Working for Families, child support, independent earner tax credit and any student loan payments.
