Rules around permanent establishments
-------------------------------------

Double tax agreements (DTAs) with other countries or territories generally provide that a non-resident company with a permanent establishment in New Zealand will be subject to New Zealand tax on income derived here.

The definition of a permanent establishment can vary across different DTAs, but often uses the criteria in the following table.

| Criteria | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A permanent establishment for a business is a fixed place where the business activity is wholly or partly carried on. | This includes:<br><br>*   a place of management<br>*   a branch<br>*   an office<br>*   a factory<br>*   a workshop<br>*   a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources<br>*   an agricultural, pastoral or forestry property<br>*   a building or construction site, installation or assembly project that lasts more than six months. |
| The company may also have a permanent establishment in other circumstances. | This includes:<br><br>*   carrying on supervisory activities in connection with a building or construction site, installation or assembly project for more than six months<br>*   carrying on activities which consist or, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources situated in New Zealand<br>*   using substantial equipment in New Zealand, for more than six months, for or under contract with the enterprise<br>*   performing any operations for the felling, removal or other exploitation of standing timber. |
| The company does not have a permanent establishment if it only uses facilities in New Zealand for certain activities. | These are:<br><br>*   storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise<br>*   maintenance of goods or merchandise that are used for the storage, display or delivery of the company's merchandise<br>*   maintenance of goods or merchandise that belongs to the company but are used for processing by another entity<br>*   maintenance of a fixed place of business that is only used for purchasing goods or merchandise or collecting information for the company<br>*   maintenance of a fixed place of business that is used for any other activity of an introductory or supporting nature, such as advertising or scientific research. |

Applying for an IRD number for your company
-------------------------------------------

If your company is deemed to be a resident of New Zealand, you will need to apply for an IRD number by completing an IRD number application - resident non-individual form, IR596.

Dual resident companies and determinations
------------------------------------------

It is possible for a company to be resident in more than one country. This can lead to a number of undesirable outcomes such as potential double taxation and restrictions on maintaining an imputation credit account. We recommend companies carefully review their governance arrangements so that dual residence does not arise inadvertently.

On the other hand, dual resident companies can be used in tax avoidance arrangements. To address these concerns, Article 4(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting requires non-individual taxpayers that are dual residents to apply to either competent authority for a determination of their residency for tax treaty purposes.

If there is no agreement, treaty benefits will be denied or only granted to the extent to which competent authorities can agree.

Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office have agreed an administrative approach under which eligible taxpayers can self-determine their residence without the need to apply for a determination. This approach is designed to reduce compliance costs for eligible taxpayers. You can see the eligibility criteria on Tax Policy's site.

[Australia and New Zealand's administrative approach to MLI Article 4(1) (Tax Policy)](https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2019/2019-other-australia-nz-admin-approach-mli-article-4-1)

  

Companies that are not eligible for the administrative approach will need to apply to a competent authority for a determination. See Tax Policy for details of how to do this if the application is made to the competent authority in New Zealand.
