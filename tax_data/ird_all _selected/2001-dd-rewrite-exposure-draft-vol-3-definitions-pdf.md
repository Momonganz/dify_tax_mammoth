Defined terms:airport operator, designated group investment fund, designated source, friendly society, group investment fund, Maori authority, New Zealand, statutory producer board, unit trust. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Definitions, consequential amendments, and tables Definitions 33 Comment:The current paragraph (b)(ii) and (iii) references to ‘group investment funds’ are replaced by draft paragraph (c), which picks up the language in current section CF 2 (3) and applies it generally for the purposes of the Act. This is, conceivably, a change in the law, but the rewrite must inevitably conform the various ways in which the Act describes non- designated category A group investment funds. An argument can be made that this definition and the definition of ‘share’ are so significant that— (a) a more generic term should be used; and (b) the definitions should not be located only in Part O. The definitions apply so generally, however, that a Part O location is inevitable and ‘company’ is arguably as generic a term as any other. Sections HE 1 (a), OC 1 (a), OC 2 (5)(a), and OC 3 (a) could all be consequentially repealed. The proposed exclusion of incorporated societies, industrial and provident societies, and friendly societies appears to be a sensible clarification. But, again, it might, conceivably, be a change in the law. (Building societies are not excluded, but their ‘withdrawable shares’ are excluded from the definitions of ‘share’ and ‘shareholder’.) comparative value method means the method of calculating FIF income or FIF loss in section EI 44 (Comparative value method) completed , for a film, means the completion of the film to— (a)the stage of production at which the film has been completely edited, shot by shot, to its final length;

Defined terms:company, convertible note, unit trust. Comment:This approach, together with the amendments to the definition of ‘company’ and ‘shareholder’, would enable the repeal of section FC 12 and section HE 1 (a) to (d). Section FZ 2 (2)(b) could also be repealed. It is proposed that current section CH 2 (8) also be repealed and that the only convertible notes that are shares for current section CH 2 purposes are the old 1960 to 1986 notes, which are generally treated as shares. This is a change in the law but seems to be a necessary and appropriate result of the rewrite.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Definitions, consequential amendments, and tables Definitions 87 Defined terms:company, dividend withholding payment rules, imputation rules, share, statutory producer board. Comment:Current paragraph (c)(ii) is superfluous, given the definition of ‘share’, and current paragraph (c)(i) is superfluous, given the definition of ‘company’ (already in section OC 3) and paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of ‘shareholder’. Note the exclusion of withdrawable shares of building societies. The exclusion of withdrawable shares in building societies from the definition of ‘share’, and the equivalent change to the definition of ’shareholder’, eliminate the possibility of ‘dividends’ on such shares being ‘dividends’ generally under the Act and accordingly should mean imputation credits cannot attach. This is not a policy shift (having regard to current section CE 1 (1)(a), which separately taxes such amounts, and current sections DI 1 (a) and NF 1 (4), which treat ‘dividends’ on withdrawable shares as interest for deductibility and RWT purposes) but might be argued to be a change in the law. share purchase agreement is defined in section CE 3 (‘Share purchase agreement’ defined) for the purposes of section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment) and sections CE 4 to CE 7 share purchase scheme means a scheme approved for the time being by the Commissioner for the purposes of section DC 4 (Loans to employees under share purchase schemes) short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services means an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services of one of the following classes: (a)an agreement under which settlement must take place or the services must be performed on or before the 93 rd day after the date on which the agreement is entered into: (b)if the date on which the agreement is entered into cannot be established, an agreement under which settlement must take place or the services must be performed on or before the 93 rd day after the earlier of— (i)the date on which the buyer first makes a payment to the seller;
