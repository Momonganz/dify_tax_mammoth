The 2021 SME tax compliance cost report outlines the results from a survey of 14,063 small business done in April to June 2021.

A significant change to the tax system occurred when payday filing became mandatory for all employers in April 2019. There has been some increase in compliance times since 2018 but overall, annual compliance time is lower than 2013.
