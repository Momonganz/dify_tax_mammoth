Notes to complete the IR833 Bright-line property rule for residential property Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • the owner will build a house on at some stage, or • the owner may one day build a house on. Under the bright-line property rule, regardless of your intentions when you acquired it, a sale of residential property may be taxable if you acquired it on or after: • 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 2 years • 29 March 2018 through to 26 March 2021 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 5 years. This includes property acquired as a result of an offer made to purchase property on or before 23 March 2021, and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021, or • 27 March 2021 and sold/disposed of it within 10 years. If one of these bright-line periods applies to your property transaction, and none of the exclusions apply, then you will have to pay tax on any profit you've made on the sale or disposal of the property. Exclusions For individuals and trusts (in limited circumstances), there are specific exclusions to the bright-line property rule. These are: Inherited property - a sale of a residential property that was transferred to an executor or administrator of a deceased estate or to an individual beneficiary. Relationship property settlements - property received as part of a relationship settlement agreement. Main home - If you are selling a property you need to decide if it's your main home. You can only have 1 main home. It is the property you have the greatest connection to. Main home held in a trust - a sale/disposal by a trustee where the property was the main home of the principal settlor of the trust (or the principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. You can use the main home exclusion if the situations in the table below apply. Main home exclusionThe situations that must apply Properties acquired before 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for more than 50% of the time you’ve owned it, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for 100% of the time you’ve owned it. This includes any continuous period of up to 12 months where it was not used as your main home, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Note: The main home exclusion does not apply if it has been used 2 or more times in the previous 2 years, or you or a group of persons have a regular pattern of buying and selling your main home. Relevant dates for property sales subject to the bright-line property rule (Boxes 4 and 5) If you have ticked that the sale or disposal of the property is taxable under the bright-line property rule, use the dates in the table below. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Purchase/acquisition of propertyDate of registration with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Purchase/acquisition where no registration occurs prior to the sale/ disposal date The latest date you acquired an interest in the property, for example the date of contract.

If your property is subject to the 10 year bright-line period and it was not your main home for the entire time you owned it but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced for the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line property rule only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the sale is taxable because you used your main home for other purposes for any continuous period of more than 12 months during the time you owned it (a change of use), your property sale income must be reduced for the days it was used as your main home. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it was not used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the sale price. Deduct this amount from the sale price and show the result at box 6. Reduced purchase price (Box 7) If the sale price at box 6 is reduced for days it was used as your main home, the purchase price must also be reduced. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it was not used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the purchase price. Deduct this amount from the purchase price and show the result at box 7. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the days it was used as your main home (including days in periods of up to 12 months it wasn’t used as your main home before or after a period that it was used as your main home) by the total days in the bright-line period and multiply the result by the total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the following note on deductible expenses. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Capital expenses incurred in acquiring the property and capital improvements will generally be deductible. You may not claim a deduction for private expenses relating to using the property as your residence. Holding costs are expenses such as interest, rates and insurance that are incurred as a result of owning land and are deductible to the extent that the land is used to earn taxable income. If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you seek advice from a tax agent. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property are included separately in your tax return. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return ($2,500 before 2020 return), you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following tax year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year. Because there are penalties for under- paying provisional tax, we recommend you get professional advice about doing this. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide.
