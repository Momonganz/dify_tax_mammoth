*   create, develop, or increase public facilities in a city or other district.

Your charity is not exempt if it uses funds for non-charitable purposes.

The exemption does not apply to income raised:

Funeral trusts

Interest and dividend income from a trust’s funeral fund is exempt if it exists only to pay the funeral-related expenses of employees and their immediate family members. (Spouses, partners and children.)

The exemption does not apply if contributions are made by anyone other than the employer or their employees.

We must approve the fund.
