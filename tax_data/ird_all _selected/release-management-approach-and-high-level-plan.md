1 Release Management Approach IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 BT Release Management Overview •Following the successful implementation of Stage 1 ( START for GST), the programme has determined that taking a release based approach will ensure that on going implementation of the new tax and social policy changes are: –logically sequenced; –grouped to enable efficient use of resources; and –business and technical risk are minimised. •The programme is comprised of 4 Stages with the final stage due to complete in 2021 •Applying a release based approach means that each Stage will now be delivered in one or more releases •A BT Release may be either a START major release which will include all the necessary components to build out “end to end” the new tax and social policy solution ( START Plus); or •A START minor release which could include enhancements to existing functionality or new functionality; or •An independent release of supporting business or technical change that could include Organisation Model Implementation, IKM, Analytics, Customer Experience or technology infrastructure. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 BT Release Sequencing and Planning Approach The following principles are taken into consideration when shaping the release scope and implementation sequence for the BT Programme: •Risk minimisation –business and technical •Ability to implement in the required time frame ( do ability –size of release) •START Plus major releases will be scheduled to align to an appropriate time frame based on the tax type affected •START minor releases will be implemented to compliment the START solution and will be either pre or post a major START release •Independent releases will be implemented at appropriate times aligned to business requirements taking into consideration START Major release windows •Business impact –allowing sufficient time between releases for change to “bed in” •Policy change considerations ( timing of legislative change) •Aligned to achievement of benefits as early as possible •Enablement of the new organisation •Affordability The BT Programme Release Plan will be reviewed at the conclusion of each major release ( or at least yearly) to ensure that the sequence remains relevant. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 4 BT Release Sequencing and Planning Approach As the delivery of the START solution progresses and the START footprint grows and replaces FIRST then: •The delivery model will become increasingly START centric, less waterfall and increasingly agile •Changes to Customer Experience (CX) and Business Intelligence will compliment the START solution ( START Plus) •Co-existence ( old solutions with new) will continue to be minimised and at the time of implementing START Plus Release 5 is expected to disappear altogether •Independent releases of supporting change can continue in the later stages of the programme, however this will likely focus on enhancing customer experience IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 5 In Confidence 20172018201920202021 Stage 1Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4 Modernising the revenue system req uires wide-ranging change Delivery Model START Plus release 4 Customer experience new KiwiSaver& Student Loans Analytics, Business Intelligence & Operational reporting Heritage Co-existence Data START Plus release 5 Customer experience new Child Support & remaining taxes Analytics, Business Intelligence & Operational reporting Data Customer experience new Income Tax & Working for Families Analytics, Business Intelligence & Operational reporting Heritage Co-existence Data START Plus release 3 Customer experience Heritage Business Taxes Heritage Co-existence Analytics, Business Intelligence & Operational reporting Data Infrastructure START Plus release 2 Customer experience Heritage GST Heritage Co-existence Analytics, Business Intelligence & Operational reporting Data Infrastructure START release 1 Programme Management, Policy, Enterprise Architecture, PMO, Commercial Management, Benefits & Bus Case Operating model (organisation design implementation) ESS releases Technology enablers –independent releases Analytics, Information & Knowledge Management, Business Intelligence –independent releases Customer Experience (CX) –independent releases IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Page 1: 11 August 2017 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 7 START Plus Release 3 Scope Overview •START Plus Release 3 will enable: ▪Endto End Income Tax within START, including associated products, e.g. Imputation credits etc. ▪Digital submissions of pre–populated Income Tax Returns. ▪Improved self service for Income Tax, including digital submission of Returns ▪Pay Day submission of Employer information ( voluntary for Release 2 becomes compulsory from Release 3) ▪Working for Families Tax Credit year end square up (linked to Income Tax return process) in START ▪All Customers will be mastered in START ▪eServicesbecomes the digital landing page for all Customers ▪Consolidated view inmyIR (eServices) for non individual customers, and individual customers with no Social policy products. ▪Enrolmentfor all Tax products consolidated in START IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 8 Page 2: 11 August 2017 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Page 3: 11 August 2017 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 10 BT ReleaseManagement Meeting : Roles and Responsibilities The existing Core Leads Meeting to transition to the Release Management Forum for the BT programme as follows: •Core Members –Approve release scope and plan, associated priority and any changes ( as a starting point then escalated to the appropriate governance forum for approval) –Approve schedule, resources, financials and any changes –Provide escalation point for issues related to each release –Assist Release Management Team with resolution of escalated issues –Accept or decline risks and associated mitigations –Provides PROCEED direction at key milestones •Chair –As for members and governs the meeting proceedings •Support –Provides sufficient and necessary information regarding •Scope, status, timelines ( critical path focus) and financials –Escalates issues as necessary –Presents risks and associated mitigations for approval IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 11 04/08/2016 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE
