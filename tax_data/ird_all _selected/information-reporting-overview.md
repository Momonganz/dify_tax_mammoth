===================================================================

Online marketplaces who are tax residents in New Zealand must collect and report information about sellers on their platforms who get income from sales. 

Defining key terms

Online marketplaces are also known as platform operators.

Sellers’ income is also known as [consideration.](/api/glossary/item?id={5686D331-C200-451B-8BD5-0189F18799CA})

Relevant services
-----------------

The rules affect:

*   the rental of immovable property (including commercial and residential), such as carparks, short-stay and visitor accommodation
*   personal services, such as ride-sharing, food and beverage delivery, and graphic and web design services.

The rental of immovable property is the actual renting out of that immovable property. Advertising a property is available to rent is not a relevant service.

A personal service is a service involving time or task-based work performed by 1 or more individuals at the request of a buyer.

Reporting to us
---------------

Online marketplaces must register with us for a Digital Platform Information (DPI) account. You can register for a DPI account in myIR.

Using this account, you will need to file reports by 7 February each year.

The report will cover the past calendar year and must include any:

*   platform information
*   reportable seller information
*   immoveable property rental information.

Reporting to sellers
--------------------

By 7 February each year, online marketplaces must send the sellers a copy of the information reported to us.

Exchange of information between countries
-----------------------------------------

In early 2025, online marketplaces must report the information they’ve collected to us. We will then exchange it with other tax authorities who use the OECD exchange framework.

Penalties for online marketplaces
---------------------------------

Penalties may apply if online marketplaces do not meet the requirements set out in the model reporting standard for digital platforms or fail to take reasonable care.

OECD model rules
----------------

We have adopted the model rules developed by the OECD for the sharing and gig economy. Refer to these rules for further guidance.

The optional extended standard for the sale of goods and vehicle rentals has not been implemented but may be considered in the future.

Online marketplaces can email us questions.
