    Enables secure information sharing online, which makes cryptocurrencies possible. Blockchain creates a shared database – but one that’s duplicated thousands (or even millions) of times across a network of computers.
    
    Most blockchain transactions are publically viewable and transparent. Every time an update is made to a blockchain database, it’s visible to everyone who has access. Transactions are also secure. Since a blockchain database isn’t stored in a single, centralised location the information it holds is easy to verify and hard for a hacker to corrupt.
    
*   Bright-line losses carried forward

    Any remaining bright-line loss is carried forward to the next year until the loss can be used.
    
*   Bright-line test
    ----------------
    
    The bright-line test means you'll pay tax on the profit made on the sale of residential property when it is sold within a certain timeframe, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies.

*   Commonly owned group
    --------------------
    
    A commonly owned group (group) of businesses is one where each business has the same owners. It does not matter whether those owners have the same proportion of ownership in each business. 
    
    A business may also be treated as being in the group if it is part of a larger group of businesses if they are centrally controlled or otherwise operate together. For example, the group:
    
    *   has a dominating shareholder or group of shareholders, and the businesses operate together as if they were one
    *   of businesses involves a complex ownership structure where the overall control is centralised and businesses are in substance one enterprise. 
    
*   Comparator period or comparison period
    --------------------------------------
    
    The comparator period falls during (either) the period beginning on either 5 January:

    *   2021 and ending at the close of 15 February 2021. 
    
    Businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue must meet the drop in revenue test set out above. However, they may select a 7-day comparison period which is before 5 January 2022 and which may be from a past year, which reflects their typical revenue.

    *   hold any shares
    *   have any shareholder decision making rights
    *   have the right to get income from the company, or have the company's income dealt with on their behalf
    *   have the right to get value from the distribution of any of the company's assets.
    
*   Controlled foreign company (CFC)
    --------------------------------

    However, control can also exist where:
    
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents have a controlling interest of more than 50%
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents control the shareholder decision rights
    *   a single New Zealand resident has a controlling interest of 40% or more, and no non-associated non resident owns a larger controlling interest.

    In brief, a regulated business or organisation must choose whether to operate under the CVC rules or non-CVC rules (as in, require the use of the My Vaccine Pass or not).  The conditions of operation that apply to the regulated business or organisation will depend upon the choice made. Operating in compliance with the CVC requirements means the business or organisation complies with the applicable conditions of operation.

    *   gather information about a customer's identity
    *   verify a customer's identity to make sure the customer is who they say they are.
    
    This process aids the detection, management and mitigation of the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
    
    You must already be, or become, a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity so that CDD can be carried out by them. If you aren't a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity, you can become one by choosing to use the service(s) provided by them.

    *   at least one of those transferors or transferees of the property is also a principal settlor of the trust
    *   all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust
    *   all principal settlors are [close family associates](~/link.aspx?_id=600B8E590D714107855D9E187D6F8658&_z=z)

*   Self-contained dwelling
    -----------------------
    
    Self-contained dwelling means it has its own cooking and bathroom facilities and its own entrance. The entrance can be from a shared accessway, for example, a hallway shared by a block of flats in the same building.
    
*   Shadow payroll
    --------------
    
    Your regular payroll pays your employee’s salary and manages their tax obligations to your country.
    
    In most cases your employee will also have tax obligations to New Zealand. You need to set up a shadow payroll in New Zealand to manage these.
    
    A shadow payroll is not needed if your employee’s salary is paid by a New Zealand employer.
    
*   Share scheme taxing date
    ------------------------

    Te tiaki tiri
    -------------
    
    Kia kaua e iti iho i te kotahi hautoru o te wā e tiakina ana te tamaiti e ētahi tāngata i ētahi whare tū motuhake.

    *   repairs and maintenance
    *   insurance
    *   interest paid
    *   rates.
    
*   Shareholder continuity
    ----------------------
    
    Shareholder continuity refers to changes that have occurred to the number of shareholders and the nature of their shareholdings during the year. Continuity affects both tax losses brought forward from previous tax years and imputation credits.
    
    For a company to be able to carry its losses forward, at least 49% of shares should be held by the same shareholders through the continuity period (the year the loss was incurred through to the year it's offset). This is the shareholder continuity test.
    
    From the 2020/2021 income year, a company may also be able to carry a loss forward if they meet the requirements for the business continuity test.

*   Short-stay accommodation
    ------------------------
    
    This is when you're renting out your residential property to guests for up to 4 consecutive weeks at a time.

    --------------------------------------------
    
    An employee whose work in the host country will typically be within a 12-month period.    
      
    People who visit New Zealand on short-term business trips may be exempt from tax, depending on how long they are here. If the trip is longer than 92 days allowed under 'Amounts derived during short-term visits' (CW19) section in the Income Tax Act or 183 days in some double tax agreements, New Zealand tax needs to be paid.

*   Single European Payments Area (SEPA)
    ------------------------------------
    
    The Single European Payments Area allows participating countries to more easily pay electronically in euros across certain borders. The SEPA is made up mostly of members of the European Union, but also some other countries and territories.

    Use of money interest (UOMI) is not a penalty. It's an amount charged or credited to pay for "use of money" in the same way banks charge or credit interest.
    
    The use of money interest rules are designed to encourage people to pay the right amount of tax at the right time, compensate people who pay too much tax and compensate the Government if people pay too little tax.
    
*   Utility tokens

*   Viable and ongoing
    ------------------
    
    A viable business is a business with a plan in place to make sure it can keep trading. This generally means the owner has good reason to believe it's more likely than not that the business or organisation will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within the next 18 months and its current overdue debts. Your accountant may be able to provide this advice. 
    
    You must keep any evidence of the business or organisation's ongoing viability at the time of requesting the CSP, as we may audit your application in the future. 
    
    This evidence could include, for example: 
    
    *   a cash-flow forecast for the business or organisation for the short term

*   Blockchain technology
    ---------------------
    
    Enables secure information sharing online, which makes cryptocurrencies possible. Blockchain creates a shared database – but one that’s duplicated thousands (or even millions) of times across a network of computers.
    
    Most blockchain transactions are publically viewable and transparent. Every time an update is made to a blockchain database, it’s visible to everyone who has access. Transactions are also secure. Since a blockchain database isn’t stored in a single, centralised location the information it holds is easy to verify and hard for a hacker to corrupt.
    
*   Blocks
    ------
    
    Blocks contain transactional information such as the time, value and participants in a trade. Each block contains many transactions.
    
*   Bright-line losses carried forward
    ----------------------------------
    
    If you sell a residential property at a loss, your total costs are more than the sale price of the property.
    
    If the bright-line property rule applies to the sale, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale.
    
    Any remaining bright-line loss is carried forward to the next year until the loss can be used.
    
*   Bright-line test
    ----------------
    
    The bright-line test means you'll pay tax on the profit made on the sale of residential property when it is sold within a certain timeframe, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies.

    *   registering for GST
    *   registering as an employer
    *   filing tax returns

    --------------------
    
    A commonly owned group (group) of businesses is one where each business has the same owners. It does not matter whether those owners have the same proportion of ownership in each business. 
    
    A business may also be treated as being in the group if it is part of a larger group of businesses if they are centrally controlled or otherwise operate together. For example, the group:
    
    *   has a dominating shareholder or group of shareholders, and the businesses operate together as if they were one
    *   of businesses involves a complex ownership structure where the overall control is centralised and businesses are in substance one enterprise.

    Businesses or organisations with highly seasonal revenue must meet the drop in revenue test set out above. However, they may select a 7-day comparison period which is before 5 January 2022 and which may be from a past year, which reflects their typical revenue. 
    
*   Competent authorities
    ---------------------
    
    Competent authorities are the people in tax jurisdictions responsible for implementing a double tax agreement.
    
*   Conditions or protections that defer the share scheme taxing date
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    For example, the taxing date will be deferred if:
    
    *   the employee is required to sell their shares back to the employer (other than for market value) if they leave the company, or
    *   the employee has the benefit of a limited recourse loan.
    
*   Connected persons
    -----------------
    
    Connected persons are people with a beneficial interest in trust property and effective levels of control over the trust. These include:
    
    *   people who have made settlements on the trust - that is, settlors
    *   people who have a power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary - that is, appointors

*   Control interest
    ----------------
    
    Control interests are used to work out if a foreign company is a controlled foreign company (CFC).
    
    Someone has a direct control interest (sometimes called 'a controlling interest') in a foreign company if they:
    
    *   hold any shares
    *   have any shareholder decision making rights
    *   have the right to get income from the company, or have the company's income dealt with on their behalf
    *   have the right to get value from the distribution of any of the company's assets.
    
*   Controlled foreign company (CFC)
    --------------------------------
    
    Controlled foreign companies are based overseas but controlled by a small number of New Zealand residents. The company itself must not be a tax resident in New Zealand or must be treated as foreign under a double tax agreement.
    
    Most commonly, 'control' means total ownership of the non resident company by a New Zealand resident.
    
    However, control can also exist where:
    
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents have a controlling interest of more than 50%
    *   5 or fewer New Zealand residents control the shareholder decision rights
    *   a single New Zealand resident has a controlling interest of 40% or more, and no non-associated non resident owns a larger controlling interest.

    In brief, a regulated business or organisation must choose whether to operate under the CVC rules or non-CVC rules (as in, require the use of the My Vaccine Pass or not).  The conditions of operation that apply to the regulated business or organisation will depend upon the choice made. Operating in compliance with the CVC requirements means the business or organisation complies with the applicable conditions of operation.

    A disposal includes:
    
    *   selling cryptoassets for money

    Cryptoassets are property. For us ‘cryptoassets’ are digital assets that use cryptography and blockchain technology. We see them as: 
    
    *   cryptocurrencies 
    *   crypto coins 
    *   digital tokens 
    *   cryptographic assets  
    *   digital financial assets 
    *   virtual currencies
    *   representing property or financial assets for securities like shares or debt. For example security or asset tokens like Dai and tZERO.   
    
    We do not see cryptoassets as currency or money. But they are used as payment or exchanged as a payment. So for us we’ll also see cryptocurrencies as: 
    
    *   tokens, for example Bitcoin and Litecoin (also called payment tokens, exchange tokens, intrinsic tokens or simply cryptocurrencies) 
    *   traditional payment vouchers, for example Siacoin and Dentacoin (also called ‘utility’ tokens).

*   Customer due diligence
    ----------------------
    
    Customer due diligence (CDD) is a process that is completed with a New Zealand reporting entity. As part of this process the reporting entity will need to:
    
    *   gather information about a customer's identity
    *   verify a customer's identity to make sure the customer is who they say they are.
    
    This process aids the detection, management and mitigation of the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
    
    You must already be, or become, a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity so that CDD can be carried out by them. If you aren't a customer of a New Zealand reporting entity, you can become one by choosing to use the service(s) provided by them.

*   Main home
    ---------
    
    Your main home is the property where you live for most of the time. If you have more than 1 property, it is the one you have the greatest connection to. You cannot have more than 1 main home.
    
    Which property is your main home depends on:

    *   where your immediate family lives
    *   where your personal property is kept

*   Major change

    -----------
    
    This is when you rent out your property to family or friends under your property's market value rent. The mates rate is anything under 80% of the market value.
    
    So, if rent for your property is usually $100 per night, and your friends rent it for $50, that's a mates rate. It's a mates rate because you're charging them 50% of your property's market value rent.

    In a mining pool miners combine (pool) their processing power to earn rewards. They split the rewards proportionally to their individual contributions.

*   Resident withholding tax (RWT)
    ------------------------------
    
    Resident withholding tax (RWT) is a tax that is deducted from investment income before the investor receives it.
    
    It helps people who receive investment income to pay their tax throughout the year, and makes sure that people who do not declare their investment income still have tax deducted from it. (Inland Revenue still follows up on undeclared investment income and takes action against people who do not declare it.)

*   Residual beneficiaries
    ----------------------

    The residual beneficiary does not have a fixed, vested or contingent interest in the trust property.
    
    Your trust deed may describe residual beneficiaries as a class or group – for example, children of the settlor. If this is the case, describe the class to us when registering the New Zealand foreign trust.

    *   at least one of those transferors or transferees of the property is also a principal settlor of the trust
    *   all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust

    -------
    
    Generally a settlor is a person who transfers value in cash or kind to the trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
    
    You're also a settlor if you both:
    
    *   provide financial assistance to a trust (or for the benefit of the trust) with an obligation to pay you back on demand
    *   you do not ask the trust to pay you back or you defer making the request for repayment.
    
    We can identify attempts to artificially increase the number of settlors by having friends or family become settlors of the trust. The initial settlor will be treated as the sole settlor of the trust and shortfall penalties may apply.
    
*   Shadow payroll
    --------------
    
    Your regular payroll pays your employee’s salary and manages their tax obligations to your country.
    
    In most cases your employee will also have tax obligations to New Zealand. You need to set up a shadow payroll in New Zealand to manage these.
    
    A shadow payroll is not needed if your employee’s salary is paid by a New Zealand employer.

*   Shared rental expenses
    ----------------------
    
    Shared rental expenses are those you spend on your rental property to earn income and used privately by you. For a rental property, they'll be for things like:
    
    *   utility bills
    *   internet bills
    *   repairs and maintenance
    *   insurance
    *   interest paid
    *   rates.
    
*   Shareholder continuity
    ----------------------
    
    Shareholder continuity refers to changes that have occurred to the number of shareholders and the nature of their shareholdings during the year. Continuity affects both tax losses brought forward from previous tax years and imputation credits.
    
    For a company to be able to carry its losses forward, at least 49% of shares should be held by the same shareholders through the continuity period (the year the loss was incurred through to the year it's offset). This is the shareholder continuity test.
    
    From the 2020/2021 income year, a company may also be able to carry a loss forward if they meet the requirements for the business continuity test.
