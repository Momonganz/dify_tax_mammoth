### Govt responds to Tax Working Group report

The Coalition Government today released its response to the recommendations of the independent Tax Working Group report.

The report found that on the whole New Zealand’s tax system was working well, but made a number of recommendations to improve fairness, balance and structure.

The Government is not adopting any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation and has agreed no further work is necessary on that aspect of the report.

“The final report covered all aspects of the tax system, and a number of the recommendations will now be considered for inclusion in the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme,” Grant Robertson said.

“That includes exploring options for targeting land speculation and land banking.

“We intend to direct the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing,” Grant Robertson said.

“Officials have been directed to prioritise work on the TWG’s recommendations on ways to encourage investment in significant infrastructure projects and improve the integrity of the tax system to crack down on tax dodgers,” Stuart Nash said.

A refreshed tax policy work programme will be released mid-year.

The Coalition Government reiterated it will not introduce resource rentals for water or a fertiliser tax in this term of Parliament.

Other priorities for the Government this year include progressing legislation for research and development tax incentives; GST on low-value goods from offshore suppliers; a discussion document on a digital services tax, and further work to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

Grant Robertson and Stuart Nash thanked the Tax Working Group members for their work

A summary of the Government’s responses to the recommendations is attached.

| 38  | Give favourable consideration to exempting the New Zealand Superannuation Fund from New Zealand tax obligations. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) – noting the significant economic and fiscal implications associated with this proposal. |
| **International income taxation** |     |     |
| 39  | New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. | **Note work already underway** – New Zealand is currently participating in discussions at the OECD on the future of the international tax framework |
| 40  | The Government should stand ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and if it is reasonably certain that New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. | **Note work already underway** – Officials have been directed to draft a discussion document on the options for taxing the digital economy that will come to Cabinet in May. |
| 41  | New Zealand should actively monitor developments and collaborate with other countries with respect to equalisation taxes. | **Note work already underway** – as above |
| 42  | Ensure, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. | **Note work already underway** – as above |
| **Retirement savings** |     |     |
| 43  | Consider encouraging the savings of low-income earners by carrying out one or more of the following:<br><br>a) Refund the Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) for KiwiSaver members earning up to $48,000 per annum. This refund would be clawed back for KiwiSaver members earning more than $48,000 per annum, such that members earning over $70,000 would receive no benefit.<br><br>b) Ensure that a KiwiSaver member on parental leave would receive the maximum member tax credit regardless of their level of contributions.<br><br>c) Increase the member tax credit from $0.50 per $1 of contribution to $0.75 per $1 of contribution. The contribution cap should remain unchanged.<br><br>d) Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds (10.5% and 17.5%) by five percentage points each. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP)<br><br>This work would sit alongside the Government’s broader work on KiwiSaver, which includes the default provider review and a consideration of options to increase KiwiSaver uptake and contributions. |
| 44  | Consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| **Personal income tax** |     |     |
| 45  | Recommendations on personal tax are dependent on the objectives of the Government:<br><br>a) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers.<br><br>b) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low to middle income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. | It is proposed to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. As a result there is no revenue to recycle. Consequently **it is agreed no further work is necessary**. |
| 46  | Consider increases in the bottom threshold of personal tax to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. |
| 47  | Consider combining increases in the bottom threshold with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. |
| 48  | If (47) is adopted, consider a reduction of the abatement rate of Working for Families tax credits to offset the impact of the increase. |
| 49  | Prefer increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold. |
| 50  | Consider an increase in net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries receive the same post-tax increase as other people on the same income. |
| 51  | Consider changes to tax rates and thresholds alongside any recommendations made by WEAG. |
| 52  | Do not reduce the top marginal tax rate because it is already low by international standards and it would not increase progressivity of the tax system. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| 53  | The TWG notes that many submissions called for increasing tax personal tax rates to make a material reduction in income equality through the personal tax system. These increases are precluded by the TWG’s Terms of reference and the TWG did not undertake an analysis of the options (and their effectiveness). | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| **Future of work** |     |     |
| 54  | Support Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly expanding the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers. | **Note work already underway** – additional operational funding for Inland Revenue is being put towards increasing investigations capability, public awareness campaigns, and new policy initiatives.<br><br>Inland Revenue officials are undertaking targeted consultation on a number of proposals to expand the scope of the Schedular Payments rules and address non-compliance of self-employed workers. An update on this work will be provided in the second half of 2019. |
| 55  | Support the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of ‘smart accounts’ or other technology based solutions. | **Note work already underway** – as above |
| 56  | Continue (through Inland Revenue’s current work) to use data analytics and matching information for specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. | **Note work already underway** – as above |
| 57  | Review the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 58  | Align the definition of employee and dependent contractor for tax and employment purposes. | **Note work already underway** – MBIE |

| 61  | Inland Revenue should have the ability to require a shareholder in a closely-held company to provide security to Inland Revenue if:<br><br>a) The company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; and<br><br>b) The company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and<br><br>c) There is doubt as to the ability/and or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. | **Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 62  | Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including:<br><br>a) An increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business).<br><br>b) A review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand.<br><br>c) The removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. | **Note work already underway** – see recommendation 54. |
| 63  | That Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. | **Note work already underway** – see recommendation 54. |
| 64  | Further measures to improve collection and encourage compliance, including:<br><br>a) Making directors who have an economic ownership in the company personally liable for arrears on GST and PAYE obligations (as long as there is an appropriate warning system).<br><br>b) Departure prohibition orders.<br><br>c) Aligning the standard of proof for PAYE and GST offences. | **Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 65  | The establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. | Objectives may be better achieved through greater alignment of agency policies on debt prevention and collection. **Cross-agency advice should be sought.** |
| 66  | That Inland Revenue strengthens enforcement of rules for closely-held companies. | **Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 67  | Explore options to enable the flexibility of a wider gap between the company and top personal tax rates without a reduction in the integrity of the tax system. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| **Administration of the tax system** |     |     |
| _**Tax secrecy and tax transparency**_ |     |     |
| 68  | The Government should:<br><br>a) Fund oversampling of the wealthy in existing wealth surveys.<br><br>b) Include a question on wealth in the census.<br><br>c) Request Inland Revenue regularly repeat its analysis of the tax paid by high wealth individuals.<br><br>d) Commission research on using a variety of sources of data on capital income, including administrative data, to estimate the wealth of individuals. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 69  | The TWG strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available). The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 70  | The TWG encourages Inland Revenue to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Statistics New Zealand. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |

| _**Ombudsman**_ |     |     |
| 72  | Any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman should include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise, and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new Crown debt collection agency proposed by the TWG. | **Agree no further work required** at this stage unless there is an unsustainable increase in complaints. |
| _**Taxpayer advocate service**_ |     |     |
| 73  | Establish a taxpayer advocacy service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. | **Agree no further work required.** |
| 74  | Consider a truncated tax disputes process for small taxpayers. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| _**The development of tax policy**_ |     |     |
| 75  | The following principles should be applied in public engagement on tax policy:<br><br>a) Good faith engagement by all participants.<br><br>b) Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s Māori/Crown engagement framework).<br><br>c) Earlier and more frequent engagement.<br><br>d) The use of a greater variety of engagement methods.<br><br>e) Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. | **Note work already underway** – officials have provided Ministers with a public engagement framework which incorporates the principles recommended by the TWG. Ministers are considering releasing this framework for public feedback. |
| 76  | The TWG notes the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development, and the importance of Inland Revenue maintaining deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability. | **Note work already underway** – Inland Revenue continues to be committed to investing in the technical skills and capability of their investigation staff. |
| **Legislative frameworks** |     |     |
| 77a | The TWG encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate. | **Agree no further work required** |

| **Charities** |     |     |
| 78  | Periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved. | **Note work already underway** – the Government added a review of charities and non-profit organisations to the TPWP in 2018.<br><br>Department of Internal Affairs (on behalf of the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector), is currently modernising the Charities Act 2005. |
| 79  | The TWG supports the Government’s inclusion of a review of the tax treatment of the charitable sector on its Tax Policy Work Programme, as announced in May 2018. | **Note work already underway** – on the TPWP |
| 80-81 | The TWG notes the income tax exemption for charitable entities’ trading operations was perceived by some submitters to provide an unfair advantage over commercial entities’ trading operations. The TWG notes, however, that the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities. | **Note work already underway** – see rec 78 |
| 82  | Consider whether New Zealand should apply a distinction between privately-controlled foundations and other charitable organisations | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (DIA) |
| 83  | Consider whether the deregistration tax rules could be amended to more effectively keep assets in the sector, or ensure that there is no deferral benefit through the application of these rules. | **Note work already underway** – on the TPWP |
| 84  | Review whether it is appropriate to treat some not-for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers, or, alternatively, whether it is appropriate to limit GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies such as registered charities. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 85  | Consider whether the issues identified by the TWG in relation to charities have been fully addressed or whether further action is required, following the conclusion of the review of the Charities Act 2005. | **Consider for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| **GST and financial transactions tax** |     |     |
| 86  | No reduction in the GST rate. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| 87  | No introduction of exemptions to GST. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |

| 89  | No application of GST to explicit fees charged for financial services. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| 90  | No financial transactions tax at this point in time. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| 91  | The TWG has already reported to Ministers on the issue of GST on low-value imported goods, and the Government recently introduced legislation in December 2018 advancing proposals to address the issue. | **Note work already underway** – the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced in December 2018. |
| **Corrective taxes** |     |     |
| 92  | The TWG supports developing a framework for deciding when to apply corrective taxes. | **Agree no further work required** |
| 93  | Review the rate structure of the alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. | **Agree no further work required** |
| 94  | Prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate beyond the increases currently scheduled. | **Note work already underway** – The Ministry of Health is leading cross-agency work on tobacco policy, looking at both tax and non-tax measures to support Smokefree Aotearoa 2025. |
| 95  | Develop a clearer articulation of the Government’s goals regarding sugar consumption and gambling activity. | **Agree no further work required** |
| **Housing** |     |     |
| 96  | The Productivity Commission should include vacant land taxes within its review of local government body financing. | **Consider taxing vacant land held by land-bankers as a high priority for inclusion on work programm**e (TPWP).<br><br>The Government intends to direct the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes in its inquiry into local government funding and financing. |
| 97  | Consider that vacant land taxes are best levied at the local rather than the national level. |
| 98  | Repeal the ten-year rule regarding selling property for a gain caused by changes in land use regulation. | **Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
| 99  | Require disclosure of IRD numbers on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when transferring a main home. | **Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme** (TPWP) |
