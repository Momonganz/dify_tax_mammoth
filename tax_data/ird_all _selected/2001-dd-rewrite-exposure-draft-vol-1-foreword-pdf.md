Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft iii Foreword The Government welcomes the publication of this exposure draft of the rewritten Parts A to E of the Income Tax Act 1994. Legislation that is clear, written in plain language, and easy to use has obvious advantages: it saves time, increases certainty, reduces compliance costs, reduces administrative costs, and is generally easier to comply with. Tax is an inherently complex subject, so it is especially important that the law relating to it is as clear and accessible as possible. Rewriting the Income Tax Act is a massive undertaking. The publication of this first exposure draft of rewritten legislation, which has been prepared by officials, is a milestone for the project. The exposure draft includes the rewritten legislation in what are probably the most used parts of the Act, Parts C, D, and E, which deal with income and expenditure. How that law is rewritten will have a widespread effect on those who use it. Therefore we encourage the tax community to comment to the project team on this first stage of the rewritten legislation. Your feedback is vital to the consultative process and will help to influence this and future stages of the rewrite of the Act.
