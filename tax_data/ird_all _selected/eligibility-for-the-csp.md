Any business in New Zealand that has had this drop in revenue may be eligible if they met the other criteria.

Example: Mountain Peak Adventures - booking cancellations

Mountain Peak Adventure carries on a hotel business in Queenstown. The majority of its customers are overseas travellers from Australia. Due to border restrictions a number of its Australian based customers continue to cancel their previously booked hotel accommodation because they are not able to travel to New Zealand - Mountain Peak Adventure experiences a 60% drop in revenue as a result of these cancellations.  

  Mountain Peak Adventure’s 60% drop in revenue caused by the halt to the trans-Tasman Covid-19 bubble and is not due to one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CSP even though they have experienced a drop in revenue. 

Example: Hungry Dragon - complying with the non-CVC rules

Hungry Dragon Limited operates a popular Chinese restaurant in Nelson. The restaurant on a usual day can only host around 10 people. Due to NZ moving to the Red setting under the CFC the restaurant can now only host 5 people or less. Additionally, due to the lack of space, it is challenging to have the required physical distancing between customers. As a result of this, Hungry Dragon Limited does not find it economical to host customers within the restaurant.  

The directors of Hungry Dragon Limited decide to only offer a takeaway option for their customers so that they are still able to operate. They display their CVC status (indicating that they are non-CVC rule compliant) and have systems or processes to prevent customers from entering their premises except to enable contactless collection of goods. However, even after complying with the non-CVC rules, Hungry Dragon Limited suffers a drop in revenue of 45% due to only being able to offer a takeaway service. 

Hungry Dragon Limited may be eligible to receive the CSP as they are complying with the non-CVC rules, they have taken all practicable steps to minimise the drop in revenue and their drop in revenue is more than 40% as a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances. 

Example: Good Boy Limited - complying with the CVC rules

Good Boy Limited operates a bakery and café in Ponsonby, Auckland. Since New Zealand moved to the Red settings under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, Good Boy Limited has set up their operations so that they comply with the CVC rules. This involves their shop displaying their CVC status, setting up systems and processes to verify their customers’ CVC status, adhering to the fixed capacity limits and relevant seating requirements. Even after complying with the CVC requirements, Good Boy Limited has suffered from a drop in revenue of 50% due to the lack of customers as people choose to work from home as a result of the Omicron outbreak.

Good Boy Limited may be eligible to receive the CSP as they are complying with the CVC requirements and their drop in revenue is more than 40% and is a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances.

Example: Ms Goldie Locks - COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate (CVC) requirements

Ms Goldie Locks operates a small café in the Wellington CBD. Ms Locks does not believe in vaccines and is not happy with the CVC requirements. Under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, hospitality venues can open in the Red setting as long as they follow the CVC requirements, which involves complying with the CVC rules or non-CVC rules. The CVC rules require businesses to have systems and processes to check that each person (including a worker) who is at the premises is carrying a CVC (other than a person who it is reasonable to believe is under the age of 12 years and 3 months). If a hospitality business chooses not to follow the CVC rules, and instead follows the non-CVC rules, it can open for takeaway only.  

Ms Locks does not want to open her café for takeaways only and does not feel the need to follow any of the CVC rules or non-CVC rules detailed in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021. She continues to trade by allowing customers into her café without regard to whether they carry a CVC.  Ms Locks has chosen not to comply with the CVC requirements. Therefore, Ms Locks is not eligible for the CSP, even if the 40% drop in revenue was met.  

Example: Ministry of Culture and Heritage - one off emergency grant

Jonty Glass is a self-employed upcoming artist and had an exhibition planned for 25 February 2022. Due to the increasing COVID-19 infections in the New Zealand community and the restrictions placed on the number of people that can gather in one place, Mr Clark’s exhibition is postponed which means he is unable to sell any of his art works. He applies for and receives the Ministry of Culture and Heritage emergency grant of $5,000 for self-employed individuals. On this basis he is ineligible for the first CSP payment.  

Example: Clockwork Glass - not taking all reasonably practical steps (if any) to minimise revenue losses

Clockwork Glass Ltd operates a restaurant in Auckland which is usually open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner service. The restaurant backs on to 2 large office buildings and most of its customers are staff from these offices.

Following the move to phase 2 of the Omicron response, being 15 February 2022, the director of Clockwork Glass continues to operate as usual 7 days a week. Due to the large number of COVID-19 cases in the New Zealand community, most of Clockwork Glass’s customers have decided to work from home. Clockwork Glass simply decides to close the business in response to the large number of COVID-19 cases and their loss of customers, as opposed to exploring options of how to run the business differently (such as different hours and methods of operation) to adjust to the changing circumstances. Clockwork Glass does not take all reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue losses and therefore, they are not eligible for the CSP.  

However, suppose that instead of shutting their doors, Clockwork Glass see they are still getting customers for the dinner service. In order to minimise losses, they decide to no longer open for the lunch services but still operate their dinner services. These would be reasonably practical steps to minimise their revenue loss. 

Example: Sparkle Electrical - staff Isolating (CPF and COVID-19 Infections) 

Sparkle Electrical does wiring for businesses. Due to the rising numbers of COVID-19 infections in the New Zealand community, 6 of their 10 staff members were identified as close contacts and need to self-isolate.

The number of employees that Sparkle Electrical had working for them has now reduced by more than half. This has impacted their ability to service their clientele and has resulted in their revenue dropping by 50% compared to the week before New Zealand moved to Phase 2 of the Omicron response being 15 February 2022 (being a typical week).

Sparkle Electrical may be eligible for the CSP as their drop in revenue is more than 40% and is a result of one or more of the COVID-19 circumstances.
