### Government to adopt Shewan recommendations

The Government is acting on all recommendations from the Shewan Inquiry into foreign trust disclosure rules, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse announced today.

The Inquiry made a number of recommendations which propose improvements to registration and disclosure of information, anti-money laundering rules and increased information sharing between government agencies.

“The Government has always been open to making improvements to New Zealand’s already strong tax settings if that was warranted,” Mr English says.

“The Shewan Inquiry’s recommendations are sensible and well-reasoned and by acting on all of them, we will ensure that our foreign trust disclosure rules are strengthened and New Zealand’s reputation is protected.

“The changes to the foreign trust rules are a matter that the Government intends to move quickly on.

“The Government intends to introduce legislation to require a register that is searchable by Internal Affairs and the Police, and annual disclosure requirements in the coming months.”

Mr Woodhouse says that while the Government agrees with all of the recommendations from the Shewan inquiry, the way in which a small number are implemented will be tweaked.

“We have already committed to a course of action for strengthening New Zealand’s anti-money laundering rules, which will bring in more comprehensive requirements for lawyers, accountants, real estate agents and others,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“For example, lawyers and accountants will be included in AML/CFT requirements as soon as practicable, However due to issues around legal privilege and regime supervision this will form part of the more substantial AML/CFT reform programme already underway, which is being expedited.”

| Review of which government agency should be responsible for administration | The registration process be the responsibility of IRD initially. This to be reviewed in the context of the rapidly expanding reporting requirements imposed by international agreements to which New Zealand is a signatory. It is possible that another agency such as the Companies Office (within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment) may be better placed to act as the registering and supervisory agency. | Agree | Registration process to be included in the August 2016 tax bill.<br><br>The review of which agency should act as the registering and supervisory agency should be undertaken after the new disclosure rules have bedded in. |
| Information to be supplied to Inland Revenue upon initial disclosure / registration | The information required to be disclosed to IRD when a foreign trust registers be expanded from the current IR 607 disclosures to include the name, email address, foreign residential address, country of tax residence and Tax Identification Number of-<br><br>*   the settlor or settlors;<br>*   the protector (if there is any);<br>*   non-resident trustees;<br>*   any other natural person who has effective control of the trust (including through a chain of control or ownership); and<br>*   beneficiaries of fixed trusts, including the underlying beneficiary where a named beneficiary is a nominee.<br><br>For discretionary trusts,<br><br>1- any class of beneficiary not listed on the trust deed must be listed, and<br><br>2- each class of beneficiary be described in sufficient detail to enable identity to be established at the time of a distribution or when vested rights are exercised (the naming of discretionary beneficiaries being impractical).<br><br>The trust deed be required to be filed with the registration form. | Agree | Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 |

| Registration and annual filing fee | Foreign trusts be required to pay a registration and annual filing fee to recover the costs to the Crown of administering the foreign trust regime. The Inquiry considers a fee of $500 at registration and an annual fee of the same amount would be reasonable. | Agree, with modification.<br><br>The registration fee will be $270 with an annual filing fee of $50, because of the cost to the Crown of administering the foreign trust regime.  The level of fees will be able to be modified by Order in Council to reflect future changes in costs. | Tax bill to be introduced in August 2016 |
| AML: Early revocation of current exemption for lawyers and accountants from AML/CFT reporting requirements | For services provided to foreign trusts, consideration be given to the removal by Order in Council in the short term (prior to 31 December 2016) of the regulation that excludes lawyers and accountants from AML reporting requirements. The proposed removal of this exclusion when phase 2 of the AML regime is implemented, as announced by the Government in May 2016, will address this recommendation but may not be effective until towards the end of 2017 or later. | Lawyers and accountants will be included in AML/CFT requirements as soon as practicable, but there are issues surrounding legal privilege and regime supervision that can only be dealt with through primary legislation and not regulation.<br><br>Removal of the exclusion for lawyers and accountants will therefore be progressed as part of the more substantial AML/CFT reform programme underway. | The revocation of the exemption will occur as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms.<br><br>Legislation will be introduced later in 2016, and is expected to be passed in the first half of 2017. |
| AML: Mandatory requirement to verify in all cases the underlying source of funds | The AML legislation or regulations be revised to include a mandatory requirement to verify in all cases the underlying source of funds or wealth settled on a foreign trust. | Agree | Consider as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. |
| AML: guidelines for customer due diligence | Expanded guidelines be issued explaining the scope of customer due diligence required in establishing and verifying beneficial ownership, effective control and source of funds in complex multi-layered trust structures. These should include a series of detailed worked examples. | Agree | Currently drafting.  Note impact of FATF and the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. |
| AML: Suspicious transaction reporting not through a New Zealand bank | The legislation or regulations that govern suspicious transaction reporting to the Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police be revised to facilitate the reporting of actual or proposed transactions that have not or will not necessarily go through a New Zealand bank. | Agree | Consider as part of the AML/CFT Phase II reforms. |
| AML: Greater profile for suspicious transaction reporting | Greater profile, coupled with training recommendations, be given to the obligation on trust service providers to report suspicious transactions. | Agree | On-going |
| Review of current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between New Zealand government agencies | A review be undertaken of the current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between the three agencies (IRD, Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police and Department of Internal Affairs) with supervisory responsibility for disclosures by foreign trusts (and other entities). The purpose of the review, which could coincide with the introduction of phase 2 of the AML regime, would be to determine the financial and efficiency gains and other implications (including secrecy considerations) of sharing strategic intelligence and other information between agencies. | Agree.  Note that it may be appropriate to also include other relevant agencies in the review. | No immediate legislative change required.<br><br>This review to be undertaken after the initial changes to the disclosure rules have bedded in and possibly coincide with phase 2 of the AML regime/ reform of tax secrecy rules. |
