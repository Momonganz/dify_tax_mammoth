Your payer, for example a bank or financial institution, deducts [resident withholding tax (RWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
.

When you have RWT exempt status you do not have to pay this tax. This means your payer stops deducting the tax from payments made to you. 

Who can apply for a RWT exemption
---------------------------------

You can apply for an exemption from paying RWT if you're a:

*   amateur sports promoter
*   Board of Trustees

Approving RWT exemption applications
------------------------------------

We'll tell you if your application is approved. We'll also add your IRD number to the online RWT exemption register.

You'll need to tell your payer, for example your bank or fund manager, you have an exemption and the expiry date (if applicable).
