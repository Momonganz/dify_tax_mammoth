Focus on Pacific Peoples' representation
========================================

Pacific people make up 9.3% of our workforce, with 7% being Pacific women. The New Zealand population is approximately 8% Pacific peoples.

Today we currently have a 13.5%  pay gap across all Pacific peoples and 24.6% for Pacific women, being the largest pay gap for any Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake population.

As with our all pay gaps, our Pacific peoples’ pay gap is driven by representation.

Our data shows that 46% of our Pacific people are in Customer Service Officer Level 1 roles - this is one of the lowest paid roles in the organisation. Representation in the Team Lead group is 9.2%, reducing to just 3.7% in management (tier 4-5) and 2.9% in senior leadership (tier 1-3) level roles.

Representation for Pacific peoples in team leader, management and senior leadership roles has remained relatively stable from 2022 to 2024. In the past year there has been a reduction in representation in all leadership roles, and as a result an increase in the pay gap, although minimal. This highlights a need to continue focusing on representation of Pacific peoples in leadership roles.

| Pacific Wāhine | 6.59% | 6.84% | 7.04% |
| Pacific Tāne | 2.38% | 2.31% | 2.19% |

The percentage of Pacific peoples in Inland Revenue has been stable from 2022 to 2024.

Understanding the lived experiences
-----------------------------------

We have been working alongside members of our Pacific communities at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake to understand their experience in relation to development and careers.

The experiences they have shared cross many of our people processes, leadership including the capability of people leaders, the behaviours we demonstrate and our working environment in general.

We have worked in partnership to establish the way forward and a series of actions to continue to support a positive shift in representation of our Pacific people.

Taking action
-------------

Engagement and insights from across our Pacific community have informed actions in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmaps. These include:

*   leadership development 
*   recruitment practices that are inclusive of cultural needs and create a supportive experience for Pacific peoples
*   an open and visible approach to set people up for success when they apply for external development programmes aimed at underrepresented communities (such as Tū Mau Mana Moana).

We are also supporting the progress of a development programme for Pacific peoples, developed with Pacific peoples.

Other actions in this roadmap that relate to our talent system, access to learning that supports individual needs and the cultural capability of people leaders will all contribute to creating a positive change to Pacific peoples’ representation.

Creating outcomes
-----------------

The overall outcome of this focus is to support a positive shift in the representation of Pacific peoples at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake, and to enable increased outcomes for Pacific peoples in terms of career development and aspirations. For specific representation outcomes see the Representation goals section of the roadmap.
