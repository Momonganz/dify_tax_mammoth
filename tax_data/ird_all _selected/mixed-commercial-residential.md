Mixed commercial and residential situations
===========================================

Tax is different for commercial and residential property, but some mixed situations also have their own special tax rules.

Airbnb and other short-stay accommodation
-----------------------------------------

This type of accommodation is residential, even if you’re running it as a business.

### Special depreciation rule - 4 or more units in a single building

If you have 4 or more units in a single building that you run as short-stay accommodation, you can claim depreciation on these units. For example, apartments within an apartment building.

Mixed business and residence
----------------------------

If you rent out part of your property to a business and part as a residence, the property is part commercial and part residential. For example, if you have a 2-storey building with a shop downstairs and a long-term rental apartment upstairs.

You need to work out how much each part is, then share out your costs accordingly. For example, 40% commercial and 60% residential.

Renting out your house to a business
------------------------------------

If you’ve converted your house and rented it out as a business premises, it’s fully commercial property. For example, a dentist or doctor’s surgery.

Boarding houses
---------------

Boarding houses have special rules for income tax and GST depending on how many rooms they have and whether those rooms are self-contained.

### GST rules

Any boarding house is commercial property for GST. 

[Are you operating a boarding house? - Tenancy Services website](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/starting-a-tenancy/boarding-houses/are-you-operating-a-boarding-house/)

### Income tax rules

For income tax, your boarding house is commercial property if it has:

*   a minimum of 10 boarding rooms that are not self-contained
*   shared living facilities, including kitchens and living areas available to all residents
*   servicing and management taken care of by the business.

In this case, it’s called a ‘boarding establishment’.

If you do not meet these requirements, your boarding house is residential property and you’re limited in how much interest you can claim against your income.
