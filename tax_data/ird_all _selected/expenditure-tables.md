Ngā tūtohi utu tautoko tamaiti Child support expenditure tables
===============================================================

The income ranges are based on average weekly earnings for the June quarter of the previous child support year.

We use the average weekly earnings provided by Statistics New Zealand to create an annual figure.

Expenditure tables for 2025
---------------------------

The tables below are based on the June 2023 average weekly earnings.

To calculate per child expenditure values when there are at least 2 children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age groups first use the 12 and under table using the total number of children then dividing the result by the number of children. This gives a per child expenditure value for each child aged 12 and under.

Next use the 13 and over table again using the total number of children then dividing the result by the number of children. This gives a per child expenditure value for each child aged 13 and over.

Children aged 12 and under
