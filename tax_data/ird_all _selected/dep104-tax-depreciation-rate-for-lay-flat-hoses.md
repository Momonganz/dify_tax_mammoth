Tax Depreciation Rate for lay-flat hoses
========================================

This determination sets a depreciation rate for lay flat hoses used for hire equipment business purposes.

* * *

**Note to draft Determination:**

The Commissioner has been asked to consider a depreciation rate for lay-flat hoses used for hire equipment business purposes.

Lay-flat hoses are generally viewed by the Commissioner as a component of a pump set and not a separate depreciable item. However, in the context of a hire equipment business, due to the variety of lengths that may be required, lay-flat hoses are often hired out as a piece of equipment separate to other equipment, so in these circumstances are viewed as separate depreciable property. The general determination will be available only to hire equipment businesses.
