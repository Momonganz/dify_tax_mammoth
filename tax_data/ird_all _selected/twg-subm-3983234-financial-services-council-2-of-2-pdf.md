The table uses 100% gearing as one example. This means that the rental property is fully funded by debt and there is no equity investment. Such gearing is possible if an investor uses equity in their own home as security to purchase rental properties. A professional couple who have $400,000 equity in their $500,000 home can borrow $1 million to purchase two $500,000 houses to rent out. The couple have then used $200,000 of equity in their own home so that the bank is prepared to lend the full $1 million to purchase the rental properties. For tax purposes the two rental properties are 100% geared (funded by debt). The couple can then deduct the full interest cost, to the extent it exceeds rental income, from their other professional, income. 4HEABOVETABLEISEXPRESSEDINTERMSOFREALEFFECTIVETAXRATES ‚ÄúNew Zealand stands out compared to comparable economies by having one of the highest tax biases in favour of investing in real estate and against investing in financial assets (such as KiwiSaver and bank term deposits).‚Äù PAGE 6 The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand The Tax Bias has Important Consequences This tax bias against financial instruments used to build up a RETIREMENTFUNDMATTERS)TPENALISESSUCHSAVINGSANDMAKES ITHARDFORPEOPLETOSAVETOMEETTHEIRRETIREMENTOBJECTIVE 4HE3AVINGS7ORKING'ROUPESTIMATEDTHATONREASONABLE assumptions up to 90% of a person‚Äôs retirement income comes from the tax penalised compounding investment income and only 10% from the initial annual contributions out of salaries ANDWAGESMADEOVERAPERSONSWORKINGLIFE 7HENITCOMESTOACCUMULATINGSAVINGSWHETHERTAXISLEVIED each year as income accrues (the tax treatment of KiwiSaver and bank term deposits) versus taxing only when the savings are withdrawn (the tax treatment of a property taxed on gains when it is sold) makes a big difference to the eventual post-tax SAVINGFUNDTHELONGERTHESAVINGSACCUMULATE The retirement income that a person can expect to be generated from KiwiSaver or similar savings is therefore largely going to be FROMTHECOMPOUNDINGINCOMETHESCHEMEGENERATES4AXINGTHIS compounding income substantially reduces the source of 90% of EXPECTEDRETIREMENTINCOME This simply reflects the importance of compounding interest INBUILDINGUPASUBSTANTIALFUNDOFSAVINGSOVERTIME4HISIS DEMONSTRATEDINTHEFOLLOWINGGRAPH4HISSHOWSHOWANINITIAL $100 deposit grows over 50 years to $1,842 if untaxed, $1,319 IFTAXEDONLYWHENWITHDRAWNANDONLYIFTAXEDANNUALLY ONANACCRUALBASIS)NOTHERWORDSINTHISEXAMPLETAXINGTHE deposit earnings reduces its value to the saver by about one third but taxing those earnings as they accrue year by year reduces the SAVINGSBY THE IMPACT ON VALUE OF TAXATION ON A REALISATION BASIS YEARS VALUE ($)            05102045152530354050 TAX FREE TAX ON REALISATION TAXED AS ACCR UED Assumptions: nominal return of 6%, marginal tax rate of 30%. $100 is invested for up to 50 years. www.fsc.org.nz PAGE 7 This tax bias also encourages people to invest in housing not lNANCIALINSTRUMENTS7HEREASlNANCIALINVESTMENTSARELIKELYTO be used to increase the productive potential of the economy, more jobs and higher future incomes, tax induced housing investment ISLIKELYTOFLOWTHROUGHTOHIGHERLANDPRICES4HISDOESLITTLE if anything to increase the real wealth of New Zealand nor our ABILITYTOEARNHIGHERINCOMES-OREOVERMUCHOFOURHOUSING INVESTMENTISLIKELYTOBEFUNDEDULTIMATELYBYOFFSHOREBORROWING The tax system encourages offshore borrowing so that New :EALANDERSCANBIDAGAINSTEACHOTHERTOINCREASELANDPRICES As a result housing becomes increasingly less affordable for lower INCOMEEARNERSASDEMONSTRATEDBYTHEFOLLOWINGGRAPH Numerous government reports have concluded that this flows through to a low performing economy, lower incomes and less jobs, an economy that is vulnerable to offshore financial crises, unaffordable housing costs, and a higher exchange rate that MAKESITDIFlCULTFOREXPORTERSTOCOMPETEONWORLDMARKETS This is the result of tax rules that penalise saving in financial instruments and provide subsidies to housing and alternative INVESTMENTS4HELEVELOFSUBSIDYFORHOUSINGISVERYHIGH4HETAX subsidy on owner occupied housing is estimated to be $4 billion PERANNUM4HISISABOUTTWICETHELEVELOFASSISTANCETHE#ROWN spends each year to meet the housing needs of lower income New Zealanders through rent subsidies for state home tenants ANDINTHEACCOMMODATIONSUPPLEMENT)TISNOWONDERTHATAN ESTIMATEDOFHOUSEHOLDWEALTHISINTHEFORMOFHOUSING It is not a surprise that most New Zealanders do not think they ARESAVINGENOUGHTOFUNDTHESORTOFRETIREMENTTHEYWANT 3OURCE2ESERVE"ANKOF.EW:EALAND"RIGGSAND.G  RATIO OF AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE TO AVERAGE HOUSEOLD DISPOSABLE INCOME YEARS VALUE OF RATIO  6 5 4 3 2 1 0 19621968198019861992199820042010196519831989199520012013 ‚ÄúThe level of subsidy for housing is very high.
