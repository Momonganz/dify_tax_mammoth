### There's more to Inland Revenue than meets the eye

If there's a little voice telling you, “but Inland Revenue is just boring tax stuff”, rest assured – it's a common misconception. The truth is there's so much more to us than tax. Sure, it's a big part of what we do, but the bottom line is we're here to help New Zealanders. We do that in lots of ways, which make fulfilling, challenging and purpose-driven careers for those who are part of it.

The work of our Policy team is a great example of the scale and variety of what we do, such as complex social or environmental policy that helps inform the drafting of laws. If policy with real meaning and purpose is what you're passionate about, you'll be in your element here.
