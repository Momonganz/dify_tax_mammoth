We have consistently signalled extending the refundabiliW ~ is~0'fis once further policy work had been completed. 4. T is ~~~\\'eks agreement to draft legislation that will broaden the refundability !!O isi re. We propose that from the 2020/21 income year, refundability is broadly o:Y~ ifaJi le . This broader refundability would be subject to a cap based on the amount o t'payro11' 1 taxes paid by a firm in each year (proposed cap). The proposed cap would not apply to tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers, and would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 5. We have considered whether tax exempt organisations should be eligible for refundability. We believe that all tax exempt organisations, except organisations receiving tax exempt income under section CW 9 and 10 2 of the Income Tax Act, should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Background 6. The R&D Tax Incentive provides tax credits to firms undertaking R&D. Reducing the amount of income tax paid by these firms lowers the cost of their R&D, thereby incentivising firms to undertake more R&D. This is a key policy to support the 1 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2 CW 9 applies to dividends derived from foreign companies and CW 10 applies to dividends within New Zealand wholly­ owned groups. 1 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Government’s goal of raising the amount of R&D undertaken and grow a more innovative economy. 7. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill has been enacted and the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has commenced from 1 April 2019 for most businesses 3 . 8. The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes. Consequently, there was insufficient time to resolve some complex issues before the legislation was drafted. The major issue requiring further consideration was refundability of tax credits. 9. Refundability refers to paying out R&D tax credits if a business has insufficient income tax liability. That is, if a business has made a tax loss or its income tax liability is less than the R&D tax credits it has earned. An alternative to refunding the credit is to allow firms to carry their surplus credits forward and use them when they move into a tax paying position. 10. Cabinet agreed to a limited approach to refundability for the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive. We committed to review the policy that would apply from the second year. 11. This paper seeks agreement to a proposal for broader availability of refundability of tax credits that will apply from the 2020/21 income year. 12. This proposal also addresses the position of organisations that receive tax exempt income (tax exempt organisations). Because these organisations generally do not have an income tax liability, the only way they will benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive is if their credits are refunded. In general, we propose that tax exempt organisations should not be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive, but we consider an exception should be made for levy bodies. Refundability is an important feature in the R&D Tax Incentive 13. Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D are able to immediately benefit from the tax credits they are eligible for under the R&D Tax Incentive. For instance, an established business can apply its tax credits to offset tax it would pay on profits generated in other parts of the business. Similarly, a large conglomerate can support a loss-making R&D division through profits from other parts of a business. By contrast, an early stage R&D intensive firm may not be able to benefit from the tax credit until a much later date, if at all if it never attains profitability or experiences a breach in shareholder continuity. 14. Refundability provides the financial incentive for R&D when it is most needed. In most cases, a firm will incur R&D expenditure prior to receiving revenue from commercialising its product. Therefore, not only are early stage R&D-intensive firms more likely to be in loss, they are also more likely to be cash constrained. For these firms, cash today will be much more valuable than a credit that is carried forward, 3 The R&D Tax Incentive applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year, which means the date from which it applies depends on the balance date of each individual claimant. For most standard balance date (31 March) claimants, the R&D Tax Incentive will apply from 1 April 2019. 2 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    especially as they risk losing their credits if they breach the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity rules 4 . 15. Enabling firms in tax loss to have their credits refunded provides a more powerful incentive for them to undertake R&D. 16. However, paying out to businesses, rather than reducing the amount of tax they pay, increases the risk of fraud. This could destabilise the R&D Tax Incentive and has been an issue in other jurisdictions 5 . The risk is not particular to R&D tax credits and arises in other parts of the tax system such as donor tax credits and GST refunds. 17. Refundability also increases the likelihood that firms will claim the R&D Tax Incentive, which will result in a higher fiscal cost. In countries where credits are refunded, growth in the amount of R&D claimed, and hence fiscal cost growth, is faster amongst those firms getting refunds. Discussions with officials in Australia and the UK suggest that some of this increased R&D is of marginal quality. Cash payments for small, start-up firms are highly attractive for some firms so encourage reclassifying other expenditure as R&D or claiming for activity that is not R&D. 18. These conflicting drivers are reflected in how refundability is treated in other countries. Across the OECD, though most countries have an R&D tax credit, only half provide refundability. Of those that do, almost all apply further constraints. Australia, for instance, only has refundability for small to medium sized firms and has introduced legislation to cap the amount that is refunded. The UK is also consulting on a proposal to cap the refund for small and medium sized firms. 19. We note that New Zealand’s R&D Tax Incentive contains features to promote integrity of the scheme and ensure its sustainability over the long term. These include the requirement for R&D activity to primarily occur in New Zealand, the system of in-year approval (starting in 2020/21), and the exclusion of claims if a firm’s R&D expenditure is below a $50,000 threshold. Nonetheless, we consider it sensible to be aware of how risks have emerged in other countries and therefore how we can build safeguards into the New Zealand scheme. Proposals for refundability for firms in loss 20. Our starting point is that refundability is a desirable policy because it will encourage more firms to undertake R&D. However, to ensure the scheme’s long-term sustainability, we consider it prudent to constrain how much can be refunded. 21. The principles we have applied in developing the proposals in this paper are: 21.1 The policy should be simple for firms to understand and comply with. 4 The R&D tax credit shareholder continuity rules are very similar to the tax loss shareholder continuity rules. They require businesses to maintain shareholder continuity of 49% or more to carry forward their R&D tax credits from one period to the next. 5 For instance the UK Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D Tax Relief for SMEs’. 3 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    21.2 Consistent with the underlying approach to the R&D tax incentive, refundability should be broadly available rather than applying selectively to particular types of firms. 21.3 We have avoided situations where a change in a firm’s circumstances alters its eligibility for refundable tax credits. In Australia, if a firm’s turnover grows to exceed $20 million per year, it is no longer eligible to have its credits refunded. 22. The recommended proposal on refundability for firms is: 22.1 All firms should be entitled to a refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed cap) 6 . 22.2 The proposed cap would not apply to limit refundability of tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. 22.3 The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 23. The proposed cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Some overseas jurisdictions counter this risk by limiting R&D tax credit refunds to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm. This is a simple and unobtrusive test but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE 7 . Consequently, we propose that additional payroll- related taxes paid and payments to approved research providers be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. 24. Nonetheless, we anticipate that some firms may not be able to receive a full refund of their tax credits in the year in which they are earned as a result of this policy. 25. We note that the R&D Tax Incentive is not the only instrument that can assist the early stage firms that may be affected by this policy. MBIE, in conjunction with Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, is leading a programme of work to review our interventions for R&D intensive start-ups in light of the shifting R&D funding environment. This includes: a review of Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Project Grants; reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out scheme; and a commitment to a refreshed and more ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through the New Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high-growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology. Tax exempt organisations 26. There are different types of tax exempt organisations, including charities, some levy bodies, public authorities and local authorities, sports promoting bodies, and science 6 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 7 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. 4 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    and industrial research promoting bodies. A common feature is that they do not pay income tax, so have no income tax liability against which to offset their R&D tax credits. Therefore, these organisations will only benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive if their credits are refunded. 27. There are arguments for and against these types of organisations having their tax credits refunded. In general, the argument for is that the R&D they undertake is potentially valuable and enabling them to benefit from the tax credit could stimulate them to do more R&D. 28. The argument against is that these organisations are outside the tax system so should not benefit from incentives provided from within the tax system 29. However, the specifics of these arguments vary with the type of tax exempt organisation, so it is useful to consider each type separately. Levy bodies 30. Levy bodies receive levy payments from their members, which are generally taxable businesses. These payments are then used to fund levy bodies’ R&D activities, which are performed for the benefit of levy body members. The R&D performed by and funded through levy bodies is fundamentally business R&D. 31. Levy bodies are not by definition tax exempt organisations, but some may receive tax exempt income. A carve-in is proposed for them, as these entities do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions) 32. We propose that levy bodies would have fully refundable R&D tax credits 8 . Charities 33. Charities also undertake valuable R&D. However, we propose that charitable organisations be ineligible for refundable tax credits, even though they are not currently excluded from receiving the Growth Grant. 34. Charities do not pay income tax, they receive GST concessions 9 , and are exempt from FBT. Also, they benefit from the donor tax credit regime (which provides tax credits to those who donate to charities), as these credits incentivise individuals and businesses to donate to charities. In short, charities receive Government support. These benefits mean that charities’ cash flow is enhanced by provisions in the tax system, and they do not have their profits top-sliced as a tax paying organisation does. Therefore, we do not consider it appropriate to extend further benefits to charities through the tax system. 35. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of determining eligibility for the R&D Tax Incentive. We propose removing 8 Levy bodies that receive other Government funding for some of their R&D activities would only be eligible for R&D tax credits to the extent their R&D activities are not already subsidised by the Government. 9 The current GST treatment of charities is concessionary, relative to other organisations, because it allows charities almost full input tax deductibility even if very few taxable supplies are made. 5 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    this rule for consistency and excluding them from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. 36. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, we are not proposing to include broader association rules. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even a business controlled by that charity, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, that could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Māori businesses 37. Māori businesses may structure their affairs differently from non-Māori businesses for a variety of reasons. The R&D Tax Incentive has broader eligibility for different forms of business entities than the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant regime, which required specific entity eligibility rules to allow some Māori businesses to qualify. 38. Māori authorities are not tax exempt - they pay tax at 17.5% rather than at the company rate of 28%. Māori organisations that carry out R&D activities should be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. A small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities, but businesses that are partially controlled by these entities would not be charities so would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Other tax exempt organisations 39. For the avoidance of doubt, we propose that other tax exempt organisations including local authorities be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. This was the original policy intent, established as part of the initial policy development of the Incentive, but this exclusion was not included in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill. Local authorities have the ability to raise the revenue required to perform R&D activities through rates. The R&D tax incentive should not be required to incentivise R&D activities by local authorities. 40 Within the Income Tax Act, there is provision for income from dividends in certain circumstances (CW 9 and CW 10) to be tax exempt. In the original legislation we provided for receipt of such income to not affect eligibility for the tax incentive or refunds. We propose this should continue to be the case. Anticipated further work 41. Establishing a robust policy on refundability rounds out the work programme for establishing the R&D Tax Incentive, but we anticipate other refinements and developments in the years ahead. These include, but may not be limited to: 41.1 Changes to make the R&D Tax Incentive more attractive for recipients. An important issue for many firms is when they will receive R&D tax credit payments. Growth Grant recipients receive payments quarterly, and during stakeholder engagement, firms raised the lack of quarterly payments as a negative aspect of transitioning from Growth Grants to the R&D Tax Incentive. At present, Inland Revenue systems only allow for end of year payments but, once Inland Revenue’s Business 6 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Transformation is more advanced, a system of in-year refundability may be possible 10 . 41.2 There is also a commitment for further policy work to be undertaken as part of the Tax Incentive to simplify administrative processes for small to medium enterprises. This work will ensure that the compliance costs for applicants are commensurate with the benefits they receive. Examples of this could be allowing small firms to use a ‘labour cost plus mark-up’ approach to establishing their eligible expenditure. 41.3 A review of complementary policies, including the R&D tax loss cash out and Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. With the R&D Tax Incentive in place, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation will undertake further work to ensure other instruments in the system of government support for R&D are complementary to the R&D Tax Incentive. 41.4 There will be ongoing monitoring of the R&D Tax Incentive, plus a formal review once it has been in place for five years. We anticipate these processes will identify areas for improvement. Stakeholder engagement 42. This refundability policy has benefited from input from a wide array of organisations. 43. The importance of broad refundability in incentivising business investment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue, and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Government Discussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018 The need for broad refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill, and through additional stakeholder meetings. 44. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation have discussed the refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully utilise non-refundable R&D tax credits; some large established R&D performers; levy bodies; charities; cooperatives; Federation of Maori Authorities; and Māori business representatives. These discussions have helped shape the refundability proposals and have highlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. 45. As part of the broader refundability discussions, stakeholders were asked to consider the impact of a PAYE cap. A PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. 10 Though other pre-conditions are likely before in-year refundability can be offered.. 7 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    46. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap could constrain the benefit loss-making early stage R&D intensive firms would derive from the credit. Many of these firms use contractors over employees because of the flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non- employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). 47. As a result of this stakeholder engagement, a broader range of taxes paid by firms have been included in the proposed cap, along with any tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. Consultation 48. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation prepared this Cabinet paper. 49. The following agencies have been consulted during the development of this paper: Treasury, Te Puni Kōkiri, Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Primary Industries. 50. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. Financial implications 51. Broadening the policy on refundability will make the policy more attractive and therefore incentivise firms to undertake and claim more R&D under the Tax Incentive. A consequence is that the cost of the R&D Tax Incentive will be higher than what it otherwise would be under the limited refundability that will apply in the first year. 52. However, this does not require any additional appropriation from that which Cabinet approved for the R&D Tax Incentive in September 2018. 53. In the paper that approved the appropriation, Cabinet agreed to limited support for businesses in tax loss starting April 2019 and noted that the design features for refundability would be broadened in subsequent years (DEV-18-MIN-0174). Therefore, the broader refundability policy proposals fall within the scope of what Cabinet has already agreed. 54. The fiscal cost estimates that were used to justify that appropriation were based on the assumption that from the Incentive’s inception all firms, including those in loss, would claim and receive the full amount of the tax credits in the year in which they are earned, even without full refundability. Therefore, the appropriation has already allowed for the costs associated with the policies we are proposing. 55. As a sensitivity test, officials have also considered the possibility that the broader approach to refundability will drive faster growth in R&D and therefore higher costs of the Incentive than is predicted on the standard assumptions. There is a large degree of uncertainty around these estimates but they nonetheless suggest that even with this additional cost, the estimated cost of the R&D Tax Incentive would still fall within the current appropriation. 8 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Legislative implications 56. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 57. If approved, we propose developing draft legislation for changes resulting from these recommendations in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill, scheduled for introduction in June 2019. We also anticipate this drafting will include some minor remedial matters relating to the Tax Incentive legislation already enacted. Impact Analysis 58. MBIE’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed the attached Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by MBIE. The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions on the proposals in this paper. Human Rights 59. There are no human rights implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Gender Implications 60. There are no gender implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Disability Perspective 61. There are no specific disability considerations arising from the proposals in this paper Publicity 62. We will make an announcement on this policy once Cabinet decisions have been made. We will also make an announcement when the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will be released at this time. Details will be posted on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation websites. Proactive release 63. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions.

Why is Government intervention required? The Taxation (Research and Development ! r~ ~t-s~ Act (the Act), implements an R&D Tax Incentive in New Zealand.

Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and c rnpanies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test will be excluded. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Maori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. It is desirable to ensure the law provides clarity as to whether these entities should benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. The limited timeframe for developing the Act meant it was not possible to design broad refundability rules for year one. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. The rationale for the R&D Tax Incentive and the importance of raising business expenditure on R&D (BERO) was explained in the previous Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) for the R&D Tax Incentive (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-ria-rdtc-bill/overview ). This RIS is focused on options to broaden the refundability of the R&D Tax Incentive. If refundability is not broadened, it is expected that the Tax Incentive will not be as effective as intended at incentivising additional R&D. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Broadening eligibility for refundability The proposed approach is to change the existing limited refundability rules so that R&D tax credit refunds are available to more businesses. It is proposed that all businesses would be eligible for refundability, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are listed. The 20% wage intensity test would~ :~ e removed. (2 \\V We expect that making the tax credit available to more R&D-perfor~~~f~ ~ nd higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) will increase t~ a~~~~R&D undertaken , which will in turn result in an increase in kli~t~ ~ creation, employment, and labour productivity growth.

Instead, it is proposed to limit the amount of creaits refundable to businesses through a cap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by each business. This payroll cap would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT) paid by a business. A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the scheme is maintained. It is necessary to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims for R&D tax credit refunds which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) in other jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits. The payroll cap would not apply to limit refundability of R&D tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers because it will be easy to verify that these payments have been incurred by a business. The payroll cap would not apply to limit the R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Levy bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economic presence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 2 Exempt income recipients Recipients of exempt income are currently ineligible for limited refundability, unless the only exempt income they receive is from dividends. Without refundability, entities that only derive exempt income, such as charities, are unable to receive any cash benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This is because they do not have any income tax to pay. As these entities are outside the tax system, it is proposed that they should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system and that they should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. It is proposed that an exception apply for levy bodies, however, which do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, q:~~d FBT concessions). The R&D performed by and funded through le~ o's; s ~ s fundamentally business R&D.

P~ tnerships, trusts, listed companies, companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test, and atypical organisations such as levy bodies and some Maori business entities will also benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 3 Where do the costs fall? Fiscal costs The budget for the Tax Incentive provides for the fiscal cost of full refundability. In Budget 2018 the Government appropriated $1 ,020 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive. On 1O September 2018, Cabinet agreed to reprioritise the remaining funding ($528 million) already allocated for Growth Grants over the same period \[CAB-18-MIN-0434 refers\]. We anticipate that allowing broad refundability will increase the take-up of the Tax Incentive compared to limited refundability. This in turn will increase t~ !:3.,.&D expenditure performed by firms, and the amount claimed under the Ta~ "~ftii\_y­ These fiscal costs will be borne directly by Government and indir~~ ~ e taxpayer. ~i~ Additional fiscal cost due to broader refundability, compar~ ~~ e limited refundability available in year one of the R&D Tax incentiv~ J\\~e5 or the below reasons: ~\\{:::::>\\) • Increased R&D activity from existing R&D perfor~ ~ • Firms new to R&D enter the scheme <ol...\_~ We have estimated the fiscal costs of the R~ D T'~~entive with full refundability to be approximately $1 ,345 million over t~ i\\ st fo'cl'r fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive (from when it comes into~ H i'{>~ pril 2019 through until 30 June 2022). The model used to prepare thesi ' t~~assumed that firms claim the full amount of the eligible R&D expendi~~~ ~ h they are entitled in the year in which it is incurred. More specific~ ~~~a~ 1p es that firms in loss claim the full amount of the Tax Incentive, eve it~~etundability. nif Anecdotal evidenc , rot}\\ ~ erseas jurisdictions shows that those that have allowed more generou~ ~~lity have experienced much greater rise in the costs of their R&D tax )Jfice ~~n Australia, R&D in the part of the scheme that was refundable (which ~ lie~ tb} small-and-medium enterprises) grew at approximately 15 percent per~ ¥ 1 reas R&D in the non-refundable part experienced no growth. "v°'e u~ not extrapolate exactly from the Australian experience to New Zealand ~e-5ause in New Zealand broad refundability will be available to all businesses, regardless of size (subject to exclusions discussed above). Moreover, without further analysis, it is not possible to conclude that the presence of refundability drove all the higher growth in Australia; a number of other factors are likely to have also contributed. Nevertheless, if New Zealand were to experience R&D growth equivalent to the refundable part of the Australian scheme, we have estimated that it might add approximately $40 million (over the period of the appropriation) to our estimates of the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive. Administration costs The increased attractiveness of the regime will increase legitimate claims but may also increase fraudulent claims. The increased risk of fraudulent claims may mean more administrative costs to ensure the legitimacy of claims. However, as the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has already been designed with relatively thorough checks on the R&D activities that are the subject of the claims, it is expected that any increase in administrative costs resulting from broader refundability will be negligible. Compliance costs Com ared with the limited refundabilit rules in ear one, com liance costs to firms ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 4 under broader refundability should either decrease or stay the same. The year one refundability rules use the existing corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria from the R&D tax loss cash-out rules, which are relatively complex. The proposed eligibility rules from year two are simpler, so compliance costs could decrease under the proposals. In addition, more firms will have their credits fully refunded rather than carrying them forward. This reduces the complexity of tracking historic credits and testing for continuity breaches. 9.Jr What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Risks ~\\ There are three main risks associated with broader refundability Mtfi'j~~st be considered as part of the design. These are fiscal risk, fraud risk, ~~~ity risk. Fiscal risk ~i".'

Experience in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, indicates that without a minimum threshold there can be a flood of smaller, lower-quality tax credit claims. Integrity risk This is the risk that compliance with the R&D Tax Incentive scheme may deteriorate if it is perceived to be abused by some claimants. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring the Tax Incentive is seen to be robust. In-year approval (included in the Act) and the proposed 'payroll' cap should help mitigate this integrity risk. Learning from overseas experience Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundabilit have some constraints, 1 There is an exception for R&D activities carried out by an Approved Research Provider. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 5 such as capping the amount of refundable tax credit to the amount of other taxes paid by a business (such as PAYE paid on behalf of employees). Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that provide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broad observations are: • Some constraint on refundability is the norm. A system with no restrictions on refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries. • The different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the underlying tax incentive scheme. • Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups. • It is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid by the firm. A common approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE. 2 This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is being made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and it reduces the risk that the claim is made by a non­ existent entity. Considering the risks associated with refundability and learnings from overseas, we propose broadening the refundability available in year one but having some constraints to mitigate risk. Constraints to mitigate the risks associated with broader refundability The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. It is proposed that all firms are entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed payroll cap). 3 The proposed payroll cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers. The proposed payroll cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. The proposed payroll cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Limiting R&D tax credit payments to the amount of PAYE paid by a firm, as is done in many overseas jurisdictions, is a simple and unobtrusive measure but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE. 4 Consequently, it is proposed that additional payroll taxes paid be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. Payments to Approved Research Providers will not be capped as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. That is, R&D credits generated from eligible expenditure on Approved Research Providers will be refundable, even if a business has not paid any payroll taxes. Levy bodies may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out, but 2 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay on behalf of employees will exceed 15% of the amount of R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 4 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 6 they are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. Conclusion The above constraint is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for New Zealand represents a comprehensive approach to refundability.

New Zealand has a low overall expenditure on R&D 5 primarily due to low business investment in R&D in New Zealand. New Zealand's low business investment in R&D can be explained, in part, by its industrial structure. New Zealand firms have low R&D intensity (Mazoyer, 1999); the size of traditionally R&D intensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing) in New Zealand is small (Di Maio and Blakeley, 2004); and there are few very large firms, who tend to be more research-active (OECD, 2017). Evidence suggests that there are other reasons for the low business investment in R&D. These include returns to innovation being relatively low in New Zealand 5 New Zealand's R&D spending in 2018 was equal to 1.37 percent of gross domestic product. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 8 (Wakeman and Conway, 2017), which means New Zealand firms do not have the same incentive to invest in activities that will increase their innovative output. The average rate of public support for business R&D is also "well below the socially efficient level indicated by international empirical studies" (OECD, 2017). This evidence indicates that there is scope for productivity gains from increasing the overall level of support for R&D expenditure. The Government announced a goal of increasing New Zealand's R&D expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027. To reach this target, a significant amount of the growth in R&D expenditure is expected to come from business. New Zealand BERO is relatively low and remains concentrated among a sm~ e~ f firms. To achieve a further boost in BERO, as well as to transform thei~~· 'o become more knowledge intensive, requires broadening the base of R& ~h~~ g firms within New Zealand while continuing to increase the R&D~~e of existing R&D-performing firms. ~'2} R&D performing firms, particularly at the early phase of the(~ v~~~ nt, will often be loss-making. Therefore, providing refundable tax ere~~ tl~\\\_~l?.-esses in tax loss is a key element of the effectiveness of the R8~ ~'\\v .eentive in achieving significant growth in BERO.

In addition to the R&D Tax Incentive, there are Callaghan Innovation grants which provide R&D subsidies. These grants include: • Growth Grants: A non-discretionary grant paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The grant funds 20 per cent of a business R&D programme up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e ., $25m of R&D spending), initially for a period of three years with automatic two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. The aim is to provide experienced R&D performers with the funding certainty and stability they need to grow their R&D spending in the long term. There were 316 recipients in 2017/ 18 at an (estimated) fiscal cost of $172.2M. The Growth Grant scheme will cease on 31 March 2021 . No new applications can be made, but existing Growth Grant recipients can extend their Growth Grants until the scheme end date. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 9 • Project Grants: A discretionary grant, allocated to less-experienced R&D performers that do not meet the conditions for a Growth Grant for R&D. It funds 40 per cent of the first $800,000 of the eligible costs of a pre-specified project and 20 per cent of the remainder. There were 344 recipients in 2017/ 18 at an estimated fiscal cost of $20.3M. There are restrictions on the availability of the R&D Tax Incentive for recipients of existing grants. New Zealand also provides support for businesses performing R&D through the R&D loss tax credit (also known as the R&D tax-loss cash out). New Zealand-resident businesses are able to apply for 28 per cent of their losses associated withf@.:g~ le R&D expenditure (up to a cap) to be paid out in cash, rather than carry~ (rw{;1Jd those losses until future years. 350 firms currently claim R&D loss tax ere'\\.~( ~V There are also tax deductions available for R&D expenditure, and th(<;b'~ 1tf./defer these tax deductions so as not to lose them due to a b~,yl\\areholder continuity rules. ("" - The objective of the R&D Tax Incentive is to ~~~ ew Zealand's low levels of R&D, specifically by increasing BERO, w~ has'e.>c~ ntral role in driving innovation and economic growth. ,~ The R&D Tax Incentive as introft..~ e.~ ,; e Act has limited refundability.

Discussions of the proposals with levy boa ·,~ 1~ icated that should levy bodies be ineligible for refundable R&D tax 0 , rllt~ c~ 3 could lead to some levy body members preferring to fund their own R&D. •Jineentive is not intended to change business behaviour in this way. Limited refundability is also not available for listed companies, partnerships, or trusts. This is problematic, because it is likely that - without refundability - some of these businesses will have insufficient income tax liability to benefit from their R&D tax credits. The Tax Incentive is intended to have broad application and treat all businesses the same, irrespective of their legal form. However, excluding some types of firm from the Tax Incentive biases it toward firms in traditional arrangements (particularly, limited liability companies). Capped refundability Some businesses may be eligible for limited refundability but unable to cash out all of their R&D tax credits because of the $255,000 cap. These businesses will have to carry their R&D tax credits forward into future years until they have sufficient income tax liability to utilise their credits. The ability to carry the credit forward is subject to a shareholder continuity rule that requires a minimum of 49% shareholder continuity to be maintained in order for R&D tax credits to be carried forward. This is problematic, because R&D intensive start-ups are more likely to undergo a significant change in their shareholder base when they seek to raise capital through new investors. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 10 2.4 Are there an constraints on the sco for decision makin ? The Government has introduced the R&D Tax Incentive and indicated that it wants to expand the coverage of refundability. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability from year two of the Tax Incentive (corresponding to businesses' 2020/ 21 income year). There is a need to use existing legislative vehicles to achieve enactment of policy changes in time for them to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array o~ .l:\]~ c;ector organisations. ~'2) The importance of broad refundability in incentivising busi~,.}~{ ment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted m~~ B'iEv,Mnd Revenue and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Gf~~ , i:frscussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018. The nei {Qt.\_~pder refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the ~~,se and Expenditure Select Committee on the Bill, and through additi~ f tak o laer meetings. MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callag~ ~ a~ iscussed refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers' Grou~ · ~ 1 ~,~~ Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, K~ 6.lwl te and EV; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performi ffi~ s c ' in ax loss or with insufficient taxable income tonb ~·~ fully use non-refunda t \\{{& a credits; levy bodies; charities; and Maori business representatives. Thf s-e d(s~u sions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, an~ J~ lighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. ~ Agencie(€\_~~fJ takeholders to consider the impact of a $5 million cap and a PAYE ca~ ~ proxy to test tangible economic presence). ~o~ k on $5 million cap s & eholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by a $5 million cap. For example, a business in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under a $5 million cap the business would receive a $5 million refund and would have to carry forward the remaining $7 million of R&D tax credits into future years. Because the business spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to fully cash out their accumulation of R&D credits carried forward. There were also a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These businesses are mainly in a tax-paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future. Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. The proposal for broader refundability removes the previously proposed $5 million cap on refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 11 Feedback on PAYE cap The PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap would significantly constrain the benefit that loss-making start-ups would get from the credit. Many start-ups that perform R&D have few employees and rely on contractors to develop their business because of the comparative flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non-employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). Tangible economic presence test As a result of the stakeholder feedback on the two options above, officials explored a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed would have allowed firms that did not satisfy a PAYE cap to be verified for TEP from either an external certifier (such as a chartered accountant or lawyer), or directly from Inland Revenue through additional checks. Stakeholders preferred the availability of alternatives to the PAYE cap, and thought that multiple ways of establishing tangible economic presence were preferable to a one-size-fits-all approach. Payroll taxes cap Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. 6 UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and that additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. As a result of this feedback, we have included an option that would include a ‘payroll’ taxes cap based on PAYE and other taxes paid by firms (including fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and tax voluntarily withheld from contractor payments (WT)) in order to lessen the impact on affected firms. It is also proposed that any tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers be fully refundable (so not subject to the ‘payroll’ taxes cap). Stakeholder engagement on including additional payroll taxes (such as FBT, ESCT and WT) in the cap indicated that this would be an improvement over a PAYE cap. Although only a small proportion of contractors have opted into the voluntary withholding scheme, more may decide to opt into it if the payroll taxes cap were implemented. Other mechanisms for providing support to R&D intensive start-ups will also be considered as part of further policy work, including reviewing the R&D tax loss cash- out and the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. 6 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 12 Incentive.

There are a range of options.Jori , ~,9undability could be broadened, including the types of entities that are eJi~~~tMe constraints that are placed on the scheme to manage risks that r f maaQ)i Jty creates, particularly to the integrity of the Tax • Local authorities • Other tax-exempt organisations Status quo Under the status quo, limited refundability rules restrict eligibility for refunds to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non­ dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits, including partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Maori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. General business entities This change would make listed companies, partnerships and trusts eligible for refundability, and there would be no wage intensity requirement. This change will allow most Maori organisations to be eligible. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 13 Levy bodies Levy bodies would be eligible for refundability under this option. Charities Under this option charitable organisations that perform eligible R&D activities would be ineligible for refundable tax credits. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that this rule would be removed for consistency to ensure they are excluded from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, this option does not exclude other associated entities. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even one controlled by that business, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. In relation to Māori organisations, a small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities. As discussed above, businesses that are wholly- owned by these charitable entities would also be ineligible. Businesses that are partially controlled by these charities would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Local authorities Under this option local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled organisations would be eligible. Other tax-exempt organisations This option excludes tax-exempt organisations from being eligible to receive refunds. The exclusion would not apply to entities that receive exempt income from dividends (no change from the status quo) or to levy bodies. Options for constraining the amount that is refundable The main options available are: • The status quo • A PAYE cap • A tangible economic presence (TEP) test • A ‘payroll’ taxes cap Status quo The status quo limited refundability rules allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure that meet the corporate and wage-intensity eligibility rules to claim a maximum refund per year of $255,000. A PAYE cap A PAYE cap would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant income year. A TEP test A TEP test would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded as long as they satisfied a test of tangible economic presence, up to a maximum of $5 million per year. A TEP test would be designed to ensure that a ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 14 firm has 'skin in the game', and that it physically exists with premises and staff, rather than just existing on paper as a shell company. A TEP test would be met where at least one of the following applied: • A business's PAYE for the year is equal to or greater than their R&D tax credit claim. This ensures a proportionate TEP because the firm is paying tax on behalf of its employees and cannot take out more than it puts in to the tax system. • A chartered accountant or practising lawyer has certified that a business has TEP. The certifier would testify to the firm's TEP, having actually met the staff/seen the premises. • Inland Revenue has completed a review (for example, checking the ~ i~ g history of a business; visiting a business's site; and/or confirming tt("~) ~ f shareholders or directors) and is satisfied that a business has TEP~~ • A business's R&D tax credit claim only includes amounts ~ Q,\_~ approved research provider to perform R&D activities on their ~~ l~ vh:s> provides an easily verified audit trail to determine TEP. <\\.

Which entities will be eligible for a refund Based on the above analysis, the preferred combination of options is for general business entities and levy bodies to be eligible for refundability, and for charities, local authorities, and other organisations that receive (non-dividend) exempt income to be ineligible. The effect of these options is that many more business entiti~es 1.-~ 1 uld be eligible for refundability, while not bringing in entities that alreij (e'o~ 1e substantial benefits from operating outside of the tax system.

Businesses will e~eive the financial support of the R&O Tax Incentive earlier or, in some instances, w P{f actually get a benefit where they previously would not have. The key advantage to a refundable tax credit is it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&O intensive firms, are undertaking their R&O. Broader refundability will provide increased certainty to businesses, with broad and simple eligibility, and receipt of cash refunds each year rather than having to carry forward credits that may be lost due to continuity breaches. The refundability available in year one is expected to be limited to approximately 350­ 650 firms, and 65-130 of those are expected to hit the cap on refundability. The proposed broader refundability has simpler eligibility criteria, and would be available to a larger number of firms, estimated at 750-1200 firms in 2019 (or 550-1100 firms, after allowing for some firms to remain on the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant). The wider coverage and increased cash flow to businesses performing R&O is expected to lead to increased R&D investment by those businesses. Increased coverage of R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to en a e in R&D is ex ected to result in an increase in innovative activit , ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 23 employment, and labour productivity growth, particularly among firms that did not qualify for limited refundability. A higher level of R&D expenditure will result in greater spillover benefits to other participants in the economy. The proposed constraint on refundability is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 24 5.2 Summar table of costs and benefits of the referred a roach Comment: nature of cost or benefit, risks R&D performing Compliance costs firms Administration costs Impact I Evidence \_certainty Administering agency Wider government ~ I Higher fiscal costs because of wider co~~s +--P-o-te-n-ti\_a\_lly\_h\_i-gh\_e\_r\_f-is-ca\_l\_c\_o\_st\_s\_o\_f\_R\_&\_D\_T\_a\_x\_\_Lo\_w\_\_\_ and more incentive to claim.

There is a potential risk that by providing broader refundability, businesses are motivated to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure or make fraudulent claims. The Tax Incentive has been designed to reduce the likelihood of, and opportunities to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure. This includes requiring a close nexus between the R&D activity and the expenses claimed. The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a 'payroll' taxes cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with p~air;:"'\\\\Ut cash. ~~L Businesses would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax cred~~~ ~ ~)~ ,tent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ·~pr~1¥-c-a ~ aid in the relevant income year. 13 \\) Payments to Approved Research Providers are not includ~o, t ~ cap as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been)-~ ~~'!tiffea firm.

There L .r ~'JleJTlpatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's ' Ex~ t ~ or the design of regulatory systems'. 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislation will need to be enacted to give effect to broader refundability. It is proposed that broader refundability come into effect from businesses' 2020/21 income year. Therefore, it is proposed that the legislative changes needed to give effect to broader refundability be included in a tax bill scheduled to be introduced in June 2019, which would make changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue is leading implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive through the tax system, and will also be responsible for implementing broader refundability. Inland Revenue will identify and mitigate operational risk so that broader refundability can be delivered successfully. Inland Revenue has the necessary capabilities and capacity to implement broader refundability through its systems. 13 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 28 It is expected that broader refundability will pose minimal compliance and administrative costs. No material change is expected for the R&D supplementary return. Instead of carrying forward non-refundable R&D tax credits, most firms will be able to receive R&D tax credit refunds. Any increase in administrative costs would be negligible, because Inland Revenue intends to carry out checks and reviews on claims from year one. The existing core team of Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation officials will continue to work on claims after broader refundability is introduced.

Feedback highlighted the need for !€ar guidance and education material. Businesses engaged with on the broader ref undability proposals reaffirmed the need for simple rules and low compliance costs. As mentioned above, the broader refundability proposals contain eligibility criteria that are simpler than the year one limited refundability criteria. The proposed broader refundability rules do not require corporate eligibility and wage intensity tests to be satisfied, and rely on the existing (easier) rules of the R&D Tax Incentive. Allowing for broader refundability also reduces the need for continuous tracking of shareholder continuity, because once refunded credits are no longer at risk of being extinguished through breaches of shareholder continuity rules. This is particularly beneficial for smaller, R&D intensive start-ups which may regularly seek new investors to boost funding for their R&D projects. Implementation risks arise where businesses re-characterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure in order to claim a larger tax credit. The incentive for re­ characterisation is greater with broader refund ability, because firms can receive cash refunds (rather than having to wait until they come into profit to utilise their R&D tax credits . The olic and le islation has been develo ed to mana e this risk, althou h ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 29 it cannot be eliminated. The proposed 'payroll' taxes cap on refunds will be backed up by existing administrative processes, such as in-year approval and IR audits. There needs to be strong uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive by businesses for the incentive to be successful. As indicated by the submissions received on the Bill, broader refundability is an important part of ensuring businesses transition to the scheme. Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation and MBIE officials have engaged with stakeholders on the broader refundability proposals. Guidance will also be developed by Inland Revenue, which will sit alongside the tax legislation, to provide claimants with more information about the broader refundability proposals.

RDAG had its first meeting in January 2019. Officials also have regular meetings and discussions with a broader range of stakeholders, at which policy and implementation issues are discussed. It is expected that RDAG and these regular stakeholder discussions will enable officials to conduct on-going monitoring and review of the impact of broader refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 30 Bibliography Appelt, S., M.

Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: • firms with turnover less than A$20m & • subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is proposed but legislation not yet passed. It is designed to reduce the costs of the scheme. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax 14 credit at a discount to their value. The UK government is currently consulting on introducing a cap relating to PAYE payments. The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: • fewer than 500 employees and • turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is firms paid before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non-taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. 14 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss and 230% of the R&D spend). ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 32             The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability. Here are some brief comments on each of them: Eligibility for refundability based on firm characteristic (generally a measure of size such as turnover) • can target refundability to firms that, potentially, benefit most from it – ie, smaller or early stage firms • creates boundaries which might disincentivise desired behaviours – eg, a firm may choose not to grow to keep turnover below the threshold • relatively simple to understand but measurement would introduce complexity Refundability applies up to a cap; credits above cap carried forward • refundability addresses cash flow needs • less of a boundary issue so less likely to impact on firm behaviours (though incentive to increase R&D spend may diminish above cap) • relatively easy to understand and apply Limit refundability based on other taxes paid • if based on PAYE paid, more like a backstop rather than a fiscal cap as for most businesses the amount of PAYE across the whole firm will exceed 15% of the cost of R&D • useful as a possible fraud deterrent as it should ensure a firm has a tangible economic presence, and may also prevent exploitation of a loophole if that involved claiming credits for high non-wage costs • operates as some form of integrity and fiscal constraint measure, in that a firm cannot “take out” more than it is “putting in” to the tax system. • some firms may not pay PAYE – eg, staff are not employees and are either shareholders who are paid a shareholder salary, contractors or provide sweat equity. This suggests either using a wider definition of taxes paid 15 or making a provision for firms to apply for an exemption • administratively easy to understand and apply (subject to exceptions for firms without employees) Refund credits at a discount • supports loss making firms while providing an incentive to become profitable • provides firms with a choice whether to refund the credit or carry it forward • perhaps less easy to understand but relatively easy to apply Spread refundability over several years • more complex to track a firm’s position • for a firm in a long-term loss making position, will produce similar results to full year refundability after a few years • creates a tail of Government liability Target refundability based on R&D intensity This mechanism is not used by any other country for targeting refundability (though in Australia R&D intensity influences the credit rate for large enterprises) but is worth considering as it is the basis of the year one scheme. • can target refundability to those most deserving of it 15 One possibility would be to include adding withholding taxes paid. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 33 • creates a boundary that might give rise to perverse behaviours • different measures of R&D intensity may favour different types of R&D performing firms • though relatively easy to understand, adds complexity to compliance and administration. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 34 Appendix 2 The examples below provide a practical illustration of how without refundability, firms do not receive a cash benefit from a tax credit if they are in loss or have insufficient income tax liability. This table provides a simple example of how a profitable firm uses a tax credit to reduce the amount of tax it has to pay in a year: Income Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) Net profit/(loss) Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) Net tax to pay 15 13 300 400 (100) come tax liability (28% x Net profit) 0 R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 15 Unused R&D tax credits to carry forward to future years 15 This table provides a simple example of a profitable firm that has insufficient income tax liability to receive the full benefit of a tax credit without refundability: Profitable firm with insufficient income tax liability (without refundability) Income 310 Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) 300 Net profit/(loss) 10 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 35 Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) 2.8 R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 15 Unused R&D tax credits to carry forward to future years 12.2 This table shows how a loss-making firm receives an immediate benefit from a refundable tax credit: Income Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) Net profit/(loss) Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 0 15 15 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 36 • MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, llntand Revenue .

The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill reflects the policy decisions taken to date by Cabinet for the R&D Tax Incentive as part of “Phase 1”. The tight timeframes has meant that some issues were deferred. These will be addressed under Phase 2. 2. Cabinet has agreed that by April 2020 a more comprehensive policy will be in place to support businesses in loss so they can better benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This followed from the advice provided on how to support loss-making firms \[MBIE 3950 17-18; IR2018/499 refers\]. 3. This paper provides further details on work to be undertaken in order to meet the commitment that a new policy on refundability will be in place by April 2020. It also sets out the work that will be done on the R&D tax loss cash out scheme in parallel. Supporting businesses in loss Refundability enables business in loss to benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive 4. Refundability refers to the policy of paying out in cash the tax credit for firms in loss. As part of the work around design and implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive, we have been considering further actions that need to be undertaken as part of “Phase 2” of the scheme, including on the issue of refundability. 5. The R&D Tax Incentive encourages businesses to perform R&D by reducing the amount of tax they have to pay when they have undertaken R&D. However, firms in loss do not pay tax. This is particularly a challenge for new and start-up business where the evidence suggests that R&D intensive firms typically spend their early years in a tax loss position. Such firms also have a lower probability of becoming profitable (at least in short term) so cannot use tax credits to improve their cash-flow position. 6. This issue also has resonance for atypical businesses, some of which are structured never to incur an income tax liability, and therefore would never be eligible for refunds of their tax credit. It is likewise an issue for businesses that do not make a stable profit. Refundability in Year One will be limited 7. The Government has already signalled that it recognises the importance of supporting businesses that undertake R&D but that are not yet making a profit, therefore having insufficient taxable income to effectively use any tax credits. 8. It has partially responded to the issue of providing support for firms in loss in the current design of the R&D Tax Incentive by providing a limited form of refundability from 1 April 2019 (the first year of the new scheme). To make this straightforward to administer and to meet legislative timeframes, officials have largely adapted the parameters operated under the existing R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme in order to help provide refunds under the new R&D Tax Incentive. 9. R&D Tax Loss Cash Out was introduced in 2015. It was designed to help R&D-intensive start- up or other small firms that might be struggling with cash flow issues, especially before they have been able to take products or services to market, by allowing them to “cash out” a proportion of their tax losses rather than carry them forward. As a condition of receiving this 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 2 support, at least 20 percent of the firm’s labour costs must be R&D related, and the maximum eligible R&D spend that can be claimed is capped at $1.7m (in 2019/20). 1 10.The decision to mirror these provisions for the R&D Tax Incentive was a combination of expedience and cautiousness, in that the constraints with the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out are more restrictive than are likely to apply subsequently, and broadly it is easier to relax rather than tighten constraints over the longer term. In Year One of the R&D Tax Incentive at least 20% of claimant labour costs must be R&D related, and eligible businesses can “cash out” up to $225,000 of their R&D losses (or 15 percent of $1.7m). Parameters for Phase 2 11.Such eligibility constraints are unlikely to work effectively as a policy on refundability in the long term because they limit the amount of benefit that firms in loss can achieve from the R&D Tax Credit unless they carry their credits forward. The Government has therefore committed to putting in place a more effective policy from April 2020. It has also indicated that it will use this opportunity to review the operation of the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme. 12.A number of countries in the OECD (such as the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and Australia) allow for a measure of refundability as part of their fiscal incentives to incentivise R&D investment. Therefore addressing the issue will ensure that the proposed New Zealand regime is competitively attractive in international terms. 13.Nevertheless, for a number of reasons we recommend that refundability be approached with some caution. Firstly the Government needs to protect against the risk of fraudulent claims. Where tax systems are based on self-assessment, as in New Zealand, there is a tension between processing returns in a timely way and investigating whether they are genuine. Tax administrators rely on being able to investigate returns after they have been processed. Where funds have been paid out, but the claim is fraudulent, the entity may have disappeared leaving no ability to recoup the funds. 14.Secondly, evidence from other jurisdictions suggests that the fastest growing portion of their costs relating to their R&D tax incentives has been refunds for small firms in loss. This has particularly been an issue of concern in Australia and has led to subsequent changes in design after concerns about increased affordability of the scheme. Discussions with officials in those countries suggest that this rapid growth is associated with more spurious claims, including some re-characterisation of non-R&D expenditure. Issues for further examination 15.There are a number of design features that officials need to consider in order to design an effective and sustainable refundable tax credit for the long term. These include: a. The safeguards that need to be built in to manage risk and ensure the integrity of the tax system while supporting the wider policy goals of the initiative: It is important to ensure that any ultimate policy reduces fiscal risks from illegitimate or uneconomic claims. This might be done, for example, through the use of caps, turnover and pre-approval measures, as well as refunds at a discount, deferral of receiving refunds, and the time-bound eligibility for refunds. b. What can be learnt from international comparisons: We need to consider the approaches used by other countries, particularly those within 1 The cap has been rising by $0.3M per year, starting from $0.5M in the 2015/16 year. 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 3 the OECD; and how the NZ R&D Tax Incentive is positioned in relation to those. c. Whether entities not structured to derive taxable income should be refunded ( - atypical businesses including charities and levy bodies): There are a range of organisations of different types that might fall within this group – for example, atypical businesses, Māori-owned businesses, charities, levy bodies, and tolling operations. As well as considering whether such a policy would incentivise more or have little impact on the amount of R&D they currently conduct, we also need to consider whether it is reasonable to treat them the same as taxpaying businesses, despite them not being taxpayers in some cases. Other issues to consider within Phase 2 16.Alongside the question of refundability, we recommend undertaking a review of the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme to avoid any misalignment between the two initiatives. Many of the firms currently eligible for the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out will also be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive so questions arise as to how each policy complements the other and how to reduce compliance burdens for applicants. This would include:  Considering how the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out has been performing over the past 3 years in areas such as take-up and fiscal cost, and what impact it has made on R&D activity. It would be useful also to consider its interaction with other policy areas such as loss continuity (as this impacts on desirability of cashed out losses), as well as to consider whether any further targeting or safeguards are required as part of its operation.  Reviewing policy goals for R&D Tax Loss Cash Out and whether these need adjusting in light of the R&D Tax Incentive’s introduction, so that overall budgetary costs can be managed sensibly while government provides support to where it is needed most. This might include harmonisation in areas such as eligible activity, R&D definitions, eligible entities, and eligible expenditure. 17.Finally, though it will be too early to have gained operational insights into the legislation, it is possible that issues will have been identified that require remedial attention. Potential Phase 3 issues 18.There are also additional measures that officials consider should be considered in “Phase 3” – that is they would be introduced from the third year of the Tax Incentive (April 2021) or later. This could include in-year payments for businesses in loss, and the development of software packages that could automate a firm’s claim for eligible expenditure. There are also other changes that could simplify firms’ compliance, such as alternate rules for calculating overheads. In addition, as experience is gained with the operation of the Incentive, there may be a need to make further adjustments to the scheme. Timelines and next steps 19.Legislation for the R&D Tax Incentive has now been introduced into Parliament with its First Reading on 1 November. Legislation associated with Phase 2 policy which would make changes to the R&D Tax Incentive could therefore not be practically introduced until the Phase 1 legislation has been enacted (not expected before the end of second quarter 2019). 20.However, we believe it is important to begin work now internally amongst officials to consider the issues in depth in order to help develop appropriate policy options. This would mean that changes to legislation can then effectively be carried out during the first quarter of 2019, and would ensure that revised legislation could be put forward as early as September 2019 (as soon as Phase 1 legislation is enacted). 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 4 21. We also recommend consulting with public stakeholders to better understand the impacts of any proposed policy on businesses. One option is to conduct a full consultation alongside the lines of the earlier Discussion Document that was issued in April. This would require the agreement of Cabinet. 22. However, we think this may risk "consultation fatigue" as in November and December the Select Committee will already be seeking submissions from the public on the current round of legislation. Additionally, March 2019 will be close to the go-live date for Inland Revenue's Business Transformation Release 3, and so tax and professional services stakeholders will be busy supporting their customers. Instead we recommend a less formal but still structured approach. This would seek views from those represented on the R&D Tax AdvisoryA :;0up to be established by IR.

With legislation to introduce the Government’s R&D tax incentive progressing t hrough Parliament, officials are now considering the following policy issues tha t h ad been deferred to a secondary phase : •A comprehensive policy on refundability (the Bill currently provides for l imited refundability to loss-making and pre-profit businesse s) •T reatment of tax-exempt organisations (the first-year policy on re fundability excludes entities that receive tax exempt income ) •Op tion s for the future of the R&D tax loss cash out (this policy wa s i ntroduced in 2015 to address the effect of distortions in the tax system o n R &D intensive start-ups ) 2. A key aim of the Government’s R&D tax incentive is to expand access to R &D s upport to a wider and more diverse range of firms and to provide firms with th e c ertainty and confidence to increase their investment in R&D. The policy intent i s to create a regime that is accessible, internationally competitive and sustainable . 3. Th ese objectives have guided our thinking on the following proposals which w e p ropose form the basis of stakeholder engagement. The stakeholder engagemen t w ill be used to seek feedback on and test the implications of the options describe d b elow (noting that Ministers have not yet taken final policy decisions) . Re fundability and treatment of tax-exempt organisation s 4. W e propose that refundability of the R&D tax credit for firms in loss or wi th in sufficient profit should be widely available. This is consistent with the objectiv e o f providing broad-based support for R&D. However, in order to manage the risk s th at refundability creates to the sustainability of the scheme, officials propose tha t th e amount paid to an organisation in a single year would be limited by : •th e amount of PAYE paid (this ensures a firm has a tangible economi c presence and that what firms receive from the tax system does not exceed w hat they have contributed); an d •a cap on refunds of $5 million (this will ensure that Growth Grant recipient s a re not worse off by moving to the tax incentive ). 5 . We are aware that some firms legitimately do not pay PAYE and we will use th e s takeholder engagement to explore the extent of this issue and th e a ppropriateness of using alternative taxes paid as a constraint on refundability . 6 . The quality of, and positive externalities from, R&D under taken by tax-exemp t o rganisations is likely to be similar to that of taxable entities. Therefore, from th e p erspective of growing New Zealand-based R&D, it makes sense for the ta x i ncentive to be refundable for tax-exempt organisations with no furt her r estrictions than those that apply to taxable entities. However, we intend to us e IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 1 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence the stakeholder engagement as an opportunity to build a better understanding of the type and amount of R&D that is undertaken by tax-exempt organisations. The R&D tax loss cash out 7.The tax loss cash out is intended to mitigate distortions in the tax system that p articularly affect R&D intensive start-up companies. The policy allows qualifyin g f irms to receive cash for their losses that relate to R&D rather than waiting unti l th e firm is profitable to obtain the benefit of a tax deduction. About 350 fir ms have registered for the scheme. The introduction of the R&D tax incentive p rovides an opportunity to consider options for the future of the tax loss cash ou t i ncluding : •Re taining it as a separate instrument but with some amendments such a s a ligning the definition of R&D with the tax incentive and tightening i ts e ligibility criteria, o r •i ncorporating it as an additional support for start-up firms delivered via a n e xtension to the tax incentive, o r •ce asing the tax loss cash out . 8. T he engagement with stakeholders provides an opportunity to test ou r u nderstanding of the impact that the tax loss cash out has had on firms, to see k insights into administrative issues such as the value of aligning the R&D definition w ith the tax incentive, and to explore whether it would create confusion to retai n t he two separate instruments . 9.

The proposals relate to : •H ow refundability of the tax credit could apply from 1 April 202 0 •Whether there should be limits on refundability for non -tax paying o rganisation s •O ptions for the future of the R&D Tax Loss Cash O ut 12 . Your agreement to these proposals does not represent final Governmen t d ecisions. The proposals will form the basis of officials’ engagement wi th s takeholders. Officials will brief you following this engagement and recommen d p roposals you can take to Cabinet for final decisions . Co ntext and background 13.The R&D tax incentive was developed under tight timeframes. Consequently , t here was not time to resolve some complex issues before the legislation wa s dra fted . 14 . Cabinet agreed to provide limited refundability for firms in loss for the first year of th e tax incentive and you committed to review the policy that would apply f rom t he second year. The two-year transition for Growth Grant recipients meant firm s w ere not disadvantaged, relative to their current situation , in this delay t o e stablishing the longer-term policy . 1 5. The R&D tax loss cash out is a separate policy from the R&D tax incentive. But th e a dvent of the tax incentive and the high overlap between recipients under eac h p olicy means it is timely to review it . 16. You have previously agreed to the scope and timeframes for this Phase 2 policy w ork ( 1560 18-19; IR2018/688 refers). If you agree with these proposals, we w ill h old workshops with stakeholders to get their feedback. We anticipate providin g y ou advice in April so that Cabinet approval and legislation can follow later in th e y ea r. R efundability Why it is an issue 17.Refundability refers to paying out the tax credit if the business has insufficient ta x l iability. The alternative to refunding the credit is for firms to carry it forward an d u se it when they become profitable . 18.Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D receiv e e qual support. Fo r i nstance, an established business can support R&D through profits from i ts e xisting products, and therefore can immediately benefit from a tax credit . S imilarly a large conglomerate can support a loss-making R&D division throu gh p rofit s from other parts of a business. By contrast, a start-up firm will not hav e o ffsetting profits from other activities and – unless its credits are refunded – ma y n ot be able to benefit from the tax credit until a much later date, if at all . 19 . Refundability provides financial support for R&D whe n it is most needed. In mos t cases, a firm will engage in R&D expenditure prior to receiving revenue from c ommercialising its product. Therefore, not only are R&D-intensive firms mor e l ikely to be in loss, they are also more likely to be cash constrained. For thes e IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 4 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence firms, cash today will be much more valuable than a credit that is carried forward until the firm becomes profitable. 20.Additionally, credits carried forward while a firm is in loss are at risk if the fir m breac hes shareholder continuity rules relating to the credit. This is more likely to oc cur where there is significant new equity investment in a firm before it reache s p rofitability . 21 . However, paying out to businesses, rather than reducing the amount of tax the y pay, increases the fraud risk for Inland Revenue. This is not particular to R&D tax c redits but is seen with other parts of the tax system such as donor tax credi ts a nd GST refunds . 22 . Refunds also increase the fiscal cost of a scheme. In countries where credits ar e re funded, fiscal cost growth is faster amongst those firms getting refunds . D iscussions with officials in Australia and the UK suggest that some of thi s i ncreased cost is associated with marginal quality R&D – cash payments for small , s tart -up fir ms are a powerful lure for some firms so encourage reclassifying othe r e xpenditure as R&D or claiming for activity that is not R&D. In those countries, a l arge number of claims has made it difficult to counter this risk through audi t. 23 . In summary, providing refundability generates positive net benefits but adds ris k to the tax incentive scheme. Therefore, the question is not whether to have r efundability or not but how to manage the risks associated with it . I nternational approaches 24.In developing a proposal for New Zealand, we have taken note of other countries ’ p olicies . 25. Across the OECD, most countries have R&D tax credits but fewer than half provide r efundability. Australia, being the country with which New Zealand businesse s mo st readily make com par isons , only has refundability for small to medium size d f irms . 2 6. Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that d o p rovide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy . 2 7. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broa d ob servations are : •S ome constraint on refundability is the norm; a system with no restriction s o n refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countrie s •t he different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect difference s in the underlying tax incentive scheme •some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups •i t is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid b y t he firm . Refundability in relation to other features of the R&D Tax Incentive 28.New Zealand’s tax incentive differs from most other countries through its lack o f targeting. The three countries we studied in most depth in designing the New Z ealand scheme either have higher credit rates for smaller companies (Australi a a nd UK) or have such a low cap the scheme is effectively limited to SME s ( Norway). New Zealand’s scheme has neither of these features . IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 5 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 29.Another aspect of the R&D tax incentive is that it is replacing the Growth Grant. T hough not explicitly stated by the Government, Growth Grant recipients have a n e xpectation that they will not be disadvantaged by moving to the tax incentive . 30. Loss -making firms can receive up to $5 million per year from a Growth Grant. U nder the tax incentive this would equate to incurring around $33 million o f e ligible expenditure. This is a relatively high level of R&D expenditure. Based on G rowth Grant recipients, only 5 New Zealand organisations currently exceed it an d of these 2 are loss making. There will be some non-Gro wth Grant recipients wh o m ay also exceed this level but we are less certain of the number . 31 . By comparison, the maximum level of eligible expenditure for refundability i n Au stralia is around A$10 million . 32 . These factors suggest that targeting refundability ex clusively to small an d m edium -sized businesses would be incompatible with other features of the ta x i ncentive and that a cap for eligible expenditure under $33 million would b e p erceived as less generous than the Growth Grant . F raud and fiscal risks 33.One reason to constrain refundability is fraud risk. Despite efforts to restrain i t, d etermined organisations are frequently able to find ways to fabricate losses, an d once payments have been made it can be difficult if not impossible to recover the f unds . 3 4. A co mmon approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid i n o ther taxes such as PAYE 1 . This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence, a nd therefore means it is less likely to be operating fraudulently. It also operate s a s something of an integrity measure for the tax system because it means wh at f irms receive from the tax system does not exceed what they have contributed . 35 . Administratively, checking how much PAYE is paid by a firm is straightforward . 36 . In-year approval of the R&D activity, which will apply from year 2, will provide a f urther element of robustness because it will potentially give an early warning of su spicious claims . S takeholder views 37.An indication of what stakeholders think is provided by their submissions on t he T axation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill to the Finance an d E xpenditure Committee . 3 8. All submitters who have commented on this issue think the tax credit should b e r efundable to a greater extent than it will be in the first year. Some of them argu e f or no limits on refundability. Others contemplate some form of refundability suc h as: •L imited by level of firm turnover or a tax incentive less than a certai n a mount (Corporate Taxpayers Group ) •A cap of $5 million on the amount of tax credit refunded (EY ). P roposals for refundability 39.In terms of establishing the p olicy on refundability, the key question is whether i t s hould be unrestrained or whether there should be some restrictions. On balance , w e think there should be some restrictions, for the following reasons : 1 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay will exceed 15% of the amount of R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 6 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence •Some form of constraint linked to other taxes paid can make fraud less l ikely . •T he R&D tax incentive is new and not all the risks are well understood . Maintaining some constraint will be useful until there is a bette r un derstanding of how the scheme is operating . •G iven the proposed R&D tax credit is relatively broad and accessible, th e p roposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter th e incentives of the scheme. •O ther countries offering R&D tax incentives have generally put constraint s o n refundability in place . •If the c onstraints are relatively light-handed they are unlikely to have a m aterial impact on the amount of R&D encouraged by the tax incentive . 40 . It is therefore recommended that the proposals on refundability with whic h o fficials will engage externally are : •The amount of tax credit refunded in any one year cannot exceed the a mount of PAYE the firm has paid in the same year, an d •T he maximum tax credit paid out in any year is $5 million . •Excess credits that are not refunded in a particular year can be carried f orward subject to the credit continuity rules and can be refunded in futur e y ears, subject to the above conditions . 4 1. Framing the constraints in this way is not anticipated to restrict refunds for th e m ajority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some refund an d a few would have less than full refundability. This differs from the Australia n a pproach where there is a hard boundary in the form of a turnover threshol d w hich means that if a firm grows, it switches from receiving refunds to n ot re ceiving any . 4 2. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for Ne w Ze aland represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. We therefor e co nsider it will be reasonably well received. Issues that might be contentious, a nd w hich we would want to explore with stakeholders, include : •So me firms may pay little or no PAYE. For instance, their staff are n ot e mployees and are paid a shareholder salary or provide sweat equity. W e a re interested in understanding how prevalent this issue might be amongs t R &D performers and whether an alternative definition of taxes paid 2 woul d b e more appropriate . •The impact of the $5 million cap. We think some cap on refunds would be p rudent as a backstop but this would have to be balanced against an y e vidence that it would disincentivise firms from expanding their R&D . T ax exempt organisations Which organisations are tax-exempt 43.Within the Income Tax Act, there are different types of tax-exempt organisations , in cluding charities, public authorities and local authorities, sports promotin g bodies, and science and industrial research promoting bodies. In some cases, the l egislation deems these bodies to be tax-exempt and in other cases th e 2 One possibility would be to add FBT, withholding tax on scheduler payments (WT) and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) paid. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 7 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence organisation elects to have the tax-exempt status. These categories include levy bodies . 4 4. Māori authorities are not tax-exempt (they pay tax at 17.5% rather than at th e company rate of 28%), but some post-settlement governance entities have re gistered as charities and Māori organisations often have charitable entitie s w ithin their structures. Consequently, tax-exempt organisations includ e o rganisations considered Māori organisations . Why it is an issue 45 . T he first-year policy on refundability excludes entities that receive exemp t i ncome. They are eligible for the tax incentive but, because they do not have a n i ncome-tax liability, they will not benefit from the incentive without refundabilit y 46. Th e main argument for making the credit refundable for these organisations i s th at the quality of their R&D and the spillovers arising from it are not likely to b e a ny different from private-sector organisations. Therefore, from the perspective o f grow ing New Zealand-based R&D it makes sense to include them . 47. So me tax-exempt organisations, such as levy bodies, may already be receivin g g overnment financial support from a different programme 3 . However, the rules a pplying to the tax incentive mean that R&D that has been funded by anothe r g overnment grant is not eligible for the tax incentive, so providing fo r r efundability of the R&D that is eligible should not lead to double dippin g. 48. Finally, there is an argument that organisations that have chosen to be tax- exempt organisations should not subsequently receive benefits from the ta x sy stem . One concern is that organisations that are not paying tax can accumulat e a ssets faster than comparable taxpaying businesses so are better able to fun d investments including R&D. Another concern is that organisations may choose to p lace their profitable operations in a tax-exempt structure while treating thei r l oss -making parts as taxable entities . P roposal for tax-exempt organisations 4 9. O fficials are in the process of getting a better picture of the type and amount of R& D that is undertaken by organisations that are tax-exempt. We consider th e s takeholder engagement will be an opportunity to extend our knowledge . 50. H owever, we are conscious that these types of discussions could rai se e xpectations amongst tax-exempt organisations that they will be eligible fo r re funds of their tax credits if they are eligible for the tax incentive . 51. A lso, we consider there may be allegations of unfairness if organisations that a re u ndertaking R&D are shut out of the tax incentive as a result of not providi ng r efundability for tax-exempt organisations . 52. W e consider the arguments in favour of refundability for tax-exempt organisation s are stronger than the arguments opposing it. Consequently, the proposal is that t he stakeholder engagement would be based on the premise that tax-exemp t o rganisations would be eligible for the refund of their R&D tax credits, with onl y t he restrictions applying to taxpaying firms applying to them . 3 For example, the Endeavour Fund or Primary Growth Partnership IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 8 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence The R&D Tax Loss Cash Out Background 53.The R&D Tax Loss Cash Out was introduced in 2015 and allows some firms tha t perform R&D to cash out their losses, up to the amount of their R&D spend, s o t hey receive 28% of the relevant amount 4 . 5 4. The scheme has been designed to support R&D intensive firms. R&D intensi ty p rovides a way of targeting firms in the early phase of their development 5 . Thi s g roup of firms have been selected for support because : •T hey are likely to be cash-constrained. Their R&D might not yet hav e d eveloped a viable product so they will struggle to attract investors and th e a bsence of a commercial product means they are not earning revenue . •T hey are more likely to be at risk of breaching the loss continuity rule s w ithin the tax system so the losses are no longer available for the firm 6 . 55 . In terms of the immediate cash benefit provided by the policy, it functions like a 2 8% tax credit. However, an important difference from a standard tax credit or grant is that because the payment cancels an equal amount of the firm’s losses, t he tax -credit payments are more in the form of a loan from the governmen t w hich is “repaid” if the firm becomes profitable 7 . Other events (liquidation, sale of th e company or of IP) also trigger repayment obligations . 5 6. The scheme is tightly targeted to a subset of R&D -intensive firms throug h i mposing a wage-intensity test. This screens out many R&D performers and ha s m eant the scheme operates on a small scale. About 350 firms have registere d w ith slightly fewer actually applying for the credit. Its cost is about 10% o f e xpected expenditure on the tax incentive . 5 7. The advent of the R&D tax incentive has led Inland Revenue to review the R& D t ax loss cash out. This review is summarised as follows . Ho w is the R&D tax loss cash out working? 58.The tax loss cash out scheme was introduced in 2015 with effect from the 20 16 y ear. There are two full years of results (2016 and 2017) and one part yea r ( 2018) . 5 9. Uptake of the scheme has grown, with 350 firms now registered and the numbe r of approved firms slightly less than 300. In aggregate, the scheme has provide d $ 50m to firms undertaking R&D, over the past 3 years 8 . The average amount r eceived per firm has grown from $73,000 in year 1 to $105,000 in year 3. 60 . Recipients are generally smaller enterprises employing fewer than 20 employees . T here is a mix of stand-alone entities and firms that are part of a group. Of th e l atter, some have a foreign parent or are associated with a foreign entity tha t e xercises control over the functions and business activities of the firm . 4 Technically, it is the lesser of their R&D send or 1.5 x the amount spent on employees engaged in R&D. 5 The standard pattern is that as a firm’s R&D is successful and it commercialises its product, its R&D intensity will decline. 6 Generally, a firm loses it losses if there is more than a 50% change in ownership. This can be triggered either by the current shareholders selling or by an injection of fresh equity capital. Within the tax system there is a discretion for firms undertaking R&D to defer the recognition of their R&D expenditure so that the losses associated with their R&D expenditure are not lost. 7 Repayment occurs because a firm starts paying tax earlier than it would if it had carried losses forward. 8 $13.7 million was paid out for the 2016 tax year, $23.2 million was paid out for 2017, and – part year only - $16.3 million has been paid out for the 2018 year. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 9 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Is the scheme achieving its objectives? 61.An assessment of the scheme’s impact is difficult because many recipients al so re ceive other forms of government assistance (such as Callaghan Innovatio n grants or support from the NZ Venture Investment Fund). It is not possible to d iscern the impact of this scheme alone on the amount of R&D that is bein g c arried out . 62 . IR officials administering this scheme indicate there is some evidence of th e scheme providing needed financial support. Some firms use the credit to pay i nstalments on tax debt or to offset debt not under arrangement. Inland Revenu e o fficials consider the credit has on occasion saved a company from liquidation o r re lieved the financial strain of tax deb t. 63 . The eligibility criteria are designed to target New Zealand-based firms that are : •C urrently loss-making firms but will potentially become profit making an d t ax payin g •Firms for whom R&D is a central feature of their operation s •I n the start-up phase because these firms are most likely to be ca sh c onstraine d •N ot otherwise readily able to tap into non-government sources of finance . 6 4. An analysis of recipients of the scheme suggests that the current criteria a re l etting in these types of firms but also letting in firms that don’t meet the criteria . F or instance, in the first year though the majority of recipients had incorporated i n 2012 or later, at least 20% were more than 10 years old, so could not be c onsidered still in the start -up phase. Additionally, firms within a wholly owne d g roup with a listed company have been eligible, despite their access to significan t n on -government finance . 6 5. A feature of the scheme is the obligation to repay the credit once the firm ha s b ecome profitable or other conditions are met. Howeve r: •B ecause the scheme has only been in operation for a short time, there i s n ot a clear picture of whether firms are moving to profitabilit y •S ome firms have become profitable but still have other losses carrie d f or ward so are not yet paying ta x •A very small number of firms have triggered the other repaymen t o bligation s •T hese other criteria are hard to monitor and Inland Revenue is reliant on s elf -reporting by firm s •Some corporate structuring arrangements can result in perpetual loss m aking companies, despite significant revenue arising f rom c ommercialisation of the research and development . D efinition of R&D 66.The scheme works off the accounting standard definition of R&D. This is differe nt f rom the definition used in the R&D tax incentive . 67 . The accounting definition was consciously chosen when the scheme wa s developed because, given the target recipient was a small start-up firm, it was c onsidered this would be the easiest concept for firms to apply . IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 10 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Appendix 1 – International Comparisons of Refundability policies 84. The following table sets out key features of how refundability is applied in key OECD countries. Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: • firms with turnover less than A$20m & • subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is a recent feature aimed at fiscal affordability. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure. UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax credit at a discount to their value 11 . The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: • fewer than 500 employees and • turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is paid firms before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non -taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability. Here are some brief comments on each of them: 11 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss and 230% of the R&D spend). IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 13 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Eligibility for refundability based on firm characteristic (generally a measure of size such as turnover) • can target refundability to firms that, potentially, benefit most from it – ie, smaller or early stage firms • creates boundaries which might disincentivise desired behaviours – eg, a firm may choose not to grow to keep turnover below the threshold • relatively simple to understand but measurement would introduce complexity Refundability applies up to a cap; credits above cap carried forward • refundability addresses cash flow needs • less of a boundary issue so less likely to impact on firm behaviours (though incentive to increase R&D spend may diminish above cap) • relatively easy to understand and apply Limit refundability based on other taxes paid • If based on PAYE paid, more like a backstop rather than a fiscal cap as for most businesses the amount of PAYE across the whole firm will exceed 15% of the cost of R&D • Useful as a possible fraud deterrent as it should ensure a firm has a tangible economic presence, and may also prevent exploitation of a loophole if that involved claiming credits for high non-wage costs • Operates as some form of integrity and fiscal constraint measure, in that a firm cannot “take out” more than it is “putting in” to the tax system. • Some firms may not pay PAYE – eg, staff are not employees and are either shareholders who are paid a shareholder salary, contractors or provide sweat equity. This suggests either using a wider definition of taxes paid 12 or making a provision for firms to apply for an exemption • Administratively easy to understand and apply (subject to exceptions for firms without employees) Refund credits at a discount • Supports loss making firms while providing an incentive to become profitable • Provides firms with a choice whether to refund the credit or carry it forward • Perhaps less easy to understand but relatively easy to apply Spread refundability over several years • More complex to track a firm’s position • For a firm in a long-term loss making position, will produce similar results to full year refundability after a few years • Creates a tail of Government liability Target refundability based on R&D intensity This mechanism is not used by any other country for targeting refundability (though in Australia R&D intensity influences the credit rate for large enterprises) but is worth considering as it is the basis of the year one scheme. • Can target refundability to those most deserving of it • Creates a boundary that might give rise to perverse behaviours • Different measures of R&D intensity may favour different types of R&D performing firms Though relatively easy to understand, adds complexity to compliance and administration 12 One possibility would be to include adding withholding taxes paid.

Draft legislation introducing the R&D Tax Incentive from the 2019/20 tax year is currently before the House and provides for the R&D Tax Incentive scheme to commence from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. 1 2. Refundability of tax credits is an important part of the R&D Tax Incentive and will help incentivise R&D for firms in tax loss. Refundability refers to paying out the R&D tax credit to firm s who are in a tax loss position, or have insufficient income tax liability to off set the credit against. Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D receive the benefit of the tax credits they are eligible for under the R&D Tax Incentive. 3. Cabinet agreed to provide limited refundability for firms in a tax loss position for the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme and noted that the design features for refundability will likely change in subsequent years (DEV-18- MIN -0174 refers). 4. The limited refundability mechanism in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill caps refundable tax credits available in the 2019/20 tax year to $255,000. The eligibility criteria are the same as in the R&D tax loss cash-out scheme. 5. Officials developed a longer term refundability proposal to use for discussion with key stakeholders (IR2019/005; 2296 18-19 refers). The basis of the proposal was that refundability would be widely available to firms in a tax loss position. This is consistent with the objective of providing broad-based support for R&D. However, in order to manage the risks that refundability creates to the sustainability of the scheme, officials proposed that the amount of credits refunded to firm in a year would be limited to the lesser of: • the amount of PAYE paid by a firm; and • a cap of $5 million. 6. Officials engaged on this proposal during February and March 2019, with a range of organisations including: • Corporate Taxpayers’ Group (and a selection of their members in a loss making position including Xero and Fisher and Paykel Appliances); Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; • Approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing firm s in loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully utilise non-refundable R&D tax credits; • Other large established R&D performers, including Fonterra, Zespri, LIC Automation and Ballance Agri -Nutrients; • Levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives. Annex Two includes a list of organisations who took part in the stakeholder engagement process. Refundability 7. The draft Cabinet paper attached at Annex One sets out the design of the longer term refundability policy for inclusion in the Taxation (1 st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial 1 The R&D Tax Incentive applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year, which means the date from which it applies depends on the balance date of each individual claimant. For most standard balance date (31 March) claimants, the R&D Tax Incentive will apply from 1 April 2019. In Confidence 4 Matters) Bill. Incorporated in it are proposals developed as a result of the engagement process outlined above and additional policy analysis. 8. The draft Cabinet paper recommends the following refundability policy option for the Tax Incentive: • All firms would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed cap) 2 : i. The cap would not apply to R&D carried out by approved research providers; ii. The cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to statutory bodies. • All tax exempt organisations, except organisations receiving tax exempt income under section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act, will be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive; • All local authorities, as well as entities controlled by or associated with local authorities, will be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Existing measures to protect the integrity of the scheme 9. The R&D tax incentive scheme has a range of measures built into it to ensure its sustainability over the long term: • Qualifying for the R&D Tax Incentive requires R&D activity to be primarily undertaken in New Zealand. This closes off some of the fraud risks experienced in other jurisdictions associated to R&D occurring offshore. • The minimum R&D expenditure threshold of $50,000 reduces the risk of a large number of very small claims being submitted. This means that more resources can be focused on working with applicants during the in-year approval process. • The in year-approval system, with a single point of contact between business and the core R&D team within Inland Revenue, will help identify fraudulent claims through the flagging of unusual R&D applications and/or behaviour. 10. These measures will provide robustness and integrity for the scheme. However, given the experience of overseas jurisdictions, we are not confident they would be sufficient to manage the risks associated with refundability and consequently we have proposed a cap on payroll taxes. Cap based on payroll taxes 11. Our recommended refundability policy option, which involves a cap base d on payroll taxes 3 , means full refundability will not be as widely accessible as some firm s would like. Stakeholder engagement revealed early stage R&D intensive firms are disadvantaged by a PAYE cap, options to soften the impact were explored, including a tangible economic presence test 12. Some types of firm s would be disadvantaged by a PAYE cap for a number of reasons. This includes early stage R&D intensive firms who choose to have contractors over employees to reduce their financial risk, start-ups where people work on an unpaid basis in return for a stake in the company, and small to medium-sized software firm s where it is more common to 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax, employer superannuation contribution tax and withholding tax on schedular payments In Confidence 5 have flexible work arrangements 4 , and firms where capital is used over labour. Representatives from KPMG considered that flexible work arrangements are becoming more commonplace across all sectors and they expect the trend to continue in future. 13. As a result of the stakeholder engagement officials explored alternatives to a hard PAYE cap, specifically a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed by officials required firms to choose one of the following measures to satisfy the test: • PAYE paid by the firm is greater than the amount of tax credit to be refunded; • Obtaining verification of TEP from a chartered accountant or practising lawyer; • Obtaining verification from Inland Revenue that a firm has TEP. 14. The TEP test is an attractive option that has broader reach and impact for firms who most need refundability support, but it is not sufficient to address the risks of fraud. Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. Officials recommend including a hard cap on PAYE to address fraud risk, but recommend broadening it to ‘all payroll taxes’ to soften the impact 15. Early stage R&D intensive firms are important participants within the innovation system both as a source of value-add employment and the development of a more productive and diversified economy. To ensure these firms can benefit as much as possible from the scheme we have broadened the proposal to include: • all payroll taxes; • R&D tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. 16. Based on analysis undertaken by Inland Revenue, broadening the definition from PAYE to include fringe benefit tax and withholding tax on schedular payments does not have a large impact (around 1.5 per cent increase). However, a recent legislative change allows firms and contractors to enter into voluntary schedular arrangements and deduct withholding tax. We would anticipate that firms who would otherwise be disadvantaged by the cap based on payroll taxes paid could use this provision. 17. Offici als are investigating the impact of a payroll cap on firms. Officials will report to you on this , through its incorporation into the regulatory impact assessment (RIA). 18. The most consistently voiced theme during consultation is how crucial cash is to the survival of early stage R&D intensive firms. Therefore the recommended option will ensure refundability is available to most firms in a tax-loss position (either as a partial or full refund of tax credits). It will also be simple to administer. 19. It is a conservative approach with reduced benefits for some firms. On balance, we recommend this option because it manages the problems seen in other jurisdictions 5 . Officials consider this option to be a viable starting position for introduction of the legislation and we will continue to explore how other jurisdictions manage risks and enable refundability. 4 For example, staff may choose to be contractors rather than employees to give them maximum flexibility over their working arrangements 5 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. In Confidence 6 There are other mechanisms in the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio that are currently under review that can be used to further support R&D intensive start-ups 20. In addition to the Tax Incentive, the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio has a suite of other interventions that can be used to support R&D intensive start-ups. 21. MBIE, in conjunction with Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, is leading a programme of work to review interventions for R&D intensive start-ups in light of the shifting R&D funding environment. T his includes: a review of Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Project Grants; reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out scheme; and a commitment to a refreshed and more ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through the New Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high-growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology. 22. There is also a commitment for further policy work to be undertaken as part of the Tax Incentive to simplify administration processes for small to medium enterprises. Removal of the $5 million cap 23. Our recommended option removes the previous proposed $5 million cap on refundability. A small number of large established R&D performers will be constrained by a $5 million cap on refundability 24. Stakeholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by the $5 million cap. For example a company 6 in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually, would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under the proposed cap the company would receive a $5 million refund on its R&D tax credits and would have to shift the remaining $7 million credits into future years. B ut because the company spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to cash out fully their accumulation of carry-forward R&D credits. 25. There are a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These companies are mainly in a tax -paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. Removing the $5 million cap will incentivise large established R&D performers to undertake more R&D and increase the attractiveness of the scheme off-shore 26. The removal of the $5 million cap reduces inequity for large established R&D performers. While the number of New Zealand firms who would be constrained by a $5 million cap is small their contribution to the innovation system is significant. In 2016, 26 per cent of all BERD was carried out by six firms that spent $25 million or more on R&D. Removing the $5 million cap will help incentivise these firms to undertake greater levels of R&D. 27. Removal of the cap may also help attract R&D performing multi-national corporations (MNCs) to New Zealand. New Zealand currently lacks the very large MNCs which tend to drive R&D expenditure in other countries. The removal of the $5 million cap, while retaining the cap based on payroll taxes, will ensure that MNCs are contributing to New Zealand’s economy at a minimum through benefits such as providing employment opportunities in New Zealand. 28. The $120 million cap on R&D expenditure with discretion to exceed it through a pre- registration process would continue to apply to all R&D performers. 6 Details withheld In Confidence 7 29. Officials understand that Ministers might prefer the assurance that a maximum cap on refundability brings to the scheme in terms of fiscal budgeting and public perceptions. If Ministers choose to include a cap on refundability (additional to the cap based on payroll taxes), then we suggest it should be set at $5 million, on the basis that loss -making firms currently receive up to $5 million per year from Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Growth Grants. 30. If Ministers prefer to include a cap on refundability then officials will provide further advice on threshold options to ensure firms are not disadvantaged. Treatment of tax-exempt organisations 31. Our recommended option ensures that levy bodies, some of whom are tax exempt, are eligible for refundability but recommends that other tax exempt organisations are e xcluded from the R&D Tax Incentive. Levy bodies were intended to be part of the scheme and will only benefit from refundability 32. Cabinet agreed to include levy bodies in the R&D Tax Incentive (DEV-18- MIN -0174). 33. Levy bodies are not by definition tax exempt organisations, but some may be tax exempt because of section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CW 49 provides that the income of certain entities is exempt income, if the entities are established for the main purpose of promoting or encouraging research. It is proposed that tax exempt organisations, such as charities, be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, a carve-in is proposed for entities that receive exempt income under CW 49, so that these entities are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Entities who receive income under section CW 49 do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donor tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions), and are specifically established for the main purpose of promoting or encouraging research. The amount of R&D tax credits refundable to these entities would still be subject to the proposed cap based on payroll taxes, unless the relevant entity is established by statute As a result, levy bodies established by statute would have fully refundable R&D tax credits. 34. Engagement revealed that levy bodies undertake research projects independent of MBIE science investment funding. If levy bodies are eligible for refundable R&D tax credits, the amount they invest in independent research would likely increase. Charities sit outside of the tax system and should be excluded from the tax incentive but a charity with a partially controlled business entity is eligible in order to address post-settlement governance entities 35. Some charities, particularly in the health sector, undertake R&D that would qualify under the R&D tax incentive. But the estimated amount of R&D conducted in the charitable sector appears to be small 7 . Charities also sit outside the tax system giving them preferential tax treatment over firms. On this basis we do not consider it appropriate to extend further benefits to charities through the tax system as would be the case if they were eligible for the R&D tax incentive. 36. There are a small number of post-settlement governance entities (e.g. Ngāi Tahu) that are registered as charities. To ensure they are not unduly penalised for a governance structure imposed on them we propose not including broader association rules in relationship to charities. This would mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which would not have tax exempt status and therefore be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. We understand that post- settlement governance entities generally have more scope to set up partially controlled 7 The 2018 R&D survey showed that $99 million of funds for internal R&D comes from ‘other funding sources’. Specific questionnaire wording is ‘Other funding sources (e.g. the Lotteries commission, cancer society and charities)’. In Confidence 8 business entities than standard charities. We also understand it is reasonably difficult for a charity to change the rules of its constitution without putting its charitable status at risk. Tax loss cash out Policy issues around the ‘tax loss cash out’ scheme are complex and further policy work is required before reform is possible 37. Our previous advice noted our intention to review the R&D tax loss cash out scheme. During stakeholder engagement we explored the value of this scheme to firms and the potential interactions it has with refundability of the R&D tax credit. 38. This provided useful information but also confirmed the issues are relatively complex and require consideration of the scheme itself, its interaction with the R&D Tax Incentive, and how it fits with other government policies both in the tax system (for instance the loss continuity rules) and with regard to government support for R&D intensive start-ups and innovative firms. 39. Because of time pressures associated with developing the broader refundability policy so that it can be incorporated in legislation in 2019, we propose it is sensible to decouple changes to the R&D tax loss cash out and refundability. Officials will continue to work on possible reform of the R&D tax loss cash out and anticipate discussing options with Ministers later in 2019. This will mean that policy changes are not likely to be implemented until the 2021/22 income tax year 8 . Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill supplementary order paper 40. We have identified we will need a supplementary order paper (SOP) for the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill. 41. The current Bill allows Inland Revenue to communicate information about tax credits to Callaghan Innovation. However, Inland Revenue’s legal department has indicated this is insufficient for Callaghan Innovation’s role as co-administrator of the tax incentive. The SOP will enable Inland Revenue to provide access to its systems so that Callaghan Innovation can function effectively as a co-administrator of the tax incentive. 42. The SOP will amend clause 37B of the Bill, which amends clause 39 of schedule 7 of the TAA 9 by adding a new 39(3). Subsection (3) provides for personnel from Callaghan Innovation to access the information necessary for administering the tax incentive. 43. The SOP also makes a small number of minor typographical corrections. Annex Three sets out the SOP for inclusion into legislation. Remedial legislative issues 44. We have identified a small number of issues where the legislation in the reported back version of the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill does not fully achieve the policy intent. Issues identified relate to allocating R&D tax credits to members of joint ventures; the time available for businesses to complete the R&D tax credit claim disputes 8 From the 2020/21 income year most applicants for the R&D Tax Incentive will go through an in-year approval, while the R&D loss tax cash out is an end-of-year process. For customers that are eligible for both schemes this may result in a suboptimal claim experience. Officials will seek to make service improvements, until policy changes can be made. 9 Schedule 7 was inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (ARMTARM Act). The version of the Tax Administration Act 1994 published on the New Zealand Legislation website does not yet include schedule 7 because the ARMTARM Act received royal assent on 18 March 2019. In Confidence 9 process; and the R&D certifier regime. These issues will not have any practical impact until claims are submitted in respect of the 2019/20 income year. This means that they need to be corrected by 1 April 2020. Officials propose that rather than correcting these issues through a SOP, these issues would instead be corrected through remedial legislative changes included in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Regulatory impact assessment 45. The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is being reviewed by officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Changes will be made to the RIA to incorporate feedback from this review process. 46. The assessment will be finalised in time for submission of the Cabinet paper to the Economic Development Committee on 16 May . The RIA will be provided to your office before the end of April. Next Steps 47. We recommend you provide feedback to officials on the Cabinet paper by 15 April, or as soon thereafter as possible. We will incorporate your feedback and provide you with a revised draft Cabinet paper which you can use for consultation with your colleagues, coalition partner and confidence and supply partner. Officials will use the same draft Cabinet paper to undertake interdepartmental consultation. 48. In order to meet the legislative timetable, we recommend the Cabinet paper is lodged on 16 May 2019, for consideration at Cabinet Economic Development Committee on 22 May 2019. 49. Subject to Cabinet agreement, the expected introduction of refundability through the Taxation (1 st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill will be June 2019.

Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) officials met with Minister Woods on Monday 29 April to discuss the draft Cabinet paper on the refundability proposal. Minister Woods suggested that she and her colleague Minister Nash meet to discuss the draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive (3068 18-19/IR2019/159 refers). 2. This brief provides you with additional information to support your discussions on the refundability proposal included in the draft Cabinet paper. The Cabinet paper proposes broad-based refundability 3. The draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive, outlined a proposal for the design of the longer term refundability policy to replace the limited refundability that applies for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive (Tax Incentive) scheme. 4. The Tax Incentive has been designed to be a broad based scheme, providing easily accessible R&D support for eligible businesses regardless of their size, revenue or profit or loss position. The refundability proposal as recommended by officials is consistent with this overarching policy objective. 5. Officials have proposed that refundability is broadly available to all firms in loss whose R&D activities qualify for the Tax Incentive. We propose that Levy bodies are eligible for the Tax Incentive but that charities, local authorities and other tax-exempt organisations are ineligible. 6. We are also proposing a cap based on payroll taxes to constrain how much of the R&D tax credit can be refunded in any one year. This is to manage the risks that refundability poses to the integrity of the scheme. A cap based on payroll taxes ensures the amount a firm receives from refundability is not more than the amount the firm puts into the tax system. It is also simple to understand and easy to administer. An alternative is to target refundability to SMEs, or to apply a cap Targeting refundability to small-medium-enterprises (SMEs) 7. Our analysis shows that two-thirds of Growth Grant recipients are in loss. It also shows that 73 per cent of Growth Grant recipients are not SMEs (i.e. they have more than 20 full-time- equivalents (FTEs)). This analysis indicates that there would be a significant number of Growth Grant recipients who would not receive the benefit of refundability if it were targeted to SMEs only. Limiting refundability by introducing a cap on the amount that can be refunded 8. If there was a less restrictive form of targeting, for example a cap on the amount of R&D tax credits that can be refunded then fewer firms would be impacted. Analysis shows there are between four to six New Zealand based R&D performers who are likely to be negatively impacted by a $5 million cap (i.e. they are in loss and also undertake more than $30 million worth of R&D activity per year). 9. If Ministers choose to limit refundability to a specific capped amount then officials consider that it would be necessary to provide further advice on threshold options or ways to treat atypical businesses such as cooperatives to ensure such firms are not disadvantaged. Additional policy options are likely to add further complexity to the scheme. In Confidence 5 Additional analysis of the proposed payroll cap 11. Our recommended refundability policy option limits the amount of the R&D tax credit that is refundable to the amount of payroll taxes 2 paid in the same tax year. In our previous briefing we undertook to investigate the impact a payroll cap has on firms and report back on this (3068 18-19, IR2019/159 refers). 12. We investigated the impact a payroll cap will have on smaller firms, by assessing how it would affect current Callaghan Innovation Project Grant recipients. Project Grants are designed for businesses new to or trying to expand their R&D. Officials selected Project Grants recipients for our analysis because we are able to identify Project Grant recipients in the Inland Revenue system and they are a proxy for early stage R&D intensive firms. However, no adjustment has been made for Project Grant recipients who have an estimated level of eligible R&D below the $50,000 per year threshold. 13. There are 326 firms in the Project Grant sample, of these: • 20 per cent are in profit, so would receive the benefit of an R&D tax credit • The remaining 80 per cent did not report income or are in loss. Of this 80 per cent: o 43 per cent did not report income or are in loss, but pay sufficient payroll taxes to get all or most of their R&D tax credits refunded o 18 per cent did not report income or are in loss and only pay a small amount of payroll taxes so would need to carry forward a relatively large proportion of their R&D tax credits o 39 per cent did not report income or are in loss and do not pay any payroll taxes so would be unable to receive any refund of their R&D tax credit, and would carry forward all their R&D tax credits 14. However, there are significant caveats 3 around this analysis which means it should only be considered as indicative for early stage R&D intensive firms. Nonetheless, it indicates that a notable proportion of early stage R&D intensive firms may not receive a full refund of their R&D tax credits This is consistent with feedback received from the stakeholder workshops. 15. The introduction of the Tax Incentive does not change firms’ access to Project Grants. And some firms receiving Project Grants will also have additional R&D expenditure that qualifies for the Tax Incentive. 16. As noted previously the Tax Incentive is not the only tool to support start-ups. Officials are in the process of reviewing Project Grants and the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out policy to identify improvements to these instruments. Changes to the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out policy will unlikely to be in place when the revised refundability policy will commence in April 2020, but changes to Project Grants could be. 2 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax, employer superannuation contribution tax and withholding tax on schedula r payments. It is also proposed that eligible payments to Approved Research Providers would not be subject to the cap. 3 The assessment of R&D expenditure could be an under estimate of the firm’s eligible expenditure under the R&D Tax Incentive. We have not taken into account any behavioural changes, for instance firms and contractors entering into voluntary schedular arrangements to deduct withholding tax or firms being able to adjust the level of net income they report so that the tax credit offsets any tax liability. Some firms will be part of a corporate group so the amounts of payroll taxes paid may be greater than what we have assessed. In Confidence 6 Feedback from agency consultation on local authorities’ eligibility f o r t h e Tax Incentive 17.The draft Cabinet paper recommends that all local authorities, as well as entities controlled by or associated with local authorities, are not eligible for the Tax Incentive. In its feedback on the draft Cabinet paper, the Department of Internal Affairs suggested that the underlying rationale for excluding local authorities was sound, but pointed out that companies minority owned by councils operated in the commercial sphere and therefore could be considered for eligibility. 18.We think this is a sensible adjustment, as it would bring these minority-owned entities of councils onto the same footing as minority owned entities of Crown Research Institutes, District Health Boards and tertiary organisations. Next Steps 19.We will incorporate your feedback and provide you with a revised draft Cabinet paper which you can use for consultation with other Ministers and their offices. 20.In order to meet the legislative timetable, we recommend the Cabinet paper is lodged on 16 May 2019, for consideration at Cabinet Economic Development Committee on 22 May 2019. 21.The regulatory impact statement is being assessed by the review panel. We expect to be able to provide this to your office next week. 22.The timetable for Cabinet and LEG approval on 24 June 2019 is dictated by other items that will be in the Tax Omnibus Bill.

Legislation has been enacted. •The current legislation only allows for limited refundability. The Government has committed t o a more comprehensive policy on refundability from year 2 of the Incentiv e. •T he R&D Tax Incentive has been designed to be a broad based scheme, providing easil y ac cessible R&D support for eligible businesses regardless of their size, revenue or profit o r loss position. •D elivering a broader refundability policy is important, or the Incentive will not be as effectiv e as int ended. Refundability proposal •The core proposal is that firms in loss can have all their tax credits refunded for expenditure w ith an Approved Research Provider, and all other tax credits can be refunded subject t o a c ap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by a firm. Payroll taxes will primaril y c omprise PAYE (which includes withholding taxes on schedular payments to contractors) , but will also include payments for Fringe Benefit Tax and Employer Superannuati on C ontribution Ta x. •A ll businesses will be eligible for refundability, consistent with eligibility for the Incentive . Lev y bodies are included as the R&D they perform is fundamentally business R&D . •C harities and other tax-exempt organisations will be excluded from the Tax Incentive . Thes e organisations are outside the tax system so they should not benefit from incentiv es pr ovided from within it. In particular, charities already receive several tax concessions so i t i s not appropriate to extend further benefits to them . •B ecause these rules would not apply a broad association test, businesses that are partiall y ow ned by a charity, such as a post-settlement iwi organisation, would not be excl uded. Payroll cap •A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the Incentive through reducing the risk of f raudulent claims which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) i n ot her jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits . •A pay roll cap means firms do not get more from the tax system than they put in, whic h combats the use of shell companies. •T he UK had this policy in place for SMEs but removed it in 2011. The consequence was a s harp increase in the incidence of fraud. The UK Government has recently announced it s i ntention to reinstate the policy. 1 Next steps •Subject to Cabinet approval to the proposed refundability design, legislation will be introduced to Parliament in June 2019. 1 The UK Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document “Preventing abuse of the R&D Tax Relief for SMEs’. 3482 18-19 In Confidence 4 Annex Two: Q&As Does the refundability proposal increase the fiscal cost of the Incentive? •No. The Incentive’s fiscal cost model assumes that firms in loss will claim the full tax credit. T reasury have confirmed that they are comfortable that allowing refundability as propos ed w ill have no further impact on the appropriation . •T he 2018 R&D survey results show higher growth in R&D than previously forecast. However, the updated fiscal cost estimates still fall within the existing appropriation. What impact will the payroll cap have on small companies? •A small proportion of companies, most often smaller ones, quite legitimately pay little or no P AYE. They may employ staff on contract rather than as employees or owners may tak e dr awings rather than a salary. On the surface, these firms may receive little initial benefi t f rom the proposed refundability policy . •However, the impact on small companies should be manageable: •Some of the firms that do not pay PAYE appear to do limited amounts of R&D so w ould not meet the $50,000 threshold . •Where a firm’s R&D is via a contract with an Approved Research Provider, all its tax c redit will be refunded . •Because the cap is based on all payroll taxes, there will be scope for firms to enter i nto an agreement with contractors and deduct withholding tax. Such payment s w ould increase the amount of tax credit that would be refunded . •There is, and will continue to be, other support that such firms could potentially ac cess rather than the Tax Incentive. Possibilities include project grants, the R& D t ax loss cash out, the Technology Incubator Programme, and the New Zeal and V enture Capital Fund . •Officials are continuing to investigate the impact this policy may have on smaller R&D i ntensive firms and will provide further advice prior to the policy being considered at Selec t C ommittee if it seems necessary . Why are large companies eligible for refundability? •Larger firms are less likely than smaller firms to be cash constrained so their need for r efunds may be less. However, the following reasons support refunding the tax credit for al l f irms (subject to the payroll cap) : •The policy provides for even handed treatment of firms in profit and loss, thereby i ncentivising all of them to undertake additional R&D . •Meeting the government’s target of growing R&D to 2% of GDP requires growth in R& D from large as well as small firms . •Some larger firms that are major R&D performers are in a tax loss position. These f irms would get no benefit from credits carried forward; the only way they will benefi t f rom credits is if they are ref unded. •In addition to performing R&D in New Zealand, these large companies would still hav e to be contributing to the New Zealand economy through payments t o em ployees or contractors, as the payroll cap prevents them from taking more out o f t he New Zealand tax system than they put i n. 3482 18-19 In Confidence 5 •If the Committee is unwilling to support full refunds for large companies, officials would r ecommend a cap on the amount that is refunded rather than any targeting to SMEs . •There is a default cap of $18 million (being 15% of the maximum eligible expenditure of $120m per year) . •We would suggest a cap should be at least $5 million if the Tax Incentive is to be perceived at least as favourably as the Growth Grant . Why are tax exempt organisations not eligible for refundability? •This position is based on these organisations being outside the tax system so they should not benefit from incentives provided from within it. In particular, charities already receiv e s everal tax concessions so it is not appropriate to extend further benefits to them . •B ecause these rules would not apply a broad association test, businesses that are partiall y owned by a charity, such as a post-settlement iwi organisation, would not be excluded. Are local authorities eligible for refundability? •Local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled or ganisations would be eligibl e. Why are levy bodies and payments to Approved Research Providers not subject to the cap? •Payments to Approved Research Providers will be easy to verify, posing a lower fraud risk. •Lev y bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economi c pr esence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D t ax c redits will be unrecoverabl e. What other forms of R&D support does the government provide? •Over time we intend to have a full package of support for New Zealand’s innovation system. T he R&D Tax Incentive will be one support amongst many . •Oth er forms of current government support for business R&D include: R&D Project and S tudent grants, advice, and support in kind; and a limited R&D tax loss cash out . •O fficials are reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out and project grants to ensure R& D i ntensive start-ups have adequate R&D support. There is a commitment to a refreshed and m ore ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through t he N ew Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high- growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology . How does the refundability proposal compare internationally? •Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundability have some constraints. A system w ith no restrictions on refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries . •T he different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the underlyi ng t ax incentive scheme. Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups . •I t is relatively common to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE . This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is bei ng made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and i t r educes the risk that the claim is made by a non-existent entity . 3482 18-19 In Confidence 6 What are stakeholders’ views on the proposal? •This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array of organisations. •Many submissions on the Tax Incentive legislation were in favour of broader refundability. •Fur ther engagement undertaken specifically with smaller R&D performers indicated that a PAYE cap could restrict the tax credit refunds available to these firms. The proposed cap now brings in FBT and ESCT in addition to PAYE, as well as expenditure on Approv ed R esearch Providers . •T hese changes to the cap will reduce its impact for some of these firms. In addition, t he c urrent ecosystem of support (which includes project grants and the R&D tax loss cash out ) f or these smaller R&D performers will conti nue. •M BIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan have discussed refundability proposals with t he C orporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zeal and; r epresentatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives fr om R &D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully use non­ refundable R&D tax credits; levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives . •T hese discussions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, and hav e hi ghlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process . 3482 18-19 In Confidence 7 MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, INNOVATION & EMPLOYMENT HTKINA WHAKATUTUKI A Inland Revenue � If TeTariTaake R&D Tax Incentive -refundability and small innovative firms Date: 27 June 2019 Security In Confidence classification: Action sought Hon Dr Megan Woods Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue Kirsty Hutchison Priority: Medium Tracking 3584 18-19 number: IR2019/303 Action sou ht Note that most loss-making firms will benefit from the refundability proposal but the payroll cap will restrict access to refundable ta credits for some early stao. � \\ . m� with little or no PAYE. ?G;v Note that MBIE w � � rti� 1 her advice on the f-,,, mdn�4\_c., '.scape for small inno +i · firms) Telephone 049014131 04 901 4173 04 890 2808 1 st contact ✓ Senior Policy Advisor, IR04 890 3010 f™"'Yiif� Tth .ollowing departments/agencies have been consulted Callaghan Innovation Minister's office to complete: Comment D Approved D Noted D Seen D See Minister's Notes D Declined D Needs change D Overtaken by Events D Withdrawn .\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ....,,.\_N\_c\_QNEI.D\_EJiC , E \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ --J    BRIEFING R&D Tax Incentive – refundability and small innovative firms Date: 27 June 2019 Priority: Medium Security classification: In Confidence Tracking number: 3584 18-19 IR2019/303 Purpose This briefing provides additional information about the impact on small early stage firms of limiting R&D tax credit refunds by the payroll tax cap.

Minister Woods and Minister Nash met on 6 May 2019 to discuss the draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Incentive. At the meeting officials undertook to: • Continue to refine our analysis of the impact a payroll cap will have on small innovative businesses, including through engagement with selected stakeholders who work with startups. • Provide you with information on other R&D funding support available for these firms. The payroll cap addresses the risks that refundability creates for the integrity of the tax system 1. The objectives of the broader refundability proposal are to support as much genuine R&D as possible in a way that is simple to administer and that maintains the integrity of the tax system 2. The refundability proposal agreed by Cabinet is: • All firms are entitled to a refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (payroll cap). • The payroll cap would not limit refundability of tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. • The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 3. The purpose of the payroll cap is to manage the risks that refundability poses to the integrity of the tax system, thereby supporting the sustainability of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme The refundability proposal is both generous and broad-based (does not target firms of a particular size) in comparison to other jurisdictions. 1 4. A payroll cap is simple to administer, ensures firms have tangible economic presence in New Zealand, and is used by some other jurisdictions 2 that provide refundable R&D tax credits. However, a payroll cap may limit refunds for businesses that have little or no PAYE. Most loss-making firms that qualify for the Tax Incentive will benefit from refundability 5. Our previous analysis on the impact of the payroll cap on small innovative businesses (3372 18-19 IR2019/233 refers) was based on 326 firms in receipt of a Callaghan Innovation Project Grant. Project Grant recipients are a proxy for certain types of firms that are most at risk of not benefiting from the refundability policy (i.e. startups), and we were able to gauge the impact of the refundability policy by using Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation data. 1 33 out of 46 international schemes do not provide refundability provisions. 12 out of 28 OECD governments currently offer preferential tax treatment to SMEs or young firms. 2 For example, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands (2296 18-19; IR2019/005 refers). In Confidence IN CONFIDENCE 3    6. The initial analysis indicated that 101 of these firms either did not report income, or were in loss and may not receive a refund of their R&D tax credits because they did not pay any payroll taxes. There were a number of significant caveats around the initial analysis, including that it did not take into account the $50,000 minimum expenditure threshold which would have excluded many of these firms from being eligible for the Tax Incentive. 7. We have subsequently updated our analysis using more robust R&D expenditure values 3 and filtering for firms that did not consistently meet the $50,000 R&D expenditure threshold during the project grant period. 8. The revised results indicate that the number of firms whose access to refunds is restricted by the payroll cap is smaller than initially identified. 9. The results show 21 firms with possibly no refund. However, taking into account entities with holding companies (which may give group access to payroll taxes) would leave 12 firms (4% of the sample) with possibly no refund. These firms could still potentially use Approved Research Providers or withholding taxes from voluntary schedular arrangements with contractors to access refundability. More detailed analysis is provided in Annex One. Stakeholders had mixed views on the impact of the refundability proposal on startups 10. Building on our earlier engagement with stakeholders on the refundability policy, we met with selected stakeholders to test our understanding of the impact a payroll cap will have on small innovative businesses. 11. The discussions with tax advisors (EY, Deloitte, CAANZ, PwC, KPMG) suggest that early stage startups in the software or digital sectors in particular are unlikely to benefit from the refundability proposal due to their reliance on labour from founders or contractors, for which PAYE is not being withheld To benefit, these firms would need to enter into voluntary withholding arrangements or engage the services of an Approved Research Provider (ARP). 12. Voluntary withholding arrangements are simple to enter into but have only been available from 2017 and have perceived compliance costs, e.g. contractors may have pre-existing arrangements. Some firms may benefit from the ARP expenditure exclusion from the cap, e.g. businesses engaged in scientific-oriented R&D that work with universities or crown research institutes. Firms in the software or digital sectors are less likely to use ARPs. We are unable to estimate the proportion of businesses that may benefit from expenditure with an ARP being excluded from the cap. 13. In contrast, our discussions with other organisations that work with startups on a day to day basis (Astrolab, Level Two and Dotterel) suggest that the refundability proposal will benefit young innovative firms. These organisations observed that contractors are often used for temporary or specialist projects, and that most startups, particularly those building a company around deep technology, need to build a dedicated team of employees. 14. We expect submissions to the Select Committee to reflect the views above. We will report back to Ministers following the submissions process on feedback received and our proposed response. 3 This now includes additional R&D expenditure reported by firms to Callaghan Innovation. Not all firms choose to record additional data. Officials have used Project Grant R&D values in the absence of self- reported figures. In Confidence IN CONFIDENCE 4    Stakeholders generally understood that the Tax Incentive is not the only instrument available to support startups 15. The Tax Incentive is the centrepiece of government support for business R&D. However, there are a range of other mechanisms currently available and targeted to small innovative businesses and startups which address the needs of firms that do not qualify for the Tax Incentive (because of the $50,000 threshold or the definition of R&D), or who may be deterred because of compliance costs relative to the benefit they will receive. 16. A brief overview of other funding sources currently available is provided in Annex Two. These measures provide support to early stage innovative businesses to invest in, commercialise and scale up their R&D and to build entrepreneurial capability. 17. For example, firms that just meet the $50,000 R&D expenditure threshold would receive tax credits worth $7,500 (at a 15% tax credit rate). Firms spending less than $50,000 on R&D, may be better off accessing the Getting Started Grant (up to $5,000), the Capability vouchers (up to $5,000) and Project Grants (40% of eligible expenditure). These grants provide a stepping stone to either larger Project Grants or the Tax Incentive. 18. If a firm in a tax loss position qualifies for the Tax Incentive but does not pay any payroll taxes (including at a group level) and does not have any eligible expenditure with an ARP or contractors who agree to voluntary withholding arrangements, then it will be better suited to accessing the other support mechanisms available 19. At the current time, firms that meet the criteria for the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme (generally small R&D-intensive firms) can also receive cash for up to 28% of their tax losses from R&D expenditure, subject to a maximum of $476,000 in the 2019/20 tax year. 4 We propose to undertake further work on the funding landscape for small innovative firms 20. As noted in some of our earlier briefings on the R&D Tax Incentive, the natural next step following the introduction of the Tax Incentive is to review the wider landscape of support for smaller innovative businesses, including startups. This review will complement the work underway on early stage capital markets (led by the Minister for Economic Development). A focus of this work will be how existing supports other than the R&D tax incentive can be shaped to ensure there is support for firms for whom the tax incentive may not be ideal. We will report back to you on the scope of this project and proposed terms of reference. Our intention is to have initial options explored prior to our response to submissions to Select Committee. Proactive release 21. We propose to include this briefing (with only information withheld to protect the privacy of natural persons) in the proactive release of the Cabinet paper Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive which is currently in process. Annexes Annex One: Analysis on the impact of the payroll cap Annex Two: Other sources of government funding for small innovative businesses 4 It is proposed to review this scheme now that the R&D Tax Incentive is in place. In Confidence 5 IN CONFIDENCE    Annex One: Analysis on the impact of the payroll cap 1. The table below summarises the results of both our previous analysis and our updated analysis that filters for the impact of the $50,000 threshold and which also benefits from more robust R&D expenditure values. 5 2. Based on the updated analysis, the number of firms that would not benefit from refundability due to the payroll cap is smaller than under the previous analysis. Project Grant sample (326 firms) Results from previous analysis Results from updated analysis (filtered for firms that consistently meet the $50,000 threshold) Did not report income or were in loss 260 firms 109 firms Did not report income or were in loss and paid sufficient payroll taxes 112 firms 45 firms Did not report income or were in loss and only paid a small amount of payroll taxes (limited refund) 47 firms 43 firms Did not report income or were in loss and did not pay any payroll taxes (no refund) 101 firms 21 firms 3. Under the updated analysis 21 firms would potentially get no refund. These firms may receive a refund if they have access to withholding taxes through the use of contractors, use an Approved Research Provider, or have a holding company with the potential to pay payroll taxes at the group level. 4. Expenditure on contractors was not available for firms included in the above analysis. However, analysis of data from the R&D Tax Loss Credit scheme (which includes information on R&D contractor spend) shows that withholding taxes from voluntary schedular arrangements with contractors could significantly reduce the number of firms affected by the payroll cap. 5. 9 of the 21 firms have holding companies, so may be able to access payroll taxes at a group level. This would potentially leave 12 firms (4% of the sample) without any refund. 5 This now includes R&D expenditure reported by firms. Not all firms choose to record this data. Officials have used Project Grant R&D values in the absence of self-reported figures.
