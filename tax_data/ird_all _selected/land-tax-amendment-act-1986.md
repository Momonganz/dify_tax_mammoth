### Penalty for failure to furnish returns, etc

Section 2 gives effect to the Government's decision to increase the maximum penalties for offences against the Land Tax Act. The section amends section 58 of the principal Act by increasing the maximum penalties for offences against the principal Act. The new penalties are set out in Appendix III of this Bulletin.

A feature of the new penalties is that the maximum penalties are increased for taxpayers who have been convicted of an offence or offences against the principal Act on a previous occasion. It should be noted that the maximum penalty does not increase with each single offence committed. The increase in penalty occurs only on each occasion on which the taxpayer is convicted of one or more offences against the principal Act.

### Example

1\. Taxpayer fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1985, 1986 and 1987. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the first conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1985 | $ 500 |
| 1986 | $2,000 |
| 1987 | $2,000 |

2\. The same taxpayer later fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1988 and 1989. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the taxpayer's second conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1988 | $4,000 |
| 1989 | $4,000 |

3\. The same taxpayer later fails to furnish land tax returns for the years ending 31 March 1990 and 1991. He is prosecuted and convicted of these offences on one occasion. As this is the taxpayers third conviction the maximum penalties are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1990 | $6,000 |
| 1991 | $6,000 |

4\. The maximum penalties for any subsequent conviction in respect of offences for failure to furnish a land tax return will be $6,000.

### Officers and employees of corporate bodies

Section 3 inserts into the principal Act a new section 58A which provides that an officer or employee of a corporate body who is responsible for furnishing information to the Commissioner commits an offence if he or she fails to do so..

The expression "officer" is defined, for the purposes of section 58A, in section 58A(1) as including:

1.  a director, or secretary or other statutory officer of the corporate body;
2.  a receiver or manager of any property of the corporate body;
3.  a liquidator of the corporate body.

Whether or not an officer or employee of a body corporate is responsible for furnishing information on behalf of that body corporate is a question of fact which must be decided on the basis of the facts of each case.

The penalty for this new offence is provided in section 58(2) of the principal Act.
