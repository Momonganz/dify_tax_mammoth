=================================================================

There’s a lot to think about when you’re starting a new business. It’s important you understand your responsibilities to help you get it right from the start and avoid penalties and interest.

We recommend you check out the business.govt.nz website, and also get advice from an accountant, lawyer, tax agent or business advisor.

Starting your business

### Naming your business

### Choose a business structure

Self-employed, partnership or company?

There are different ways to set up your business, with different tax obligations for each. It can be expensive to change your business structure, so it’s important to choose the right one.

Read about these and other options in our ‘Setting up a business or organisation’ page. Business.govt.nz has a tool to help you choose.

### Income tax for business

Most businesses and organisations that make an income in New Zealand need to file an income tax return.

Plan and save for your taxes, and you’ll have better control of your cash flow, avoid penalties for late payment, and save yourself stress.

### Goods and services tax (GST)

Once you turnover $60,000 a year, you need to register for GST, charge 15% GST on your sales and income, and pay it to us. You can claim GST back on your purchases and expenses.

### Employing people

When you start employing people, you need to register as an employer and make deductions from their pay.
