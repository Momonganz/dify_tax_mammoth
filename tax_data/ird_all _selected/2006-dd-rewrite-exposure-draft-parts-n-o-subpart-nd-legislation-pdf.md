Number used in calculations (2) The number of days on which a vehicle is available for an employee’s private use that is ascertained in the test period is the number used in the calculation in section ND 30(2). For the calculation in section ND 30(4), the relevant number is the number of days ascertained in the test period multiplied by 4. Quarter or 3 months for test period (3) If FBT is paid quarterly or annually, the test period is a quarter. If FBT is paid on an income year basis, the test period is 3 consecutive months of an income year.

The term starts, as applicable, as follows: (a) if FBT is paid quarterly, on the first day of the test period: (b) if FBT is paid on an annual basis, on the first day of the tax year in which the test period occurs: (c) if FBT is paid on an income year basis, on the first day of the income year in which the test period occurs. Reduction of term (7) The term referred to in subsection (6) is reduced if the number of days of actual private use of the motor vehicle is 20% or higher than the number ascertained in the test period. In this case, the term ends on the last day of the applicable quarter, year, or income year. If the employer chooses to start another test period, the existing term ends immediately before the start of the new term. When test period no longer representative (8) If the Commissioner considers that the result ascertained in the test period does not, or does no longer, fairly represent the actual private use of the motor vehicle by the employee, the Commissioner may notify the employer that the term will end on a particular date. Following notification, the employer must not use that result again.

When vehicle owned less than whole year (5) If an employee has not been part-owner of the motor vehicle for the whole of the income year (or the period referred to in subsection (4)), a reduction under this section is reduced by the proportion of the number of days of the income year or period for which the employee was not a part-owner to the total number of days of that income year or period.
