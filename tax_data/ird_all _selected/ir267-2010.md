IR 267 June 2010 Historic depreciation rates For assets acquired before 1 April 2005 The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 DEPRECIATION INLAND REVENUE Introduction Historic rates Historic rates are used to depreciate assets acquired on or before 31 March 2005. Following is an explanation of how to read the list in Part 1 of this guide. Assets are listed alphabetically and their available rates are shown in four columns. Column 1 shows the diminishing value (DV) rate Column 2 shows the DV rate including the 25% loading, where applicable (see “Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993” for details) Column 3 shows the straight line (SL) rate Column 4 shows the SL rate with the 25% loading, where applicable (see “Assets acquired between16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993” for details) SV means standard value. For specific assets, a standard value has been negotiated with Inland Revenue. Generally, this value gives an average of the original cost of specified assets for the 1993 and earlier income years. The use of a diamond  means that for the 1993 and earlier income years you must choose one of the following to set the asset’s value: • replacement value • annual value • standard value. Part 1 – Depreciation rates before 1993 Some of the figures in the list are printed in bold. These highlighted figures show the method you must use to calculate the depreciation for each asset acquired in the 1993 income year and earlier. For example, on page 4 you will see that you must use the diminishing value (DV) method to calculate depreciation on accounting machines, but for barns you must use the straight line (SL) method. Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and March 1993 Historic depreciation rates with a 25% loading are available for assets that meet certain criteria. This means depreciation on these assets can be calculated at the appropriate historic rate plus a further 25% of that rate. Example To depreciate a beer brewing plant: its historic rate is 15% DV plus loading equals 18.8% DV To qualify for the 25% loading, the assets must either be a new asset or an imported secondhand asset used in New Zealand for the first time, and • acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive), and • must have been used on or before 31 March 1994. Buildings and imported used cars don’t qualify for the 25% loading. The increased depreciation rate will still apply for every income year until the asset is sold or disposed of. Each year, from the 1994 income year onwards, you can choose to use either the SL or the DV method to calculate your depreciation for that year. 3 INLAND REVENUE DEPRECIATION Assets acquired before 1 April 1993 and used in shift work An additional (sometimes referred to as “supplementary”) depreciation allowance is available for certain new or secondhand plant and machinery used for two or three shifts each working day. The asset must be an excluded depreciable asset. Broadly speaking, this means that the asset must be: • used in business in New Zealand, and • purchased before 1 April 1993, and • an asset that qualifies for the 25% interim depreciation loading. These allowances don’t apply to: • plant and machinery used in refining petroleum or smelting aluminium • motor cars • ships, aircraft and hovercraft • plant and machinery for which ordinary depreciation isn’t allowed • plant and machinery for which Inland Revenue hasn’t, in determining a rate of ordinary depreciation, set a differential rate for more than one shift operating for the 1993 year. Differential rates of depreciation for more than one shift were set for the following plant and machinery. • Manufacturing plant and machinery generally, not specifically mentioned and used between 16 and 24 hours daily. • Water-fed evaporating air conditioners used 24 hours a day. The additional allowance is calculated on the number of shifts the asset is in operation for. Two shifts (that is, an average of not less than 16 hours each working day) = an additional 3% Three shifts (that is, normally used 24 hours each working day) = an additional 6% Plant and machinery may qualify for both the supplementary depreciation rate and the 25% loading. To calculate the depreciation rate including both allowances: • first, determine the historic rate • then add the supplementary rate for two or three shifts • finally, add the 25% loading. Converting from DV rates to SL rates To change from the DV method to the SL method (or the other way around) simply pick the corresponding rate in the schedule. Part 2 – 1993 to 2005 asset rates: Industry categories This part contains the rates for assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 1 April 2005, listed by industry type, and the rates for buildings acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 19 May 2005. Part 3 – 1993 to 2005 rates: Asset categories This part contains the rates for assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 1 April 2005, listed by asset type, and the rates for buildings acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and before 19 May 2005. From the 1994 income year For assets acquired before April 1993, you can choose between SL or DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years. To calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years you may either: • use the general rates shown in Parts 2 or 3, or • pool the asset with others listed in the historic rates schedule. 4
