Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 96/6 (TIB Volume Seven, No. 12, April 1996 at page 4 under the heading “Definition of “transitional capital amount”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Consequently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: • The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and • The company was subsequently wound up; and • Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. Taxpayers wish to know the effect of the repeal, and in particular whether or not it results in a reduction of the “available subscribed capital” of a company when the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off losses against paid-up capital. To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be determined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Volume Six, No. 6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994). Legislation Section OB 1 states: 2 “ Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where - j is the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the same class (whenever issued and including the share), not being-...\[Emphasis added.\] k is the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994... l is the number of shares in the specified class ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares in the specified class on issue at the close of 30 June 1994. Application of legislation The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990 M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992 Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid- up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994 Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995 Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l where- j is paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994 $ 500 add back capital reduction $ 500 aggregate capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as defined in the $1,000 Ruling k qualifying share premium assume is 0 l number of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994 1,000 m shares on issue at 1 July 1994 1,000 3 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital amount 1,000 The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. 4
