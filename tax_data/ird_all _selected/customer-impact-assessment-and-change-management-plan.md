Data - 4 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer impact assessment summary - 5 - This impact assessment focuses on S4.1.R2 and some S4.1.R2 Other scope items. This release impacts all customers across our customer segments to some degree but it varies depending on the product and type of change. As expected with the final stageof transformation, the impact for customers overall is reducing. Release 2 focuses on moving Child Support into START impacting our Families customers and upgrading myIR to version 12 that impacts all customer segments to varying degrees. Most customers don’t need to do anything specifically to prepare themselves for changes prior to go live with the exception of s ome of our business partners and employers. However, all our customers need to understand the changes so when they interact with Inland Revenue there are no surprises. For example, our child support customers will need to understand what services they can access digitally should they need them in the future. Customers with myIR accounts will need to be aware of myIR upgrade to version12, in particular our intermediaries will need tailored support and messaging to navigate some of the more significant changes. The Customer Impact •In general, a Mediumimpact is expected across many customer groups, with many Lowpockets and one pocket of Highfor intermediaries V12 upgrade (although we expect this to decrease when the design is finalised). •Most changes should be received positively (or at least neutral) and there are no very high impacts identified so far. However,most customers will need support to understand the changes before and after go live. The level of support and timing will be dependent on the nature of the change, business events requiring a call to action and customer changes that may trigger an interaction with Inland Revenue. For many customers the v12 myIR upgrade may trigger an “initial” reaction that things look a bit different and as they notice navigation changes but this should be negated quickly as they acclimatise, much like similar modern web application upgrades. Our customers who use myIR more frequently (generally business customers and intermediaries) may need additional support to understand there is no change to functionality as they have more engrained pathway habits that will need to change. •Other scope items includes further changes for intermediaries, software and payroll developers, some government agencies, some financial institutions, KiwiSaver providers, employers and some individual customers including amendments to interfaces, upgrades to payroll software, upgrades to SPK2IR, credit card payment changes and bankruptcy process improvements. Employers will need to know about when they can include a negative adjustment on Employment Information file, version 2 changes and timeframe. •Some of the changes only impact smaller subgroups of our customer segments and are dependent on specific circumstances (i.e. bankruptcy, arrears payments) . Many of the other scope changes are about improving Inland Revenues administration processes, therefore customers will not necessarily have visibility of the changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer impact assessment summary - 6 - The more highly impacted customer segments are: Individuals – Families/High Wealth Individuals – child support customers are impacted and require awareness of the changes including better visibility of child support obligations and payments in myIR (including v12 changes) and improved self-management services (i.e. registrations, cancellations administrative reviews etc), the introduction of compulsory employer deductions for paying parents, changes to penalty application and statement of account re-design, ratification of the Hague Convention, streamlined processing of employer deductions and payments and other legislative changes. All customers regardless of their role will be impacted in some way by child support changes, but many existing customers will not need to do anything differently prior to or after go live. They will need reassurance and support to understand the changes so they are aware of and can navigate the changes as and when their circumstances require them. Intermediaries– require awareness of all changes to support their customers. The v12 myIR upgrade impacts intermediaries, in particular tax agents significantly and they will need to be aware of and understand what the changes are – fresh look and feel, changes to navigation (new simplified ‘hub and spoke’ model), how calls to action are presented, how summary views and balances are displayed all without loss of functionality. A new Intermediary centre will replace access to the functions/links currently within the Tax Preparer tab. Here they can access the new Action Centre; a centralised view of alerts for all clients they are subscribed to. These will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The Tax Agent workspace will be retired and instead access to clients will be through a client s earch screen or through the use of the favourites functionality. This is a further change that intermediaries will need understand andadjust to. Business/Employers – employers are impacted by child support compulsory deductions, version 2 payday filing upgrade and negative PAYE adjustments. They need to understand when compulsory employer deductions start, how they will be notified and if they need to adjust their business processes. Many businesses/employers are frequent myIR users and they will be impacted bythe v12 upgrade although this is expected to reduce quickly as customers become used to the new features. Significant Enterprises with complex needs with multiple profiles and accounts will be impacted by the v12 upgrade. Customers will see improvements, have quick access to alerts/balances, have greater visibility of multiple customers and find it easier to access information. Customers wil l need support to understand the changes with minimum disruption to their business and interactions with Inland Revenue. Business Partners – some government agencies and overseas based agencies are impacted by child support changes and other scope items.A new service portal for \[Information redacted\] will enable them to apply for child support and view overpayments. The multi payment option will be available in their myIR account.\[Information redacted\] countries will be impacted by international child support changes but there will be no major changes to existing channels and processes to receive and send files. Some financial institutions are impacted by improvements to interfaces but the impact is estimated to be low. Payroll developers must ensure t heir employment information software is upgraded to version 2, so that employers can continue to file via GWS and file upload. Our business partners will need support to navigate these changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] IN CONFIDENCE Customer Change \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Detailed customer heatmap The heat-map below provides a high level view of the customer impacts based on known START Delivery Stage 4 - Release 2 scope and design as at31 March 2021.

This impacts Individuals – Families/High Wealth Individuals customers who receive and pay child support by digitising the application process, providing greater visibility of their information, earlier payments (in most cases) and legislation changes. Some employersmay also be impacted by making it mandatory to deduct payments from employees who are new or returning liable parents. The level of change for receiving carers and liable parents isLOW – MEDIUM. Customers will be able to apply for child support in myIRwith some information pre-populated for them. Customers will have greater visibility of their account and payment information, along with the ability to self-service more by requesting actions like applying for an administrative review and objections (currently paper based). Legislation changessuch as penalty grace periods and a time bar to limit reassessments and administrative reviews should be viewed favourably. Aligning the definition of income with Working for Families may result in some adjustments to payments paid and received, however, customers won’t experience this until the assessments are calculated late February 2022. Improved payment processingwill also see most receiving carers get payments as soon as possible after the liable parents due date. Automating compulsory employer deductions reduces the time available for a liable parent to discuss privacy concerns with Inland Revenue prior to employer deduction notices being issued to the employer. The level of change for employers is estimated to be LOW – MEDIUM with compulsory employer deductions for all new or returning liable parents (currently only applies to parents in debt) which may increase the number of employees an employer currently deducts for. Automatic notifications to deduct will be included into one electronic notice instead of multiple paper only notices and havea shorter lead- in time for starting deductions. Some employers may perceive this as an additional compliance cost, as they will be required to adjust business processes. The level of change for some Business Partners such as government agencies is estimated to be LOW – MEDIUM. \[Information redacted\] will apply for child support, andview overpayments via a new self service portal, and will have access to a new multi payment option account in myIR; they will need support as they adjust to these. The child support file method of transfer between IRan d \[Information redacted\] changes from iron key to SFTP, and a new keypoint to capture the SWN number will be added on their Employment Information. Advocacy groups will need to be aware of the legislation changes and new services available in myIR. Customer Support Existing and new customers will need an awareness of the changes. Most existing child support customers won’t need to do anything differently at go live but will need to know about myIR changes (including v12), new self service options and payment changesfo r receiving carers. Returning liable parents and employers will need to know prior to go live about compulsory employer deductions. Our business partners will need support to change/amend business processes and adapt to using new digital services. New customers will need a myIR account, making it easier to apply and manage their entitlements/obligations. Our communications will need to include this message before, at and after go live. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support – legislation changes - 12- The Child Support Amendment Bill was passed and received royal assent on 24 March 2021. The Bill contains a range of measures to reduce the scheme’s complexity, improve fairness and increase compliance. The key changes that will be part of Release 2 are: Newly liable parents, or liable parents that are returning to the child support scheme will: Receive a 60 day grace period from penalties to assist in the transition into the scheme Have compulsory employer deductions made from their salary/wages, with some exceptions Be able to have their estimation backdated, if the estimation is received within 28 days of their assessment starting All liable parents will be able to apply for a temporary exemption if they are: suffering from a long term injury or illness in an overseas prison or hospital For the initial late payment penalty: The $5 minimum for the first stage will be repealed; it will always be the standard 2% The second stage will be moved out from 7 days to 28 days after the due date A time bar of 4 years will apply to reassessments and administrative reviews. There will be a change to the definition of income that will include interest/dividend income for salary/wage customers and excl ude losses carried forward. This aligns to the income definition for Working for Families. A new election period for estimations will benefit customers who are re-estimating their income throughout the year. The square up process will reflect income during the estimation periods. Children will not be considered financially independent for child support purposes unless they are at least 16 years of age. Child support for a qualifying child that is still in school will cease on the 31 st of December the year they turn 18. Inland Revenue will have the discretion to adjust a child expenditure calculation when the calculation leads to a perverse outcome. Customers will have 60 days to provide court orders of parentage for the back dating of assessments. Customers will also have 28 days from receiving an assessment to advise Inland Revenue of their existing living circumstances. Commissioner discretion will be introduced to offset customers arrears owing to each other instead of through the administrative review process. The mixed age expenditure table and urgent maintenance order provisions will be repealed from the Child Support Act. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer and product snapshot: child support - 13- 175K QUALIFYING CHILDREN 1.99B TOTAL CHILD SUPPORT DEBT BALANCE 367K PHONE CALLS RECEIVED WITHIN ONE YEAR 319K TOTAL CUSTOMERS – COMPRISED OF 156,000 LIABLE PARENTS AND 163,000 RECEIVING CARERS 517M TOTAL LIABLE PARENT ASSESSMENT DEBT BALANCE 1.4B TOTAL PENATLY BALANCE 9.5K CASES REFERRED TO AUSTRALIA FOR COLLECTION 34K APPLICATIONS RECEIVED WITHIN ONE YEAR 6K CASES BEING COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF AUSTRALIA \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer and product snapshot: child support - 14- Receiving Carer External Agencies Liable Parent Receiving carers are a parent or third party carer of a qualifying child/children that is normally entitled to receive child support from a liable parent. A liable parent is a parent that does not live with their child/children or shares the care of them and supports the child/children financially by paying Child Support. Inland Revenue works with external agencies. \[Information redacted\] Employers Employers support Inland Revenue by deducting child support amounts from their employees salary/wages and passing them on to Inland Revenue. Key Impact: The introduction of compulsory employer deductions. KEY CHANGES The Child Support Amendment Act passed March 2021 has a focus on improving the administration of the scheme including simplified penalty rules, compulsory employer deductions and more certainty for parents via a 4 year time bar for reassessments and administrative reviews. It will be easier for customers to manage their child support as more self-service options available, including registrations, cancellations, administrative review applications and objections. Over time, this will reduce the amount of paper that IR receives from customers and encourage customers to use digital channels. Information sharing and communication with our external agencies will be improved through the use of portals and secure file transfer. The processing of payments and employer deductions will be streamlined and ensure receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible following a due date Most processes will be managed using a mix of cases and work items providing standardised patterns across a range of work types. START will automate processes reducing the amount of manual handling required. Up front validations and pre- population of information will improve data quality and make it easier for people to complete day to day tasks. START will introduce the use of transaction ledgers and a new CSC account to manage financial transactions as money moves from a liable parent through to one or more receiving carers. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for receiving carers - 15- Digital Services Legislation Changes Timing of Payments Fluctuating High Stability L Will be more likely to get payments when they are newly entitled as a result of compulsory employer deductions Sees that the income used for their assessment better reflects their circumstances Will seamlessly receive their payments as soon as possible after the due dates Will no longer need to request an urgent refund to receive their entitlement earlier Meeting customer expectations for digital service offerings Mobile friendly digital services makes it easier for customers to access their child support information M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for liable parents - 16- Legislation Changes Mostly Digital Deduction Methods Salary and WagesSelf employed L Mobile friendly digital options may make managing their child support and interacting with IR easier Meeting their expectations with similar level of functionality as their business accounts May appreciated the option of setting up a schedule of payments based on their chosen frequency No choice of payment channel; will be automatically set up for employer deductions May perceive they are disadvantaged if their losses carried forward will not reduce child support income Sees the income used for their assessment better reflects their circumstances M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes for NZ agencies - 17- Digital Services Information Sharing New Payment Options L Will be able to access information as and when required using the portal; reducing time spent contacting IR for adhoc information \[Information redacted\] will shift from IronKey to SFTP; will reduce manual effort for them Will continue using their current methods to make payments; no direct impact Will have a bulk payment channel (MPO account) in addition to standard payment options; will be able to choose the right payment option for them Existing channels used for information sharing; no channel changes. \[Information redacted\] will have a new field on their EI for the SWN; will need to adapt to include this Will have their own portal; they will need to adapt to using a new tool and know how to access support M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support - key changes overseas agencies - 18- Digital Services Information Sharing New Payment Options L The Hague agreement will allow us to share information with other Hague countries to support the collection of NZ and international child support Will have new myIR options along with existing preferred services; design meets needs of agency Will use new MPO account for their bulk payment: will be minimal impact as they already pay in bulk, this is simply a new channel Hague agencies will have digital payment options; each agency can determine what works best for them No change to what information is able to be shared; will be of no real impact At minimum, all will have myIR services available; onboarding processes to determine what options will suit each agency M \[Information redacted\] \[Information redacted\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – receiving carers - 19- Key ChangesKey Impacts Payments to receiving carers will be issued as soon as possible after the liable parents payment due date. The payment will be issued on the 23 rd at the earliest, instead of being held until the 7 th of the following month. There will be more incentive to shift to authenticated digital services due to more digital services being offered, the removal of some paper forms (including the main parent application form), and V12 design ensuring myIR is mobile friendly. Customers when using myIR will be prompted to provide all required information up front through the use of validations and pre- population of information already held where appropriate. Ratification of the \[Information redacted\] will allow receiving carers to apply against liable parents living in other member countries and request IR approach these countries to collect on their behalf. Newlegislation makes employer deductions compulsory for newly liable or returning liable parents which provides more consistency earlier. Newlegislation introduces a time bar that will restrict reassessments and administrative reviews to a four year period, exceptions will apply. Newlegislation aligns the definition of income with Working for Families Tax Credits. Income for child support will now include interest / dividends and exclude losses bought forward. Receiving carers will be paid their entitlement from the 23 rd of the month (as long as it has been paid by the liable parent) and will no longer have to request an urgent refund of the entitlement to receive it earlier than the 7 th of the following month. More digital services will give customers a new channel for common tasks and provide a clearer view of their account enabling them to take more of a self service approach. The upgrade to V12 has enhanced the usability of myIR for customers on mobile devices. Customers unable to shift to digital channels to lodge applications will continue to have our phone channel available. New validations will decrease the need for multiple points of contact with customers during registration, administrative reviews and other requests, to clarify or request additional information. The Hague Convention gives customers access to a new avenue to enable easier collection of child support and maintenance entitlements from parties in Hague countries. Compulsory deductions helps liable parents meet their obligations from the start of their liability; this will result in receiving carers being more likely to receive their entitlement earlier. The four year time bar will provide receiving carers with more certainty around their entitlement. They will need to understand what exceptions apply if their circumstances necessitate it. Receiving carers may see a change in their entitlement due to the change in income definition. This will not take effect until the 2023 child support year. Some customers may perceive this as unfair or fair depending on the impact to their entitlement. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – receiving carers - 20- Key ChangesKey Impacts Newlegislation aligns the minimum age a child can be deemed financially independent and the qualifying age criteria with Working for Families Tax Credits. Newlegislation repeals the mixed aged expenditure table to allow a fairer reflection of costs based on the actual ages of the children in each household. Newlegislation allows the Commissioner to initiate debt offsetting on behalf of the customer when there is debt owing between the parents. This removes the requirement for the customer to take part in an administrative review process to achieve the same outcome. Receiving carers will be monitored to identify and notify customers that may benefit from estimating their income to more accurately reflect their circumstances. Aligning the qualifying child criteria with Working for Families should make it less confusing for customers as there will be one clear set of criteria for both products. Receiving carers will consider this a fairer calculation of their child support as their entitlement will reflect the costs associated with each child based on their actual age. Receiving carers will no longer have to use the complex administrative review process to have their debt offset against the other parents, saving them considerable time and effort. They may view this positively as it removes a perceived unnecessary step and simplifies the overall process. Receiving carers may appreciate Inland Revenue notifying them of a potential avenue available to them when their circumstances appear to have changed. This may prompt receiving carers to estimate their income to more accurately reflect their circumstances. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – liable parents - 21- Key ChangesKey Impacts Newlegislation makes employer deductions compulsory for newly liable or returning liable parents who receive salary or wages. These deductions will be automatically set up based on their employment situation, with some exceptions. Liable parents who are in debt and receiving salary / wages, will no longer be contacted and instead arrears plans will be automatically set up with their employer, exceptions will apply. Newlegislation introduces a 60 day grace period from penalties for newly liable or returning liable parents. Liable parents who do not have employer deductions, will have the option to request a START generated schedule of recurring payments to meet their monthly obligation based on their chosen payment frequency. Newlegislation introduces a time bar that will limit reassessments and administrative reviews to a four year period, exceptions will apply, e.g. in the case of a court order. Newlegislation aligns the definition of income with Working for Families Tax Credits. Income for child support will now include interest / dividends and exclude losses bought forward. Along with a more mobile friendly design due to version 12, there will also be more digital services offered for liable parents to use. In addition there will be a reduction in paper forms available. Liable parents will no longer have to request Inland Revenue set up deductions from their employer as it will happen automatically. This may mean some liable parents will not have the opportunity to advise of any privacy concerns prior to the deduction being set up. Some liable parents may appreciate that Inland Revenue is making it easy for them to meet their obligations, however some may view it as a sign of mistrust. Some liable parents may perceive it as unfair for Inland Revenue to go straight to their employer rather than discussing options with them first. Newly liable or returning liable parents may perceive the introduction of a grace period as a more compassionate approach to helping them to adapt to meeting their new obligations. Liable parents who choose the schedule option will have the certainty of a clear payment schedule to adhere to that suits their payment frequency. This will also remove frustration as they will no longer be incorrectly penalised when their payments didn’t easily align to the monthly due date. A time bar will provide liable parents with more certainty that their obligations will not change unless particular exception criteria apply. Liable parents may see a change in their entitlement due to the change in income definition. This will not take effect until the 2023 child support year. Some customers may perceive this as unfair or fair depending on the impact to their entitlement. Liable parents will appreciate that they can easily use myIR on any device and have access to new functionality enabling them to take more of a self service approach. Some may be frustrated by the removal of some paper forms. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – liable parents - 22- Key ChangesKey Impacts Ratification of the Hague convention will mean that liable parents living in New Zealand or \[Information redacted\] member countries can be requested to pay or have payment enforced by that country. Newlegislation removes the $5 minimum for the first stage of the initial penalty and instead all customers will be charged 2%. The second stage of the initial penalty will also change from 7 days after the due date to 28 days. Newlegislation expands exemption criteria in relation to paying child support to include those in overseas hospitals and prisons. A new temporary ground has also been introduced for liable parents unable to work due to illness or injury. Liable parents based in Australia will only be asked for income details if \[Information redacted\] is unable to provide them. Liable parents who have a shortfall in their payment obligation will receive a text or web message to advise them of the shortfall and request them to make a manual payment. Liable parents will be proactively notified or contacted to advise they may have deductions that are not appropriate for their situation or that they may benefit from estimating their income. Liable parents living in New Zealand or \[Information redacted\] member countries may perceive the ability for Inland Revenue or the \[Information redacted\] country authority to take enforcement action negatively. Customers may not understand which country to contact in relation to the collection actions. Removing the $5 minimum for the first stage of the initial penalty will have a positive impact for our low income liable parents who will no longer be over penalised. Moving the second stage of the initial penalty will give all liable parents more opportunity to pay before being further penalised. Liable parents may perceive the changes to the exemption criteria positively as it could allow their situation to be taken into account. Less contact from Inland Revenue may mean liable parents in Australia perceive that \[Information redacted\] and Inland Revenue are working more collaboratively. Liable parents may appreciate being notified of an under deduction faster, giving them more of an opportunity to make up the shortfall before the due date. Liable parents may appreciate Inland Revenue notifying them of an option to have their deductions or assessment more accurately reflect their circumstances. Impacted Customer Segments: Families, High Wealth Individuals, Nominated Persons, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – employers - 23- Key ChangesKey Impacts New legislation requiring compulsory employer deductions may increase the number of employees that an employer has to deduct child support for. There may be some employers that previously have not had any employees requiring deductions and will now be required to. Employer deduction notices will be sent electronically if the employer has an active myIR account, paper will be an exception. Employer deduction notices can be redirected to tax agents rather than always going to the employer first. This will follow standard mail redirection patterns meaning they will not be redirected to payroll intermediaries, only to tax agents. Employer deduction notices will be consolidated into one notice that includes all actions that need to be taken e.g. start or stop deductions, instead of these being in separate notices. Employer deductions notices currently request that deductions start 21 days from the issue date, this will be decreased to 14 days. Employers will be monitored earlier to identify those that continually under or over deduct, or do not deduct for 3 paydays in a row, so that contact can be made with them to find out why they are incorrectly deducting. Employers will not be contacted for under-deductions that do not reach the 3 paydays criteria, however the liable parent will be contacted directly so they have the opportunity to address the under-deduction with the employer themselves. Employers may perceive an increase in compliance costs if their processes are affected by a change in volume of deductions or through being required to make deductions for the first time.Some employers may need education to understand why they are required to deduct. Employers will be able to view all correspondence relating to their payroll in myIR instead of receiving employer deduction notices separately via post, this may assist them with their processes as all of their information is in one place. Employers may appreciate employer deduction notices being redirected automatically to their tax agent as they will no longer have to forward this information. Employers may perceive Inland Revenue to be more efficient as they will receive fewer individual notices, with multiple requests being contained in the same letter. They may find it takes less time to action these requests from Inland Revenue. Some employers may need to adapt their internal processes to ensure they are able to commence deductions within 14 days of receiving a notice from Inland Revenue. Employers who do not meet their obligations in relation to deductions will receive more proactive contact from Inland Revenue. Employers need to be aware that liable parents may approach them after receiving a text message from Inland Revenue in relation to an under deduction. Impacted Customer Segments: Significant Enterprises, Small & Medium Enterprises, Micro Business, Not for Profits, Other Government Agencies, Intermediaries Impact Rating: Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Child support impacts – NZ based agencies - 24- Key ChangesKey Impacts Inland Revenue will host an external eServices portal for \[Information redacted\], this portal will enable them to apply for child support and view their overpayments using a report. \[Information redacted\] will use a Multi Payment Option account when making bulk repayments. Files sent to and from \[Information redacted\] to assist with the administration of child support will shift from using IronKey as the transfer method, to using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). \[Information redacted\] will no longer add the SWN number to the customers name field in their Employment information (EI) as a new key point for SWN numbers will be added to EI that will only be visible to \[Information redacted\]. PAX requests for child support customers will shift from being an emailed based process to using the reinstated \[Information redacted\] interface that was built for student loans as part of Release 4. Advocacy Groups will encounter a range of changes as Inland Revenue improves administrative processes and the fairness of the scheme, and introduces a number of digital options for all parties involved in child support. There will continue to be use of secure mail with some of our partner in relation to child support. \[Information redacted\] will initially need education and guidance in using the portal. Although there may be some initial frustration as their people adjust, over time they may appreciate the convenience a self-service channel gives them. \[Information redacted\] will need to understand how the Multi Payment Option works, including what they need to supply on a schedule and how to submit it in myIR. Adopting the SFTP method to transfer benefit information to IR will mean a person from \[Information redacted\] no longer has to physically deliver a USB. This simpler process may be less resource intensive. The new field for the SWN will allow Inland Revenue to include the SWN in employer deduction notices sent to \[Information redacted\]. This will allow \[Information redacted\] to easily match their customers to our notices, which may reduce their time spent on processing notices. \[Information redacted\] will use the interface to manage both child support and student loan PAX requests, removing the need for separate processes for the two products. Advocacy groups that assist customers in understanding their obligations and entitlements will need to be aware of changes that are being made in order to support their clients. Our partner agencies will continue to communicate with Inland Revenue via their existing channels, they will not need to make any changes to their processes.

This allows them to make a single bulk payment to Inland Revenue for all the amounts collected from liable parents. New Zealand ratifying the Hague Convention will enable other member countries to request Inland Revenue to collect on their behalf. They can also be requested to collect on behalf of Inland Revenue. Refund redirects will be used when a payment for a receiving carer is required to be issued to \[Information redacted\]. \[Information redacted\] will be sent annual bulk requests for income for liable parents located in Australia prior to these customers being contacted by Inland Revenue. The sending and receiving of files to and from \[Information redacted\] will continue to be done manually via the secure web portal hosted by \[Information redacted\]. Newlegislation expands exemption criteria to include those in overseas hospitals and prisons. This enables liable parents located in Australia who meet the criteria to be granted an exemption. \[Information redacted\] will need to understand how the Multi Payment Option works, including what they need to supply on a schedule and how to submit it in myIR. Hague countries may initially need education on payment options and how to register for a Multi Payment Option account. They will need to have a myIR account and understand how this is used to submit their payment schedule and the correct way to code payments. There may be some additional assistance needed initially as they become familiar with this process for making bulk payments. New Zealand and Hague countries will have access to a new avenue to enable easier collection of child support and maintenance entitlements from liable parents in their respective countries. Using refund redirects will eliminate the possibility of payments being made to the receiving carer when they should have been made to \[Information redacted\], this will save them the administrative work that results from this incorrect payment being made. There will be a small increase in the number of liable parents included in the request for income that \[Information redacted\] will receive from Inland Revenue. \[Information redacted\] will continue to receive and send files using their existing channels, they will not need to make any updates to their existing processes. \[Information redacted\] will need to be aware of the changes to exemption criteria in order to direct liable parents living in Australia to Inland Revenue. Impacted Customer Segments: Overseas agencies Impact Rating: Negligible – Low - Medium \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer Impacts V12 Individuals Families Business Intermediaries - 26- \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 upgrade to myIR – customer change impacts - 27- START and myIR will upgrade from the current Version 11 (V11) to Version 12 (V12). This impacts all customers who use myIR to varying degrees and is dependent on frequency of use, current confidence levels when interacting with myIR, and if they have complex/specialised needs. At a high level the overall customer experience will improve but as with any application/software upgrade a period of adjustmentmay be required as customers familiarise themselves with the changes. Frequent and complex users will need more support, however this is expected to decrease over time due to the intuitiveness of V12. This upgrade presentsanopportunity tore-engagecustomers with myIR functionality,focusing ontheir needsand benefitsasopposedto product specifications. The level of change across all customer groups ranges from LOW – MEDIUM with the exception of intermediaries, where level of change is assessed asMEDIUM -HIGH. This is expected to decrease over time as customers become familiar with the changes. All myIR customerswill see changes that will improve their customer experience, including: Intermediaries are frequent users of myIR with diverse needs and may be impacted differently. We expect the change impact to decrease once design is finalised taking into account customer feedback.A new Intermediary centre will replace access to the functions/links currently within the Tax Preparer tab. Here they can access the new Action Centre; a centralised view of alertsfor all clients they are subscribed to. These will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The Tax Agent workspace will be retired and instead access to clients will be through a client search screen or through the use of the favourites functi onality. The design team iscurrently considering possible improvements to this function based on customer feedback. The level of change for businesses and employers(frequent and complex myIR users) is expected to be LOW – MEDIUM. The impact is expected to reduce quickly as customers become used to the new features. Customers will see improvements, have quick access to alerts/balances. Customers with complex needs such as significant enterprises will have greater visibility of multipl e customers and find it easier to access information. Customer support –all customers will need support before, during and after the upgrade. Support/education levels will vary dependent on the final design (in response to customer feedback/testing), frequency of use and business events prompting interaction with myIR. myIR FeatureCustomer Change Look and feelModern and streamlined – view key/common information upfront and quick links to regular actions NavigationSimplified and cleaner information hierarchy Calls to action (Alerts)Centralised view of alerts with clearer descriptions, due dates and quick links to actions Account panelsIncludes summary view of balances, next actions and account details (applies to all products) Adaptive by deviceLayout adapts to fit any screen size without loss of functionality \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer snapshot: V12 upgrade - 28- These customer groups have been chosen due to the importance of their distinct usage patterns in myIR.

Type of myIR user KEY CHANGES - myIR Version 12 myIR is a lighter, modern look and feel, and simplifies the information that is presented, making it easier for customers to focus on relevant and important information. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it a seamless experience to use myIR across different devices. A new simplified ‘hub and spoke’ navigation model will allow customers to easily access most of the actions they need to perform, either from their home page or within the “I want to...” menus at the customer or account level. The current account (product) tiles will become account panels, and customers will be able to scroll down through these. These will allow IR to provide the customer with upfront information about the account such as any due now balances or relevant quick links to actions such as “make a payment” or “file a return”. A new Intermediary Centre will provide access to intermediary functions/links within myIR, replacing the current Tax Preparer tab. The Tax Agent Workspace will be retired, and access to clients will be through the client search screen, from the Action Centre, or through use of the new favourites functionality. The new Action Centre will give customers access to all their alerts, rather than some only being visible at the account or period levels. Alerts will be separated by customer, account, and due date; ensuring logons with access to multiple customers will be able to identify easily which alerts relate to which customer. Customers will be able to see when an alert is due, what action is required and easily navigate to this from the alert. They will also have the ability to dismiss alerts. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR - key changes for individuals - 30- Change in look & feel Adaptive by device Easy view of calls to action Annual IndividualSocial Policy May feel that myIR is behaving as expected when accessed on mobile devices Will appreciate the more user friendly view across all devices May appreciate a centralised view of alerts Clear descriptions and easy linking will help them complete required actions May perceive this to be an improvement on how information is presented Information may feel more accessible but may not notice the extent of the change L-M L-M \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR - key changes for businesses - 31- Access / Sign On Adaptive by device Flattened navigation Complex BusinessFrequent Business May be of minimal impact unless working across desktop and laptop/tablet May find the consistent experience makes it easier to complete transactions in myIR at any time May welcome being able to access information/actions with less clicks Key information and regular actions displayed upfront; may require a break from pathway habits Will be easier to distinguish between personal and business accounts Will be easier to distinguish between various customers, profiles and accounts, and can select favourites Calls to action Centralised view and clearly separated by customer, account, and due date.

Information relating to alerts, and the “I want to...” links have been removed from the top of screens, reducing clutter and freeing up space for the new account panels. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen, without a loss of functionality, making it a seamless experience for customers to use myIR across different devices. Navigation within myIR for customers will be simplified and flattened with the new ‘hub and spoke’ model instead of the current ‘hierarchical’ one. The customer’s myIR summary page will be the central “hub” with links that enable them to explore different sections “spokes” for further detail as required. Customerswill no longer click into an account first to see their information, and instead will be able to access most actions/information with only one click from the summary screen. The new account panels that are replacing the account tiles, will now provide a more detailed snapshot view of the product with the number of alerts, any relevant total or due now balances, along with links and other information specific to that account such as detail of their next Working for Families payment, or the result of their end of year income tax assessment. A new ‘alerts’ tab provides customers with a centralised view of all actions that are required for their logon, with descriptions and quick links to perform these. On the summary screen they will also be able to quickly see how many alerts relate to each account. Some social policy customers may find the new look less cluttered and easier on the eye, while others may be annoyed that things have changed making it harder for them to find what they are looking for. Annual customers who have not logged in to myIR in a while may not realise the extent of the changes. Customers who use mobile technology predominantly will appreciate that they will have a more user friendly view. Customers who have not logged in to myIR for a period of time may be pleasantly surprised that myIR now behaves the way they would expect it to when accessed on a tablet or mobile. Regular users of myIR may find the new navigation initially frustrating as they re-learn where information now lives. Others may feel this removes some of the frustration they had trying to find information in the old version. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks as more information will be accessible from the summary screen. Once customers are familiar with the new account panels they will appreciate the ability to see key information, balances, and links upfront. This may reduce the time it takes for them to find what they are looking for as well as make it easier for them to navigate to commonly used tasks for that account. Customers may find the new alerts tab provides a simpler and faster way of seeing any actions they need to take as well being able to quickly access that action. This may be of more benefit to those customers whose interaction with myIR is generally in response to an action required of them. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – frequent business - 34- Impacted Customer Segments: Micro, Not for Profit, Small-Medium Enterprises, Nominated persons Impact Rating: Low - Medium Key ChangesKey Impacts Version 12 provides a cleaner view of myIR, by simplifying what information is visible/accessible within screens. Information relating to alerts, and the “I want to...” links have been removed from the top of screens, reducing clutter and freeing up space for the new account panels. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen, including mobiles, without a loss of functionality. The flatter navigation is simpler and more information will be pulled up to the summary screen. Customers will no longer click into an account first to see their information, and instead most actions will require only one click from the summary screen to access. The new account panels, replacing the account tiles on the summary page, will now provide more of a snapshot view of the product. Instead of clicking into the account, the panel will show the number of alerts, any relevant key information including total/due now balances, and links to commonly accessed actions/information. Customers will continue to see the number of alerts per customer/account, but the new Alerts tab will provide a centralised view of all alerts for the customer. Each alert will now also show a description of the action required, a quick link to take this action, and the due date. Alerts will be sorted by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered and dismissed. Dismissed alerts will still be accessible within the Action Centre and can be undismissed if required. Micro business customers may find the new look less cluttered and easier on the eye, while others may be annoyed that things have changed making it harder for them to find what they are looking for. Customers will appreciate myIR being device responsive, and this may improve the experience they have of accessing myIR when and where suits them. Customers may find the change in navigation style initially frustrating as they will have formed pathway habits in myIR through frequent use, and will need to break these to learn new ones. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks, as more information and links will be accessible from the customer level. Most customers will appreciate the ability to see account relevant information, balances, and links including the “I want to...” menu, within the new account panels as this will make it easier for them to navigate to commonly used tasks for that account. The increased visibility of account balances may cause some concern from customers if they are unsure what these relate to and/or are not expecting to see amounts due. The new Action Centre and alerts panels will particularly suit those customers who are generally reactive to requests for action from Inland Revenue, such as “file a return”. Customers will value the categorisation by due date as this will enable them to quickly assess what actions they should prioritise, and then dismiss those already dealt with or considered irrelevant. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – complex - 35- Impacted Customer Segments: Small – Medium Enterprises with complex business structures, Significant Enterprises Impact Rating: Low - Medium Key ChangesKey Impacts Version 12 provides a cleaner view of myIR, by simplifying what information is visible/accessible within screens as we as a new “hub and spoke” navigational pattern with more information pulled up to the summary screen. Information relating to alerts, and the “I want to...” links have been removed from the top of screens, reducing clutter and freeing up space for the new account panels. Logons with access to multiple customers will be required to select the customer they wish to access, before moving to the summary view for this customer. A list of all customers they can access will be visible and they will be able to filter these using the name or IRD Number of the customer. They will also be able to select up to 50 customers or accounts as “favourites” that will show up under a new favourites tab on the landing page for easy access to those they work in regularly. Account panels, and sub-panels, will replace the v11 account tiles. Customers will no longer click into an account, and instead the panels will provide them with a snapshot view of information relevant to the account along with links to commonly accessed actions/information. The new Action Centre will provide a centralised view of all alerts associated to the customers and accounts that the logon has access to. These will be organised by customer, account, and due date, and can be filtered. The alert panels in the action centre will have a description of the action required, along with a quick access link to complete this action. Customers may find the change in navigation style initially frustrating as they will have formed pathway habits in myIR through frequent use, and will need to break these to learn new ones. It is expected that once they are familiar they will find it easier to navigate the system, with less clicks, as more information and links will be accessible from the customer level. This may make it easier for customers to ensure they have accessed the customer account they intend to work in, but those customers who could previously “fast path” to a specific account for a customer may be frustrated at this extra step. Those customers who regularly access a subset of their customers/accounts may appreciate being able to select favourites as a way to reduce the time it takes to find and access these. Some customers will appreciate having key information and links being available on the summary screen. Others may be concerned at the amount or type of information that, though previously accessible, is now more visible to those in their organisation with myIR access. As the Action Centre can be accessed from the landing page as well as the customer summary screens, this will provide these customers with another avenue to quickly access a customer or account where action is required. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V12 myIR impacts – intermediaries - 36- Impacted Customer Segments: Tax Agent, Bookkeeper, Payroll Intermediary, Tax Pool Intermediary Impact Rating: Medium - High Key ChangesKey Impacts A new Intermediary Centre will replace access to the functions/links that currently sit in the v11 tax preparer tab, excluding the “manage workspace” link as the Tax Agent Workspace is being retired. Access to the Intermediary Centre is via a link on the landing page, and will be available to all logons of a registered tax intermediary. When an Intermediary logs in to myIR they will be presented with a client search screen. This will allow them to find clients by IRD number or customer identifier. Once the intermediary searches, their access will be evaluated, and if they are linked to the customer they will be granted access and will be navigated to the customer's account. Intermediaries will be able to select up to 50 clients and accounts to be included in a “favourites” tab on their landing page, for quick access to those they work on regularly. Intermediaries will be able to access the new Action Centre from the Intermediary Centre and this will provide them with a centralised view of alerts for all clients of the agency that the web logon has subscribed to, up to a maximum limit. The alerts will be organised by customer, account, and due date, and will be able to be filtered. Alerts for non-subscribed clients will still be accessible from the client’s account. There are a number of changes to the look/feel of myIR including the navigation within myIR and the way information is presented. The account tiles in v11 are being replaced by account panels, and instead of clicking in to these, they will provide an upfront view of key information along with quick links to commonly accessed actions/information. Intermediaries will need to understand what the new Intermediary centre provides them in comparison to the functionality that was designed for them in v11. Support will be required to assist them in learning new pathways in myIR, and understanding any benefits of the new system, as well as how IR is responding to any perceived degradation in functionality. Intermediaries may be frustrated that they require their client’s IRD number or customer identifier to be able to use the ‘search’ screen, as they may store this in a separate system. Work is underway to consider possible improvements to this function. Although favourites will not be an exact replacement for the workspace functionality in v11, it will provide Intermediaries with an alternative to the client search function for easily viewing their priority clients. Some intermediaries may need to look at changes to their current business processes to adapt to the change. Intermediaries will appreciate that the new Action Centre will ensure they areable to identify easily which alerts relate to which customer and when these are due. Further education around myIR functionality will support those Intermediaries who may feel that the maximum limit on client subscriptions will remove their ability to quickly identify actions required across their client list. Some Intermediaries may welcome the changes and find they present a simplified view of a customer’s account, and improves their ability to navigate around myIR with fewer clicks. Others may find it initially difficult to adjust, where they have become familiar with the current layout and need to learn new pathways. There may also be some concern from Intermediaries at the level of information now more visible to their clients as they may receive increased contact from these clients seeking reassurance. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer Impacts Other Scope Individuals Business Intermediaries Business Partners - 37- \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other – customer change impacts - 38- There are further scope items that will be implemented either leading up to or close to Release 2 go-live. The changes are varied and impact a range of customer groups such as individuals, business, intermediaries and business partners but overall the changes have a Lowimpact and one pocket of Mediumfor KiwiSaver providers and members impacted by the default provider review. Some of the changes only impact smaller subgroups of our customer segments, depending on specific circumstances. Many these are improving Inland Revenues administration processes, therefore customers will not necessarily have visibility of the changes. Tax on Income: Negative PAYE adjustments -employers, software developers and intermediaries managing payroll for clients will need to understand when they can make a negative adjustment for prior periods in an Employment Information file – it only applies to gross and PAYE fields (not to social policy adjustments). Bankruptcy IRD number allocation –Individual customers (including sole traders) going through the bankruptcy process won’t be allocated a new IRD number, reducing confusion and removing the need for them to change their number with other organisations. Other business customers will not need to update their files for their employees or clients who are bankrupted. Credit card convenience fee -student loan borrowers and child support customers based overseas who use a credit card for payment transactions will now be charged the convenience fee charge (1.42%), along with all other customers and will need to be aware this and what other payment options are available. SPK2IR payment options -enhancements to improve the SPK2IR self service payment options for customers in arrears by allowing credit card payments, removing the need to engage with Inland Revenue staff. Miscellaneous payment types –management of a number of miscellaneous payment types (i.e. conscience money, excess cash etc) will be moved into START, including reparations that are awarded to Inland Revenue and collected by \[Information redacted\]. There are no direct impact to customers. Barcode solution (unauthenticated) –will be updated to match barcodes issued natively in START, ensuring \[Information redacted\] only have to read one standard type and may improve payment processing for them. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other – customer change impacts - 39- Digital Services: Version 2 Employment Information –payroll software developers, intermediaries and employers who have not moved to version 2 of Employment Information will need to do so, be aware of the implications if they continue to use version 1 and understand how to manage amendments by using the same EI version as originally filed. \[Information redacted\] interface –Inland Revenue will start sending passport information to \[Information redacted\] (e.g. for maintaining person of interest list). There should be minimal impact to \[Information redacted\] as there is not a functional change to the interface. \[Information redacted\] interface (unauthenticated credit card payment) -customers who use the unauthenticated credit card payment option may notice a minor change in look and feel due to a new provider – \[Information redacted\]. However, the impact to \[Information redacted\] should be minimal as there is no change to functionality and this is a common banking function they provide. \[Information redacted\] interface –\[Information redacted\] will send Inland Revenue bank files intraday in addition to the existing end of day file. This should have minimal impact for \[Information redacted\] but they may need to support any queries triggered by the file content. KiwiSaver: KS Default Provider –the KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements. Default KiwiSaver providers and members will need to be aware of the update. The outcomes of the review are expected to be known by end of May and the bulk of any change activity will likely occur in December 2021. The impact has been assessed as Mediumfor providers and members but this will be clearer when review outcomes are known. Data: myIR correspondence –there are some changes to how customers view correspondence in myIR and some will have to use a search function to view migrated EDSR content as it will not appear in their inbox. For most customers this shouldn’t be a significant impact as they would expect to only see recently issued correspondence in their inbox. This will have a greater impact on child support customers as all correspondence up to cutover will be migrated content. Customer Support Customers will need to be aware of the changes prior to and after go live via our usual engagement channels and methods particularly intermediaries and employers about version 2 payday filing and negative adjustments. Some customers will need to make changes to their systems and business processes and they will continue to be supported by the BT Account Management and External Relationships teams. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope Employers will be able to use negative values in the prior period adjustment field when submitting their Employment Information (EI) files as long as validations are met. Customers who go through bankruptcy will retain the same IRD number and no longer be required to get a new number. This means they will no longer have to update this information with employers, banks and other agencies. There will be some changes to the look/feel of unauthenticated credit card payments with \[Information redacted\] being the new provider for this service. There will also be no exceptions for the convenience fee charged on credit card payments, regardless of channel.

There is no change to the requirements for managing their tax and social policy accounts separately where pre and post adjudication applies, this will just be managed under the same IRD number. The unauthenticated credit card payment option will be updated as part of a change in provider. \[Information redacted\] will provide the platform for this service based on Inland Revenue specifications. Inland Revenue will start passing on the convenience fee charge (1.42%) for credit and debit card transactions to all customers. Previously overseas based borrowers paying student loans and overseas child support customers were not charged this fee. There will be updates to SPK2IR to improve self service payment options for customers to include the ability to make arrears (ARR) payments by credit card. Customers will see some differences in myIR in relation to how they view correspondence, some of this is due to the V12 design, however there will also be change based on how EDSR content is migrated to START. The key difference is that migrated correspondence (even if it is recently issued) will not appear in the customer’s inbox and native START content will; instead they will need to use a search function to view the migrated EDSR content. The KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements to regularly do so. Customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt. This will reduce confusion around which number applies to which period of their tax accounts and remove the need for them to contact employers, banks and other agencies to update their details with a new number. Customers may notice a new look / feel to the unauthenticated credit card payment option, however as the functionality will be the same, this should be of minimal impact. Customers who are aware of and currently benefiting from Inland Revenue covering the credit and debit card convenience fee will need to know that it will no longer continue. They may need to understand what other payment options are available to them so they can determine if they still wish to use this payment channel. Customers may notice some small enhancements to SPK2IR that allows them to use a self-service option rather than needing to be connected to a person in relation to arrears payments. Customers may wonder why some information is accessed from their inbox in myIR and other content can only be accessed using the search function. For most customers this won’t be of significant impact as they would expect only recently issued correspondence to be in their inbox. However this will impact those customers with child support obligations / entitlements the most as all correspondence up until cutover for this release will be migrated content and affected by this. KiwiSaver members may need to make a choice in relation to their KiwiSaver provider if they were allocated to a provider who is removed from the default list. They will need guidance from their current provider and education from Inland Revenue to support this. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts - business Impacted Customer Segments: Micro, Small-Medium Enterprises, Significant Enterprises, Not for Profits Impact Rating: Negligible - Low - 45- Key ChangesKey Impacts Customers (including Sole Traders) who go through bankruptcy processes will no longer be allocated a new IRD number. There is no change to the requirements for managing their tax and social policy accounts separately where pre and post adjudication applies, this will just be managed under the same IRD number. Those employers who have not already done so will be transitioning to version 2 of the Employment Information (EI) file.This relates to those using file upload in myIR or those using a software package that has yet to update to version 2. This change will affect the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions. Employers can, in some cases, enter a negative value in an Employment Information (EI) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period.They can already make adjustments for prior periods currently as long as the value is positive.This change enables a negative value in the relevant gross and PAYE adjustment columns as long as it will not reduce the overall gross or PAYE for the line item below 0. Additional validations will prevent negative adjustments entirely if there are impacts on social policy as part of the adjustment. There will be updates to SPK2IR to improve payment options for customers to include the ability to make arrears payments by credit card. Customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt.This will reduce confusion around which number applies to which period of their tax accounts and remove the need for them to contact employers, banks and other agencies to update their details. Customers who are employers or who use an IRD number from their customers/clients as part of their business activity will no longer need to update files with a second number if their employee or customer/client has been made bankrupt.This may reduce some administrative cost for them. Employers may find the way version 2 captures information easier to work with as it allows all information relating to an employee to be captured on one line item rather than multiple. They will need to understand how to manage amendments and that they must amend information using the same EI version as originally filed.This may cause some confusion initially but this will reduce over time as version 2 becomes the dominant file type used. Employers will need to be aware that the prior period adjustment fields on the EI can now accept negative values if validations are met.They will need to understand when this is an option, and when a prior period will need to be amended instead. Customers may notice some small enhancements to SPK2IR that allows them to use a self-service option rather than needing to be connected to a person in relation to arrears payments. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts - intermediaries Impacted Customer Segments: Tax Agents, Bookkeepers, Payroll Intermediaries Impact Rating: Negligible - Low - 46- Key ChangesKey Impacts Customers who go through bankruptcy processes will no longer be allocated a new IRD number.

This change will affect the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions. Intermediaries completing payroll for their clients can, in some cases, enter a negative value in an Employment Information (EI) file when accounting for adjustments for a prior period.They can already make adjustments for prior periods in a current EI, this change enables a negative value in the relevant gross and PAYE adjustment columns as long as it will not reduce the overall gross or PAYE for the line item below 0. Additional validations will prevent negative adjustments entirely if there are impacts on social policy as part of the adjustment. There will be a consistent current tax year plus four years prior approach taken to what historical correspondence will be migrated to START from EDSR. This means START will no longer call EDSR to access older correspondence (up to 8 years) and only records from current year plus four can be viewed in myIR. Based on how the data is migrated, it can only be viewed via a search function. Intermediaries will need to be aware that customers will no longer have to update records with a new IRD number when made bankrupt.They will need to know how accounts will behave in myIR and will no longer need to have more than one IRD number held in client lists for the same customer for this reason. Intermediaries may find the way version 2 captures information easier to work with as it allows all information relating to an employee to be captured on one line item rather than multiple. They will need to understand how to manage amendments and that they must amend information using the same EI version as originally filed.This may cause some confusion initially but this will reduce over time as version 2 becomes the dominant file type used. Intermediaries will need to be aware that the prior period adjustment fields on the EI can now accept negative values if validations are met.They will need to understand when this is an option, and when a prior period will need to be amended instead. Intermediaries who regularly review correspondence in myIR will need to be aware of what historical information will be available to view and how to locate it. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Other scope impacts – business partners Impacted Customer Segments: Software Developers, Service Providers/Financial Institutions, KiwiSaver Providers, Other Gov’t Agencies Impact Rating: Negligible – Low - Medium - 47- Key ChangesKey Impacts Software Developers will need to complete the transition to Version 2 of the Employment Information (EI) file if they have not already done so. This change affects the fields on the file with the addition of new fields in V2 changing how they complete information relating to prior period adjustments, employee share scheme (ESS) information and when accounting for student loan SLCIR and SLBOR deductions.This includes support for amendments as their clients may need to amend files that are both version 1 and version 2. The unauthenticated barcode generator will be updated to match the barcodes issued natively in START ensuring \[Information redacted\] will only be presented with one standard type of barcode by customers. \[Information redacted\] will be responsible for the unauthenticated credit card payment platform our customers access from the Inland Revenue website. Inland Revenue will commence sending passport information (when provided by the customer) as part of the data we send to \[Information redacted\] through the \[Information redacted\] interface (e.g. for maintaining the person of interest list). \[Information redacted\] will begin sending Inland Revenue bank files intraday in addition to the existing end of day file. Management of a number of miscellaneous payment types will be moved into START, including reparations that are awarded to Inland Revenue and collected by the \[Information redacted\]. The KiwiSaver default provider list will be updated as per legislative requirements to regularly do so. Most Software Developers will deliver this change prior to release 2, however for those who do not, they will need to manage their capacity to complete all development that Inland Revenue is requiring of them; this may be challenging as version 2 is not the sole focus of change (e.g. other annual changes, e-file decommission are also on their runway). They will also need to support their own customer base with this change including any communications around timing and implications if they need to push out delivery dates. \[Information redacted\] will no longer need to use two different systems to read Inland Revenue issued barcodes. Having one standard barcode type will remove this requirement and may improve ease of payment processing for them. \[Information redacted\] will support the unauthenticated payment platform; however, as this is a common banking function for them it should be of minimal impact. There should be minimal impact to \[Information redacted\] as there will be no functional change to the \[Information redacted\] interface and they already send Inland Revenue matched passport information. \[Information redacted\] may need to support any queries triggered by intraday file content, however the introduction of intraday files is not new to \[Information redacted\] and should be of minimal impact to them, the impact is more for Inland Revenue. Although there will be changes to how Inland Revenue manages reparations money internally in START, there is no direct impact to the \[Information redacted\] in terms of how they pass on payments. KiwiSaver Providers will need to be aware of the update, however this is an expected change that has happened before. The degree of impact may vary if any providers are removed or added. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] We will continue to utilise all of our channels and methods to tailor our reach and engagement with customers Website, myIR and online services Content on IR website, news items, campaign pages, promotional and instructional videos, banner messaging and new functionality, services and B2B channels.
