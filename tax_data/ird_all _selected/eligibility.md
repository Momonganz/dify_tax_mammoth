Ko wai ka taea te utu, te whiwhi rānei i te Takuhe Tiaki Tamariki? Who can pay or receive child support?
========================================================================================================

Being eligible for child support depends on:

*   whether your children qualify for child support
*   whether the other [parent](/api/glossary/item?id={4B4E9057-5321-4C5B-9F4E-3D13C76FAEE5})
    , or both parents if applying as a [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
    , can be made liable
*   the amount of care you provide.

If you and your child are living in Australia, you should apply for child support through Services Australia.

[Child support in New Zealand and Australia](/child-support/overseas/australia)

If the parent of the child you want to make liable for child support is not a NZ citizen but lives in a [2007 Child Support Convention](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
 country, you can apply to us for a child support formula assessment.

Child support definitions of 'child', 'liable parent', and 'ongoing daily care of a child'

Does child support apply to you?

Choose a definition Does your child qualify for child support? Are you a liable parent? What about your level of daily care for your child?

To qualify for child support, the child must:

*   be under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age and enrolled at and attending a registered school in New Zealand or an overseas school. If a child is 18 and still enrolled at and attending a school, then child support ends on 31 of December of the year they turn 18
*   not be married, in a de facto relationship or civil union
*   be financially dependent, that is under the age of 16 or aged 16 and not working more than 30 hours a week on average or receiving a benefit or student allowance
*   be a New Zealand citizen or [ordinarily resident](/api/glossary/item?id={DC1E35F3-44F9-4F6C-8EE4-5F02E75DA5B4})
     in New Zealand

If you're unsure whether your children are New Zealand citizens, you can check this with the New Zealand Government.

[Check if you are a citizen (New Zealand Government)](https://www.govt.nz/browse/passports-citizenship-and-identity/nz-citizenship/proof-of-citizenship/check-if-you-are-a-citizen/)
 If your children often travel overseas, you can see whether they are spending most of their time in New Zealand by checking their tax residency status. If they are [New Zealand tax residents](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
, they are ordinarily resident in New Zealand.

Sometimes for child support, we need to decide whether or not a person will be or will continue to be ordinarily resident. In these cases we may consider the person's intentions to live or not live in New Zealand.

[Tax residency status for individuals](https://www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

In order to be a liable parent for child support, the person must either:

*   be the birth or legally adoptive parent of the child
*   have been married to the other parent when the child was conceived or born
*   have acknowledged before a court, or in writing, that they are a parent of the child
*   have been declared a legal step-parent by the Family Court
*   have had a court make a paternity order in respect of the child

They must also be either:

*   a New Zealand citizen
*   ordinarily resident in New Zealand
*   ordinarily resident in Australia,
*   ordinarily resident in Australia, or in a [2007 Child Support Convention country](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
    , as we have agreements for child support.

The [formula assessment](/api/glossary/item?id={685B102C-017F-44EE-BB14-BF34C28EE726})
 for child support recognises that a parent provides for their child if they give ongoing daily care for at least 28% of the time. This is called [recognised care](/api/glossary/item?id={111F9E51-131C-472D-8F36-8E0465CD1C82})
.

A [parent](/api/glossary/item?id={4B4E9057-5321-4C5B-9F4E-3D13C76FAEE5})
 or [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 will not receive child support unless they provide ongoing daily care for at least 35% of the time.
