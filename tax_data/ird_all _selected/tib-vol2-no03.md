Introduction This item has been prepared in light of the recent High Court decision in State Insurance Office v CIR. It raises questions on the assessability of share exchanges in relation to the Department’s policy on the taxation of profits from selling shares by insurance companies. Issues There were three main issues in the case for consideration by Judge Heron, they were; (1) Whether pursuant to section 65(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976 State’s assessable in- come included profits from any business be- ing such profits or gains from share exchanges, including those where a cash element was involved. (2) If the gains are income, whether there has been a realisation of the gain by reason of the share exchanges. (3) If the gains are taxable, whether the shares are trading stock. Decision First Issue Judge Heron concluded that whilst there is a nexus between the income generated by the shares and the operation of State’s business, there is no nexus between the realisations which occurred and the method of operation of the business. He considered the realisations which did take place to be “sporadic isolated transac- tions”. He said that while sale of the shares had some connection with the business because the income fell into the cash flow there was no nexus between those sales and the method of operation of the business. His final statement on the issue says that the gains were made without the intention of meet- ing the needs of the “insurance” business or the desire to realise or vary any investment, and to that extent they were at least not motivated by business considerations. He sees State as an unusual case with quite unique considerations. Second Issue Judge Heron found that because section 65(2)(a) speaks of gains “derived”, it must be construed as meaning realised. Third Issue Judge Heron cited the case of Anson v Commis- sioner of Taxes \[1922\] NZLR 330, where it was held that the test is “whether an asset has been procured for the purpose of being sold at a profit”. He found that the dominant purpose of State’s acquisition of the shares was to hold, not sell. Comment Judge Heron’s decision turns to a large degree on his findings of fact, such as the finding that State is unique in the way it operates its busi- ness. Ultimately, the matter has been decided on the basis of the unique capital structure and methods of business adopted by State. He also points to the distinctions between State’s case and the case of other insurance companies. It therefore does not change the Department’s policy in relation to the taxation of profits from the sale of shares by insurance companies. 3 CASINO CONTROL ACT 1990 Amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary This item explains the amendments contained in the Casino Control Act 1990 which amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treatment for gaming conducted within a casino. Introduction The Casino Control Act 1990 provides for the licensing, supervision, and control of casinos. It also contains amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treat- ment of gaming activities conducted within a casino. This treatment reflects the recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry into the Establish- ment of Casinos in NZ in that GST will apply to the casino’s “win”. The treatment is consistent with that afforded to other forms of gaming such as games of chance and lotteries conducted in terms of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. These amendments to the GST Act will have no application until casinos become operational and commence to make supplies in respect of their gaming activities. The Casino Control Act comes into force on the 2nd of August 1990. GST Amendments Section 5 of the GST Act, which deals with the meaning of supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems AIRPORT OPERATORS Depreciation on Concrete Pavements Effective from 1 April 1988, the taxation treatment of concrete pavements is as follows: 1. Depreciation will be allowed on concrete airport pavements at the rate of 4 percent cost price. 2. In the case of demolition , prior to the end of the pavements useful life, the unallocated cost be allowed as an additional allowance in the year of demolition. The unallocated cost must be reduced to the extent runways, taxi ways, apron areas, airstrips and other pavement areas are not demolished. 3. No special treatment is available for expendi- ture incurred on the pavements, other than what is permitted in accordance with Section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Note: This treatment applies only to concrete pavements and not to asphalt pavements. a supply of services to occur where a person pays money to purchase a chip or otherwise to participate in a game played or conducted in a casino. This deemed supply is made by the holder of the casino licence. Section 9 of the GST Act, which sets out the time of supply rules, is amended by the insertion of a new time of supply rule in respect of the deemed supply described above. The new time of sup- ply rule deems the supply to occur at the time a “casino count” occurs. A “casino count” is a defined term and means a count of money or money’s worth paid for the right to participate in gaming. Such counts will occur on a regular basis in terms of the conditions that will be attached to a casino licence. Section 10 of the GST Act, which determines the value of a supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems the value of the supply to be the amount of money paid by persons to purchase chips or otherwise to participate in games less the amount of money paid out in winnings by the casino in respect of those games. The amount paid to participate in a game is GST inclusive. These amendments only provide the GST treat- ment for gaming activities played or conducted within a casino. In respect of other goods and services supplied by a casino the normal GST provisions of the GST Act will apply. Reference: LA GST 1990Leg. Vol. 4 TRANSIT NEW ZEALAND ACT 1989 Consequential Amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary This item explains the consequential amendments to the GST Act 1985 contained in the Transit New Zealand Act 1989. Introduction The Transit New Zealand Act 1989 was enacted to: (a) Constitute Transit New Zealand as a central land transport authority; and (b) Provide the framework for the planning, funding, and development of New Zealand’s land trans- port system. It also provided the mechanism for the dissolution of the National Roads Board, the National Roads Fund, and the Urban Transport Council. This Act came into force on 1 October 1989. This reform of the land transport system has a bear- ing on a number of provisions in the GST Act 1985. Accordingly, the GST Act 1985 was consequentially amended via the Fourth Schedule to the Transit New Zealand Act 1989 to reflect these changes. GST Amendments The Transit New Zealand Act provides for the estab- lishment within the Crown Bank Account for a fund to be known as the Land Transport Fund to which the following revenue will be credited: (a) A portion of all excise duty collected in respect of motor spirits; (b) All fees and charges collected under the Road User Charges Act 1977; (c) All fees and charges collected under Part I of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986; and (d) Other amounts as specified by section 8 of the Transit New Zealand Act. Unlike the National Roads Fund, the Land Transport Fund will not be deemed to be supplying goods and services in respect of the receipt of some of these payments and therefore will not be registered for GST purposes. The revenue accumulated in this fund will be appropriated to Transit New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport to meet budgeted costs in respect of certain output programs. Both Transit New Zealand and the Ministry of Transport are registered for GST purposes and will be required to account for GST on this payment from the Crown. A number of consequential changes have been made to the GST Act 1985 following the dissolution of the National Roads Fund. Those changes are: Section 5(6A): The provision has been amended to explicitly provide that the taxable activity is carried on by the person who collects those fees. For ex- ample, if NZ Post collects these fees it will be required to account for the GST on the supply and issue tax invoices as it is deemed to be carrying on the taxable activity. Previously, the GST Act did not indicate the supplier of those services. The reason for not explic- itly identifying the collector of these fees in the legislation, was to recognise that the person collect- ing these fees may change from time to time. Section 5(6B): Road user charges are deemed to be consideration for a supply of services in course or furtherance of a taxable activity by the person who collects those fees. Section 5(13A): A refund of excise duty paid out of the Land Transport Fund to a registered person, where the excise duty paid by the registered person was incurred for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, is deemed to be consideration for a supply of services in the course of that registered person’s taxable activity. This provision only applies in respect of excise duty on motor spirits. Section 11(3): This section is no longer required and has been repealed. Dissolution of the National Roads Board and the Urban Transport Council The Transit New Zealand Act 1989 also provides for all the real and personal property belonging to or vested in these two bodies to vest in Transit New Zealand. The vesting of these goods in Transit New Zealand is a taxable supply made in the course of the termination of the taxable activities carried on by the National Roads Board and Urban Transport Council. However, as no consideration is being paid for the supply, there are no GST implications in regard to accounting for output tax and input tax on this supply. Reference: LA GST-1989-Leg. Vol. 5 GST TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE BY EMPLOYEES IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYER’S BUSINESS Introduction There are many circumstances where employ- ees will incur expenditure in the course of their employment. Employers may wish to reim- burse employees for such expenditure. Employ- ers may pay for such expenditure by employees in various ways, such as the payment of allow- ances or the reimbursement of actual expendi- ture. As registered persons, employers will want to claim input tax credits arising from such expenditure. The purpose of this item is to set out the circumstances under which this may be done. Background For a registered person to be able to claim an input tax credit under section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) the supply to which the particular input tax credit relates must have been made to the particular person claim- ing the input tax credit. The United Kingdom VAT tribunal decisions have determined that a supply is only made to a person if the person is in a contractual relationship with the supplier. This approach may limit the circumstances in which employers can claim input tax credits for expenditure incurred by employees. Thus, where employees contract in their own right to receive supplies, the tax paid on the supplies cannot be claimed as input tax credits by employers, not- withstanding that the expenditure may have been in the course of the employer’s business and that the employers may have reimbursed the employees for actual expenditure. It is the Department’s view that the application of the decided UK cases in this context is limited. It was always the intention of the legislation and the practice of the Department to allow employ- ers, who are registered persons, to be able to claim input tax credits for expenditure initially incurred by employees and reimbursed by em- ployers where the expenditure was incurred in the course of the employer’s business. Ruling Reimbursement of Actual Expenditure Where expenditure is incurred by an employee in the course of the employer’s business, and the actual expenditure is reimbursed by the employer, the em- ployer is entitled to claim an input tax credit. Whether or not the expenditure is incurred by the employee in the course of the employer’s business is a question of fact. Examples are the reimbursement of transport costs (taxi fares) and accommodation costs (hotels). It is also confirmed that expenditure incurred on residential telephone rentals of an employee may be expenditure in the course of the employer’s business if the private phone is used for business purposes. Further, subscriptions to professional associations- the New Zealand Law Society or the New Zealand Society of Accountants for example, may be expendi- ture in the course of the employer’s business. In such situations employers will be able to claim input tax credits for such expenditure, where it is shown that the membership to the society relates to the employ- ment of the particular employee. Payment of Allowances Where actual expenditure is not reimbursed and/or an allowance is paid by the employer to the em- ployee, an input tax credit will not be allowed as: no GST is incurred by the employer if there is no reimbursement; or there is insufficient connection between the pay- ment made by the employer and the expendi- ture incurred by the employee if reimburse- ment is by way of allowance. Tax Invoices Where employers seek to claim input tax credits for expenditure incurred by employees in the course of the employer’s business, the invoicing requirements of section 24 must be met. Employers must be in receipt of valid tax invoices before input credits will be allowed. Reference: H.O. GST A.5.1 6 USE OF CREDIT CARD SALES VOUCHERS AS TAX INVOICES FOR GST A credit card sales voucher is acceptable as a tax invoice only when the requirements of section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (1985) (the Act) are complied with. Some credit card companies have requested approval of their sales vouchers as tax invoices. Further, the credit card companies have re- quested, and been granted, a dispensation un- der section 24(6) of the Act. This dispensation precludes the need for the address of the recipi- ent to be shown on invoices where the supply exceeds $100 in value ($200 from 1 October 1990). The following credit cards have had Head Office approval for use of their vouchers as tax invoices and have been granted dispensation relating to the recipient’s address on a full tax invoice: Diners Club American Express BNZ Visa National Bank Visa Auckland Savings Bank Visa Trustee Bank Visa Westpac Mastercard/Bankcard. Reference H.O. T.4.2.1 PRIZES WON IN COMPETITIONS RUN BY BANKS AND OTHERS Introduction Inland Revenue has recently looked at the in- come tax assessability of prizes offered by banks to selected account holders. Background With the changes to the definitions in the Income Tax Act 1976 of “interest” and “money lent” there has been uncertainty as to whether prizes won by account holders were assessable income. Were the prizes “payment in respect of or in relation to money lent”? Industry representa- tives argued that the account holders only re- ceived a right to participate in the competition. The prizes related to that right and not to the money lent and held in the depositors’ accounts. Ruling The Department’s policy in respect of prizes won in competitions linked to the holding of a bank (or similar) account is: (a) Where an account holder receives a right to take part in a competition any prize received is in relation to the competition and not the money lent. The prize does not constitute assessable income to the account holder. (b) The right to take part in the competitions received by the account holder is in relation to the money lent. The value of that right is assessable income to the account holder. (c) Where the value of the right is of negligible monetary value the Department would not seek to pursue the income tax owing in re- spect of that right. The value of the right to participate in a compe- tition is determined by reference to the chance of winning a prize. The greater the chance of winning, the greater the value of the right to participate. In most cases the value of the right is small and no action is required to include that value as assessable income. Where the value is more than nominal the De- partment would seek to treat the value as assess- able income to the taxpayer/account holder. Each competition must be looked at individu- ally. H.O.
