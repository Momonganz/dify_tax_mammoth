2024 CPI adjustment to DET 19/02: Short-stay accommodation
==========================================================

This update to DET 19/02 shows the annual adjustment to the standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation.

In accordance with Section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner advises adjustments have been made to the standard-cost amounts for the 2024 income year (1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024), as follows:

| Determination DET 19/02 (CPI 2024) Short-stay accommodation |     |
| --- | --- |
| - Daily standard cost (for each guest) |     |
| --- | --- |
| Owned dwelling | $61.00 |
| Rented dwelling | $55.00 |

These amounts reflect the annual movement of the Consumers Price Index for the twelve months to March 2024, which showed an increase of 4.0%.
