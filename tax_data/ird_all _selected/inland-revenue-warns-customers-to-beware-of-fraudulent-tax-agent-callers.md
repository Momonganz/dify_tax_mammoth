Inland Revenue warns customers to beware of fraudulent tax agent callers
========================================================================

**21 May 2014**

Inland Revenue is warning its customers to beware of fraudulent tax agents who claim to work on its behalf to ensure people receive their tax refund.

"We have received reports of people going door-to-door and giving the impression to householders that they are a tax agent who works on behalf of Inland Revenue.

"Just to be clear, Inland Revenue will never telephone, email or knock on your door regarding your tax refund. Neither will we ask for your credit card details or monetary payment in order to receive your refund," said Group Manager Customer Services Eleanor Young.

In South Auckland, householders have recently contacted Inland Revenue about a scheme where callers to their homes claim to work with the Inland Revenue. When pressed, the callers changed this to being contracted by the department.

"This is an attempt to use the Inland Revenue logo and brand to steal confidential and personal information.

"We want to make our customers aware that the tax refund services that do exist to help people receive their refunds do not work for, or on behalf of, Inland Revenue. Customers should always check the person's ID and contact us if they are concerned in anyway.

"Any information that is given to these fraudsters can result in a business or individuals suffering identity and data theft."

Customers who want to manage their tax return themselves can always simply request a personal tax summary through Inland Revenue's myIR website. They will then be sent their personal tax summary and once confirming the amount online the refund will be automatically refunded into their bank account.

"The key thing to remember is that Inland Revenue will never issue a tax refund onto a credit card," Ms Young said.

Inland Revenue asks customers to keep their IRD numbers, tax information, online passwords and all other data safe at all times. If you have replied and given money or provided details please contact your bank or credit card provider immediately.
