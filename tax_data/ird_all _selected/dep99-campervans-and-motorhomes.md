Campervans and Motorhomes
=========================

General Determination DEP99 corrects the depreciation rate for Campervans and Motorhomes for the 2010/11 and subsequent income years.

#### Note to Determination DEP99

This determination corrects the applicable depreciation rate for Campervans and Motorhomes, for the 2010/11 and subsequent income years. The item also clarifies the Commissioner's view that these assets are:

*   considered to have a high residual value (20% residual value)
*   assets acquired during or after the 2010/11 income year are viewed as having an estimated useful life of 8 years,
*   assets acquired prior to the 2010/11 income year were viewed as having an estimated useful life of 10 years.

Taxpayers impacted by the retrospective depreciation rate change can ask for an adjustment to assessments for past years in terms of section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994[1](#01)
, to the extent that legislation permits a refund to be made under Subpart RM of the Income Tax Act 2007. Alternatively, other taxpayers may choose to simply begin to use the new depreciation rate prospectively and make the appropriate depreciation recovery adjustment upon disposal of a campervan or motorhome..
