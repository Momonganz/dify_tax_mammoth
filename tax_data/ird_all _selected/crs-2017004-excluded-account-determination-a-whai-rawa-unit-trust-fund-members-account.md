“Whai Rawa scheme” means the Whai Rawa Unit Trust Fund which is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund under the FMC Act.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

As outlined above, the Whai Rawa scheme is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund under the FMC Act. The register is maintained by the Financial Markets Authority. In order to be included on the register, Whai Rawa must fully meet the registration requirements as set out in section 127, and other relevant provisions, of the FMC Act.

The Whai Rawa scheme was established to encourage long-term savings habits for members of the Ngāi Tahu Whanui.

A Whai Rawa member must meet the following registration requirements. They must be:

*   An individual (natural person) or parent, guardian or other relation of the applicant if the applicant is a minor, provided that the person is less than 65 years at date of entry.
*   Registered (or eligible to be registered) as a tribal member with TRONT; and
*   Able to provide a valid birth certificate.

Whai Rawa members can make voluntary contributions into their own, or into another, Whai Rawa member’s account. TRONT also matches the savings of certain members up to a maximum of currently $200 per year or an additional $100 for newborns enrolled on their first birthday.

All Whai Rawa scheme contributions are locked in until the member reaches the age of 65 years; or unless a member makes another type of permitted withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of the Whai Rawa Unit Trust Deed. The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

A Whai Rawa member’s account:

*   Is subject to regulation under the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011, the FMC Act 2013, the ITA 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994;
*   Is subject to regulation under the ITA 2007 as a retirement account, with Whai Rawa administering taxation obligations on behalf of its members for RSCT payable on TRONT contributions at the individual member’s personal RSCT rate, and with Māori Authority tax credits available as a subsidy (partial or full – depending on the member’s marginal tax rate) against the RSCT that is payable on TRONT contributions.
*   Is subject to AML/CFT procedures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009;
*   Has information reported to Inland Revenue; and
*   Only allows members to make permitted withdrawals. The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

A Whai Rawa member’s account has substantially similar characteristics to a retirement or pension account in subparagraph C(17)(a) of Section VIII of the CRS standard and a savings account in subparagraph C(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such an account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Determining that a Whai Rawa member’s account is an excluded account, and specifying this under NZ law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Scope of determination**

A Whai Rawa member’s account does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to, a retirement or pension account in subparagraph (C)(17)(a) of the CRS standard and an investment/savings account in subparagraph C(17)(b) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and applies to a member’s account in the Whai Rawa scheme where:

*   The Whai Rawa scheme is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund, under the FMC Act; and
*   The Whai Rawa scheme continues to maintain its registration on the register of managed investment schemes as a managed fund, and its manager complies with the relevant on-going registration requirements under the FMC Act; and
*   The member of Whai Rawa is a natural person; and
*   The member’s annual contributions into the Whai Rawa account do not exceed United States $50,000 per annum (including any applicable aggregation rules set out in the CRS); and
*   The member is not able to withdraw funds from Whai Rawa for any purpose other than tertiary education, first home purchase, retirement from age 55 years onwards, for special circumstances due to significant financial hardship, or hardship due to serious illness, or due to the member’s death (where amounts can be withdrawn on behalf of the member).

### **Determination**

A Whai Rawa member’s account in the Whai Rawa scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is an excluded account for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Dated at Wellington on the 22th day of June 2017.
