Te rēhita i te tarahiti kei tāwāhi Register a New Zealand foreign trust
=======================================================================

Before applying for a [New Zealand foreign trust's](/api/glossary/item?id={58222269-A254-48BE-A0FE-94A894AC6B11})
 (NZFT) registration, you'll need to:

*   apply for and receive an [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
     for the NZFT
*   be the NZFT's [contact trustee](/api/glossary/item?id={E65A902B-474B-4A9B-A8D1-DF99BBC9E60E})
     or tax agent.

If your NZFT meets the criteria for an [offshore person](/api/glossary/item?id={C27574DA-8DD9-4D59-8794-E560E12FE3BB})
, apply for an IRD number as an offshore non-incorporated trust. If your NZFT does not, apply for an IRD number as a New Zealand business or organisation.

Other ways to do this

If you want to register an NZFT using paper forms, you can do this. You'll have the option to send us the completed and signed forms, with the required attachments, by either:

*   email
*   post.

[Register a New Zealand foreign trust using paper forms](/international-tax/foreign-exemption-trusts/register/paper-forms)

What happens next
-----------------

We'll process your request within 10 working days. If we need more information, we'll contact you.

Once we confirm your registration, we'll send you a letter and make it available in your myIR account. You'll see an NZFT account on your homepage in myIR, which you can use to manage the trust's details and submit annual returns. You'll need to keep these up to date to retain NZFT registration.

We'll also send you a GST receipt when we receive your payment for the registration fee, if you were required to pay it.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

You or your tax agent will need to keep up to date with managing the trust's details and filing its annual returns.

[File an annual return for a New Zealand foreign trust](/international-tax/foreign-exemption-trusts/annual-return-process)

[Tax agents](/roles/tax-agents)

Non-compliance with the disclosure rules can result in the trustee losing their access to the foreign sourced income exemption for the relevant income year and/or being charged the Foreign Exemption civil penalty (of up to $1,000) for failure to comply.  

### Residual beneficiaries

Are also known as final beneficiaries and are beneficiaries that have a right to any undistributed trust property when the trust is wound up.   
  
The residual beneficiary does not have a fixed, vested or contingent interest in the trust property.   
  
Your trust deed may describe residual beneficiaries as a class or group – for example, children of the settlor. If this is the case, describe the class to us when registering the New Zealand foreign trust.
