[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

After the end of each tax year, we send out income tax assessment letters showing whether people have a tax refund, tax to pay or have paid the right amount. You do not get a letter if you need to file an individual income tax return - IR3. 

The definitions on this page will help you understand your letter and how your tax has been worked out for the year.

**Tip:** definitions are grouped by topic. For example, you’ll find ‘Total PIE deductions’ under ‘Portfolio investment entity (PIE)’.

Show all

ACC earners' levy

Everyone who earns salary or wages in New Zealand pays the ACC earners’ levy. This covers injuries that happen at work, at home, or anywhere else.

Like tax, the levy is automatically taken from your salary or wages.

Benefits

These are payments from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Some have tax taken from them and are included in your end-of-year tax assessment, like the Jobseeker or Sole Parent Support benefits. Some other benefits are not taxable and are not included in your end-of-year tax assessment, like the accommodation supplement or Unsupported Child benefit.

Claimable expenses

You can claim some expenses against your income, which reduces the tax you pay. For example, the cost of income protection insurance.

Find out what you can claim as expenses in your income tax assessment.

Completing your assessment

If your letter asks you to complete your assessment, you need to check our records are correct and give us any missing information. The letter will give you more instructions, or you can read more on our page 'Change my income tax assessment details'.

[Change my income tax assessment details](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/income-tax-assessments/change-my-income-tax-assessment-details)

Credit/debit - tax calculation result

We work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax. Credit means you’ve paid too much and have a refund (or money to transfer to a different tax debt like child support). Debit means you have more tax to pay.

Earnings not liable for ACC levy

The ACC earners’ levy is not deducted from income-tested benefits, NZ Super or Student Allowance. Our website has examples of income-tested benefits.

[Benefits, New Zealand superannuation and Student Allowance](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-income/benefits-nz-superannuation-student-allowance)

Entitlement (Working for Families)

Working for Families Tax Credits are payments you can get to help raise your children. Your entitlement depends on your income and family circumstances.

Find out more about any entitlement you may be able to get.

[About Working for Families](/working-for-families/about)

Gross income

This is your income before tax or expenses are taken away.

Gross payments (for schedular payments)

These are payments to contractors (schedular payments) before tax is taken away.

IETC

The independent earner tax credit (IETC) is a payment or credit for New Zealand tax residents earning $24,000 to $70,000 for the 2025 tax year (or $48,000 for the 2024 tax year and earlier). You can use it to:

*   pay less tax during the year
*   get a refund at the end of the year
*   reduce your tax debt at the end of the year (including child support).

Find out if you can get the IETC.

Income tax assessment

This shows the income you earned, how much tax you paid during the year and how much you should have paid. It also shows if you paid too much tax and have a refund, or not enough tax and have more to pay.

[Automatically issued income tax assessments](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/income-tax-assessments)

Interest/gross interest

Interest is money you earn from having investments (for example, KiwiSaver) and savings in bank accounts. You pay tax on interest you earn.

**Gross interest** is your interest income before tax is taken away.

[Interest and dividends](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/interest-and-dividends)

Portfolio investment entity (PIE)

An organisation that invests money for its customers (investors) in different types of passive investment (like KiwiSaver).

**PIE income** – the interest you earn from your investment is counted as income, and you pay tax on it.

**PIE loss** – if your investment loses money, the PIE organisation claims a tax refund from Inland Revenue. They may then refund money to you.

**Total PIE deductions** – the total tax you’ve paid on your PIE income. Your provider (the PIE organisation) takes away tax as you earn interest, based on the tax rate (PIR) you’ve given them. You need to make sure your PIR is right or you may have tax to pay at the end of the tax year.

**Portfolio investment entity/PIE calculation** – we work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax on the interest you earned from KiwiSaver or other PIEs.

Learn more about how we work out tax on your PIE interest.

Prescribed investor rate (PIR)

This is the tax rate used for interest you earn from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) - for example, KiwiSaver income. You tell your PIE/provider what your rate is. It’s based on your income, and if it’s too low, you may have tax to pay at the end of the tax year.

[Using prescribed investor rates](/roles/portfolio-investment-entities/using-prescribed-investor-rates)

Resident withholding tax (RWT)

This is the tax you pay on interest and dividends you earn from New Zealand bank accounts and investments. RWT is taken away from your earnings before they’re paid to you.

[Resident withholding tax (RWT)](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/resident-withholding-tax-rwt)

Schedular payments

These are payments made to contractors. Tax is deducted, but they’re different from salary or wage payments.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

TAA (Tax Administration Act) 1994

This Act gives us the legal right to work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax.

Tax deductions

Any tax that’s already taken away before you’re paid.

[My income is taxed before I get paid](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed/my-income-is-taxed-before-i-get-paid)

Taxable income

The income you’ll pay tax on. This is your total income, minus certain expenses, losses and income types. Find out more about what income is taxable.

[How income gets taxed](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/how-income-is-taxed)

Taxable pensions

New Zealand superannuation (NZ Super) is taxable. This means the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) deducts tax before they pay you.
