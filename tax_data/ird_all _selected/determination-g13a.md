UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Prices or Yields Issued: 24 October 1990 G13A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G13A: Prices or Yields”. G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G13: Prices or Yields made on the 8th day of February 1989. 2. This determination applies where for the purpose of calculating the income or expenditure of a person it is necessary to determine a price or yield for valuation purposes. This may arise where a person wishes to calculate income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement pursuant to section 64C(4) of the Act. (For example, in the application of a market valuation method for calculating the amount of income derived by a person in respect of New Zealand Government Stock in an income year.) 3. Apart from minor amendments, this determination differs from Determination G13: Prices or Yields by allowing the use of prices or yields other than those at which the person could deal. The method for finding such an alternative price or yield must be adopted for financial reporting purposes and must produce a price or yield that does not result in a more favourable result for tax purposes. For example where the holder of Government Stock values its holdings, for financial reporting purposes, by taking the price mid-way between the buy and sell price it may also use this method for calculating its income or expenditure for tax purposes. 4. The criteria for approval of a market for this purpose are similar to those required for the approval of a foreign currency market (Determination G6C: Foreign Currency Rates refers). These are the indicators of a “free” and accessible market. 5. Where it is necessary to ascertain a price or yield for the purpose of section 64C(4) of the Act (market value methods of accounting), the price or yield to be used is found by reference to a market in which the person could deal. For example, where there is a Euromarket and a domestic market in the same class of securities, the person is required to use prices from the market to which the person has access. It is assumed that where a person has access to two such markets, arbitrageurs will ensure that prices in the two markets will not differ materially. 6. Where a person owns securities or has bought securities for forward delivery (i.e. is “long in the security”), the price to be used is the buying or bid price (i.e. the price at which the market would be prepared to buy the security for appropriate delivery date). Where the person has “short sold” securities, the price to be used is the selling or offer price (i.e. the price at which the market would be prepared to sell the security for the appropriate delivery date). Alternatively, in either case, the person may use a method which finds a price which falls between the two prices. This method must be adopted G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] for financial reporting purposes and produce a result which is no more favourable for tax purposes. 7. Where sources of information for approved markets do not show price or yield quotations for the maturity of the security to be priced, commercially acceptable forms of interpolation or extrapolation may be used based on quoted prices or yields for securities of different maturities that are otherwise identical to the security in question. 8. Section 64C(4) of the Act may not be applied in relation to a financial arrangement if no market or method or source of information for the financial arrangement is approved in a determination made by the Commissioner. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(d) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G13: Prices or Yields made on the 8th day of February 1989. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply where it is necessary for the purposes of section 64C(4) of the Act to determine the price or yield of a financial arrangement. 4 Principle 1.

Where quotes are available on Contributor Pages these shall be used in preference to quotes from persons active in the Market; ii. All quotes used shall be from persons acting independently of any other. c) Where— i. The price or yield cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this sub-clause; and ii. The prices or yields for Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangements and for Longer Maturing Financial Arrangements in relation to the Identical Financial Arrangements and the Market are quoted on a Multicontributor Page; by Interpolation between the price or yield so quoted for the Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement and the price or yield so quoted for the Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement. d) Where— i. The price or yield cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this sub-clause; and ii. The price or yield for a Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement and for a Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement in relation to the Identical Financial Arrangements and the Market are quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages; G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] by Interpolation between the arithmetic mean of the prices or yields quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages for the Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangements and the arithmetic mean of the prices or yields quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages for the Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement; e) Where the price or yield cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this sub-clause, and the price or yield for any Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement or any Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement is quoted on a Multicontributor Page, by Extrapolation from the price or yield so quoted for— i. The Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement; or ii. The Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement; as the case may be, that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement. f) Where the price or yield cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this sub-clause, and the price or yield for— i. A Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement; or ii. A Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement; is quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages, by Extrapolation from the arithmetic mean of the prices or yields quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages for the Shorter Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement, or the arithmetic mean of the prices or yields quoted on not less than three Contributor Pages for the Longer Maturing Financial Arrangement that matures closest in time to the maturity of the financial arrangement as the case may be. 8. Where the price or yield cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding sub-clause, no method is approved by this determination for the purposes of subsection 64C(4) of the Act. 7 Example On its balance date of 30 September 1991, a corporate investor held $2,000,000 face value of New Zealand Government Stock maturing 15 August 1994 bearing a coupon of 14%. G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1991 the Reuters Multicontributor Page, NZGS, had quotes of 16.42% (buy) and 16.38% (sell). A rate of 16.42% would be appropriate for the valuation of this holding as at 30 September 1991 in accordance with clause 6(3)(a), clause 6(4)(a), and clause 6(7)(a) of this determination. Note: To obtain the value of the Government Stock it is necessary to use this rate in an appropriate valuation formula. b) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1992 there were no Multicontributor quotations available. However, for an identical issue of Government Stock the following quotes were obtained from a broker active in the market and from Contributor Pages supplied by brokers active in the market: The appropriate rate, determined in accordance with clause 6(7)(b) of this determination, is the arithmetic mean of the buy quotes, i.e. 15.88%. c) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1993 there were no Multicontributor quotations available for this particular stock. The following quotations were available from the Multicontributor Page, NZGS, for two similar stocks: Clause 6(7) of this determination applies and a form of Interpolation between these quotations is to be used. If the corporate investor chooses to use linear interpolation, the required yield is calculated as follows: G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The relevant buy quotes and terms are: From 15/6/94 to 15/9/94: 92 days The required valuation yield is calculated under straight line interpolation: ((31 × 15.10) + (61 × 15.06))/92 = 15.07% d) An alternative method At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1991 the Reuters Multicontributor Page, NZGS, had quotes of 16.42% (buy) and 16.38% (sell). The corporate investor uses the mid point between the buy and sell rate for financial reporting purposes and a rate of 16.40% would be appropriate for the valuation of this holding as at 30 September 1991 in accordance with clause 6(3)(a), clause 6(4)(b) and clause 6(7)(a) of this determination. Note: To obtain the value of the Government Stock it is necessary to use this rate in an appropriate valuation formula.
