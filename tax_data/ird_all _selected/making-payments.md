Te utu i ngā utu tautoko tamaiti Making child support payments
==============================================================

Child support payments are due from the [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 on the 20th of the month. We pay them to the [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 by the 23rd of the month.

Compulsory employer deductions
------------------------------

### From October 2021

If you're a liable parent, it is compulsory for you to pay by deductions from your income if you earn salary and wages. We'll let your employer know when and how much to deduct.

### Before October 2021

If you were registered as a liable parent before October 2021, you can choose whether to pay by employer deductions or to pay by other payment options - for example, payment plan, direct debit or credit card. However, if you miss payments, you’ll be registered automatically to make payments through compulsory employer deductions.

There are times when we may agree to you organising your payments yourself, even when you are earning salary or wages. For example, because your income is irregular.

If Work and Income pay you a benefit, they'll deduct your child support payments before your benefit is paid to you. We'll let Work and Income know when and how much to deduct.

Let us know if you change jobs or stop or start a benefit. By letting us know, we can help you make sure you still make your payments on time.

Other payment options
---------------------

If you do not have employer deductions for child support payments, there are other ways to pay.

### Child support payment plan

If you do not have salary or wages we can deduct child support from, you may want to use our child support payment plan. The plan will help you remember how much to pay and the date the payments are due.

You can choose to pay weekly, fortnightly or monthly and we'll work out how much you need to pay. You can set this up by calling us or doing it yourself in myIR.

### Direct debit

When you set up a direct debit, it means you're letting us take a certain amount of money from your bank account. You can set up regular payments or make a one-off payment. Direct debits can be from New Zealand and some overseas banks.

### Credit card or debit card online

You can make payments to us with credit and debit cards. We accept Visa and Mastercard.

The bank charges a convenience fee of 1.42% for any credit or debit card payment made to us. Convenience fees are charged and paid directly to the bank. There may be a delay in processing the fee (up to 24 hours) and it will show as a separate transaction on your bank statement. 

You need to log into myIR to make credit or debit card payments.
