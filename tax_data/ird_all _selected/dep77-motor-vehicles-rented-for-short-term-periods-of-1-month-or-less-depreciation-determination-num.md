### Note to determination DEP77

In _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 10, No 6 (June 1998) we published a general depreciation determination, "Determination DEP34: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 34" for certain classes of motor vehicles and trailers when they are rented for short-term hire periods of 1 month or less.

The determination added those asset classes to both the "Transportation" and "Hire Equipment (Where on short-term hire of 1 month or less only)" asset categories. We have been advised that some taxpayers, referring only to the "Transportation" asset category, have been using the depreciation rates set for "short-term" hire even though the assets in question may have been hired for periods longer than 1 month (in this context, 1 month refers to a calendar month).

We have therefore issued a new depreciation determination deleting the old asset classes set out in DEP 34 from the "Transportation" asset category, and inserting new asset classes making it clear that the higher depreciation rates that may be used for motor vehicles and trailers used for short-term hire apply only to those assets that are hired only for periods of one month or less. The depreciation rates, however, are unchanged.

We have also been asked to clarify whether or not the asset category could be used for assets that are used for both short-term (1 month or less) and longer term hire (periods of longer than 1 month). This issue arises where taxpayers generally hire the motor vehicles / trailers for short-term (1 month or less) periods, but may occasionally hire them for a longer term.

It is the Commissioner's view that the higher depreciation rates available for assets that are used for short-term hire periods should only be used for assets that are exclusively hired for short-term periods. Taxpayers who hire assets for both short and longer terms should not use the depreciation rates that apply for short-term periods.
