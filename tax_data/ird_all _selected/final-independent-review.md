Geof Nightingale Advisory Ltd Team Lead & Management Support (CE & DC ED&I) – Executive Services Enterprise Design & Integrity Inland Revenue WELLINGTON 6011 4 November 2024 Tēnā koe This letter records the outcomes of my independent review of Inland Revenue’s draft review report titled “Review and Analysis of Social Media Usage for Custom Audiences” (the Final Draft Review Report). My review has been conducted in accordance with my engagement letter dated 22 October 2024. Thank you for your time and the time and prompt engagement of Inland Revenue officials who I met with in the course of the review. Summary Based on my review of the report, its associated references and my discussions with key Inland Revenue officials involved in the review, the Final Draft Review Report reflects a careful and considered review of the custom audience programme. The review reflects the importance of communicating with customers using approaches that best support customers to access their entitlements and meet their obligations while meeting Inland Revenue’s confidentiality obligations to customers. The scope of the custom audience review has been appropriate to consider the concerns raised with the custom audience programme. The findings are well supported and clearly set out. I have not identified any unaddressed concerns. The review identified some areas for further consideration by Inland Revenue. The review identified two instances of unintended disclosure of confidential information and outlines how these are being dealt with. Strictly Confidential 1 Background The Commissioner has a statutory duty to protect the integrity of the tax system and is charged with a duty of care and management of the tax system. 1 In particular, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the importance of promoting compliance, including voluntary compliance, by all persons with the Inland Revenue Acts. 2 Since 2014 Inland Revenue has contracted social media platforms to provide targeted communications to customers to remind them of their obligations and to make them aware of their potential entitlements. Using custom audiences assists the Commissioner to fulfil his duty of care and management of the tax system and to provide the best customer support that he can using modern communication channels. However, the Commissioner also has important confidentiality obligations to customers arising under the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act 2020. Inland Revenue communicates those confidentiality obligations to customers through its charter and its privacy policy. Despite those confidentiality obligations, Inland Revenue has the ability to make permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information in certain circumstances in order to carry out or support a lawful function of the Commissioner administering the tax system 3 . It is in that context that in order to target relevant messages to specific customer groups some customer details are provided to the social media platforms in controlled circumstances on a de-identified and encrypted basis to enable the platforms to generate custom audiences. In response to concerns raised recently by the public in the media and in order to respond to requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 2020, Inland Revenue has stopped its custom audience programme and undertaken a detailed internal review of its engagement with social media platforms to determine if there is a threat or risk to customer privacy. The internal review is documented in the Final Draft Review Report. That report, once finalised, is intended to be released to the public at a press conference by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Scope and timing of the independent review The scope and timing of the independent review is set out in appendix one. Meetings held with relevant Inland Revenue officials in conjunction with the independent review are set out in appendix two. 3 Section 18D(1) and (2), and Schedule 7, Part A, clause 11 of the TAA. 2 Section 6A(2)(b) of the TAA. 1 Sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Strictly Confidential 2 My review considered three versions of the Final Draft Review Report: 1.
