Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 75
======================================================

Determination DEP75 (2010) sets a depreciation rate for Marine Fender Systems, which are attached to wharves for protection of the wharf and vessels.

#### Marine Fender Systems - Depreciation Determination

* * *

The Commissioner has set a general economic depreciation rate for Marine Fender Systems. Marine Fender Systems are attached to wharves.

Their function is to absorb large amounts of kinetic energy and to protect the wharf and vessels moored or being moored to the wharf from being damaged should the vessel collide with the wharf.

The Marine Fender Systems consist of a series of steel box frames with plastic or rubber fenders behind. These are mounted on a structural steel frame and may be further supported by chains. They may also use high strength plastic tanks as pneumatic buffers.
