Nama tōmuri mā te roa 2008 ki te 2017 Overdue debt by debt age 2008 to 2017
===========================================================================

This section shows the dynamics of overdue debt case age from the 2008 to 2017 financial years. It covers both overdue tax debt and overdue child support debt. The debt age structure is presented both for dollar values and debt cases. The age of each debt case is weighted based on weighted overdue debt case age. Due to rounding, the proportions may not always add to 100%.  
  
The data for these statistics is available for download from the links at the bottom of the page.
