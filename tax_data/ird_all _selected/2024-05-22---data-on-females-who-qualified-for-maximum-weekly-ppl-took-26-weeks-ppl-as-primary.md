24OIA2159 Page 1 of 4 22 May 2024 De ar Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 April 2024. You requested the following: How many men who had the primary responsibility for the care of a newborn child took 26 weeks paid parental leave in 2024, compared to women? How many of these qualified for the maximum weekly amount of $712.17 (figure for 2024), compared to women, and how many qualified for less? How many men who met the 12-month criteria went back to work after using the 26 weeks of paid parental leave, compared to women? Wherever possible, could you provide a total tally as well as providing data for each region in New Zealand? On 23 April 2024, you clarified your request to include how many people transferred part of their 26 weeks paid parental leave to their spouse or partner, broken down by gender. The information you have requested is enclosed as Appendix A. To protect the privacy of individual persons, this information cannot be broken down further as it increases the risk of being able to identify an individual, which is contrary to the confidentiality provisions set out in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA). As such, your request for regional data is refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as releasing this information would be contrary to section 18 of the TAA. The gender information used to prepare our response is implied, based on a customer’s title, as Inland Revenue does not explicitly store gender information. Male titles include Mr, Master, Lord, Reverend Father, and Sir. Female titles include Miss, Mrs, Ms, Lady, Reverend Mother, Sister, and Dame. Unknown titles include Captain, Colonel, Doctor, MX, Professor, Reverend, Honourable, Judge, and Major. 24OIA2159 Page 2 of 4 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz . Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz ) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.

We do not hold information on when a customer might have returned to self-employed work. Some customers in the 2024 year have not yet exhausted their PPL entitlements.
