Determination PROV23: Provisional depreciation rate for automated milking system
================================================================================

Determination PROV23 (2012) sets a provisional depreciation rate for automated milking systems, or milking machines.

The Commissioner has set a provisional depreciation rate for automated milking systems.

An automated milking system is a robotic milking machine that is used on dairy farms. It enables cows to be milked on demand, without human intervention. An automated milking system typically consists of the following components and functions:

*   The milking station, which includes robotic arms, cups that place on a cowâ€™s udder, gates, and frame where the cow stands during milking
*   Feeding systems for the cow while milking
*   Udder preparation routine
*   Cleaning system
*   A milking machine and milking line
*   Vacuum system
*   Milk cooling function
*   Automatic milk samplers
*   Milk quality monitoring equipment
*   Cow electronic identification
*   Selection gates and herd traffic control software
*   Herd management software, including software to control the milking, cleaning and cooling process; milk quality monitoring; and cow identification
