=============================================

If you have tax debt you cannot pay, we can help you. Individuals, companies, partnerships and trusts can apply for either:

*   an instalment arrangement
*   financial relief.

We might ask you for more information so we can understand your situation and work out the best way to help you. If you're in business, we may get you to send us a Twelve month cash flow forecast - IR591.

If you're unsure of your options, give us a call and we'll help you out. If you know ahead of time that you will not be able to pay your tax, contact us or start the application that best fits how you want to move forward.

Applying for an instalment arrangement
--------------------------------------

Splitting up what you owe over weekly or fortnightly payments can make it easier to repay your tax debt. Apply for an instalment arrangement if you cannot afford to pay the tax you:

*   already owe
*   will owe in the future.

You can apply for instalment arrangements for all tax types, except child support, in myIR. We'll either:

*   approve it
*   contact you for more information.

Setting up direct debit payments is a good way to make your ongoing instalments. You'll be able to set these up in myIR or choose a different way of paying.

Applying for financial relief
-----------------------------

If you cannot meet your payments, we might be able to write off penalties or certain amounts. We'll need you to send us information in your application for financial relief before making a decision.

If you're [overseas-based](/api/glossary/item?id={0D56A105-8E3D-4EF9-B502-52EEBC261811})
 with a student loan or a [non-resident taxpayer](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
, we'll need a bit more information in your application. We normally have most of the information we need for companies, partnerships and trusts, so your application is also a different process.
