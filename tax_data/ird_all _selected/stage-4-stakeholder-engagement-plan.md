multi-year, multi-stage change programme which will help IR become the modern world-class revenue organisation which is set out in its vision: IR for the Future. Stage 4 1 will see the completion of the future revenue system. It is the final stage of IR’s transformation journey and will conclude in early 2022 at which point the Business Transformation programme will end. In this time, we will look to transition the knowledge, practises and processes we have developed to support both internal and external stakeholders, into the business progressively. How this happens ties into the way the organisation is set up for the future, with ongoing work on our future operating model in conjunction with He Kōtuitui. 1.1 Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams: 1.1.1 Workstream 1 — START Delivery. This is made up of three key areas: A. Core Completion Delivery: Moving all remaining tax and social policy products into START (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Foreign Trusts, Duties and Unclaimed Monies) and upgrading START and myIR to Version 12. B. New Legislation Delivery: Implementing any new policy into the tax and social policy system. C. Optimisation De livery. Improvement of products and services already in START in full partnership with the business and in consultation with external customers where appropriate. This work will go through a prioritisation pr ocess and while important, will be lower priority than workstreams A and B. 1.1.2 Workstream 2 — Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO). 1.1.3 Workstream 3 — Intel led (IL). 1.1.4 Workstream 4 — Enterprise Support Services (ESS). 1.1.5 Workstream 5 — Transition and Business Integration (T&BI). This Stakeholder Engagement Plan identifies and documents at a high-level the strategy and approach for building and maintaining internal and external stakeholder understanding of, and support for, START Delivery (Workstream 1). For a more detailed view of the BT external stakeholder management approach, this Stakeholder Engagement Plan should also be read in conjunction with the BT Account Management Strategies (scheduled for completion by the end of September). 1 See Appendix 1 for a detailed diagram of Stage 4 Scope Page 7 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.2 Strategic engagement for our Stakeholders Effective communication and engagement with a complex array of stakeholders is critical to the success of the transformation within IR, and a key construct of achieving the transformation goal of making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Stage 4 START Delivery has a critical dependency on successfully engaging internal and external stakeholders, both existing and new to the Business Transformation Programme. This includes stakeholders BT has been engaging with to varying degrees since Stage 1 of Business Transformation, for example, the majority of CCS teams within the organisation , an d tax intermediaries, software developers and businesses outside IR; as well as stakeholders who have had less interaction with to the BT Programme who are connected specifically with the final products being moved into START. These include, for example, Trustee Companies for Foreign Trusts and Oranga Tamariki for Child Support. 1.3 Strategic considerations When developing this strategy, we took into account a number of considerations illustrating the landscape of START Delivery: • We know most of our stakeholders, and they know us. • START Delivery affects new stakeholders, as well as existing stakeholders in different ways. • We have effective, well established account and relationship management teams. • IR has established Areas of Focus teams in areas of highest risk and change impact and BT is an integral part of these teams. • We engage and collaborate with the business to achieve successful outcomes. • We acknowledge all the IR change our customers may be facing. • BT communications channels are well developed and fit for purpose. • We are agile and ready to respond to legislation changes and the impacts of COVID-19. 1.4 Stakeholder engagement strategy The above considerations identify some critical elements for success for START Delivery stakeholder engagement. Our strategy is to: • Use what we know works. We will continue to de velop BT’s established engagement methodologies, relationships, processes and channels, particularly for the many stakeholder groups that are familiar with BT change. • Engage effectively with new stakeholders. We will build our understanding and adapt our approach to meet the needs of our new s takeholder groups. • Help our people be ambassadors of change. We will build a deeper understanding of the change with our people first and equipment them to help our customers. • Taking a whole of IR view when engaging with stakeholders. Acknowledging there are benefits and impacts which sit outside of BT change. Page 8 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Be ready to understand, act and adapt. Environmental impacts beyond our control may affect the effectiveness of our engagement. We will be prepared to recognise these impacts, understand them and act quickly in response. Page 9 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Background 2.1 About Inland Revenue Inland Revenue (IR) is an organisation of over 5,000 people located in 17 towns and cities across New Zealand. In the 2018-2019 period, IR collected $79.5 billion of revenue which is 80% of the revenue required by the New Zealand government to fund our country. IR also paid $4.1 billion in Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver (via scheme providers), paid parental leave payments and payroll subsidies. We collected $471 million in Child Support and passed on $290 million to carers (the difference retained to offset costs of benefits). 2.2 About Business Transformation Business Transformation (BT) is a multi-year, multi-stage change programme which will help IR become the modern world-class revenue organisation that is set out in IR’s vision IR for the Future. The transformation will change IR to make it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. The programme’s objectives are: • Improving agility so policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing our services. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, focused on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. The programme replaces the FIRST core tax and social policy system with START. It also enables other significant shifts including changes to the organisation model, the introduction of supporting technology and a review of policy and legislative settings to frame and support the programme’s objectives. 2.3 Business Transformation progress to date As at June 2020, the following has been delivered: 1. Business Transformation Stage 1: Stage 1 delivered GST and other functions into START including Case manager and Customer Interaction Manager, making GST easier for customers and making the management of GST simpler and faster for IR and the government. 2. Business Transformation Release 2: Release 2 delivered the Accounting Income Method (AIM), Voluntary Payday Filing, Withholding taxes, Fringe Benefits Taxes, Gaming Machine Duty, EMS information collection and imaging correspondence. Page 10 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3. Business Transformation Release 3: Release 3 moved Income tax, donation tax credits, Working for Families tax credits and the Customer Master from FIRST to START. It also included new approaches to meeting tax obligations and paying tax, including automatic income tax assessments for individuals. Payday filing (voluntary in R2) became compulsory. 4. Business Transformation Release 4: Release 4 moved Student Loans, KiwiSaver and the end-to-end processing of employer obligations (PAYE) into START and implemented a number of enhancements to Income tax and Working for Families. 5. Organisation design: In parallel with this activity BT has supported IR through significant change, resulting in more effective ways of working and bringing our people closer to our customers. Although organisation design is still ongoing, it has now been handed to the business for completion. 6. Intelligence-Led: This project will deliver the Data and Intelligence Platform, Stax (enterprise records management system), and the Intelligent Information Project (including guided help, enterprise search and intranet). This is to be delivered in stages through to September 2021. 7. Ātea: Ātea, IR’s new enterprise support services system has been implemented with subsequent updates due over 2020. 2.4 Changes due to COVID-19 In late May 2020, changes were made to the scope and timings of the final stage of the programme to accommodate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Page 11 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Stage 4 Scope 3.1 Stage 4 Scope and Workstreams Stage 4 2 will see the completion of the future revenue system. It is the final stage of IR’s transformation journey and will conclude in early 2022 at which point the Business Transformation programme will end. In that time, we will look to transition the knowledge, practises and processes we have developed to support both internal and external stakeholders, into the business progressively. How this happens ties into the way the organisation is set up for the future, with ongoing work on our future operating model in conjunction with He Kōtuitui. Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams: Workstream 1 — START Delivery: This is made up of three key areas: A. Core Completion Delivery: Moving all remaining tax and social policy products into START (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Foreign Trusts, Duties and Unclaimed Monies) and upgrading START and myIR to Version 12. B. New Legislation Delivery: Implementing any new policy into the tax and social policy system. C. Optimisation Delivery: Improvement of products and services already in START in full partnership with the business. While important, this work will go through a prioritisation process and will be lower priority than workstreams A and B. Workstream 2 — Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO): Decommissioning and archiving of non-enduring heritage services and a programme of work to ensure that technology environments are simplified, enduring, and sustainable to operate. Workstream 3 — Intel led (IL): The Intelligence Led programme will continue working to bring together two distinct programmes of work — data and analytics and information and knowledge management — into one cohesive eco-system. Workstream 4 — Enterprise Support Services (ESS): This will bring more information and functionality into Ātea over the next year. Workstream 5 — Transition and Business Integration (T&BI): This workstream will focus on the support and transition of our knowledge, methods, practices, and processes back to the business, to enable the programme to wind down and the business to progressively take on the responsibility for delivering change. 2 See Appendix 1 for a detailed diagram of Stage 4 Scope Page 12 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.2 START Delivery In early 2021, move into START: • Paid Parental Leave: Moving Paid Parental Leave into START will bring about the following key changes: o PPL being in the same system as all other products, rather than a standalone system. o Wider range of staff will be able to work on PPL. o Removal of the paper application and replaced with a digital channel, with a phone channel for those that don’t have access to the internet. Customers able to submit applications and update their circumstances via digital channels. o It will also allow automated processing of applications, disbursements and will consider IR’s role in prevention of overpayments. Note: regulation changes are required to enable the significant shift we look to deliver for PPL when it is moved into START. I n 2019, IR made $367 m illion in payments to 66,923 parents. • New Zealand Foreign Trusts: The move to START will allow digital channels for receiving, storing, managing and distributing information and payments as well as enhancing validations to improve data quality and reduce manual handling. As at October 2019 there were 2,991 active trusts. • Duties: The move to START will enable digital channels for receiving and distributing information and money as well as changes to allow for automated processing of returns, payments, P&I, credit offsetting, disbursements and reconciliations. In 2019, payments totalled approximately $115 m illion. • Unclaimed Monies: The move to START will deliver legislative changes to improve aspects of the holder and owner processes such as enhancing information matching to locate owners, allow third party authority to make claims and introduce a 60-year time limit for claims. Further changes include improving compliance for organisations through online service options, providing an online claimant process and automated website list updating holder payments and claimant refund transactions. The database and spreadsheets currently hold more than 500,000 entries worth approximately $214 million. In October 2021 move into START: • Child Support: Moving Child Support into START will modernise and improve information sharing, online services and self-management tools, and deliver straight- through processing with fewer manual interventions, automating large transactional processes and providing a better integration of International Child Support into core systems. It will also deliver legislative changes to improve fairness, simplify aspects of the scheme, improve compliance and deliver on Government goals to improve the wellbeing of children. It may include changes that affect some individuals, such as requiring some to start Page 13 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] paying child support directly via their employer. Note that in 2019, IR collected $471 million from more than 164,000 parents who pay child support. • Upgrade START and myIR to Version 12: The changes will include better functionality, enhanced security, a different navigational structure and a new look and feel. The changes will likely have a medium-high impact for customer facing staff and will be a big change for most customers and especially tax agents. 3.3 New Legislation Delivery This area of focus will allow us to: • Dedicate resource to ensure we can assist, as needed, to support the Government’s COVID-19 response. • Implement legislative changes we may need for the CORE START products, along with Budget initiatives, such as annual returns. The items in this stream are considered must dos and will be prioritised over optimisation tasks. 3.4 Optimisation This area of focus is about transitioning the change processes and methods to IR’s business units with a focus on optimising products and processes already delivered by BT, for example Tax on Income, Working for Families, KiwiSaver, Student Loans and GST. The combined BT and BAU leads will develop the prioritisation approach and model that IR will use post BT and also test the processes and model during the final stage of BT by selecting high value groups of changes that deliver on operational efficiencies and improved customer outcomes. Page 14 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Structure of Stakeholder Engagement and Planning documents This Stakeholder Engagement Plan identifies and documents the strategy and approach for building and maintaining internal and external stakeholder understanding of and support for START Delivery (Workstream 1), covering the period June 2020 – December 2021. Stakeholders are defined as groups or individuals who are impacted by, or will impact on, the implementation of Stage 4 START Delivery. 4.1 Stage 4 Planning documents More detailed planning documents for Stage 4 are below: Stakeholder Engagement for Business Transformation Stage 4 Workstream Details Owner Workstream 1: START Product Delivery Stakeholder Engagement Plan for START Delivery (Stage 4) (this document) Internal Communications Plan BT Communications in collaboration with the business Customer, Stakeholder and Marketing Plan BT Communications in collaboration with Marketing and Communications, and the business Workstream 2: Technology Landscape Optimisation Organisation Impact Assessment, Change, Stakeholder and Communications Plan for Decommissioning and Archiving Organisation Impact Assessment, Change, Stakeholder and Communications Plan for Technology Landscape Optimisation BT OCMT in conjunction with BT Communications Workstream 3: Intel-Led Intelligence Led – Incremental Communications plans BT Communications in conjunction with IIS Communications Workstream 4: Enterprise Support Services ESS Release Change and Communications plans BT Communications for ESS programme Workstream 5: Transition and Business Integration Plan name (TBC) Plan owner (TBC) Page 15 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 Environment Key internal and external environmental factors that will influence the way we communicate are listed below: 5.1 Internal environment Strengths Weaknesses • BT change and communications processes and tactics are well embedded and engaged with by IR people. o There are high levels of internal awareness of BT. o The roll out experience is well understood and planned for – the milestones for change management are well understood and expected by the business. o Teams waiting for their work to go on START are highly engaged and have already been requesting information. o Product owners and BT Managers are well known and respected in the segments they’re representing. • There are high levels of trust in both BT’s ability to deliver and our people’s capability to learn and adapt. • We have access to a group of key users throughout IR. • Dropping the ‘release’ terminology may cause some initial confusion with our internal stakeholders, who are more familiar with releases rather than stages. • Effective engagement and communications with Child Support customers has a high dependency on the support and involvement of our Child Support team. The team’s unique role, needs and values need to be well understood by the BT team when planning and delivering communications. • Anticipation for START v12 to drive innovation may mean that there is disappointment if there are limitations on improvements. • The update to START v12 brings change on change for teams who have been impacted at every release. Embedding will be difficult as people are still catching up. Page 16 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Opportunities Threats • Getting the remaining tax products into START removes all remaining coexistence for our people and provides an opportunity for teams to look at ongoing service improvements. • V12 is the first upgrade experienced by IR and an opportunity to re-engage our people with START functionality, and how it assists them and our customers. • Stage 4 including Paid Parental Leave will help Families deliver on their Child Support strategy. • Prioritisation and delivery of optimisation initiatives will be delivered in partnership with the business and will provide the blueprint for delivering future change post BT. • The use of new technology throughout the COVID-19 levels has opened new communications channels and ways to engage with our people. • Stage 4 provides the opportunity to bring products currently stored on spreadsheets and databases into START, reducing risk and a significant amount of manual work maintaining them. • Currently only a very small portion of the unclaimed monies held by IR is published. • Updating START to v12, may prove hard, if not harder for our people than introducing a whole new system. • There is risk that messaging around changes delivered from the START delivery workstream may become confused if teams outside BT are also delivering change eg new legislation, optimisation. • The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 may add to our delivery scope and make engagement more difficult, and are not all known — but will include: o Changing priorities for our customers, affecting how we work. o Changes to our working environment – how and where they work. • High levels of change across IR in 2020/2021, including organisation design change, can mean change fatigue, and less focus on Stage 4. • Organisation design change could mean changes to teams and individuals BT depends on for stakeholder engagement, marketing and communications. • The initial publication of the updated Unclaimed Monies list is likely to generate an initial peak of work, greater than the current resourcing – delays in responding or high thresholds of proof may be seen negatively. Page 17 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.3 External environment Strengths Weaknesses • IR’s reputation to deliver change is strong. • External groups understand our go-live processes and trust that we’ll prepare them well for change. • We have very strong external relationship teams (Community Compliance, BT Account Management, External Relationships, Significant Enterprises). • We’ve established good channels to communicate to key external stakeholder groups. • We are clear about who our customers are and what they need from us. • Existing relationships with key government agencies (MSD in particular) can be leveraged to support communications to key external groups. • We are the lead agency for Child Support – customers understand to come to us for information and questions. • The f inal products within Stage 4 have a relatively small customer base – with the possible excep tion of Unclaimed Monies where a lot of people could be interested to find out if they are owed anything. • We are not the lead agency for Paid Parental Leave which may make driving change more challenging. • Employers have played a key role in PPL application with the changes this will different and IR will assist with income information. We need clear information to employers so they can provide correct information to their employees. • Although accountable for Child Support, IR may need to rely on MSD to communicate changes to their staff and customers. • IR may be reliant on other government agencies updating their systems before the benefits to customers from information sharing can be realised. • Testing solutions with customers may be challenging for customer groups such as Child Support. • Some customer groups, particularly those associated with Child Support, may be difficult to reach. • Dropping the ‘release’ terminology may cause some initial confusion with our established stakeholders and audiences, who have become familiar with the term. Page 18 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Opportunities Threats • We’ve built up good relationships with external stakeholders and have good access to third party channels for our communications. We can also use third parties as our advocates. • The upgrade to version 12 presents an opportunity to re-e ngage customers with START functionality, focusing on their needs a nd benefits as opposed to product specifications. • Mobile optimisation for e-services with v12 provides opportunity to reach customers through their preferred channels. • Child Support customers rely on advocacy groups for information. There are further opportunities to work with these groups as we did in Release 3. • The impacts of COVID-19 may make engagement more difficult and are not as yet known — but may include threats to our ability to achieve cut through and communicate effectively, or changes needed to channels as work environments change. • The version 12 upgrade, while offering benefits, is another big change for some critical stakeholders. Some customer groups, having adapted to changes in myIR from previous releases, will again face extensive changes in the user interface. • There may be added complexity where there is a requirement to reach offshore customers. • There are high levels of reputational risk associated with products in START Delivery scope. • Multiple release dates during Stage 4 - (products/legislation/optimisation) may confuse and therefore impact customers awareness, understanding, and consequently what action they may need to take. • While the ability to put all the unclaimed money we hold with a name on the website is a huge opportunity to get money back to customers, there may be questions why IR hasn’t kept the list up- to-date and made the information available sooner. Page 19 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Communications and Engagement Strategy Effective communication and engagement with a complex array of stakeholders is critical to the success of the transformation within IR, and a key construct of achieving the transformation goal of making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Stage 4 is made up of five workstreams. Workstream 1, START Product Delivery, has a critical dependency on successfully engaging external stakeholders, both existing and new. Some key considerations that shape our stakeholder engagement strategy for START Delivery are: • We know most of our stakeholders, and they know us. o In Stage 4, for the most part, we will be engaging with well-informed stakeholders, both external and internal, who are familiar with IR’s transformation objectives, the new START system and how we’ll engage with them — however, we continue to identify new and effective ways to reach them. • START Delivery affects new stakeholders, or existing stakeholders in different ways than before. o START Delivery will mean engagement with new stakeholder groups, as well as different types of engagement with current stakeholders. Effective engagement with these groups is critical. o More detail on these new stakeholders can be found in Section 7, New external stakeholders for START Delivery. • START v12 is an upgrade, not a product. o We must take a different approach to communication and engagement of an upgrade over a product, with potential to ‘relaunch’ START to both our people and customers with a focus on benefits to teams and customer groups. o We will look to empower our people to help customers with a better understanding of the system. • We have effective, well established account and relationship management teams. o Our BT Account Management team is well established and recognised at every external audit to be effective. o The BT Account Management team (comprised of Account Managers and External Relationship Managers) works collaboratively to manage engagement with external stakeholders, with a focus on groups such as professional bodies, software developers, banks and financial institutions, business organisations, Maori authorities, significant enterprises and customer advocacy groups, supporting grass roots engagement from within the organisation. More information on our account management function can be found in Section 8. Page 20 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] o BT has developed effective working relationships with customer facing teams including Community Compliance and Significant Enterprise by developing targeted webinars and supporting CCOM, their Tax Agent Network Group who manage initiatives for Tax Agents and Small Business, engaging with their Tax Agent Cohort as needed. SE Business Life Cycle managers will play an important role supporting their customer groups, specifically with the early release. • We acknowledge all the IR change our customers may be facing. o Stakeholders are increasingly not seeing a difference between transformation and the rest of IR’s activities, for example COVID-19 support, or transformation initiatives which have become business activities, for example Autocalc and Payday Filing. o Stakeholders are looking to IR to provide joined up information on what they need to know, across current and previous BT activities, and other IR activities. o Many external stakeholders have multiple, varied interactions and touchpoints with IR, and we have learned consistent information across these touchpoints is essential. • BT is an integral part of IR’s Areas of Focus teams in areas of highest risk and change impact. o We have seen great value in being part of the Areas of Focus teams which brings together IR expertise across broad areas of stakeholder engagement, for example tax agents and intermediaries, b usiness and specific products such as Investment Income. This concept, introduced under Release 3, has continued through Release 4 , led by CCS. It has proved successful to look at the bigger picture for stakeholders including, but not solely focused on, business transformation. o However, it has identified gaps in the current communication model, with BT providing proactive and reactive communications support to some external stakeholders beyond specific marketing campaigns. • We engage and collaborate with the business. o Internally, BT has created an effective method of engagement with teams, moving away from change being driven (pushed) by BT, to BT supporting the business to drive and integrate change (pulled) — for example, the Get Ready campaign promoted significant re-engagement with R4 collateral pre go-live. o START Delivery Stage 4 will see us build further on existing collaborative partnerships and develop new ones where the release touches new areas and specialist teams administering products — for example, Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Duties, NZ Foreign Trusts and Unclaimed Monies. • BT communications channels are well developed and fit for purpose. o Over the years of transformation IR has moved to more digital and diverse channels in response to changing stakeholder expectations and needs. o This has meant the pace and currency of communications has improved. With the exception of the successful webinar platform, ON24, BT ‘owns’ few channels itself, Page 21 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] but focuses on supporting others (ELT, CCS-I and CCS-B, account managers, Marketing and Communications etc) to engage with our stakeholders. • We are agile and ready to respond to legislation changes and the impacts of COVID-19. o COVID-19 affects all New Zealanders in varying ways. We do not know for certain the impacts that COVID-19 will have on our engagement strategy, but challenges could include a lower level of engagement due to changing priorities, and the need to change approach quickly if our existing engagement activities do not suit those in different working environments from before. 6.1 Communications Strategy The above considerations identify some critical elements for success for START Delivery stakeholder engagement. Our strategy is to: • Use what we know works. We will continue to develop our established engagement methodologies, relationships, processes and channels, particularly for the many stakeholder groups that are familiar with BT change. • Engage effectively with new stakeholders. We will build our understanding and adapt our approach to meet the needs of our new stakeholder groups. • Help our people be ambassadors of change. We will build a deeper understanding of the change with our people first and equipment them to help our customers. • Taking a whole of IR view when engaging with stakeholders. Acknowledging there are benefits and impacts which sit outside of BT change. • Be ready to understand, act and adapt. Environmental impacts beyond our control may affect the effectiveness of our engagement. We will be prepared to recognise these impacts, understand them and act quickly in response. 6.2 Communications Objectives Successful communications provides both a proactive strategy and reactive mitigations. At a broad level our communications objectives are: • Decision makers and influencers support the transformation and have continued confidence in IR’s ability to deliver. • Everyone impacted by START Delivery change during Stage 4, both internally and externally, knows: o What will change? o What they will need to do differently and when? o Where to get help if they have problems? • Key external and internal stakeholders feel they have been engaged and involved in transformation and understand and support the need for change. • Communications risks are identified, managed and mitigated. 6.3 Communications Principles Communications principles remain unchanged: Page 22 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Tell one IR story. • Be centred on our customers. • Be simple, open and certain. • Engage the right people with the right information at the right time. • Use plain English. • Tell our people first. Page 23 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 External Stakeholder Identification 7.1 External Stakeholder categorisation Stakeholders are categorised into four groups: • Government. • Key Influencers. • Customers. • Service Providers. Almost all of our stakeholders fall into more than one of these categories and interact with us in different ways. New stakeholder groups for Business Transformation are highlighted in red, with more information on new stakeholder groups following the table. Detailed information for each stakeholder group, existing and new, is listed in Appendix 2 – Detailed External Stakeholder Analysis. Note that more stakeholders will be added/identified once further analysis is done of the other components of Workstream 1. Figure 1: Stakeholders Page 24 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7.2 New External Stakeholders for START Delivery Included in the above categories are our new stakeholder groups for START Delivery. Earlier, we identified that focusing on understanding and meeting the needs of these groups is critical to our engagement strategy. • MSD, MBIE, DIA and Treasury. They will become partners in the change, so we’ll engage with them more closely and in different ways than we have done previously. • Those paying or receiving Child Support and/or involved in the child support process. \[Information redacted\] • Existing PPL applicants (those who have applied and/or are receiving payments), there will be changes to how they can manage their PPL. In addition, there will be general information for anyone looking to apply indicating changes will come in from Stage 4. For employers, they will no longer need to verify the customer income in the application, this will be done using the employment information they have provided through the employment information filed to IR. High value stakeholders involved with NZ Foreign Trusts. This small but influential stakeholder group includes DIA, the NZ Financial Intelligence Unit (part of the New Zealand Police) and foreign trust and company service providers. \[Information redacted\] • New stakeholder groups affected by changes to Duties, including the New Zealand Lotteries Commission, the Racing Industry Transition Agency (formerly NZ Racing Board) and casinos. The main change for this audience is moving to more digitised processes. • New stakeholder groups affected by changes to Unclaimed Monies. This group includes Treasury, Public Trust, government agencies and financial institutions. The main change for these stakeholders is the move to more digitised processes, and legislative change, including when money is considered unclaimed. There will also be changes for the wider public as Unclaimed Monies are made more discoverable and making the claiming process easier for people. Page 25 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 External Stakeholder Engagement Inland Revenue interacts with external stakeholders on many levels through its day-to-day activities, as taxpayers, employers, partners, suppliers, as part of industry groups and as a result of the changes being delivered as part of the Business Transformation programme. From the beginning of the Business Transformation programme, we have adopted an open and transparent approach to engaging and communicating with our stakeholders, including our customers. This principle will continue in Stage 4. 8.1 Stage 4 START Delivery Customer Impacts The Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery suggests the following levels of impact for our customers. Areas of medium and high impact are highlighted in amber and red. Figure 2: Preliminary Customer Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery 8.2 BT Account Management For Stage 4, BT Communications will continue to work with the BT Account Management team (which includes members of the External Relationships team), Product Owners, Community Compliance, with International Revenue Strategy and the Families Segment where appropriate to manage engagement with impacted external stakeholders. The BT Account Management team is the primary conduit for managing external customer and stakeholder relationships and will continue to be accountable for external engagement across IR’s customer segments for Business Transformation’s Stage 4. This is done by establishing and maintaining successful engagements with customers (and/or their advocacy groups) who are impacted by IR’s transformation and by providing a channel for their feedback directly to the programme. Page 26 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Account Management team aims to: • Through a thorough understanding of the customers assist their understanding and engagement with IR’s transformation objectives and explore how they will be impacted. • Engage, advise and support customers when BT changes impact them. • Ensure the customer voice is heard when design/solutions are being considered. • Provide feedback within BT on customers’ issues and concerns with change driven by BT. • Work alongside our customers and the programme teams to stay on track to deliver the outcomes we have agreed. • Work alongside teams within BT and across the business to support customers impacted by BT changes and to make sure the right transformation messages are shared across all customer segments. BT Account Management are an integral part of Area of Focus teams and work closely with the business (Community Compliance Officers and Account Managers, Business Lifecycle Managers, the External Relationships unit and other business units within IR) and within the BT Programme, to make sure: • Operational teams have the right transformation messages to share with customers. • The business is supported. 8.3 Role of BT Communications 8.3.1 Informing Communications and Stakeholder Engagement activity All BT Communications and Stakeholder engagement activities will take advice and input from the BT Policy team in terms of what can be said and when, along with Product Owners, to ensure messaging is accurate and appropriate to the audience. BT activities will supplement, but not replace, ‘business as usual’ activities. The monthly external stakeholder management meeting to monitor customer readiness, led by BT Account Management and attended by product owners, digital leads, Community Compliance, customer change, Marketing and BT communications will continue throughout Stage 4. 8.3.2 Working with IR Marketing and Communications A Customer, Stakeholder and Marketing Plan for START Delivery Stage 4 will be developed in collaboration with the Marketing and Communications team. This will include an update to the stakeholder plan in line with the second, more detailed impact assessment. Messaging from this will be woven into the overall stakeholder and engagement communications activity and will inform the messaging for all customer groups. In the meantime, the Marketing, BT Communications and Account Management teams will work closely to start building the Stage 4 narrative and agree a timeline of messages appropriate for each audience. 8.3.1 Supporting Account Management The BT Communications and Engagement team will work closely with the BT Account Management team to maintain a schedule of planned engagement, develop core messages and information to provide a basis for Stage 4 communications, and presentation material to Page 27 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] support those engagements, and support them with their Stage 4 related communication needs. The weekly communications meeting between BT Account Management, Communications and Marketing and the Change Team will continue through Stage 4. 8.3.2 Supporting other key Stakeholder Groups The BT Communications team also has responsibility for supporting communications for other key stakeholder groups: • Ministerial and Government (in conjunction with the BT Business Case team) Supporting messaging to ensure Ministers have trust and confidence in IR’s ability to deliver business transformation, are supportive of the programme approach and understand how it links to cross-government initiatives such as the Business Growth Agenda. • Other key partners and stakeholders Tax intermediaries, government agencies with whom we share information, banks and software developers will continue to be key groups for IR to engage with as we move into our final phase of transformation. Page 28 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 Internal Stakeholder categorisation 9.1 Internal Stakeholder categorisation Internally, our stakeholders are categorised below. Detailed information can be found in Appendix 3 - Detailed Internal Stakeholder Analysis. • Decision-makers: Executive Leadership Team, members of boards, governance and reference groups. • Influencers: IR people (mainly leaders) whose opinion and positive perception of the programme will contribute to its success. • Senior leaders (tiers 3 and 4): broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS- B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). • Team leaders and group leads: broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS- B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). • Our people: broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS-B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). O f particular note are: o The Families Segment (particularly Child Support teams which are located in ten regions, and the Families Segment Leadership Team) and the Paid Parental Leave team (currently in the Individuals Segment and moving into the Families segment mid 2020). o People in the International Revenue Strategy team who manage NZ Foreign Trusts. o Individuals Segment (particularly the Transactional teams in Upper Hutt who manage unclaimed monies and duties) and the Contact Centre. o Community Compliance who manage front-of -house and account manage tax agents. Note that the Child Support and Paid Parental Leave teams’ unique role, needs and values need to be well understood by the BT team when planning and delivering communications. • Key users. • Unions. • BT Team. Page 29 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 Internal Stakeholder Engagement Inland Revenue is made up of approximately 5,500 people in 17 locations across New Zealand. A significant proportion are customer-facing teams including people who complete tax- technical, tax-policy and back office functions. Many of these people have been directly touched by the changes delivered through BT with all people at IR impacted in some way by IR’s broader transformation goals. Through previous releases, BT has created an effective method of engagement with teams, moving away from change being driven (pushed) by BT to BT supporting the business to drive and integrate change (pulled). Stage 4 will see us build on the existing collaborative partnerships we have with internal teams and will see us develop new partnerships with specialist teams administering products in Workstream 1A (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Duties, Foreign Trust and Unclaimed monies). The proven success of internal communications tactics used in previous releases will be used again where appropriate, for example where the change is wide-ranging and touches multiple audiences across the business such as for the START v12 upgrade. BT communications shares information with IR audiences through several channels it manages directly. In addition to providing content through existing channels, with the products impacting smaller, specialist teams, there is an opportunity to be more targeted in Stage 4 including utilising key users, specific group and team leaders, segment newsletters and TEAMS sites. We will also seek to make the most of our new technology to engage people via digital channels to negate the need for large scale events and travel. 10.1 Stage 4 START Delivery Organisation Impacts The Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery suggests the following levels of impact for our customers. Areas of medium and high impact are highlighted in amber and red. Page 30 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 3: Preliminary Organisation Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery 10.2 Approach In Stage 4, even more so than in previous stages and releases, though with some exceptions, we are dealing with well-informed internal stakeholders who understand the strategic priorities of transformation, and who have become accustomed to both the volume of change and the processes involved in changes that affect the ways they work. Key aspects of our communications are: • Under the principle of right information to the right people at the right time, we will inform our people of the changes and what they mean to them, with particular focus on go-live readiness for directly impacted teams. • We will continue to work to establish a pull model of change management, delivering change in partnership with the business (a co-change approach). We will work alongside customer facing teams and their leaders to engage them in what the changes will mean for them and their customers. • We will provide support to the Product Owners, Channel Owners and Business Transformation Managers linked with our internal stakeholder groups and will actively identify and support advocates to help us tell our story internally. • In collaboration with People and Culture, we will also continue to build and nurture a strong relationship with unions through established channels, reviewing these as necessary to ensure they continue to meet transformation and union objectives. Page 31 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.3 Relationship with Unions The Transformation Programme continues to build and nurture a strong relationship with unions, in collaboration with People and Culture, who are responsible for IR’s overall union relationship strategy. Unions will be managed with the support of BT Communications. The BT relationship owner will be the Stage 4 START Delivery OCMT lead. We will continue to build upon this relationship through established channels, reviewing these as necessary to ensure they continue to meet transformation and union objectives. Engagement to date has included monthly teleconferences, hosting quarterly and six-monthly events, and our attendance at national union meetings, as well as specialised involvement such as weekly teleconferences with nominated members during Early Life Support. Further details will be available in the planning documents for each workstream. Page 32 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 Measurement It is essential that we measure what we do and set targets for the future, giving us the ability to actively adapt plans in response. Our communications objectives, as set out in Section 6: Communications and Engagement Strategy, a re listed below, with measurements associated with each: Communications objective Measurement Decision makers and influencers understand the rationale for and support the transformation and have confidence in IR’s ability to deliver. • Feedback from governance groups and Ministers. • Media measures, including articles and opinion pieces from IR experts and identified business and media influencers and commentators. • Feedback from internal key influencers group. Everyone impacted by Stage 4 changes, both internally and externally, knows: • What will change? • What they will need to do differently and when? • The benefits delivered in this phase of change • Where to get help if they have problems? • Customer readiness surveys. • Data and statistics on customers carrying out tasks they need to do before go-live, calls to contact centres, visits to customer-facing offices. • Questions asked and answered through webinars and other engagements. • Business and people readiness survey.
