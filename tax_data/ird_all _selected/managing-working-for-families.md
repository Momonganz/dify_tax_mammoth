To do this, we need you to check that the information we have is correct, and keep us up to date with any changes to your family circumstances.

Because the amount we pay you depends on the information you provide, you could be underpaid, or overpaid if we don’t have the right information.

You don’t need to tell us about every family milestone like first words or first football goals.

You just need to tell us when your family income changes, or your family circumstances change, so we can make sure you’re getting paid the correct amount.

We need to know about increases and decreases in income, changes in hours of work, if you start or stop earning self-employed income, changes in child support, benefits, pensions, ACC and any changes to your student allowance.

We also need to know if your family circumstances change.

Please tell us if your spouse or partner moves in or out, you start looking after a child, a child leaves your care, or your shared care arrangements change.

We also need to know if you move to a new address, or change your contact details.
