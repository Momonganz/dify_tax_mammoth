Reporting entity

Inland Revenue is a government department as defined by section 2 of the Public Finance Act 1989 and is domiciled and operates in New Zealand.

The relevant legislation governing Inland Revenue's operations is the Public Finance Act 1989.

Inland Revenue is a wholly owned entity of the Crown whose primary objective is to provide services to the public rather than to make a financial return. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has designated itself as a Public Benefit Entity (PBE) for financial reporting purposes.

These non-departmental financial schedules present financial information on funds managed by Inland Revenue on behalf of the Crown.

These non-departmental balances are consolidated into the Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2022. For a full understanding of the Crown's financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year, refer to the consolidated 'Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ended 30 June 2022'.

Reporting period

The reporting period for these financial schedules is for the year ended 30 June 2022. The forecast financial schedules are for the year ending 30 June 2023.

The Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue authorised these financial schedules on 29 September 2022.

Statement of compliance

The financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989, which includes the requirement to comply with New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (NZ GAAP) and the Treasury instructions.

Inland Revenue has applied the Tier 1 Public Benefit Entity International Public Sector Accounting Standards (PBE IPSAS) in preparing the 30 June 2022 financial schedules.

Basis of preparation

The financial schedules have been prepared on a going concern basis, and the accounting policies set out below, and in the notes to the financial schedules, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial schedules.

These financial schedules have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated. The accrual basis of accounting has been used.

Functional and presentation currency

These financial schedules are presented in New Zealand dollars, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($000). The functional currency of Inland Revenue is New Zealand dollars.

Accounting standard issued and not yet effective

The standard issued but not yet effective, and that has not been adopted early, is:

### PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments

The External Reporting Board issued PBE IPSAS 41 Financial Instruments in March 2019. This standard supersedes PBE IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which was issued as an interim standard. It is effective for reporting periods ending on or before 30 June 2023. Inland Revenue does not intend to adopt PBE IPSAS 41 early. When this standard is adopted, Inland Revenue does not expect any significant changes as the requirements are similar to PBE IFRS 9.

Estimations and judgements

In preparing these financial schedules, judgements, estimates and assumptions have been made concerning the future.

These judgements, estimates and their associated assumptions may differ from the subsequent actual results. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on experience, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and other factors. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to revenue, and the carrying amounts of receivables and payables within the next financial year, are referred to in the notes. The impact of COVID-19 on estimates and assumptions is also discussed in these notes.

Accounting policies

Significant accounting policies are included in the notes to which they relate. Significant accounting policies that do not relate to a specific note, and which materially affect the measurement of financial results and the financial position, are outlined below.

Expenses

Expenses are recognised in the period to which they relate.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in transit and funds held in bank accounts administered by Inland Revenue. All cash is on demand and no interest is payable to Inland Revenue.

Comparatives

When the presentation or classification of items in the financial schedules are amended or accounting policies are changed, comparative figures are restated to ensure consistency with the current period, unless it is impractical to do so.

Change in accounting policies

There have been no changes in accounting policies since the date of the last audited financial schedules.

All accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.

Budget and forecast figures

The budget, revised budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing these financial schedules.

The budget and forecast financial schedules are not subject to audit.

The budget figures for 2021–22 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2022.

The revised budget figures for 2021–22 (refer to the 'Statement of non-departmental budgeted and actual expenditure incurred against appropriations') are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2022.

The forecast figures for 2022–23 are those included in The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2023.

The forecast financial schedules have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Public Finance Act 1989 to communicate forecast financial information for accountability purposes. They are compliant with PBE Financial Reporting Standard 42 Prospective Financial Statements.

Forecast policies

The forecasts have been compiled on the basis of existing government policies and ministerial expectations at the time the schedules were finalised and reflect all Government decisions up to 11 April 2022.

While Inland Revenue regularly updates forecasts, updated forecast schedules for the year ending 30 June 2023 will not be published.

The main assumptions are:

*   Estimates for COVID-19 economic impacts and the Government's COVID-19 economic response packages, including:
    *   the reinstatement of a 2% diminishing value depreciation rate for commercial and industrial buildings
    *   increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 for the 2020–21 income tax year
    *   Small Business Cashflow Scheme lending and associated initial fair value write-down.
*   Tax revenue: tax policy changes enacted and announced by the Government will take place as planned and will affect tax revenue and receipts as calculated and agreed between Inland Revenue and the Treasury.
*   Student loans: the fair value of student loans is based on a valuation model adapted to reflect current student loans policy. As such, the fair value over the forecast period is sensitive to changes in a number of underlying assumptions, including future income levels, repayment behaviour and macroeconomic factors such as wages inflation and discount rates. Any change in these assumptions would affect the present fiscal forecast.
*   Estimated year-end information for 2021–22 is used as the opening position for the 2022–23 forecasts.

For other key fiscal forecast assumptions, refer to the 'Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2022'.
