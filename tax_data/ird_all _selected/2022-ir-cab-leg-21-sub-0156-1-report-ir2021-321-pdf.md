This report seeks your agreement to amend by Order in Council the commencement dates for recent child support amendments to align with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START. Background 2. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (CSAA) was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its purpose was to make amendments to further improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system. 3. When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s new system (START) in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many the proposals in the CSAA were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council. Proposal 4. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme will need to be amended. Officials recommend that generally the dates be amended to 26 October 2021 to align with the move. However, for provisions relating to penalty changes, such as the introduction of the grace period, it is preferable that they apply from the beginning of a month. Officials therefore propose such provisions apply from 1 November 2021. The affected sections and the commencement date for each are listed in Appendix A to this report. 5. Provisions relating to the annual assessment of child support, such as the changes to what is included as income, will apply from 1 April 2022 being the start of the next child support year. Consultation 6. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 7. If you agree to the date changes, officials will draft a Cabinet Legislative Committee paper for your consideration and submission to the Cabinet Office.
