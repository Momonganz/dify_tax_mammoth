Are you an employer? If you make contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver account, you’ll need to pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). ESCT is a tax deducted from the employer contributions you pay into the employee’s KiwiSaver account.

Employer contributions are compulsory, and the minimum amount you need to pay is 3% of the employee’s gross salary or wage.

You pay ESCT to Inland Revenue along with your PAYE and other employer deductions.

ESCT is also paid on employer contributions to superannuation schemes other than KiwiSaver. Inland Revenue’s website has more information about these other schemes.

Jennie has both full time and part time employees who earn different salaries. This means they each get their own ESCT rate.

Let’s see how Jennie calculates Daniel’s ESCT every payday.

Daniel’s salary for the week is $1,250. That means Jennie’s employer contribution is $37.50. ESCT is a tax on the employer contribution. For the purpose of calculating ESCT, you use whole dollars only. Jennie removes the cents and applies Daniel’s ESCT rate of 30%.

She must pay ESCT of $11.10.

Jennie needs to calculate one more figure: the net employer contribution. That’s easy. All she does is deduct the ESCT from the employer contribution including the cents.

Jennie must include both figures in her employment information return.
