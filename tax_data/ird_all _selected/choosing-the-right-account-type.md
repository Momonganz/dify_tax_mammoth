Te kōwhiri i te momo pūkete tika Choosing the right account type
================================================================

When you make a payment to us you'll need to use your IRD number as a reference. You'll also need to use a payee code showing us which tax type the payment is for.

If you're making a payment for an approved instalment arrangement you'll need to use the reference code from your acceptance letter. Every instalment arrangement has its own reference code so that your payments go to the right debt.
