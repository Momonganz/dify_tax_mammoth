OB 1 for Part N–Tax collection rules 222 Whether sufficient interest (3) In determining whether a person has a sufficient interest in a company at the time, a consolidated group is treated as if it were a single company.

Maximum reduction (2) The nominated company may notify the Commissioner within the time for payment to the Commissioner set out in section NA 15(3)(c) (Payment dates for interim and other tax payments) that it chooses to use the net loss, so far as it extends, to pay some or all of the payment.

Treatment of excess (3) If subsection (2) does not apply to some or all of the payment because it is more than the applicable credit balance, the amount in excess is credited to a payment for a foreign dividend that is payable by the company for a tax year in which it is part of the group. Earlier refunds of payments (4) The credit balance referred to in subsection (3) is treated as reduced by an earlier refund of a payment for a foreign dividend that is made in the tax year to the OB 1 for Part N–Tax collection rules 224 company, or to another company that is part of the same group at the time the dividend is paid or for the income year in which the refund is made.

Applying for refund (2) The company may apply to the Commissioner for a refund of the payment. The maximum refund is the smallest of the following amounts: (a) the amount of the payment paid in the income year: (b) the amount of the net loss referred to in subsection (1)(b) multiplied by the rate set out in subsection (4)(b): (c) the credit balance of the group’s FDP account at the end of the tax year just ended. OB 1 for Part N–Tax collection rules 225 Net loss reduced (3) The amount of the net loss is reduced by an amount calculated using the formula— amount of refund rate.

Section NA 19: amalgamations (6) Section NA 19 (Refunds of excess amounts or when amounts mistakenly paid) applies, modified as necessary, from the time of amalgamation when a OB 1 for Part N–Tax collection rules 227 consolidated group ends its existence on a qualifying amalgamation that involves all members of the consolidated group, whether or not with a company outside the group, in relation to tax paid by the consolidated group as if it and the amalgamated company were a single company. Sections 30 and 68 of Tax Administration Act 1994: FDP accounts (7) Sections 30 and 68 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply, modified as necessary, in relation to a consolidated group as if a reference to an FDP account company were a reference to a company that is part of a consolidated group that maintains an FDP account.
