Te maraurau AIM me ngā whakaritenga pūmanawa AIM eligibility and software requirements
======================================================================================

Business rules for AIM eligibility
----------------------------------

The following rules apply when using the return service.

*   The customer must not be part of a group excluded from using AIM, for example partnerships, Maori authorities, super funds and look-through companies.
*   The customer must be active.
*   The customer must not be a member of an income tax consolidated group.
*   The tax year the customer wants to use AIM is not a transitional year, for example they have not changed their balance date in that year.

AIM-capable software requirements
---------------------------------

AIM works on a self-certification model. A software system must meet the proposed definition of an AIM-capable accounting system contained in [section RC 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2017/0003/latest/DLM6912493.html)
 in order to gain approval from the Commissioner.

### Definition in legislation

To meet the definition and be approved as an AIM-capable accounting system, the core software accounting package must have the ability to:

*   generate and keep comprehensive financial accounts, including accounting income and expenditure, ledger accounts, trial balances, bank account reconciliations and journals on an on-demand basis, in accordance with good accounting and tax practices
*   calculate tax liabilities using tax adjustments in accordance with the technical determination
*   for tax adjustments not included in the determinations, ensure they reasonably accurately assess tax liabilities
*   recalculate all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports as required by the Commissioner and e-communicate electronically with Inland Revenue and provide the right level of help and assistance to its users.

### Client intermediation

The linking and delinking of a client by their tax agent is excluded from the scope of gateway services. This can be done in myIR Secure Online Services.

### Year to date calculations

AIM payments are based on a year to date calculation. Software must be able to work out all financial accounts and liabilities retrospectively and produce reports. This allows for errors to be corrected easily.

### Working out AIM adjustments

Your software needs to incorporate end of year adjustments throughout the year to more accurately reflect taxable income.

Read our determinations for the minimum adjustments required:

### Statements of activity

Software will need to send us information with each payment that shows how it came to this amount. This is a statement of activity and is not treated as an income tax return. Indicative technical schemata for statements of activity are available on GitHub.
