DRAFT LEGISLATION iv CONTENTS PART ONE CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 1.1 Purpose of the Discussion Document The Companies Bill was introduced into Parliament in 1990. After consideration by the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee the Bill was reported back to Parliament on 15 December 1992. The resulting Act, the Companies Act 1993, was enacted by Parliament in September 1993, and is scheduled to come into effect on 1 July 1994, together with other ancillary measures forming the company law reform package. This discussion document assesses the implications of company law changes for income tax rules in the various Revenue Acts, in particular the Income Tax Act 1976. The purpose of this document is to put the Government's perspective on the issues before the taxpaying community as part of the process of undertaking widespread consultation on tax policy changes. The Government seeks to ensure that the reasons for tax policy changes are well understood and that, before they become law, tax policy changes are properly worked through with those in the private sector who will operate under them. 1.2 Submissions Submissions are invited on the various proposals. They should be addressed to: The Director Legislative Affairs Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Submissions should be made by 21 February 1994. They should contain a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. Following a full and thorough consideration of submissions by the Government, legislation to amend the various Revenue Acts to accommodate the new companies regime will be introduced into Parliament. The legislation will be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee of the House of Representatives. There will be a full opportunity for interested parties to make submissions on the legislation during the Select Committee process. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 1 1.3 Background The major income tax implications of recent company law reforms relate to: • provisions in company law that allow a company to purchase its own shares; • company amalgamations and their treatment for tax purposes; • tax accounting procedures for existing companies when they register under the new companies regime; • the implications of the repeal of the notions of "par value" and "nominal capital", and "share premium"; • miscellaneous changes to the Income Tax Act where existing concepts and terminology will be redundant or are to be modified by the new companies regime. (For example, the new Companies Act does not retain the current distinction between public and private companies.) 1.4 Objective and Scope of this Review The objective of this review is to revise those aspects of taxation law that require amendment because of the linkages between company and taxation law. The review is not a complete revision of company taxation. The Government desires to see taxation law integrate well with revised company law rules. While there is no desire to see taxation provisions inhibit the willingness of companies to take advantage of any increased flexibility that company law changes may confer, the need to maintain the integrity of the tax base must be given due weight. It is unrealistic to assume that because company law changes may increase the ability of companies to restructure or return funds to shareholders, tax imposts on such activities should be removed. Tax rules must be designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the competing considerations of maximising commercial activity and maintaining robust and fair taxation rules. Furthermore, the Government seeks rules that provide certainty and that impose as few as possible compliance costs on taxpayers in their day to day operations. Existing tax rules which govern company distributions have also been reviewed. There are significant weaknesses in existing rules designed to prevent companies substituting tax-free distributions of subscribed capital for taxable distributions when shares are redeemed or cancelled by an on-going company. The current anti-dividend substitution rules are set out in section 4A(1)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act. Weaknesses include: 2 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW • The uncertain nature of existing rules. There is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances in which existing anti-dividend substitution rules apply and the exact meaning of the words used in the provisions. Consequently, the rules are difficult to apply in practice. • Inadequate marshalling rules. Existing rules provide opportunities for companies to attribute the entire amount of a distribution to tax-free reserves even though taxable reserves remain in the company. This effectively allows tax-free reserves to be distributed first. These weaknesses would be aggravated by the greater ease with which shareholders will be able to access the capital of a company under the new Companies Act. In addition, existing rules aimed at preventing reserves that are taxable on distribution from being converted into tax-free reserves through share for share transactions are not completely effective. These rules include the restrictive definition of "qualifying share premium". In order to address the weaknesses of the existing rules, this discussion document proposes new rules that: • define clearly when distributions made by way of share repurchases, cancellations or redemptions are deemed to be dividends; • modify the averaging formula that defines the portion of a distribution that is tax-free on the repurchase or redemption of shares, or liquidation of a company; • define additions to subscribed capital where shares are issued either: - directly or indirectly in consideration for the acquisition of shares in another company; or - in circumstances where the subscription for that issue is funded by the payment of tax-free inter-corporate dividends by the issuing company. The background to these proposals is described in more detail later in this report. 1.5 Outline of the Document This document is set out in two parts. Part One comprises five chapters and details the major tax implications of company law changes and proposed tax policy responses. Part Two contains draft legislation and explanatory notes to the legislation. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 3 An overview of the significant implications of proposed changes to companies legislation on current tax rules is outlined below. The issues are discussed in more depth in succeeding chapters. 1.5.1 Share Repurchases and Related Issues (Chapter 2) From a tax perspective, proposed changes to company law will have their most significant impact on the tax treatment of company distributions. A key change is that companies will be able to purchase their own shares. Sections 58 to 67 of the new Companies Act provide that a company may purchase its own shares subject to: • the company's constitution containing a power to repurchase; • the solvency test; • the repurchase being fair and reasonable to the company and its shareholders; • no material information being withheld from shareholders; • shareholders receiving advance advice of the repurchase (with an exception for small repurchases made on the stock exchange). Repurchases can be initiated by the company only if the repurchase is made on: • a pro rata basis, that is, an offer is made to all shareholders to acquire a proportion of the shares that would, if accepted, leave unaffected relative voting and distribution rights (section 60(1)(a) of the new Companies Act); or • a selective basis, that is, an offer is made selectively to one or more shareholders to acquire shares (section 60(1)(b) of the new Companies Act); or • a stock exchange, so giving all shareholders the same opportunity to sell some or all of their shares (sections 63 and 65 of the new Companies Act). In all cases, shares are cancelled upon repurchase. A company may repurchase on the stock exchange, without prior notice to its shareholders, up to 5 percent of its shares in any 12-month period. However, it must advise its shareholders of any such repurchase within 10 working days of the repurchase occurring. A share repurchase may also be initiated by a shareholder under the buy-out of minority shareholder provisions in section 110 of the new Companies Act. A shareholder can require the company to repurchase his or her shares if: 4 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW • The shareholder casts all his or her votes against a resolution (passed by other shareholders) to: - adopt or revoke the company's constitution; - alter the company's constitution to impose or remove a restriction on the activities of the company; - approve a major transaction (defined in section 129 of the new Companies Act); - approve an amalgamation; or • The shareholder does not sign a shareholders' resolution made in accordance with section 122 of the new Companies Act. Such a resolution must be signed by at least 75 percent of the company's shareholders representing at least 75 percent of votes entitled to be cast on that resolution. A company may arrange for the shares it is required to repurchase to be acquired by another party. The basic issues with respect to the tax treatment of share repurchases discussed in Chapter 2 are: • determining the reserves from which tax-free distributions resulting from share repurchases can be funded (referred to as "tax-free reserves"); • determining when distributions by way of repurchases can be attributed to tax-free reserves; • the mechanism for taxing the dividend component of share repurchases. At present companies are able to cancel their own shares, subject to High Court approval, or, in the case of redeemable preference shares, redeem their own shares. However, the new Companies Act provides greater scope for companies to provide a cash return to shareholders in a form other than an ordinary dividend. This follows from the relaxation of the constraints on share repurchases or cancellations and the removal of the current company law requirement to distinguish between reserves that consist of subscribed capital and other reserves. 1.5.2 Amalgamations (Chapter 3) The new Companies Act provides that two or more companies may amalgamate and continue as one company, which may be one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. Broadly, the procedure to amalgamate requires CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 5 the consent of the boards and shareholders of each amalgamating company; there is no court involvement. The consent by shareholders must be by way of special resolution and the amalgamated company must satisfy the solvency test immediately after amalgamation. A short-form amalgamation procedure is provided under section 222 of the new Companies Act for a wholly-owned subsidiary that amalgamates with a parent or two wholly-owned subsidiaries that amalgamate. Under the short-form procedure, an amalgamation may be approved solely by the boards of each amalgamating company agreeing to the amalgamation, provided that the solvency test is still met. Following approvals, an amalgamation proposal is registered with the Registrar of Companies, who thereupon issues an amalgamation certificate. The certificate specifies the effective date of amalgamation. The new Companies Act provides that all assets and liabilities of the amalgamating companies are vested in the amalgamated company. However, shareholders of amalgamating companies must agree to the terms of the amalgamation, and shares and rights of shareholders in amalgamating companies are not necessarily converted into shares and rights in the amalgamated company. Where one amalgamating company holds shares in another amalgamating company, those shares must be cancelled for no payment when amalgamation becomes effective. Under current tax law, there are full tax consequences on the transfer of assets from the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, and on the exchange of shares in the amalgamating companies for shares in the amalgamated company, where those are held on revenue account. Tax losses and imputation credits are generally extinguished. These consequences follow from an amalgamation being treated in substantially the same manner as a liquidation. Under the new rules proposed in Chapter 3, amalgamating companies would be able to utilise tax-free asset transfer rules based on the existing consolidation regime. The tax losses and imputation credits of the amalgamating companies will be able to be retained, subject to shareholder continuity and commonality tests being met. Dispositions of shares occurring under an amalgamation would continue to be assessable to revenue account shareholders. 1.5.3 Tax Accounting Issues (Chapter 4) Treatment of Reserves Company law reform will remove the concepts of "par value", "nominal capital" and "share premium" on which existing tax law relies. As a result, it is proposed that tax rules be amended to focus on subscribed capital (consisting of the sum of what is now paid-up capital and qualifying share premium). When existing 6 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW companies register under the new companies regime, it will be necessary to convert reserve accounts for tax purposes into a form appropriate to the new regime. The treatment in this context of paid-up capital, including bonus issues, share premium and capital redemption reserves, is covered in Chapter 4. Also considered in Chapter 4 is the carry over into the amended dividend definition applying after the enactment of company law reform of an equivalent of the concept of "qualifying share premium". Existing rules limit the range of share premium eligible for tax-free distribution to "qualifying share premium". This limitation is aimed at preventing companies from creating, via share swaps, share premium reserves on take-overs or mergers from which tax-free distributions can be made. Tax accounting issues relating to amalgamation are also addressed, as is the extent to which subscribed capital can be derived directly or indirectly from exempt inter-corporate dividends. Recovery of Excess Distributions The new Companies Act provides in section 56 for a company to recover distributions made to shareholders where such distributions breach the solvency test. The recovery of distributions from shareholders is likely to be a rare event, since repayment by the shareholder would not be required if the unauthorised dividend was received in good faith, and it would be unfair to require repayment having regard to the altered circumstances of the shareholder. The discussion document outlines how current income tax rules will need to be amended in order to cater for situations where taxable distributions are later returned to a company. 1.5.4 Miscellaneous Issues (Chapter 5) In addition to the issues outlined above, there are also a number of consequential changes to the Income Tax Act resulting from terminology changes in company law. A number of the existing definitions, largely relating to defining a shareholder's interest in a company, rely on the concepts of nominal and paid-up capital that, as previously noted, will have no relevance under the new companies regime. Also, the removal of the private/public company distinction means that changes will be necessary to those provisions of the Income Tax Act that rely on the definition of "private" and "public" companies. CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW 7 8 CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 2.1 Background The new Companies Act treats share repurchases as a distribution. When making a distribution under the new Companies Act a company is subject only to restrictions in the company's constitution and to satisfying the solvency test in section 4 of the Act. The term "distribution" is defined widely in section 2 of the Act to mean: "(a) the direct or indirect transfer of money or property, other than the company's own shares, to or for the benefit of \[a\] shareholder; or (b) the incurring of a debt to or for the benefit of \[a\] shareholder; in relation to shares held by that shareholder, and whether by means of a purchase of property, the redemption or other acquisition of shares, a distribution of indebtedness, or by some other means." There is no longer a restriction as to the fund or reserve out of which a distribution can be made. A distribution can now be made out of capital. The definition of a distribution recognises that, regardless of its form, a distribution by a company reduces the cushion of reserves available to creditors. The new Companies Act distinguishes between distributions in the form of "dividends" and other distributions, such as share repurchases and certain redemptions, because the administrative rules governing the payment of dividends differ in detail from those that govern other forms of distribution. However, the economic equivalence of all forms of distribution made by an on-going company is recognised so that all distributions, whatever their form, are subject to the same solvency test. 2.2 General Considerations Share repurchases as provided for in the new Companies Act are not contemplated under existing tax rules. The closest existing analogy to a share repurchase is a share cancellation. Both reduce the capital of the company. Until such time as a company is registered under the new Companies Act, if it wishes to reduce its capital it will only be able to cancel shares. Accordingly, the treatment applied to cancellations should, as far as possible, parallel the tax treatment of repurchases. The Valabh Committee considered the appropriate treatment of share repurchases in its two reports on The Taxation of Distributions From Companies, released in November 1990 and July 1991. The Committee proposed a CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 9 mechanism by which the dividend component of share repurchases could be subject to tax. A number of submissions to that Committee argued that, except in certain circumstances, a repurchase should be treated in the same way as a sale of shares to a third party. That is, no tax consequences should arise if the shares repurchased were on capital account. Furthermore, submissions argued that to tax the dividend component of a share repurchase would mean that it would never be prudent for a company to repurchase its shares because it would have to pay a premium on the market price. This was seen as undermining the objectives of proposed company law reform. The Valabh Committee considered these objections but maintained its earlier view that there is little difference in principle between the distribution of retained earnings as an ordinary dividend and the distribution of retained earnings by way of a share repurchase by a company. The effect on the company's retained earnings and shareholders' total wealth is the same in each situation. It logically follows that the overall tax consequences of each type of distribution should be identical. If this were not the case there would be an incentive for companies to characterise dividends as share repurchases (Valabh Committee (1991) p33). The Valabh Committee also rejected the argument that treating share repurchases and other distributions in a consistent manner would undermine company law reform. As the Committee noted, this is no more true than to say that taxation of ordinary dividends undermines company law provisions allowing the payment of such dividends (ibid, p33). The Government agrees with the Valabh Committee's general conclusions. There are three key questions to consider, however: • What part of the repurchase proceeds should be tax-free in the hands of the shareholder? In particular, should distributions funded from capital profits be tax-free when made through repurchases? • What ordering rule is to be used to determine the portion of the amount paid on the repurchase of shares that is tax-free? • What is the most appropriate mechanism for taxing the dividend component of amounts distributed through a repurchase? These issues are discussed below. 10 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 2.3 Current Rules For Taxing Share Cancellations 2.3.1 The Current Rules Under current income tax law: • A payment made to shareholders on cancellation of a share during the life of a company is taxable unless it represents a return of capital. • Cancellation payments funded from a company's capital gains are taxable (except on a full liquidation). This is consistent with the rules for dividends generally. Dividends funded from capital gains are taxable. • Rules apply to determine the contributed capital amount and qualifying share premium amount per share. This is the amount that can be returned tax-free. Where the company is being liquidated, capital profits can also be distributed tax-free. The formulae for determining these tax-free components are outlined in Annex 2.1. • Rules also apply to determine when a distribution is in substitution for a dividend, in which case the full amount is taxable. These rules are contained in section 4A(1)(c)(ii) of the Income Tax Act. Dividends are easily distinguished conceptually from a return of subscribed capital from a company to its shareholders. They are normally seen as a distribution of the profits of the enterprise to its owners. In a perfectly operating company tax system, imputation credits equivalent to full company tax would be attached to dividends. By contrast, a return of subscribed capital would be expected to be an unusual one-off event reflecting a distinct feature of a company at any point in time. To the extent that a company distribution to a shareholder consists merely of a return of the shareholder's investment, the distribution should not constitute a taxable dividend. While it is conceptually clear, there are difficulties in applying this "in principle" distinction in the operating commercial environment. First, the funds actually held by the company are not necessarily equal to the amount an individual shareholder has invested. Many shares are likely to have been purchased on the secondary market at a price different from their issue price. With bonds, this issue is dealt with by taxing as income any gain made by the holder on the bond. However, the same treatment applied to shares would result in the taxation of gains on shares held on capital account. The approach adopted for shares therefore is to treat as a return of capital the amount invested in a company with respect to those shares by the original shareholder. Under existing law this amount is paid-up capital for tax purposes. When company law reforms become effective, it will be subscribed capital. The concept of subscribed capital is considered in more detail in Chapter 4. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 11 Second, it is not uncommon for companies to issue bonus shares in lieu of dividends, or periodically seek new capital by offering new shares to existing shareholders. As the issue price of the new shares usually varies from the price of the initial shares, shares of the same class represent differing levels of investment in the company. Companies do not necessarily keep records tracing the issue price of specific shares. Thus, tax rules apply an averaging formula to compute the amount of capital attributable to shares in a class. Third, allowing companies to determine the source of the distribution without constraint (other than in the course of a liquidation) would seriously undermine the dividend tax base since it would allow companies to substitute distributions funded from tax-free sources for taxable distributions of retained earnings. Consequently, the current rules identify the order in which the funds are sourced. Any amount over and above paid-up capital is deemed to be a distribution of revenue reserves and is taxed. Where the market price is paid for the share, the current rule results in a distribution arising from a share cancellation being deemed to come from both taxable and tax-free sources. This is referred to as the "slice rule". The Government considers the slice rule to be the most appropriate approach to determining the portion of the distribution that is tax-free. Broadly, the aim of the slice rule is to base the non-taxable and taxable components of the share repurchase proceeds on the ratio between capital and the taxable reserves of the company. Given the variation in accounting treatments, it is inappropriate to specify for tax purposes reserves that are taxable on distribution. Existing tax rules specifically define tax-free distributions. Distributions in excess of those nominated as being tax-free are taxable. Consistent with this approach, taxable reserves are the difference between the tax-free reserves and the market value of the company's shares. Existing rules on the full liquidation of a company reflect this treatment. Under those rules, all the proceeds of a distribution on a full liquidation (representing the market value of the company's underlying assets at that time) are taxable except for those specifically deemed to be tax-free. 12 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Since any dollar distributed cannot be specifically identified as coming from either tax-free or taxable reserves, the slice rule has the advantage of being "even- handed" by assuming the distribution comes from both sources in proportion to their contribution to total market value. 2.3.2 Problems With Existing Rules The existing rules that govern share cancellations have two key problems which give rise to a need to strengthen those rules so that they achieve their intent. First, while the slice rule applies if the market price is paid for the share, the rules allow a company to pay less than market price. As a result, the entire distribution can be made tax-free by the company paying only the contributed capital per share. Shareholders are not penalised provided their respective interests in the company remain unchanged. Existing rules in practice therefore provide scope for subscribed capital to be distributed ahead of taxable reserves. For tax base maintenance reasons, the Government considers that it is appropriate that the slice rule apply in these circumstances. Second, the test that determines when a cancellation is in substitution for a dividend is very difficult to apply because it is highly subjective. The test relies on identifying the distribution as being made "regularly, systematically or explicitly" in lieu of a dividend, which is very difficult for the Commissioner to determine. First, there may be some argument that "systematic" does not include a one-off cancellation. A more fundamental problem is that the test requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine what a company would distribute as an ordinary dividend in any particular year in the absence of an ability to cancel or repurchase shares. This has proved difficult to apply in practice, and in the case of a newly established company, or a company with a one-off gain, the test is particularly hard to administer. Since companies are expected to repurchase shares more frequently than they currently cancel shares, this weakness represents significant potential for dividend tax base erosion. 2.4 Proposed Changes 2.4.1 Distributions Funded by Way of Capital Profits General Proposal The Government, in determining what proportion of a distribution should be taxed as a dividend, has considered the appropriate treatment of distributions funded from capital profits. As noted above, under existing rules, distributions funded from capital profits are tax-free only when a company is fully liquidated. The Valabh Committee proposed that distributions funded from capital profits also be tax-free when effected by way of a share repurchase or redemption (Valabh Committee (1991), p37). The recommendation related only to non-qualifying CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 13 companies. The qualifying company regime, aimed at small incorporated businesses, already provides that distributions funded from capital profits are tax- free when distributed to shareholders. The arguments advanced by the Committee in favour of relaxing the existing rules and allowing distributions funded from capital profits to be tax-free on a repurchase or redemption of shares were that: • There is no "in-principle" distinction between an amount distributed by way of a repurchase and distributions on the full liquidation of a company (when distributions from capital profits are tax-free). • Rules aimed at preventing companies substituting tax-free repurchases for taxable dividends should be sufficient to protect the dividend tax base if the existing restriction is relaxed. There are some arguments for not relaxing the rules. Under the new Companies Act, repurchases and dividends are subject to broadly similar rules, such as the solvency test, while rules applying on a full liquidation differ significantly. Also, the proposal to allow distributions sourced from capital profits to be tax-free creates an opportunity for on-going companies to provide a tax-free return to their shareholders by way of share repurchases not currently available. This could undermine the dividend tax base. Existing anti-dividend substitution rules are considered inadequate in this regard. The proposal also involves some increase in compliance and administration costs. Implementing it would require rules to attribute distributed capital profits to shares of a company (other than fixed rate shares) repurchased by a continuing company. For their part, companies would need to have adequate records that identify realised capital profits and losses, as well as any past distributions from those sources. After careful consideration of this issue, the Government has determined on balance to support the Valabh Committee's recommendation that distributions by way of share cancellations or repurchases that are funded from realised capital profits be tax-free, so long as the distribution is of sufficient size to clearly not be in substitution for a dividend. For the reasons outlined above, the Government considers that such a change should be conditional upon the implementation of more robust rules to prevent the substitution of tax-free distributions for the payment of taxable dividends. These rules are discussed further below. Since the new rules will apply to share cancellations, they will affect companies registered under the Companies Act 1955 as well as the new Companies Act. This change would not apply to fixed rate shares. Distributions upon the redemption or repurchase of fixed rate shares, other than those funded by subscribed capital, would continue to be taxable. 14 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Determining the Capital Gain Amount As noted above, it is necessary to apply rules to attribute realised capital profits to shares repurchased. Otherwise, there would be little constraint on a company targeting tax-free distributions funded from this source to particular shareholders, such as high-marginal rate taxpayers. The capital gain attributable to shares on a repurchase or redemption would be calculated by simply averaging the total realised capital gain reserves over the number of shares of all classes, other than fixed rate shares, on issue prior to the repurchase or cancellation. Capital gain reserves would be the sum of all realised capital gains, less capital losses and distributions previously funded from such reserves, since the creation of the company. 2.4.2 New Anti-Dividend Substitution Rule In light of the weaknesses in the current law, the Government proposes to amend the legislation to achieve two objectives. The objectives are: • to ensure that the slice rule applies even where less than the market price is paid for the share; • to incorporate a more robust and effective anti-dividend substitution rule. 2.4.3 Reinforcing the "Slice Rule" General Approach A company making a share repurchase or redemption, or a distribution on liquidation, would continue to be able to determine the amount that is attributed to tax-free reserves on a similar basis to the current section 4A(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, but with a key modification. It is proposed to amend the section to ensure that the tax-free and dividend components of the distribution better reflect the composition of the company's value. As noted earlier, currently companies can make a pro rata cancellation that is entirely tax-free by cancelling shares for their par value despite the market price being many times that amount. Such a strategy could also be possible with off-market repurchases but unlikely with on-market repurchases as shareholders would not sell their shares on-market for less than the market value. Under the proposed change, where the market value or more is paid for a share, the subscribed capital and capital gain amount in relation to the share could be returned in full. Where less than the market value is paid, those amounts would be reduced as follows: CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 15 price paid x (subscribed capital amount + capital gain amount) market price Section 4A of the Income Tax Act currently refers to the "returned capital amount". This term will be replaced by the term "subscribed capital amount", a concept that will reflect the capital position and shares on issue at any point in time, taking into account all previous capital subscriptions and reductions. The current formula refers to all shares and capital ever issued. Example Assume a company has 100 shares, all of one class, with subscribed capital of $0.50 per share. The market value of the company is $100.00 and its realised capital gain reserves are $20 (or $0.20 per share). The company repurchases 70 percent of the shares for $0.70 each through off-market repurchases. The tax-free component per share would be $0.49, that is: price paid x tax-free amount = $0.70 x ($0.50 + $0.20) = $0.49 market price $1.00 Determination of Market Value It is envisaged that the Commissioner would exercise a discretion as to how market value would be calculated in the case of repurchases, having already the power to determine the market value of shares in several other contexts. At the request of the Government, the Commissioner has considered ways to reduce compliance costs involved in determining the market value, and is conscious of the need to approve or confirm market values of shares to enable the proposed measures to operate in a satisfactory manner. For example, in the case of non- listed companies it is envisaged that detailed valuations will not be required but that a written valuation by an independent competent valuer will suffice in most cases. This should reduce compliance costs. Submissions as to how to further reduce compliance costs consistent with the general objective would be welcomed. 2.4.4 Brightline Tests The New Test Under the slice rule, amounts distributed by way of share repurchases and redemptions would continue to be tax-free to the extent that they are considered to be returns of subscribed capital or realised capital gains. However, it is proposed to include in section 4A(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act two new tests that would allow this treatment only in circumstances where a "qualifying capital reduction" or a material reduction in a shareholder's interest (a "qualifying 16 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES disproportionate reduction") occurs. These tests establish levels referred to as "brightlines". The tests are designed to give a clear, objective determination of when a distribution is a qualifying capital reduction or a qualifying disproportionate reduction as opposed to a deemed dividend. If the tests are not satisfied, the distributions would be taxable in full to the shareholder as dividends. The tests will apply to repurchases other than "on-market repurchases". The slice rule would automatically apply to on-market repurchases, with the company rather than the shareholder being responsible for meeting the tax imposition (refer to section 2.5 for further details). On-market repurchases would be defined as repurchases where: • The company acquires the repurchased shares through a broker in a recognised exchange (as defined in section 8B of the Income Tax Act for the purpose of determining interests in companies). • The seller, as a result, is unaware of the identity of the purchaser at the time the offer to acquire is accepted. The brightline tests specify that amounts distributed by way of repurchases, redemptions and cancellations (other than on-market repurchases) would be considered to be in lieu of taxable dividends, and would therefore be fully taxable as dividends, in the following circumstances: • where a repurchase offer is made on a pro rata basis under the terms of the companies legislation and the amount ultimately distributed represents less than 15 percent of the market value of the repurchasing company's shares at the time the company first notified shareholders of the intended offer. To be pro rata the offer must apply to all shares of the company other than fixed rate shares (defined in the proposed section 4A(3) of the Income Tax Act); • where a repurchase offer is made on a non pro rata basis, a shareholder's proportionate interest in the company after the repurchase or cancellation is more than 85 percent of the shareholder's pre-repurchase/cancellation interest. The shareholder's interest would include the interests of certain persons associated with the shareholder. This test would be applied to the aggregate of all shares in a company, other than fixed rate shares. Sections 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act, which measure voting and market value interests, would be used as the basis for establishing a shareholder's underlying interest in a company. The tests of when a distribution is in lieu of a dividend have been designed to enable companies, for reasons such as downsizing of operations, to fund one-off distributions to all shareholders (or to selected shareholders in the case of disproportionate reductions) partly from tax-free reserves of the company. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 17 The brightlines have been set at levels where it is clear a company would be returning capital rather than paying a dividend. The 15 percent of market value level represents approximately three times typical dividend yields. This represents a reasonable level for a robust anti-dividend substitution rule. Commissioner's Residual Discretion The Commissioner's discretion currently in the law will be rewritten as a backstop measure for use only when taxpayer behaviour defeats the purpose of the new rules. Where there is either a qualifying disproportionate reduction or a qualifying capital reduction, the distribution will be considered to be in lieu of a dividend only if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the repurchase was made under an arrangement to acquire, redeem or otherwise cancel shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend. The factors to be considered by the Commissioner in this regard are outlined in the legislation. A circumstance in which this residual discretion for the Commissioner should apply is where a company (likely to be a closely-held company) accumulates earnings until they represent 15 percent or more of the market value of the company. The company then makes a distribution, ostensibly as a result of a downsizing operation, but without reducing any of its core business. Similarly, successive disproportionate reductions that leave the respective interests of shareholders largely unchanged would also run foul of this rule. Repurchase by Related Company It is necessary to include rules to prevent a repurchase being characterised as a sale of shares to a third party by using, for example, related sibling companies or trusts to acquire shares. While it is considered that section 99(5) of the Income Tax Act is likely to catch such repurchases, it would be difficult to apply the section in relation to on-market repurchases, since it is not practical to deem a dividend to have been derived by the vendor. Accordingly, to cover the case of repurchases occurring on-market in the circumstances outlined above (or similar circumstances), a new section 4(12) will be inserted. This in effect provides for a debit to the Imputation Credit Account (ICA) of the company that issued the shares in respect of the dividend component of the repurchase. There would be no tax consequences for the vendor. Under section 4A(1)(cb) the amount paid to the vendor would be excluded from the dividend definition. Treatment of Fixed Rate Shares Fixed rate shares would be excluded from the brightline tests. They are more akin to debt instruments and usually do not carry an entitlement to the reserves of the company. This means that only subscribed capital in respect of such shares would be returned tax-free. The only exception would be when there is a 18 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES plan or arrangement to redeem fixed rate shares in lieu of the payment of a dividend on other shares in which case the distribution would be fully taxed as a dividend. An anti-avoidance rule to deal with this situation is included in the draft legislation. 2.5 Mechanism for Taxing the Dividend Component of Share Repurchases 2.5.1 Introduction How the dividend component of a share repurchase will be subject to tax will vary according to a number of factors, including: • whether the repurchasing company is a resident or a non-resident company; • whether the repurchase occurs on-market or off-market. Since it will not generally be possible for repurchasing companies to identify vendor shareholders at the time shares are acquired through the sharemarket, on- market share repurchases are likely to be from selected shareholders. Pro rata share repurchases will generally be confined to off-market transactions; • whether the shareholder from whom shares are repurchased is a company, a non-corporate shareholder, a resident or is taxable on gains from the sale of shares. Each of the above combinations results in different considerations that should be taken into account in determining how best to tax the dividend component of share repurchases. The proposals are discussed in more detail below, and are summarised in general terms in Annex 2.2. 2.5.2 Off-Market Purchases by Resident Non-Qualifying and Qualifying Companies Background The Valabh Committee made the following recommendations on the appropriate general mechanism for accounting for tax on the dividend component of a share repurchase: • A company buying back its shares should be subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the dividend component of the repurchase where that occurred on- or off-market. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 19 • The company should be able to debit its imputation credit account (ICA) in satisfaction of the FBT liability. • If insufficient ICA credits exist to satisfy FBT, then FBT should be actually paid with no credit to the ICA for that payment. • All vendor shareholders should be exempt from tax on the dividend component of the repurchase price. The Committee made its recommendations when non-cash dividends were subject to FBT and prior to the removal of the inter-corporate dividend exemption. This latter change means that where a company repurchases from a resident corporate vendor, the dividend component will be taxable. Where this occurs there is some argument that applying the Valabh Committee approach unaltered would operate harshly in relation to repurchases from corporate shareholders. In order to address this concern in respect of off-market repurchases, it is proposed that where shares are purchased by a qualifying or non-qualifying company off-market, the normal dividend distribution rules apply. Repurchase from Resident Non-Corporate Shareholder Where a company repurchases shares from a resident individual, the shareholder will be taxable on the dividend component of the sale proceeds. Imputation credits may be attached by the company in accordance with ordinary rules, and the dividend will generally be subject to the resident withholding tax regime. This treatment is illustrated in Annex 2.3. Repurchase from a Resident Corporate Shareholder A corporate shareholder would be taxed in the same way as an individual on the repurchase of shares. A credit will arise to the vendor's imputation credit account equal to the amount of any imputation credit, or resident withholding tax credit, attached to the dividend component of the sale proceeds. In this way, the appropriate amount of tax would be levied on dividend income. Repurchase from a Vendor who Holds Shares on Revenue Account The interaction between taxing the dividend component of a share repurchase and taxing gains or losses on shares on revenue account has not been fully evaluated. Any changes that may be proposed as a result of further evaluation will be discussed with interested parties during the consultation period. The proposal is that a vendor shareholder who holds shares on revenue account would be assessed on profits arising from the sale of the shares. The vendor would also be assessed on the dividend income arising from the repurchase. To ensure that both the dividend and the gain on share sales are not subject to tax, it is proposed that only the dividend component (excluding imputation credits) 20 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES and the excess profit over the dividend, if any, should be assessable. Where a loss had been made on sale, it could be offset against dividend income. Repurchase from a Non-Resident Shareholder The purchasing company would be required to deduct from the purchase price non-resident withholding tax on the dividend component of that repurchase price. Repurchase from Tax Exempt Shareholder Where the vendor shareholder is tax exempt, the dividend would be exempt and therefore not subject to RWT. However, imputation credits must be allocated to the dividend in accordance with the imputation rules. 2.5.3 On-Market Repurchase by a Resident Non-Qualifying Company Background Where a company purchases on-market from a shareholder of the company, the normal dividend rules will be inappropriate because: • The shareholder will be unaware of the identity of the purchaser. • At the time of the acquisition, the purchaser will not know the identity of the vendor. • Where shares (representing less than 5 percent of the company) are held by a nominee the purchaser may never know the identity of the beneficial owner of the shares. The Valabh Committee's recommended approach to taxing the dividend component of a repurchase, outlined above, assumed a link between dividends and FBT. The regime that applied at that time levied FBT on non-cash dividends. This is no longer the case. In view of this, and because a situation in which a company would prefer to pay FBT rather then debit its ICA is unlikely to arise, it is proposed that the legislation simply provide for a debit to arise to the ICA of a company to cover tax due where shares are repurchased on-market. Repurchase from Resident Non-Corporate Where a company repurchases shares from a resident non-corporate, the company would debit its ICA in respect of the dividend component of the repurchase price. The amount of the debit would be calculated in the same way as resident withholding tax on non-cash dividends. Where the purchasing company has insufficient credits in its ICA to absorb the debit at the time of purchase, it would CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 21 make a payment of tax sufficient to square the account by 31 March (without penalty) or 20 June. In almost all circumstances, this payment would offset a future provisional tax liability. The vendor would not be taxed on the dividend component. Repurchase from Resident Companies Where a company repurchases on-market from a resident corporate shareholder, the repurchasing company will debit its ICA in payment of tax on the dividend component of the repurchase. Although the shareholder would not be taxed on the dividend component, that amount may be taxed again if it is distributed to shareholders of the vendor. One mechanism by which this problem could be eliminated is to permit a credit to arise in the ICA of the vendor company. A corporate shareholder who sells shares to the company in which it holds shares would receive the same price for the shares as would have been the case had the shares been sold to a third party. In the former case, however, the shareholder would also receive imputation credits. The corporate shareholder who sells to the company should not be in a better position than one who sells to a third party. When the company sells its shares to a third party, it receives no such credit. Accordingly, allowing a credit to arise is inappropriate. The other possible solution to this problem is to exempt from the ICA debit mechanism dividends on shares repurchased from corporate shareholders. There are two concerns about such an exemption from the ICA debit mechanism: • Where shares are owned by a nominee company, the status of the beneficial owner should determine whether tax is payable. If the beneficial owner is a non-corporate, tax should be levied. However, companies will not typically know whether a corporate shareholder is a nominee, or the character of the beneficial owner. • Because the repurchasing company has an advantage if shares are acquired from a corporate, there is some incentive to arrange for shares to be purchased by a corporate prior to sale to the company. For these reasons, it is proposed that where shares are repurchased from a corporate, the repurchasing company would be liable for tax on the dividend component of the proceeds by way of a debit to its ICA. It should be noted that companies may be able to avoid these difficulties by repurchasing shares off- market. In that case, ordinary dividend rules would apply with imputation credits able to be attached to the dividend component of any share repurchase. 22 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES Repurchase from Tax-Exempt Entities To make the share repurchase rules as simple as possible, no special rules for on-market repurchases from tax-exempt entities are proposed. Such repurchases would be treated in the same way as acquisitions from resident taxable entities. A debit to the ICA of the repurchasing company would arise in respect of the dividend component. Repurchase from a Non-Resident Shareholder It is proposed that a debit (calculated as outlined above for residents) arise in the ICA of a company that repurchases its shares on-market from a non-resident. There would be therefore no need to distinguish between non-resident and resident vendors. An alternative approach would be to treat the dividend component as an ordinary non-cash dividend for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) purposes. This means that no deduction of NRWT would be made from the sale proceeds. Instead, the repurchasing company would pay an amount of NRWT equivalent to the amount that would have been deducted under general rules. This mechanism would be more appropriate than a deduction of NRWT because it ensures that the vendor is in the same position as a vendor selling to a third party. However, this approach assumes that a repurchasing company is able to identify the vendor as a non-resident shareholder. Where shares are held by a nominee company, it would seem that such identification is impossible. Accordingly, the approach proposed of debiting the ICA of the repurchasing company is simpler and is preferred. In addition, where a company has sufficient credits in its ICA, it may prefer to debit the ICA rather than pay NRWT. Repurchase from a Vendor who Holds Shares on Revenue Account Where a share trader sells on-market, the share trader will be liable for tax on any profit on sale of the shares. In addition, a debit will arise to the ICA of the repurchasing company in relation to the dividend component of the sale proceeds. However, as the vendor will not be able to identify the purchaser and the repurchasing company will not know whether the shares are held on revenue account, this appears unavoidable. Obviously, the problem would be reduced if shares are repurchased off-market, although this may not always be possible. 2.5.4 Repurchase by Non-Resident Companies Off-market The Valabh Committee considered that, while changes in our company law would have no impact on non-resident companies that repurchase shares, our tax law should address the consequence of a share repurchase permitted by CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 23 other jurisdictions. Their proposal was that the rules should be consistent with the rules that apply to resident company share repurchases. Adopting this approach, the ordinary dividend rules should apply to off-market repurchases by non-resident companies from resident shareholders. The Government agrees with this approach. If the resident shareholder is an individual, the dividend component would be assessed to the shareholder. Where the shareholder is a corporate, foreign dividend withholding payment may be payable on the dividend. On-market Placing a liability for tax on a foreign corporate repurchasing shares on-market poses jurisdictional and administrative problems. Therefore, it is considered that no tax liability should be imposed where shares are repurchased by non-resident companies on-market. 2.6 Treasury Stock Option During the course of developing the company law reforms, consideration was given to whether companies should be able to retain shares that they repurchased. This "treasury stock option" would enable companies to resell repurchased shares rather than be required to cancel them. However, this option was not included in the Companies Act. The Valabh Committee had made proposals on how a treasury stock option might work from a tax perspective, but in the context of company law providing for treasury stock. In the absence of company law providing for a treasury stock option, it would be very difficult to provide a workable treasury stock option in the tax legislation. For this reason the Government has decided against including a treasury stock option in the tax legislation. 2.7 Summary of Proposals The principal proposals outlined in this chapter are that: a Distributions funded from realised capital profits will be tax-free when made through qualifying share repurchases or redemptions. b Amounts distributed to shareholders on the repurchase, redemption, or other cancellation of shares that occur through off-market repurchases be fully taxable as dividends: i where the offer to repurchase or cancel is pro rata and the amount ultimately distributed represents less than 15 percent of the market 24 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES value of the shares of the company (i.e. it is not a qualifying capital reduction); or ii where the offer to repurchase or cancel is not made on a pro rata basis, a shareholder's proportionate interest in the company after the repurchase or cancellation is more than 85 percent of the shareholder's interest prior to repurchase or cancellation (i.e. it is not a qualifying disproportionate reduction). c Where there is a qualifying capital reduction or a qualifying disproportionate reduction, the "slice rule" would apply to determine the dividend component of the distribution except where the Commissioner applied the residual discretion to deem the full distribution to be in lieu of a dividend. d Where the slice rule applies the tax-free component of an amount distributed on a repurchase or cancellation is the sum of: (i) the subscribed capital amount (broadly, the subscribed capital per share repurchased or cancelled); and (ii) the capital gain amount per share (broadly, the total realised capital profits of the company divided by the total number of shares on issue, other than fixed rate shares). e Where less than the market value is paid for a share that is repurchased or cancelled, the subscribed capital amount and the capital gain amount attributable to the share will be reduced so that the tax-free component of the distribution is the amount of subscribed capital and capital gain over the market value of the share. f Where a company purchases its shares off-market, the dividend component of the purchase is taxable to the vendor of the shares. g Where a company purchases its shares on-market, the company is liable for the tax on the dividend component of the purchase price. This is met by way of a debit to its imputation credit account which is calculated in the same way as resident withholding tax on a non-cash dividend. The vendor is exempt from tax on the dividend component. CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 25 ANNEX 2.1 Current Rules For Calculating Paid-Up Capital, Qualifying Share Premium and Excess Return Amount Section 4A of the Income Tax Act sets out a number of exclusions from the term "dividends". Principal among those exclusions are amounts funded from subscribed capital (being paid-up capital and qualifying share premium) distributed when shares are cancelled or redeemed, and amounts funded from capital gains distributed on the liquidation of a company. Hence, a dividend for tax purposes is a benefit which is derived by virtue of a shareholder's ownership interest in a company, excluding the return of the original investment and, in the case of a liquidation, capital gain amounts. Under section 4A those excluded amounts are calculated as follows: Distributions Attributable to Paid-Up Capital Under the section, the amount per share returnable tax-free as paid-up capital is computed as: a b where: a is the total amount of capital paid up prior to the redemption of the shares of the class being redeemed or cancelled; and b is the total number of shares of the class that have ever been issued by the company prior to the redemption that are still on issue. Distributions Attributable to Qualifying Share Premium Qualifying share premium amounts returnable tax-free are computed according to a similar averaging formula to that outlined in the previous paragraph. However, the amount of tax-free share premium is the actual amount debited to the company's share premium account in respect of the redemption if this is smaller than the amount computed under the averaging rule. Distributions Attributable to Other Tax-Free Sources on a Liquidation Distributions funded from certain realised and unrealised capital gains are also non-taxable when distributed on the liquidation of a company. These residual 26 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES non-taxable amounts are allocated to distributions on a pro rata basis according to total distributions made on a liquidation, other than distributions of subscribed capital. Broadly, the residual amounts distributable tax-free to a shareholder on liquidation are computed as: a x b c where: a is the amount of realised and unrealised capital gains available for distribution to shareholders; b is the distributions received by the shareholder on the liquidation, other than distributions of paid-up capital and share premium; and c is the total amount of distributions payable to all shareholders on liquidation, except distributions of paid-up capital and qualifying share premium. Where a distribution exceeds the total amount that can be attributed to tax-free sources, the excess is taxable as a dividend. The first two formulae operate on a class by class basis for each class of shares redeemed or cancelled. Shares are considered to be of the same class for tax purposes if: • the shares carry the same rights to exercise voting power and the same rights to distributions; or • the same amount has been subscribed in respect of each share, the company elects to treat such shares as being of the same class, and the company can distinguish between such shares and other shares.

The market value of each share is $20. B owns 500 shares. Company A purchases those shares for $20 per share. B receives $10,000. As all of B's shares are sold, the distribution is not deemed to be in lieu of a dividend and the slice rule applies. The subscribed capital and capital gains attributable to the repurchased shares will be tax-free and are calculated in the following way: Subscribed capital $20,000 ------------ = $10.00 per share 2,000 Capital gains $10,000 ------------ = $5.00 per share 2,000 The balance, being the dividend component, is therefore $5 per share ($2,500 in total). The company attaches the maximum imputation credits to the dividend ($1,231.34) which is the benchmark ratio for the year. As the dividend is fully imputed, no RWT is deducted. B returns $3,731.34 as assessable income and claims $1,231.34 as a credit of tax. (If B was a resident company it would also credit its ICA with $1,231.34, being the imputation credit attached to the dividend). CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES 29 Where the repurchasing company is distributing tax-paid income (and assuming that the company is able to fully impute the dividend) no premium above market price need be paid to attract shareholders to sell to the company. However, where the company does or cannot fully impute the dividend component, the cost to the company of the repurchase may be greater than the market value of the shares. This is because, where there is a market for the shares, the shareholder will look for an after-tax return that is not less than what the shares could be sold for on-market. In practice, however, it is difficult to understand why a company would prefer to pay a premium on the market value and deduct resident withholding tax rather than make a payment of tax (which it could use to offset a future tax liability) and fully impute the dividend to the shareholder. On-market If the shares were repurchased on-market the slice rule would automatically apply. The dividend component would also be $5 per share. A debit would arise to company A's imputation credit account as follows: 0.33 x $2,500 = $1,231.34 0.67 Example 2: Off-market repurchase from vendor who is taxable on share profits Assume in the above example that B is a trader who purchased the shares for $15 each (and subsequently sold them to the company for $20). B receives taxable income of $5 per share, totalling $2,500 for 500 shares. In addition, (assuming the company is paying the distribution from tax-paid profits) B will receive a fully credited gross dividend of $3,731.34, comprising a dividend component of $2,500 and imputation credits of $1,231.34. This transaction has therefore been taxed twice - once as a dividend and then again as a profit on sale. To avoid this double taxation, B would be assessed only on the dividend component of the share repurchase. If B had purchased the shares for $5 per share so that the profit on the transaction was $7,500, $5,000 ($7,500 - $2,500) would be taxable as a profit on sale. 30 CHAPTER 2: SHARE REPURCHASES AND RELATED ISSUES CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 3.1 Introduction This chapter considers the tax implications of the amalgamation provisions of the new Companies Act. 3.2 The Amalgamation Provisions of the New Companies Act Under the amalgamation provisions of the new Companies Act, the procedures governing the amalgamation of two or more companies into one company have been simplified in comparison with those applicable under existing company law. Under the new Companies Act, the amalgamation of two or more companies generally requires the following: • approval from the board of directors; • a resolution of the board of directors that the amalgamation will be in the best interests of the company; • a resolution of the board of directors that the amalgamated company will satisfy the solvency test immediately after the amalgamation; • advice to all secured creditors of the amalgamation proposal; • shareholders' approval by special resolution; and • registration of the proposal with the Registrar of Companies. The amalgamation takes effect on the date specified in the amalgamation certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies. Under the new amalgamation procedures court involvement is no longer required unless sought. In addition, an even simpler amalgamation process is provided for the amalgamation of wholly-owned companies. A "short-form" amalgamation procedure is provided under section 222 of the new Companies Act for a wholly- owned subsidiary amalgamating with a parent, or for two wholly-owned subsidiaries that amalgamate. Under the short-form procedure, an amalgamation may be approved solely by the boards of each amalgamating company agreeing to the amalgamation, provided the solvency test is still met. Under the new Companies Act, the amalgamating companies continue as one company, which may be a continuation of one of the amalgamating companies or a new company. All assets and liabilities of the amalgamating companies are vested in the amalgamated company. Amalgamating companies can agree to CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 31 the terms of their amalgamation. Thus, if the terms of the amalgamation so provide, some shareholders in the amalgamating companies may be issued shares in the amalgamated company, while other shareholders in the amalgamating companies may be bought out for cash and debentures. Where one amalgamating company holds shares in another amalgamating company, those shares must be cancelled for no payment when the amalgamation becomes effective. 3.3 Tax Treatment of Revenue Account Shareholders in an Amalgamation 3.3.1 Current Treatment Under current tax rules, the realisation of a gain or loss upon the disposal of a parcel of shares by a revenue account shareholder is a taxable event. Therefore, revenue account shareholders making a gain or loss on any shares swapped for other shares as part of an amalgamation face the same tax consequences as if they had sold the shares for cash. 3.3.2 Rollover Relief Ideally, taxes should not influence taxpayer preferences between different investment choices. However, any tax incurred on realisation of an investment spanning multiple tax periods changes taxpayer behaviour to the extent that taxpayers defer the tax liability by retaining an asset longer than they otherwise would. This is known as "lock-in". Lock-in influences are unavoidable in a realisation based income tax. The Government is aware that some taxpayers believe that shareholder lock-in in relation to company amalgamations should be addressed by the provision of some form of shareholder rollover relief, which would enable a tax liability arising as a result of a share swap to be deferred until the shares acquired in the amalgamation were sold. Providing shareholder rollover relief only changes the timing of income recognition for tax purposes. The incentive to delay realisation is not eliminated. Indeed, if the shares acquired in an amalgamation increase further in value, rollover relief would exacerbate lock-in influences. Accordingly, the existence of lock-in does not support arguments that there is a sound policy basis for providing rollover relief. In New Zealand only gains on shares held on revenue account are taxed. In Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom rollover relief was not available prior to the introduction of comprehensive capital gains taxes in those jurisdictions. Thus, if anything, the experience of those jurisdictions suggests that the provision of rollover relief is not appropriate for New Zealand. 32 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS Introducing rollover relief would also result in tax considerations further distorting taxpayer decision-making by creating a bias towards amalgamation over other forms of sale or reorganisation. Finally, the relief provisions that apply to corporate restructuring in other jurisdictions are understood to be among some of the most complex tax rules of those countries. These rules are apparently subject to considerable "tax planning". Under the circumstances, it does not appear necessary or appropriate to add to the Income Tax Act another layer of complexity that will increase opportunities for tax planning. In summary, the current treatment of shares disposed of as part of a corporate reorganisation is consistent with the general realisation-based treatment of other taxable gains. The new Companies Act does not introduce any special feature in relation to amalgamations that is sufficient to warrant a departure from current tax treatment by the introduction of tax treatment inconsistent with general tax principles for taxpayers holding shares on revenue account. Accordingly, no legislative change is proposed. 3.4 Tax Treatment of Asset Transfers 3.4.1 Asset Transfers in an Amalgamation The purpose of the amalgamation provisions in the new Companies Act is to simplify the administrative procedures that must be followed when two or more companies merge. Thus, the new amalgamation provisions are designed to minimise administrative impediments to corporate restructuring through amalgamations. The Government favours extending to amalgamations the tax-free asset transfer treatment available to consolidated groups. Both consolidation and amalgamation can be used to achieve the same substantive restructuring. Tax rules should not influence which method (amalgamation or consolidation) taxpayers use in merging their corporate operations. In other words, the two different methods of restructuring should yield the same tax consequences. The amalgamation of two or more companies can be viewed as a one-step procedure by which companies become wholly-owned (100 percent commonly- owned by the same shareholders) and then merge their assets into a single company. The consolidation regime can be used to achieve this result without triggering income tax consequences on the transfer of the merging companies' assets to a single company. The Government proposes that amalgamation be dealt with by utilising the tax- free asset transfer rules of the consolidation regime. CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 33 3.4.2 Other Considerations Consistent with the consolidation regime, the amalgamated company would inherit each transferor's tax cost for the asset (as well as the transferor's other tax attributes in respect of the asset). The Valabh Committee has recommended an asset classification system under which tax consequences would be triggered when a taxpayer moves an asset out of the tax base. Accordingly, the Government considers it would be appropriate to implement rules that would trigger tax consequences when an asset moves from revenue to capital account as a result of an asset transfer made pursuant to an amalgamation. In addition, tax-free treatment should only apply where the amalgamated company will be resident in New Zealand. Otherwise, assets could be transferred out of the New Zealand tax base free of tax consequences, thereby permanently avoiding (rather than deferring) New Zealand tax. Under the consolidation regime, only companies that are resident in New Zealand are eligible to be members of a consolidated group. If the amalgamated company is a qualifying company, tax-free treatment should only apply if all amalgamating companies are also qualifying companies. Otherwise amalgamating a non-qualifying company into a qualifying company would enable qualifying company election tax to be avoided. 3.5 Losses and Imputation Credits 3.5.1 Introduction In the Government's view, an amalgamated company should be able to succeed to the losses and imputation credits of the amalgamating companies, subject to ensuring that the shareholder continuity rules and the limitations on loss grouping are not circumvented. 3.5.2 Losses - Implications of Shareholder Continuity and Loss Grouping Rules for Amalgamations The tax treatment of companies that amalgamate should be consistent with the tax treatment of company losses generally. An amalgamated company should inherit the losses of an amalgamating company only when shareholder continuity and commonality tests are met. 34 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 3.5.3 Existing Shareholder Continuity Rules The purpose of the loss carry-forward rules is to ensure that, to an extent, shareholders in a company at the time it incurred tax losses are still shareholders when the company utilises those losses. This is achieved through shareholder continuity rules that determine what tax losses a company may offset against its future income. A company may carry forward its losses and offset them against income arising in subsequent income years provided that shareholder continuity of at least 49 percent is maintained throughout the period beginning with the year in which the loss is incurred and ending with the year to which the loss is carried forward (the "continuity period"). Shareholder continuity is maintained if at least 49 percent of the shares in the company are owned by the same persons throughout the continuity period. 3.5.4 Shareholder Continuity Rules and Amalgamations An amalgamation would not provide a means of circumventing the shareholder continuity rules with respect to the amalgamating companies provided those rules continue to apply after the amalgamation. The amalgamated company would be considered to satisfy shareholder continuity with respect to the losses of an amalgamating company if at least 49 percent of the shares in the amalgamated company and 49 percent of the shares of the amalgamating company are owned by the same persons throughout the continuity period. The amalgamated company would be considered a continuation of the loss company for the purposes of the shareholder continuity test. Of course, if at the time of the amalgamation more than one amalgamating company had carried forward tax losses, and those companies had different shareholders during the relevant continuity periods, the amalgamated company would need to keep track of the losses of each such company separately, even where those losses were incurred for the same income year. 3.5.5 Existing Loss Grouping Rules The purpose of the loss grouping rules is to enable the losses of loss companies to offset the income of profit companies provided a minimum commonality of ownership is achieved. The application of the commonality of ownership test is separate and different from the shareholder continuity test. Under current loss grouping rules, the losses of one company (both current losses and those carried forward) may be offset against the income of another company only if, throughout the period beginning with the year the loss is incurred and ending with the year of offset, a group of persons concurrently owns at least 66 percent of the shares in each of the companies. This group of shareholders is not restricted to persons who were shareholders at the time the CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 35 losses were incurred. This requirement is often referred to as "shareholder commonality". If a loss company wishes to group its losses with a profit company, and it has some losses that do not satisfy the shareholder commonality test, and other losses from subsequent years that do satisfy the shareholder commonality test, only those losses satisfying the shareholder commonality test may be used to offset the profit company's taxable income. 3.5.6 Loss Rules And Amalgamations The Government considers that an amalgamated company should be allowed to inherit the losses of any amalgamating company if: • The shareholder continuity rules continue to be satisfied with respect to the losses of that amalgamating company after the amalgamation. • The losses of that amalgamating company could have been grouped against income realised by all other amalgamating companies immediately prior to the amalgamation. If the losses of more than one of the amalgamating companies are carried into the amalgamated company, the losses of each predecessor company would continue to be identified separately in order to continue to test shareholder continuity. Where the losses arose in the same income year, the amalgamated company would be able to elect the set or sets of losses against which its income could be offset. Where no election is made, losses would be offset against assessable income on a pro rata basis. Shareholder continuity would be measured by reference to ownership interests in the amalgamated company compared to ownership interests in the predecessor amalgamating company for the continuity period. Where the amalgamated company subsequently breaches shareholder continuity, any remaining losses carried over from the amalgamating company would be forfeited in the usual way. A more lenient approach is possible in the consolidation regime as the members of the consolidated group continue as separate legal entities. Therefore, under consolidation, where a consolidated group contains a loss company with pre- consolidation losses that cannot be grouped with any other members of the consolidated group, the losses can be carried forward and offset against the loss company's income, as long as it continues to meet the loss carry-forward shareholder continuity requirements. 36 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS However, it is not practicable to develop rules regarding amalgamations that fully replicate this, as the amalgamating companies that form an amalgamated company have no continuing legal existence separate from the amalgamated company. 3.5.7 Imputation Credit Shareholder Continuity Rules The purpose of imputation carry forward restrictions is to ensure that the imputation credits are enjoyed by substantially the same shareholders of the company as existed at the time the imputation credits arose. The shareholder continuity rules apply to imputation credits in the same manner as to losses, except that the shareholder continuity threshold is 66 percent. Except for consolidated groups there are no provisions for grouping imputation credits between members of commonly-owned groups. Consequently, an amalgamated company should be allowed to succeed to imputation credits of an amalgamating company if, after the amalgamation, the shareholder continuity requirement continues to be satisfied with respect to the relevant amalgamating company up to the period those credits are distributed by the amalgamated company. 3.6 Conclusion The simplified amalgamation provisions in the new Companies Act are designed to remove unnecessary regulatory impediments to amalgamations. The provisions are not designed to create a bias towards amalgamations for their own sake. Similarly, tax rules should not favour amalgamations over other similar forms of corporate restructuring. This means that tax rules regarding amalgamations should be more or less the same as current generally applicable rules regarding company and shareholder taxation. Tax rules relating to the amalgamation of two or more companies should be closely aligned with existing rules governing the carry forward and grouping of tax losses and the carry forward of imputation credits. Amalgamating companies should also be able to use the preferential asset transfer rules currently available to taxpayers through the consolidation regime, without needing to consolidate or group the amalgamating companies prior to amalgamation. A tax liability would be triggered when shareholders trading on revenue account swap shares in an amalgamating company for shares in an amalgamated company. This is a continuation of existing law. CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS 37 3.7 Summary of Proposals It is proposed that the following income tax rules apply to company amalgamations: (a) Revenue account shareholders in an amalgamating company will realise assessable income or loss on the exchange of their shares in the amalgamating company for shares in the amalgamated company. This requires no change to existing tax rules. (b) The transfer of assets to an amalgamated company from the amalgamating companies will be tax-free, under rules similar to those that apply to consolidated groups. (c) An amalgamated company will be allowed to succeed to losses of a particular amalgamating company if: (i) the shareholder continuity requirement with respect to that amalgamating company continues to be satisfied; and (ii) immediately prior to the amalgamation, the losses of that amalgamating company could have been grouped against income of all other amalgamating companies. (d) An amalgamated company will be allowed to succeed to imputation credits of an amalgamating company only if the shareholder continuity requirement continues to be satisfied with respect to that amalgamating company after the amalgamation. (e) For the purposes of the shareholder continuity tests the losses and imputation credits of each predecessor company would continue to be separately identified by the amalgamated company. Where the losses arise in the same income year, the amalgamated company will be able to elect the set or sets of losses against which its assessable income could be offset. Where no election is made, losses would be offset against assessable income on a pro rata basis. 38 CHAPTER 3: AMALGAMATIONS CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 4.1 Introduction This chapter covers tax accounting questions associated with the transition between the existing and the new companies regime, as well as issues relating to company distributions made other than by way of share repurchases. The following areas, in particular, are discussed in this chapter: • treatment of the existing capital reserves of companies registering under the new companies regime; • revision of the current qualifying share premium rules; • determining the subscribed capital of an amalgamated company; • tax rules where distributions made to shareholders breach the company law solvency test and are subsequently recovered. 4.2 Treatment of Company Accounting Reserves for Tax Purposes The current tax treatment of company reserves generally requires only minor changes to respond to the reform of company law. The only significant change will be the proposed revision of the current qualifying share premium rules. 4.2.1 Existing Capital Reserves The new Companies Act makes no distinction between reserves arising from shareholder contributions and other reserves. However, this distinction is important for tax purposes, as reserves contributed by shareholders can be distributed tax-free. Therefore, the existing tax concepts of paid-up capital and share premium will be supplanted by the single concept of "subscribed capital". Subscribed capital will, like paid-up capital and share premium, be available for tax-free distribution on liquidation, or on the redemption or repurchase of shares, subject to the proposed rules regarding share repurchases detailed in Chapter 2. Where shares are "partly paid" on subscription, only the amount paid on subscription is included in subscribed capital. For tax purposes, existing paid-up capital and qualifying share premium reserves will be included in subscribed capital. CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 39 The subscribed capital of new companies registering under the new Companies Act will include all sums paid to the company in return for shares in the company and the net value of subsequent taxable bonus issues. For three years after the new Companies Act comes into force, some companies will have re-registered while others will remain under the old regime. Consequently, some companies will distinguish in their capital reserves between share premium and paid-up capital, while other companies will record only subscribed capital. Several sections of the Income Tax Act, including sections 4 and 4A, will be redrafted to accommodate both situations. 4.2.2 Capital Redemption Reserves The Companies Act 1955 provides that where redeemable preference shares are redeemed otherwise than from the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares, a company must transfer a sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed to a "capital redemption reserve fund", sourced from funds available for distribution as a dividend. Capital redemption reserves are not currently treated as paid-up capital for tax purposes. This treatment will be preserved for companies registering under the new companies legislation - capital redemption reserves will not be subscribed capital for tax purposes. 4.2.3 Existing Bonus Issues Under the Companies Act 1955, bonus issues represent a transfer of retained earnings to paid-up capital effected by way of the creation of additional "bonus" shares which are issued to shareholders for no consideration, or in lieu of a dividend. For tax purposes, there are currently three types of bonus issues, namely taxable, non-taxable and 10-year bonus issues. A different tax treatment applies to each of these. Where non-taxable bonus issues are made, the bonus issue is tax-free, and the transfer to paid-up capital is ignored for tax purposes. It is proposed that amounts of paid-up capital resulting from non-taxable bonus issues will be taxable on distribution, with the exception of amounts bonus issued out of capital gain or qualifying share premium reserves and distributed during a liquidation or cancellation of shares. 40 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES In the case of taxable bonus issues, the value of the issue, less any attached imputation or RWT credits, is transferred from taxable reserves to paid-up capital at the time the issue occurs. It is proposed that on transition to the new companies regime, amounts of paid-up capital that have arisen from capitalised taxable bonus issues will be subscribed capital for tax purposes. A 10-year bonus issue is a bonus issue made between 1 April 1982 and 1 October 1988. These bonus shares were non-taxable at the time of issue, with the capitalisation not being recognised for tax purposes until the tenth anniversary of the bonus issue. In effect, companies are permitted to make a tax-free transfer to paid-up capital 10-years after the bonus issue. It is proposed that upon registration under the new Companies Act, amounts capitalised from 10-year bonus issues that have reached their tenth anniversary will be subscribed capital for tax purposes, while amounts capitalised in 10-year bonus issues that are less than 10 years old will not qualify as subscribed capital until the tenth anniversary of the issue. The exception to this is where the bonus issue was sourced from capital gain amounts or qualifying share premium. Other amounts capitalised by way of 10-year bonus issues would continue to be taxable if distributed before the 10-year period has elapsed. 4.2.4 Future Bonus Issues With the elimination of company law distinctions between capital reserves and retained earnings, there is no need to maintain a tax distinction between share splits and non-taxable bonus issues. Therefore, Income Tax Act references to non-taxable bonus issues will also be applicable to share splits. It is proposed that for taxable bonus issues other than those made in lieu of a dividend, the issuing company will be free to elect the amount transferred to subscribed capital per bonus share issued. While the new Companies Act does not explicitly authorise bonus issues, section 42 provides a general authorisation for a company to issue shares as it sees fit. Consequently, it is not intended at this stage to develop tax rules that provide an alternative to taxable bonus issues. It may be appropriate, however, to consider developing a mechanism that would enable companies to distribute imputation credits without creating additional shares or paying out cash. In particular, it may be appropriate to develop notional distribution rules similar to those applicable for co-operative companies, with appropriate anti-streaming rules. Submissions on this matter are welcomed. CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 41 4.2.5 Tax-Exempt Taxable Bonus Issues and Dividends At present, if a taxable bonus issue is exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act (for instance, a bonus issue made between members of a consolidated group) a tax-free transfer from that company's taxable to tax-free reserves may be achieved without any tax being paid. Similarly, a tax-free transfer from taxable reserves to subscribed capital may occur when tax-exempt dividends are paid out, and the funds are then re-subscribed in the dividend paying company. This is inconsistent with other tax rules that aim to tax, either at the time of the transfer or upon distribution to shareholders, amounts transferred from potentially taxable reserves to subscribed capital. Accordingly, it is proposed that special rules apply to such a dividend that is either: • used to directly or indirectly fund a subscription of capital in the company paying the dividends or in an associated company; or • a taxable bonus issue. The amount of the above subscription will be ineligible to be included in subscribed capital for tax purposes, to the extent that the dividend from which the subscription was sourced was: • exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act; and • less than fully imputed, in which case an allocation rule will determine the portion of the dividend that is fully imputed. For example, assume a company pays an exempt dividend of $800, attaching imputation credits of $200. The shareholder then subscribes $1,500 to the company. The attached imputation credits are sufficient to fully credit $406 of the dividend, with the remaining $394 being uncredited. The first $406 of the capital subscription would be subscribed capital for tax purposes, the next $394 would not be subscribed capital, while the remaining $700 would also be subscribed capital. 4.2.6 Qualifying Share Premium Rules Subscribed capital (including qualifying share premium) can be returned tax-free to shareholders, unless it is distributed in lieu of a dividend. This is in contrast to retained earnings, which are generally taxed on distribution. Therefore, in the absence of effective tax rules to the contrary, taxpayers face an incentive to recharacterise retained earnings as subscribed capital. 42 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Under current law, qualifying share premium does not include share premium arising with respect to the issue of shares in one company for shares in another company. This limitation on qualifying share premium is designed to prevent a tax advantage resulting from share swaps on capital restructuring occurring either as part of a genuine commercial transaction or motivated entirely by tax considerations. The current rule is somewhat arbitrary and poorly targeted, in that the application of the rule to shares issued in the exchange is determined by the relationship between the par value and issue price of the shares (the difference being the share premium), rather than the relationship between paid-up capital plus qualifying share premium and the issue price of the shares acquired in the exchange. Accordingly, it is proposed to revise the existing qualifying share premium rule to take account of company law changes, to better reflect the tax policy underlying the current rule, and to provide a rule suitable for application to both share swaps made in the course of an amalgamation, and other share swaps. Where a transaction or series of transactions has the effect of the issuing of shares by a company in exchange for shares in another company, the subscribed capital attributable to the issued shares shall be the lesser of the subscribed capital or market value of the shares acquired in consideration for the issued shares. This would include a transaction where the acquiring company pays cash for the acquired shares, on condition that the cash is then re-subscribed in the issuing company. This rule might be defeated by inflating the subscribed capital of the acquired company in anticipation of the share swap. Therefore it is proposed to include an anti-avoidance provision that would prevent the limitation on subscribed capital being defeated in this way. Existing amounts of non-qualifying share premium resulting from the application of the existing qualifying share premium definition will continue to be taxable on distribution. Share premium that currently qualifies for tax-free distribution will retain that status. 4.3 Amalgamations Amalgamations would be subject to the general rules limiting subscribed capital attributable to shares issued in return for other shares. In addition, it is proposed that the subscribed capital of any amalgamating company represented by shares held by or on behalf of any other amalgamating company immediately prior to the amalgamation would not qualify as subscribed CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 43 capital in the amalgamated company. This prevents double counting of subscribed capital, eliminates a tax planning opportunity, and is consistent with the new Companies Act. The new Companies Act requires that shares in any amalgamating company held by or on behalf of another amalgamating company be cancelled without payment or the provision of other consideration (sections 220(3) and 222(2)(b)(i) refer). The example in Annex 4.1 demonstrates both this rule and the general subscribed capital limiting rule applicable to shares issued in exchange for other shares. Other aspects of amalgamations are discussed in Chapter 3. 4.4 Excess Distributions 4.4.1 General Approach Under the new Companies Act, the board of a company may authorise a distribution (including a repurchase of shares) only if it is satisfied that the company will be solvent after the distribution. Where the company does not satisfy the solvency test after the distribution, the dividend may be recovered by the company from the shareholder. There are three exceptions to this right of recovery: • where the shareholder received the distribution in good faith and without knowledge of the company's failure to satisfy the solvency test; • where the shareholder has altered its position relying on the validity of the distribution; • if it would be unfair to require repayment. It is anticipated that use of the recovery provisions is likely to be a rare occurrence. However, the Income Tax Act has to be amended to provide for this. An amendment to unwind the distribution for tax purposes is complicated by the fact that some dividends will have been fully imputed, some will have had resident withholding tax deducted and others will carry neither imputation nor RWT credits. In addition, where imputed dividends are paid to a company the attached credits will have been credited to the recipient's ICA. It is proposed to amend section 4 of the Income Tax Act to provide that where a shareholder repays a dividend to the company pursuant to the new Companies 44 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Act, the shareholder shall be deemed not to have received that dividend or any imputation credits attached to it. The Commissioner will reassess the shareholder's return for the year in which the dividend was received. The company that recovered the distribution will credit its ICA as at the date of recovery for the amount of imputation credit attached to the dividend. It is proposed that the Commissioner be required to refund any RWT or NRWT previously deducted on payment of the dividend. 4.4.2 Corporate Recipient A corporate recipient will have credited to its ICA any RWT or imputation credits attached to the dividend. It is proposed that an offsetting debit to the corporate shareholder's ICA arise on repayment of the dividend. 4.5 Summary of Proposals The following tax rules are proposed for companies registering under the new Companies Act: (a) That the following amounts be "subscribed capital" for tax purposes: (i) existing paid-up capital reserves, being: • amounts subscribed by shareholders; • where shares are "partly-paid" on subscription, the amount paid on subscription; • amounts that have arisen from taxable bonus issues; • amounts represented by 10-year bonus issues that have reached their tenth anniversary; • amounts represented by both unexpired 10-year bonus issues, and non-taxable bonus issues, that were sourced from either capital gain amounts or qualifying share premium; (ii) existing qualifying share premium reserves. (b) In respect of future transactions, including amalgamations, having the effect of the issuing of shares by a company in exchange for shares in another company: CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 45 (i) The subscribed capital of the issued shares will be the lesser of the subscribed capital or market value of the shares received in exchange for the issued shares. (ii) For the purposes of paragraph (b)(i) an anti-avoidance rule would apply, so that the subscribed capital of the acquired company will not include capital resulting from subscriptions in that company made in anticipation of the share swap, to the extent that some or all of that capital is returned to the subscribing shareholders in some form other than as shares in the amalgamated company. This removes any tax advantage that would otherwise result from inflating the subscribed capital of a target company prior to acquisition. (iii) Subscribed capital represented by shares held by amalgamating companies in each other would not be credited to the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. (c) Subscriptions be excluded from subscribed capital for tax purposes to the extent that they are attributable to dividends that were: (i) exempt from tax under section 63 of the Income Tax Act; and (ii) were not fully imputed (in which case an allocation rule will apply to determine the non-imputed amount). (d) In the case of a company recovering a distribution from shareholders: (i) A credit to the value of imputation credits attached to the recovered dividend would arise in the imputation credit account of the company that recovers the dividend. The ICA credit would arise on the date of dividend recovery. (ii) The shareholder would be deemed not to have received that dividend, or any imputation credits attached to it, and would be reassessed accordingly. (iii) The Commissioner would be required to refund any RWT or NRWT that had previously been deducted from the refunded dividend. (iv) Where the recipient of the dividend was a corporate, the repaying company would debit its imputation credit account with an amount equal to the value of any resident withholding tax or imputation credits attached to the recovered dividend. 46 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES Annex 4.1 APPLICATION OF TAX ACCOUNTING RULES TO AN AMALGAMATION Stage 1 Start position: Stage 2 A and B agree to amalgamate C Co, Do, and E Co into a new company, F Co. F Co Issues 2,000 shares in total to A and B in proportion to the market value of their direct holdings (double counting results if indirect holdings are Included, as the value of an indirect shareholding Is counted once as the market value of the subsidary company, and again as a share investment forming part of the value of the shareholding company). In return for existing holdings In C Co and D Co, A is Issued shares In F Co with a market value of: C Co's market value x A's shareholding, plus D Co's market value x A's shareholding, = $3,000 x 100% + $400 x 40% = $3,160 In return for existing holdings in D Co and E Co B Is issued shares in F Co with a market value of: D Co's market value x B's shareholding, plus E Co's market value x B's shareholding, = $400 x 10% + $ 1,000 x 100% = $ 1,040. The subscribed capital of F Co is the subscribed capital of C, D and E Co shares acquired by F Co in return for the F Co shares, excluding holdings by any of the amalgamating companies In each other = Subscribed capital (C Co + D Co + E Co), less sub. cap. of D Co held by E Co = $1,000 + $100+ $500-($100 x 50%) = $1,550. End position: CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES 47 48 CHAPTER 4: TAX ACCOUNTING ISSUES CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 5.1 Introduction This chapter covers aspects of company law reform with tax implications which have not already been specifically addressed: • capital structure: abolition of nominal and par value; • use of new measurement of company ownership rules to replace obsolete company law concepts; • revising associated persons and company control definitions to accommodate company law changes; • substituting the closely-held company definition for private and proprietary company definitions; • providing for references to both the new and old Companies Acts during the transition period; • the effect of companies having only one shareholder or one share; • replacing memoranda and articles of association references in the Revenue Acts with the term "constitution"; • other terminology changes; and • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's preferred creditor status. 5.2 Capital Structure: Abolition of Nominal and Par Value The concepts of "par value" and "nominal capital" (and also as a consequence the concept of "share premium") are abolished under the new Companies Act. This will mean that the capital structure and financial accounts of a company incorporated or registered under the new Act will be significantly simplified. Par value and nominal capital had their origin in the capital maintenance rule, which required a company to retain assets equal to its capital for creditor and shareholder protection reasons. The concept of capital maintenance is superseded under the new Act by the solvency test. Par value was intended to provide protection for existing shareholders against stock watering (i.e. reducing the value of shares) by the issue of shares below CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 49 the value established at par. This protection, however, is not effective in circumstances where the shares are worth substantially more than par value. Section 47 of the new Act addresses the problem of stock watering by effectively requiring there to be adequate consideration paid on the issue of a company's shares. The board of directors is responsible for deciding the consideration for which a company's shares will be issued. Before issuing any shares the board must be satisfied that the consideration received for the shares is fair and reasonable to the company and to all existing shareholders. If the shares are to be issued other than for cash the board must determine the reasonable present cash value of the consideration. Section 35 simply defines a share as personal property. This means that the new Act retains an essentially common law definition of a share. The Income Tax Act mainly relies on the common law understanding of what is and what is not a share (with the exception of section 192 and 195 debentures, which are deemed to be shares for Income Tax Act purposes). There are various provisions in the Revenue Acts which use the terms nominal value, nominal capital or par value. As these terms are obsolete under the new Act, references to them will be replaced. These references are listed in Annex 5.1. The terms nominal value, nominal capital and par value are mainly used in the various Revenue Acts to measure shareholders' interests in companies. It will be possible to replace these terms with the voting and market value interest concepts used in sections 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act. Such a change of terminology can have effect from date of enactment and therefore can apply to companies incorporated under either the Companies Act 1955 or the new Companies Act. 5.3 Measurement of Shareholder Interests In addition to replacing such terms as nominal capital, nominal value and par value, the measurement of shareholder interest rules in section 8A to 8D of the Income Tax Act can also be used to replace references to issued capital, paid- up capital (where this term is not used for distribution purposes) and shares generally where those terms are used as a measurement of company ownership. Those rules are not dependent on the existing terminology of the Companies Act and can therefore be applied more generally in the Income Tax Act. The company control definition in section 7 of the Income Tax Act and the various associated persons definitions are the main areas where the voting and market value interest concepts will be applied. 50 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 5.3.1 Associated Persons and Company Control Definitions As noted above, it is proposed that the company control definition (section 7) and the various associated persons definitions in the Revenue Acts be amended to employ the measurement of shareholder interests rules contained in sections 8A to 8D. Under these rules shareholders' economic interests in a company will generally be measured by reference to their voting interests in that company. In certain limited circumstances, shareholders' interests may need to be determined by reference to both their voting interests and market value interests in the company. Section 7 provides a standard company control definition which is used throughout the Income Tax Act (i.e. there is no multiplicity of definitions as there is with associated persons). By contrast, in addition to the general associated persons definition in section 8, there are currently four other associated persons definitions which apply only for the purposes of certain provisions in the Income Tax Act. They appear in: • section 67 - tax treatment of profits and gains from land transactions; • section 166 - notional interest on loans made to employees under an employee share repurchase scheme; • section 214E - associated persons definition for the petroleum mining regime (sections 214D to 214N). (This definition is also used for section 74 purposes, where in the case of timber sold to an associated person of the seller the seller's deduction for the cost of the timber is limited to the amount of the profit or gain derived by the seller); • section 245B - for purposes of the CFC and FIF regimes in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. (For example, control interests held by associated persons are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC). Each of these definitions also requires amendment to employ the new measurement of shareholders' interests. Similarly, it is proposed to amend the associated persons definition in section 2 of the GST Act. The corporate and nominee look-through rules in existing section 8(2) are inadequate as they only refer to paid-up capital and not nominal capital, even though the latter is also used in section 8(1)(b) as a measure for determining whether a company and any individual are associated persons. The use of voting interest/market value interest tests in the recast section 8 will address this shortcoming. CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 51 5.4 Abolition of Private and Public Company Distinction The new Companies Act does not retain the current distinction between private and public companies, which in effect distinguishes between closely-held and widely-held companies. It is not considered necessary to have a separate regime for closely-held companies in the new Act. The flexibility typically provided by such a regime, such as less formality in management and shareholder decision-making, can be achieved under the new Act by a particular company's constitution providing that various presumptions in the new Act will not apply to that company. Tax references to the existing Companies Act private company definition are listed in Annex 5.2. The use of the private/public company classification in certain Income Tax Act provisions recognises the desirability of distinguishing between closely-held and widely-held companies in certain situations for tax purposes. In light of the absence of a closely/widely-held company distinction in the new Companies Act, those Income Tax Act provisions which currently refer to a private company could use the closely-held company definition contained in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. This would have the advantage of reducing the number of similar definitions. However, there are distinctions between the definitions. While a private company can currently have between 2 and 25 shareholders, there is no associated persons rule whereby associated shareholders are treated as one person. A closely-held company, as defined in section 8B, is a company in which five or fewer shareholders (with associated shareholders such as relatives being treated as one person) have in total over 50 percent of the direct voting interests (or direct market value interests where a market value circumstance exists). After receiving submissions the Government will determine whether its goal of applying a single definition in all circumstances is the best approach. While the closely-held company concept is embodied in various provisions in the Income Tax Act through the use of private company and proprietary company terms, there is no similar need for a widely-held company concept to replace the term "public company" outside of the shareholder continuity provisions. The term public company is used only once in the Income Tax Act, in section 147. This reference can remain as it is defined separately from the Companies Act 1955 and relies currently on the definition of the private company. In short, a public company for section 147 purposes will generally be defined as any company which is not a closely-held company. 52 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES There is a reference to a public company, within the meaning of the Companies Act 1955, in section 35 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 relating to the treatment of evidence in Taxation Review Authority proceedings. It is proposed to replace the public company references in this provision with a reference to the widely-held company definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. 5.5 Proprietary Companies In light of the removal of the private company references in the Income Tax Act, it is appropriate to review the proprietary company definition in section 2 of that Act. That definition also embodies a closely-held company concept of a company with a small number of associated shareholders and where ownership and management are often by the same persons. The proprietary company definition is utilised in various provisions which recognise that transactions between such companies and their shareholders (including persons associated with these shareholders) are more likely than in the case of other companies to be governed by other than arm's length considerations. A proprietary company is defined generally as a company under the control of not more than four persons. Provisions in the Income Tax Act which use the proprietary company definition and the closely held concept that it embodies are set out in Annex 5.3. As discussed in the private company section of this chapter, the closely-held company concept is now also embodied in the appropriately named "closely-held company" definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. It would be desirable if the Income Tax Act could employ a single, general closely-held company definition. Accordingly, it is proposed that the existing proprietary company references in the Income Tax Act also be replaced with the section 8B closely-held company definition. 5.6 Companies Act References Sections of the Revenue Acts which refer to the Companies Act 1955 are listed in Annex 5.4. This does not include Income Tax Act references which are used only for the purpose of defining a private company and which will therefore be omitted when private company references are removed. Immediate replacement of all Companies Act 1955 references with Companies Act 1993 references will not be possible because during the three year transition period following the enactment of the new Companies Act there will continue to exist companies incorporated under the 1955 Act, which will not be repealed until the end of the transition period. Therefore, until the expiration of the transition period there will have to be references in the Revenue Acts to both Companies Acts. CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 53 5.7 One Shareholder/One Share Companies It is possible under the new Companies Act for a company to have only one shareholder and/or one share. Under the present law a company must have a plurality of shareholders and shares (i.e. at least two of each). Many provisions in the Revenue Acts referring to shares or shareholders are predicated on the basis that a company must have a plurality of shares and shareholders and accordingly use words importing the plural number. The advent of one shareholder/one share companies should not, however, be problematical. Section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924, relating to the general interpretation of terms used in New Zealand statutes (unless inconsistent with the express provisions or context of an Act), provides that words and statutes importing the plural number are to include the singular number. Consequential amendments to the Revenue Acts to take account of the possibility of one shareholder/one share companies will therefore not be necessary. 5.8 Company Constitutions: Abolition of Memoranda and Articles of Association A company's constitutional arrangements under the new Act will no longer be governed by a separate memorandum of association (containing the objects of the company and the amount of its authorised share capital) and articles of association (providing for the company's internal government). Instead, each company will have a constitution. The absence of memorandum of association and articles of association terminology in the new Companies Act will involve little change to the Revenue Acts as they already typically use the generic term "constitution". For example, the term is employed in section 394B(2)(c) and the measurement of company ownership provisions in sections 8A to 8D. The few references to "memorandum of association" and "articles of association" in the Revenue Acts (listed in Annex 5.5) can be immediately replaced with the analogous term constitution. 5.9 Other Terminology Changes 5.9.1 Change from Allotment/Allotted to Issue/lssued The new Companies Act refers to shares being issued by a company and the issued shares. This is a change from the language used in the current 54 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Companies Act, which refers to the allotment of shares by a company and the allotted shares. The Income Tax Act currently uses both types of terms (i.e. allotment/allotted and issue/issued) in relation to shares. It would therefore be sensible for reasons of conformity with the new Companies legislation and the standardisation of terms within the Income Tax Act itself to change the allotment/allotted references in the Income Tax Act to the terms "issue" or "issued". In those sections where allotment/allotted is used in tandem with issue/issued, the allotment/allotted references merely need to be omitted. The Income Tax Act sections which currently use allotment/allotted terminology are listed in Annex 5.6. As the allotment/allotted and issue/issued references, in relation to shares, have exactly the same meaning, it will be possible to change these terms from the date of enactment of the taxation legislation. 5.9.2 Change from Wound Up/Winding Up to Liquidated/Liquidation The rules for ending the life of a company have been greatly simplified in the new Act. Partly because of this simplification the following terms used in the Companies Act 1955 - "winding up", "voluntary winding up", "dissolution", and "striking off" - have been able to be dispensed with and replaced simply with the concepts of liquidation and removal from the register in the Companies Act 1993. The term "liquidation" describes the process under which a company's assets are liquidated. The removal from the register of companies (equivalent to dissolution under the Companies Act 1955) is the final step on the liquidation of a company. Removal from the register can also constitute the entire process of ending a company's life in its own right (i.e. a prior liquidation process may not be necessary). It should be noted that where the grounds for the removal from the register are that the Registrar is satisfied that the company is defunct, or the director or shareholders of an insolvent company have applied for it to be removed, notice must be given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This notice allows the Commissioner to object to a company being removed from the register where there is outstanding tax owing by the company. The Income Tax Act currently uses the terms winding up or wound up to describe the process of ending a company's life. Winding up is defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act as including the final dissolution of a company. In order to achieve conformity with the new terminology in the new Companies Act relating to the termination of a company's existence the current Revenue Act references to the terms winding up or wound up (listed in Annex 5.7) CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 55 should be changed to liquidation or liquidated. This change can apply from the date of enactment. The term liquidation should be defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act as including the removal of a company from the register of companies under the new Companies Act or a dissolution under the Companies Act 1955. The reference to dissolution under the Companies Act 1955 can be deleted at the end of the three-year transition period. As with the term liquidation, winding up refers to the process by which a company's life is ended. Dissolution is the final step in the winding up of a company. 5.10 Commissioner's Status as Preferred Creditor Section 312 of the new Companies Act provides that a liquidator, after meeting the claims of secured creditors (other than the claims of debenture holders under any floating charge), must pay out of the assets of the company the preferential claims set out in the Seventh Schedule of the new Act. Clause 2(d) of the Seventh Schedule refers to amounts deducted by the company from the wages or salary of an employee in order to satisfy obligations of the employee. The total sum to which priority can be given under section 2(d) is limited by section 6 of the seventh schedule to $6,000 in the case of any one employee. This section is widely drafted and could include PAYE liability. The Commissioner would, however, rely on his specific priority under clause 5 in respect of this liability. Clause 2(e) of the Seventh Schedule includes any amounts relating to child support which are required to be deducted from an employee's wages or salary by a company and paid to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in accordance with the Child Support Act 1991. Clause 5 of the Seventh Schedule gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue preferred creditor status in respect of: • GST; • source deduction payments under Part XI of the Income Tax Act (this specifically includes PAYE obligations without any limit as to the amount to which priority is given); • non-resident withholding tax deductions; • resident withholding tax deductions. Clause 9 of the Seventh Schedule provides that after a liquidator's or receiver's expenses are met all other preferential claims rank equally and if a company's assets are insufficient to meet them the debts abate and are paid in equal proportions. 56 CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Clause 9 also provides that preferential debts are paid in priority to the claims of holders of debentures under any floating charge. If the assets available for payment of general creditors are insufficient to satisfy preferential debts, then the shortfall can be taken from assets which are subject to a floating charge. The existing preferential creditor status of the Commissioner is unchanged by Clause 5 of the Seventh Schedule, which specifically states the nature and extent of the Commissioner's priority. The Commissioner's preferred creditor status is not specifically referred to in section 308 of the Companies Act 1955 (the equivalent provision to section 312); instead, this status is "imported" by specific provisions in the GST Act (section 42) and the Income Tax Act (section 365(2)(b)). It is proposed to amend these preferred creditor provisions in the Revenue Acts so that they contain cross-references to the Seventh Schedule to the new Companies Act. 5.11 Summary of Proposals The proposals in this chapter are that: (a) The current references in the Revenue Acts to nominal capital, nominal value, par value, issued capital, paid-up capital and shares generally - where those terms are used to measure shareholders' interests in companies - be replaced with the concepts of voting interest and market value interest contained in the measurement of company ownership rules in sections 8A - 8D of the Income Tax Act. (b) The Income Tax Act employ a single, general closely-held company definition (outside the qualifying company regime) which would be substituted for the current private company and proprietary company references in the Income Tax Act. (c) The public company reference in section 35 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 be replaced with a reference to the widely-held company definition in section 8B of the Income Tax Act. (d) Other existing company law references in the Inland Revenue Acts identified in Annexes 5.4 to 5.7 be amended to align the Revenue Acts with the new definitions and concepts used in the Companies Act 1993.

In the interests of brevity, the commentary is confined to amendments that are considered to be significant and complex and that are not described in detail in the discussion document. The commentary should be regarded as a guide only, and it does not, for interpretation purposes, override the actual words used in the legislation. Section 3(1) The definition of "bonus issue" will be amended to reflect the absence of a company law concept of capitalisation. The definition of "non-taxable bonus issue" will be retained, but will in future be synonymous with a share split. The term "ten year bonus issue" will be repealed. Amounts bonus issued between 31 March 1982 and 1 October 1988 which have served their time or which are paid up after 20 August 1985 and sourced from capital gain amounts and qualifying share premium are credited to subscribed capital (see item i(i) of "Transitional capital amount" in section 4A(3)). Section 3(2) Section 3(2) will be repealed as "subscribed capital" is not reduced where losses are written off. The provision is therefore unnecessary. Section 3(3) Section 3(3) will also be repealed. The replacement subsection provides a mechanism for determining for tax purposes how much is converted to subscribed capital by a taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu). This is required because there is no longer a distinction between the types of reserves for company law purposes and therefore no external reference point for determining the amount bonus issued. The amount credited to subscribed capital is the amount which the company elects is bonus issued (by notifying the Commissioner). The amount of dividend arising on a taxable bonus issue is the amount per share that the company so elects (section 4(6)). The provision only applies to New Zealand resident companies. Section 4(1) and (3) It appears that there is no reason for the specific inclusion of "specified payments" in section 4(1)(a). "Specified payments" are defined in sections 4(3) EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 71 and 4A(2) as (in effect) share premium. Distributions of share premium in cash appear to be covered in the general category "all sums in money" in paragraph (a). The proposed deletion of this term does not reflect any change in policy in relation to distributions of share premium. Section 4(1)(g) This paragraph has been redrafted to make it clear that amounts paid to shareholders on the acquisition by a company of its shares are included in the dividend definition (to the extent that they are not excluded under section 4A). Section 4(7A) New subsection (7A) reverses the tax effect of a distribution which is subsequently recovered by an insolvent company. The provision operates on the assumption that the net dividend (that is, the dividend less any resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax) will be recovered from the shareholder. The RWT or NRWT will be refunded by the Commissioner directly to the company. Section 4(12) The Government is concerned that companies, rather than purchase their own shares, will arrange for related companies to acquire those shares in order to avoid the dividend consequences that attach to the repurchase of shares. Such arrangements are likely to be caught by section 99(5). However, section 99(5) does not adequately deal with the tax consequences of an on-market repurchase. Accordingly, section 4(12) will clarify how section 99(5) will apply in such circumstances. Where a company arranges for a related company to purchase shares in substitution for an on-market buy back, section 4(12) in effect provides that a debit will arise to the imputation credit account of the company that issued the shares. Section 4(15) Section 4(15) will be amended to provide that where a person holds shares on revenue account, and sells those shares off-market to the company, the shareholder is taxed on the profit on sale only to the extent it exceeds the dividend (exclusive of imputation credits) arising on the sale. 72 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION Section 4A(1)(c) The new section 4A(1)(c) excludes from the dividend definition, if the conditions set out in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) are satisfied, amounts returned to shareholders when a company repurchases, redeems or cancels its shares (other than on liquidation) up to the amount of subscribed capital and realised capital gain per share. Subparagraph(i) This subparagraph contains the "brightline tests" discussed in section 2.4.4 of the discussion document. Subparagraph (ii) The brightline tests do not apply to fixed rate shares. The subscribed capital will be tax-free on redemption of such a share (assuming the anti-dividend substitution provisions in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) do not apply). Subparagraph (iii) This subparagraph contains a redraft of the current anti-dividend substitution provision. Subparagraph (iv) This provision contains the "slice rule" described in sections 2.3.1 and 2.4.3 of the discussion document. Section 4A(1)(ca) This paragraph excludes from the dividend definition amounts returned to shareholders when the company's shares are redeemed or cancelled upon its liquidation. The exclusion is limited to the aggregate of the subscribed capital per share and realised and unrealised capital gains per share. Section 4A(1)(cb) This paragraph excludes from the dividend definition amounts returned to shareholders when a company repurchases its shares on the stock market. Such amounts are treated as dividends only for the purposes of: - requiring that a debit arises to the repurchasing company's imputation credit account in relation to the dividend component of a distribution; EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 73 - enabling section 99(5) to apply (in the circumstances where it can apply) where there is an on-market acquisition; - the recovery of dividend provisions in section 4(7A). Section 4A(1)(h) Paragraph (h) will be repealed because losses written off will not affect a company's "subscribed capital amount" (defined in new section 4A(3)). Section 4A(3) A new section 4A(3) will replace the current provision. It will contain definitions of new terms to be used in section 4A as well as amended definitions of terms currently in use. The terms used are in relation to a single share. "Excess return amount” This formula is used in section 4A(1)(c) and (ca). It distinguishes between realised capital gains (item d) that may be distributed tax free on a cancellation or repurchase of shares, and unrealised capital gains (item e) which are available for tax free distribution only on liquidation. The formula spreads such gains across all shares of the company, other than fixed rate shares. Paragraph (ii) of the present item e has been broadened to align that paragraph with section 4A(11). "Fixed rate share" Fixed rate shares are essentially shares in respect of which the rate of dividends paid is not commensurate with the company's profits. The definition in this subsection is similar to the definition of that term in sections 8B and 63(2D). It has a further requirement that there be no shareholder decision- making rights available to the holder of the shares except in very limited circumstances. "Fully credited" This term is used in the definition of "subscribed capital amount" (item f(iv)) and discussed in section 4.2.5 of the discussion document. The calculation of the subscribed capital amount of a share excludes: 74 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION - taxable bonus issues made to shareholders who are exempt from tax under section 63; and - consideration received by a company on the issue of shares which is attributable to the payment by the company of a dividend exempt to those shareholders. The exclusion applies except to the extent to which the taxable bonus issue or the dividend is fully credited. "Fully credited" in relation to a dividend thus refers to that proportion of a dividend which is credited with imputation or withholding payment credits at the maximum imputation ratio. "Ineligible capital amount" This concept is the "anti-avoidance" provision referred to in section 4.2.6 of the discussion document. The term is used in the definition of subscribed capital amount (item f(vi)). It is intended to prevent the inflation of the subscribed capital of an acquired company in anticipation of a share swap. "Subscribed capital amount" The subscribed capital amount is a new concept which refers in essence to consideration received by a company on the issue of its shares. Its relevance is in determining the amount that can be distributed tax-free to shareholders under section 4A(1)(c) and (ca) described above. The predecessors of the subscribed capital amount are the current "returned capital amount" and "returned share premium amount" which effectively compute the subscribed capital per share based on an overall average of shares ever issued of the same class. It is considered that the current returned capital amount computation will be deficient in the context of the "slice rule" in that where less than market value is paid for a share the rule restricts the amount of subscribed capital that may be returned to shareholders. Accordingly, there is a need for a new concept of subscribed capital which is based on a "moving average". The "moving average" formula will in effect calculate subscribed capital attributable to shares on issue at any particular time. Subscribed capital amount is thus the aggregate of:- - for a company that was in existence before the application date, its "transitional capital amount" (see below); and - consideration received by a company on the issue (after the application date) of shares of the same class as the share being cancelled (subject to certain exclusions); EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 75 less - subscribed capital amounts which have previously been returned to shareholders on the cancellation of shares of that class on or after the application date and which have been treated as tax-free distributions under section 4A(1)(c). The result of the above calculation is divided by the number of shares of the same class on issue immediately prior to the relevant cancellation. It is important to note (see item f(vi) in the calculation) that the amounts making up the consideration received by a company on the issue of its shares do not include consideration in the form of shares in another company acquired by the company to the extent to which the value of those shares exceeds the subscribed capital amounts (after deducting the ineligible capital amounts ) in respect of such shares. Thus, if (for example) a company ("A Co") issues shares to a shareholder of another company ("B Co") in exchange for shares in B Co the subscribed capital amount of A Co increases only by the subscribed capital amount attributable to the shares acquired in B Co (calculated after deducting the ineligible capital amount). "Transitional capital amount' This term is only relevant to companies formed before the application date. As noted above, the calculation of the subscribed capital amount based on a moving average will require knowledge of amounts of subscribed capital paid up on shares of a class currently on issue. It was thought that it may be time consuming for companies to identify amounts of paid up capital returned to shareholders on shares previously cancelled. Therefore, the simplest solution was to include in the subscribed capital amount calculation, a "transitional" amount which would relieve companies from having to identify those amounts. The transitional capital amount is thus simply an amount calculated by multiplying the outstanding shares in each class by the returned capital and share premium amounts determined under the current averaging formula. Section 191WD Corporate Amalgamations Some corporate amalgamations qualify for particular taxation treatment under this section. The taxation treatment minimises administrative impediments to corporate restructuring through amalgamations by permitting, for example, tax- free asset transfers on amalgamation and preservation of accumulated losses 76 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION and imputation credits for use by the amalgamated company. The provision also details the tax consequences for non-qualifying amalgamations. Section 191WD(1) This subsection contains a number of definitions relevant to the operation of section 191WD. It limits the particular taxation treatment to "qualifying amalgamations" occurring under the 1955 and 1993 Companies Acts. Each amalgamating company must be an "eligible company" (essentially resident in New Zealand and not exempt from income tax). Amalgamations between qualifying and non-qualifying companies are not qualifying amalgamations. Section 191WD(2) Amalgamating companies have up to 63 days from the date documentation evidencing the amalgamation is given to the Company Registrar for registration purposes to give notice of the amalgamation in writing to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Section 191WD(3) This subsection explains how to calculate the subscribed capital amount of shares issued in the amalgamated company. It has the same effect as item f(vi) in the definition of subscribed capital amount (a separate provision is included here as the term ineligible capital amount referred to in that item relates only to the acquisition of shares). Except as discussed in relation to subsection (4), generally the subscribed capital amount of the amalgamating company becomes subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. However, a portion of the amalgamating company's subscribed capital may be ineligible to be attributed in this way. This restriction is intended to prevent an amalgamating company increasing the level of its subscribed capital in anticipation of amalgamation with another company, in order to inflate the amount which may be credited to subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. This provision is only triggered to the extent a shareholder in the amalgamating company receives cash or other liquid property for shares converted. Section 191WD(4) The effect of this subsection is to subtract the subscribed capital of shares held by an amalgamating company and cancelled upon an amalgamation from the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. The subscribed capital attributable to the cancelled shares therefore does not form part of the subscribed capital of the amalgamated company. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 77 Section 191WD(5) The transfer of assets out of an amalgamating company may affect the market value of the shares held by an amalgamating company in that company. The cancellation of the shares and the issue of new shares in the amalgamated company in effect result merely in the gain or loss being transferred to the amalgamated company. Accordingly, this provision prevents that gain or loss from being taken into account by deeming the amalgamating shareholder company to have disposed of the shares at their opening book value (for shares purchased in prior years ) and at cost ( for newly acquired shares ). Section 191WD(6) This provision ensures the continuity of the liabilities and rights of an amalgamating company that ceases to exist after the amalgamation. For tax purposes, this ensures continuity of the amalgamating company's objection rights, loss election rights and rights to refunds. Section 191WD(7) Income received by the amalgamated company for the provision of services by an amalgamating company is treated as assessable in the recipient's hands if the income would have been assessable to the amalgamating company that provided the services. Section 191WD(8) Taxation consequences apply on the transfer of assets in a non-qualifying amalgamation. There is a deemed disposal at market value. Section 191WD(9) This subsection contains several provisions relating to the tax treatment of the asset transfers that occur from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company. First, it provides for the tax-free transfer of assets other than trading stock at the time of amalgamation. In determining the assessable income that may arise later to the amalgamated company in respect of these assets, the consolidation provisions in section 191N(1) to (4) apply with some modifications. Second, the transfer of trading stock of the amalgamating company to trading stock of the amalgamated company is treated as a deemed disposal at opening book value (for trading stock on hand) and at cost ( for new acquisitions ). This 78 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION prevents movements in the opening and closing values to the date of amalgamation being taken into account by the amalgamating company. Third, it provides for tax to be payable where an asset is converted from revenue account to capital account on amalgamation. This provision ensures the tax-free treatment of asset transfers is not used to convert assets without taxation consequences. Section 191WD(10) This subsection provides for a deemed consideration for the base price calculation required on the transfer of a financial arrangement (of which the amalgamating company is the issuer) to an amalgamated company. In certain circumstances, for example, where the same method of allocating income or expenditure is used by both the amalgamating and amalgamated companies, the deemed consideration is one that results either in a nil allocation or a fair and reasonable allocation. Where a different method of allocation is used, the market price of the financial arrangement is taken into account. This provision is identical to the treatment of financial arrangements of which the amalgamating company is the holder. Section 191WD(11) An amalgamating company that ceases to exist may, subject to certain conditions, carry forward any accumulated loss, attributed foreign loss, foreign investment fund loss or tax credit into the amalgamated company. The amalgamated company is allowed to succeed to losses of an amalgamating company only if the shareholder continuity requirement is satisfied with respect to the amalgamating company after the amalgamation, and immediately prior to the amalgamation, offset of the losses of that amalgamating company was allowable against the income of all the other amalgamating companies. Section 191WD(12) This subsection provides an ordering rule for the offset of losses and the tax credits referred to in subsection (11) of two or more amalgamating companies against the future income or tax liability of the amalgamated company. Section 191WD(13) The liability of an amalgamated company to make provisional tax instalment payments after an amalgamation is based on the residual income tax of the preceding income year of each amalgamating company. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION 79 Section 191WD(14) This subsection contains several provisions relating to debits and credits of an amalgamating company in its imputation credit account, dividend withholding payment account, branch equivalent tax account and policyholder credit account. First it provides for the pre-amalgamation debits and credits to be treated with effect from the amalgamation as debits and credits of the amalgamated company provided the continuity of shareholding has been maintained. Second, it provides the mechanism for posting any debits or credits of an amalgamating company that arise after the amalgamation to the equivalent accounts of the amalgamated company. Finally, it mirrors the limits applying to refunds contained in sections 394M and 394ZO of the Act. Section 327C(1) Resident withholding tax on taxable bonus issues (except bonus issues in lieu) will be calculated under paragraph (c). For the purposes of item b of the formula, the dividend paid is the amount which the company elects to transfer to subscribed capital. Paragraph (d) will be redrafted so that it applies only to a bonus issue in lieu. Section 394E(1) and (2) Where a company repurchases shares on-market, a debit arises to that company's imputation credit account. The formula for calculating the amount of the debit is contained in proposed new paragraph (1)(ab). The debit arises on the date of acquisition of the shares. The slice rule automatically applies in calculating the debit amount, i.e. the brightline tests do not apply in relation to an on-market repurchase. Section 394ZW (1) This section will be amended to remove the reference to refunds under section 394ZO. This is to accommodate a refund of dividend withholding payment arising on the recovery of a dividend distribution from a corporate shareholder by a non-resident insolvent company. 80 EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE DRAFT LEGISLATION DRAFT LEGISLATION - 1 - TAXATION IMPLICATIONS OF COMPANY LAW REFORM - DRAFT LEGISLATION Income Tax Act 1976 OO.
