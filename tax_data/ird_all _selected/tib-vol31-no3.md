The table published in the _Hybrid mismatches_ item on page 42 (titled "Table 1: New Zealand's implementation of the OECD recommendations") is incorrect.  
  
The second part of that table ("Specific rule recommendations") should have contained the following information:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Section | Rec. | Hybrid mismatch | Hybrid arrangement | Corresponding branch agreement | Counteraction | Scope |

| Subpart EX | 5   | D/NI | Reverse hybrids – specific rules\*\*\* | Disregarded branch structure and diverted branch payments | 5.1 Improve CFC and other offshore rules  <br>5.2 Turn off transparency/non-taxation  <br>5.3 Improved disclosure | Specific to NZ's domestic law |
