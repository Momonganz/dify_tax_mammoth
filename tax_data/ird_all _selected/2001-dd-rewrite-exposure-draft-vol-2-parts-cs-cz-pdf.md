Comment:Current section CB 2 (1)(c) exempts personal services income earned by visitors to New Zealand if the visit ‘does not exceed a period of 92 days’. This draft section makes clear that the day of arrival and the day of departure each counts as a whole day for the purpose of calculating the 92-day period. The change makes the provision consistent with current section OE 1 (4) (Determination of residence of person other than a company), which directs part days to be included when calculating the 183-day period for residency, and is a clarification proposed in issues paper 1, page 6.

Comment:Current section CB 2 (1)(a)(ii) denies exempt status to a visiting non- resident entertainer if the activity or performance occurs under the programme of an overseas foundation, trust, or other organisation that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder. However, the policy underlying that wording is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a private pecuniary profit. The class ‘any proprietor, member or shareholder’ has therefore been widened to ‘any person’ in draft Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 204 CW – Exempt income subsection (1)(b)(ii). This change was proposed in issues paper 1, page 5. The qualifier ‘directly or indirectly’ has also been added, as this is also consistent with the underlying policy.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CW – Exempt income 213 Comment:Current section CB 3 (b)(i) exempts any amount derived by a local authority other than ‘an amount received in trust’. The draft provision makes clear that the amounts intended to be exempted are amounts which a local authority receives as a trustee. This clarification was proposed in issues paper 2, page 2. A reference to airport companies in current section CB 3 (b)(ii)(B) has been obsolete since July 2000, when section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974 ceased to exclude airport companies from the definition of 'local authority trading enterprise' in that section.

Comment:Current section CB 4 (1)(h) denies exempt status to a society or association established for promoting any amateur game or sport if any part of its funds are used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder. However, the policy underlying that wording is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a private pecuniary profit.
