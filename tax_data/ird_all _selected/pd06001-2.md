PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 06/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by LetterBox Channel Limited (“LBC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of New Zealand Post Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the ITA”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections DA 2(4), CE 1 ; definitions of “employment income”, “extra pay”, “income from employment”, “salary or wages”, and “withholding payment” in section OB 1 ; the definition of “source deduction payment” in section OB 2(1); the definition of “PAYE rules” in section OB 1 , regulation 4(1) and clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”); and section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“The GST Act”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (“the Runners”) by Franchisees pursuant to a standard form contract for the delivery of newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. LBC carries on the business of distributing newspapers, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2. LBC intends to implement a franchise model under which Franchisees will engage the Runners pursuant to a standard form contract, the conditions contained in which are required to be agreed to by the Runners when entering into the contact (“the Contract”). 3. The Contract requires Runners to deliver particular items within a specified period, to each house, flat or other premises located within a designated area, by placing one of each item in each letter box (or other specified location). The Runners are paid specified rates per item delivered. 4. The Contract is attached to this Ruling as Appendix I. 5. The items delivered by the Runners pursuant to the Contract are not items the carrying of which requires LBC or the relevant Franchisee to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: • The relationship between a Franchisee and the Runners is, and during the period of this Ruling will continue to be, entirely in accordance with the Contract affixed to this Ruling as Appendix I, and there are no other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, relating to the engagement of the Runners. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” within the meaning of those terms as defined in section OB 1. To the extent that any such payment is also not a “withholding payment” it will therefore not be a “source deduction payment” as defined in section OB 2(1), for the purposes of the PAYE rules. • For the purposes of sections DA 2(4) and CE 1 , any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be “income from employment’ or “employment income” as those terms are defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not be a “withholding payment” as defined in section OB 1. • For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Runner by a Franchisee pursuant to the Contract will not fall within the class of payment specified in clause 5(d) of Part A of the Schedule to the Regulations and will not be declared to be a “withholding payment” by regulation 4(1) of the Regulations. • For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Runner to a Franchisee under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of that Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 This Ruling is signed on the 8 day of March 2006 by: Maryanne Hansen Manager, Corporates Appendix 1 «Fr\_Co\_Name» FRANCHISEE LIMITED CONTRACT FOR SERVICES (Delivery of papers/circulars etc) The delivery of circulars has become part of our Kiwi culture.

This contract does not therefore create an employment relationship between you and «Fr\_Co\_Name». You are free to accept other engagements or work while you are engaged by «Fr\_Co\_Name». However you agree not to undertake other work which conflicts with, or may conflict with, the interests of «Fr\_Co\_Name». NO LIABILITY You will undertake the Deliveries at your own risk.

DELIVERY OPTIONS It is your responsibility to carry out the Deliveries as required under this contract. If you are sick or not able to personally carry out the Deliveries then you must arrange for others (such as a friend or family member) to do so. When you do this, you will be solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who assist you in this way. If you are unable to meet your contractual obligations to ensure the product is delivered within the Delivery window then you must notify «Fr\_Co\_Name» immediately. FREQUENCY OF DELIVERIES «Fr\_Co\_Name» does not guarantee any minimum amount of Deliveries as the volume of material available for distribution will vary depending on the time of year and needs of Letterbox Channel’s customers – «Fr\_Co\_Name» will do its best to advise you of anticipated volumes as far in advance as possible. COMPETITIONS You and your immediate family members may be prevented from entering competitions advertised in material delivered by you, under the terms and conditions of those competitions. ISSUES If issues arise between «Fr\_Co\_Name» and you, both parties agree to raise and discuss issues in an open manner.

If the issues are still unresolved after mediation has taken place, either you or «Fr\_Co\_Name» can refer them to the Disputes Tribunal for a binding decision to be made if the claim is for an amount less than $12,000. If the matter remains unresolved, the matter can be referred to the District Court for a binding ruling. If the amount claimed is greater then $12,000 then the matter can be referred to the District Court for a binding decision. The process to be followed is outlined further in Schedule 5. HEALTH AND SAFETY While «Fr\_Co\_Name» will make reasonable efforts to ensure that you operate safely, you are required to take all practical steps to ensure your own safety, and the safety of others and inform «Fr\_Co\_Name» immediately if any safety issues arise.
