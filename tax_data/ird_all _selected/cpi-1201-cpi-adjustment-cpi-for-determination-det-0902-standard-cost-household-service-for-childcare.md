=========================================================================================================

CPI Adjustment CPI 12/01 (2012) for Determination DET-09/02: Standard-cost household service for childcare providers.

#### Important note of change

[Please read "Changes/clarifications to Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers ("Educators")"](/determinations/standard-cost-household-service/childcare-providers/det-0902-changesclarifications-to-determination-det-0902-standard-cost-household-service-for-childca)

In accordance with the provisions of Determination DET 09/02, as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume 21, Number 4 (June 2009), Inland Revenue advises that, for the 2012 income year:

1.  The variable standard-cost component will increase from $3.29 per hour per child to $3.34 per hour per child; and
2.  The administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost component will increase from $321 per annum to $326 per annum, for a full 52 weeks of childcare services provided.

The above amounts have been adjusted in accordance with the annual movement of the Consumers Price Index for the twelve months to March 2012, which showed an increase of 1.6%. For childcare providers who have a standard 31 March balance date, the new amounts apply for the period from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012.
