30 March 2017 BEPS -Interest limitation rules c/o Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P 0 Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140. By email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Dear Madam J ,,,. SKYCITY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP SKYCITY Entertainment Group Limited Federal House 86 Federal Street PO Box 6443 Wellesley Street Auckland New Zealand Telephone +64 (0)9 363 6141 Facsimile +64 (0)9 363 6140 www.skycitygroup.co. nz The following brief submission has been prepared by SKYCITY Entertainment Group Limited on the discussion document released by officials titled "BEPS -Strengthening our interest limitation rules". SKYCITY Entertainment Group Limited is a member of the Corporate Taxpayers Group. SKYCITY supports the objective to ensure New Zealand collects its fair share of tax from investments made by foreigners in New Zealand. SKYCITY is listed in both New Zealand and Australia and its share register shows approximately 66% foreign shareholders. Its largest shareholders are primarily custodial holdings. In addition, SKYCITY has substantial investments in Australia and operates casinos in both Adelaide and Darwin. T he operators of the two casinos are Australian resident companies. The discussion document proposes that the current thin capitalisation ratios of 60% for inbound investment and 75% for outbound investment are retained but the way the ratio is calculated will be narrowed by including non-debt liabilities and by removing the current provision that allows the revaluation of assets for the purpose of the thin capitalisation calculation when that revaluation is not included in the entity's financial statements. The effect of these two changes is likely to have a significant impact on the interest deductibility of entities subject to either or both the inbound or outbound thin capitalisation rules. If an entity breaches the outbound thin capitalisation rules in New Zealand, having borrowed to invest or loan funds cross border, it may then breach the inbound thin capitalisation rules in the country into which it is investing, and would be subject to the denial of interest deductions in both countries for the same investment. It appears from the discussion document New Zealand is moving to align its thin capitalisation rules with those of Australia. However, there are significant differences in the approach proposed under this discussion document and the Australian legislation, in particular with regard to revaluation of assets and including intangible assets in the thin capitalisation calculation. The Australian legislation provides that as a general rule an entity must comply with the accounting standards when revaluing its assets for the purpose of calculating its thin capitalisation liability. However, an entity can choose to revalue an asset, including an intangible asset for these purposes as long as it meets stringent requirements. The valuation must be in writing and must be made before the due date for lodging the relevant income tax return. If the revaluation is included in the financial statements, an external expert is not required to undertake the revaluation, but if the revaluation is not included in the financial statements, the assets must be revalued by a person who is an expert in valuing such assets and whose pecuniary and other interests could not reasonably be regarded as being capable of affecting the person's ability to give an unbiased opinion in relation to the revaluation. We have attached a copy of the relevant Australian legislation. #001 SKYCITY submits that if New Zealand is not going to follow the best practice as set out by the OECD and limit interest deductions by way of an EBITDA ratio, and is going to tighten its current thin capitalisation rules in line with the Australian legislation, it should adopt the same position as Australia on revaluation of assets and include intangibles in the asset calculation and not exclude this aspect of the legislation. An entity that does not wish to include the revaluation of an asset in its financial statements but wishes to include the current value in its thin capitalisation calculation could be required to have the assets valued by a member of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers. In SKTCITY's opinion, a revaluation of assets by an independent professional firm for the purposes of the thin capitalisation regime would result in a greater level of scrutiny than may be the case if the assets were not revalued by an expert but were instead revalued by the company directors or employees. In some cases the accounting standards may preclude the recognition of an intangible asset from being included in the financial statements. An example of this in New Zealand is the SKYCITY Casino licences. Banks lend on the value and earning potential of intangibles such as a licence and, with sufficient rigour imposed on the process, there should be no reason for such assets to be excluded from the thin capitalisation calculation. There can be many reasons entities do not include revaluations in their balance sheets, and entities taking this conservative approach should not be penalised by the removal of the net current valuation method from the list of available valuation methods for thin capitalisation. The discussion document states that the objective of the thin capitalisation rules is to prevent companies from shifting profits out of New Zealand through excessive interest deductions. Does a thin capitalisation regime that focuses on debt, equity and assets and not actual earnings or profits achieve this goal? If the regime is to be based on debt, equity and assets, then the calculation should include all measurable assets, including intangible assets, at current net value. As noted in the discussion document, New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment. If the majority of countries from which New Zealand sources investment adopt the recommendations set out in the OECD report then the EBITDA ratio method will be more widely understood than a method based on a ratio of debt to equity. The OECD proposals are designed to ensure that profits are taxed where the underlying economic activity occurs and where value is created. It is not clear that a regime which focuses on debt, equity and assets rather than actual earnings achieves this result. SKYCITY submits that the aspects of the Australian thin capitalisation regime relating to the revaluation of assets by an independent expert should be included in the New Zealand legislation. If this does not occur, the "best practice" approach provided in the OECD's final report on BEPS, (Action 4 Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments), of an EBITDA based ratio should be adopted. I agree to Inland Revenue contacting me to discuss the above brief submission if required. Yours faithfully Richard Smyth Deputy Chief Financial Officer SKYCITY Entertainment Group Limitetpage 2 Home I Business I Thin capitalisation I Understanding thin capitalisation I Average values for debt and capital levels I Revaluing assets Revaluing assets J. a.o~;;; J. vJ. ..... Assets can be revalued for thin capitalisation purposes, provided the revaluation is done in accordance with accounting standards, even if they are not also revalued for accounting purposes. Once an asset is revalued, the asset must continue to be revalued in accordance with the frequency set out in the accounting standards. If the entity does not continue to revalue in accordance with the accounting standards, then it cannot use the original revaluation for the period that it fails to comply with the accounting standards in this regard. lt must use the value specified in its financial statements. If the revaluation is done for the purposes of calculating the entity's thin capitalisation position and is reflected in its financial statements that it is required by Australian law to prepare, the revaluation does not need to be done by either an external expert or an internal expert. However, if either the entity is not required to prepare financial statements or it is required to but the revaluation is not reflected in those statements, the revaluation must be done by either an external expert or by an internal expert. External expert An independent expert is a person: • who is an expert in relation to valuations of that class of assets, and • whose pecuniary or other interests could not reasonably be regarded as being capable of affecting that person's ability to give an unbiased opinion in relation to that valuation. https:llwww.ato.gov.au/businesslthin-capitalisation/understanding-thin-capitalisation/... 2810312017 Revaluing assets I Australian Taxation Office Page 2 of 4 Internal expert An internal expert must be a person who is an expert in valuing such assets, and • whose pecuniary or other interests could reasonably be regarded as affecting the person Is ability to give an unbiased opinion but only because the person would be one of the following \_\_. performing duties as an employee of the entity \_\_. providing services to the entity under an arrangement with the entity that is substantially similar to a contract of employment. To be an acceptable value , the internal expert must make the revaluation in accordance with a methodology that has been reviewed and accepted as suitable by an external expert- see criteria above. The review of the methodology by the external expert must include the validity of any assumptions made, and the accuracy and reliability of the data and other information to be used . Revaluing an asset in a class of assets The values used for thin capitalisation purposes are the values calculated under the accounting standards. If the accounting standards require an asset to be revalued at certain intervals, the entity must comply with this for thin capitalisation purposes as well. A strict adherence to this would require that once an asset in a class is revalued, all the assets in that class must be revalued. The thin capitalisation rules will allow an entity to revalue one or more assets in the class only, provided that no asset in the class of assets has fallen in value. Example 8: Revaluing assets Two assets in the same class- asset A and B- have a carrying value of $1,000 and $2,000 respectively . The entity wants to revalue asset A but not asset B. In the relevant income year, asset A has increased in value to $1,200 and the value of asset B has remained the same. https :/ / www .a to . gov .au/busine ss/ thin-capitalisatio n/understanding- thin-cap italisation/. .. 2 8/03 /20 1 7 Because, as a class, no asset has fallen in value, asset A can be revalued without having to also revalue asset B. However, if the value of asset B had fallen to $800, asset A could not be revalued without asset B also being revalued. See also: • section 820-680 (/law/view/document?docid = PAC/19970038/820-680) of the ITAA 1997. Revaluation records An entity must keep records in relation to the revaluation containing details about all of the following: • the methodology used in making the revaluation, including any assumptions that may have been made • how the methodology was applied, including information used • who made the revaluation, their qualifications and their experience as an expert in valuing assets of the relevant kind • the remuneration and expenses paid to that person. Where the revaluation was made by the internal expert, the records must also include the following details: • who the external expert was that reviewed the methodology for the valuation • the external expert 1 S qualifications and experience as an expert in valuing assets of the relevant kind • the remuneration and expenses paid to the external expert • the external expert 1 S review of the methodology and their agreement that the methodology is suitable. All records must be prepared by the time the entity must lodge its tax return for the income year for which the revaluation is made. https://www.ato.gov.aulbusiness/thin-capitalisation/understanding-thin-capitalisation/... 28/03/2017 Revaluing assets I Australian Taxation Office Page 4 of4 However records need not be kept where the asset was revalued subject to subsection 820-680(2A) of the IT AA 1997.
