ARTICLE 2 Taxes covered 1 The existing taxes to which this Agreement shall apply are: (a) in New Zealand, the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"); and (b) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, income tax imposed under the national laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (hereinafter referred to as "Marshall Islands tax"). 2 This Agreement shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of this Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other within a reasonable period of time of any substantial changes to the taxation laws covered by this Agreement. 3 This Agreement shall not apply to taxes imposed by municipalities, local authorities, or possessions of a Contracting State. ARTICLE 3 Definitions 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (b) the term "the Republic of Marshall Islands" means; any land territory within the territorial limits of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and includes the internal waters and territorial sea of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (c) the term "competent authority" means in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner and, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; the Secretary of Finance or an authorised representative of the Secretary of Finance; (d) the term "Contracting State" means New Zealand or the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as the context requires; (e) the term "national", in relation to a Contracting State, means any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; (f) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (g) the term "tax" means New Zealand tax or Marshall Islands tax as the context requires; and (h) the term "transfer pricing adjustment" means an adjustment made by the competent authority of a Contracting State to the profits of an enterprise as a result of applying the domestic law concerning taxes referred to in Article 2 of that State regarding transfer pricing. 2 As regards the application of this Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State, for the purposes of the taxes to which this Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. ARTICLE 4 Resident 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means: (a) in the case of New Zealand, a person who is a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax; and (b) in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a person who is a resident of the Marshall Islands for the purposes of Marshall Islands tax; and 2 A person is not a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of this Agreement if the person is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is not subject to the most comprehensive taxation provided under the national tax laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 3 Where by reason of the preceding provisions of this Article a person, being an individual, is a resident of both Contracting States, then the person's status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to that individual; if a permanent home is available in both States, or in neither of them, that individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (c) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve the question by mutual agreement. 4 Where, by reason of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. ARTICLE 5 Pensions 1 Pensions, (including government pensions) annuities and other remunerations paid to an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State. 2 Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to an individual who is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 3 However, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall not apply where the pension, payment, annuities or other remuneration is not subject to tax in the Contracting State of which the individual is a resident. ARTICLE 6 Government Service 1 (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such payments shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Government referred to in paragraph 1 may be taxed in accordance with the laws of a Contracting State. ARTICLE 7 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice, who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is temporarily present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training, receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 8 Mutual agreement procedure IN RESPECT OF TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS 1 Where a resident of a Contracting State considers the actions of the other Contracting State results or will result in a transfer pricing adjustment not in accordance with the armï¿½s length principle, the resident may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the first-mentioned State. The case must be presented within 3 years of the first notification of the adjustment. 2 The competent authorities shall endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of the armï¿½s length principle by a Contracting State regarding transfer pricing adjustments. They may also communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. ARTICLE 9 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement. Information may be exchanged by the competent authorities for the purposes of this Article in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes concluded by the Contracting States (whether or not this Agreement, in whole or in part,ï¿½forms part of the domestic law of either Contracting State). ARTICLE 10 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Contracting States shall notify each other, in writing, through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall, provided an Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes is in force between the Contracting States, thereupon have effect: (a) in respect of New Zealand tax, for any year of income beginning on or after 1ï¿½April in the calendar year following the date on which this Agreement enters into force; and (b) in respect of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, for any year of income beginning on or after 1 October in the calendar year next following the date on which this Agreement enters into force. Article 11 Termination 1 This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely, but either of the Contracting States may give to the other Contracting State through the diplomatic channel written notice of termination. 2 Such termination shall become effective: (a) in respect of New Zealand tax, in the year of income beginning on or after 1ï¿½April in the calendar year following that in which the notice of termination is given; (b) in respect of Marshall Islands tax, in the year of income beginning on or after 1 October in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 3 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 or 2, this Agreement shall, on receipt through the diplomatic channel of written notice of termination of the Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes between the Contracting States, terminate and cease to be effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of six (6) months after the date of receipt of such notice. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised by their respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.
