KOWHEORI-19 Ngā pakihi me ngā whakahaere COVID-19 Business and organisations
============================================================================

Many businesses and organisations will have changed the way they operate to respond to the challenge of COVID-19. There are new measures designed to help businesses and their employees deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. We want to help customers understand the tax implications of these changes.

The government announced several schemes to support businesses and organisations impacted by COVID-19.

### COVID-19 Support Payment

The COVID-19 Support Payment (CSP) was for viable and ongoing businesses or organisations facing a reduction in revenue due to COVID-19 circumstances.
