Te Tāke Hokohoko (GST) mō ngā kaihautū waka, ngā kaikawe taputapu me ngā kaitaurima wāhi noho GST for drivers, deliverers and accommodation owners
==================================================================================================================================================

If you perform or provide listed services in New Zealand using an [online marketplace](/api/glossary/item?id={89DCEE22-82EC-4535-AE11-9873FDE8EE3C})
 (such as a website or app) — the online marketplace will collect and return GST on the sale.

If you do not know whether you’re using an online marketplace, please check with them. These GST rules do not affect services that do not go through an online marketplace.

Listed services
---------------

Listed services include:

*   ride-sharing
*   food and beverage delivery
*   short-stay and visitor accommodation.

How the marketplace rules apply to you
--------------------------------------

How the marketplace rules apply to you depends on whether you are GST-registered or not.

If you perform or provide listed services in New Zealand, you must give your online marketplace your:

*   name
*   IRD number
*   GST registration status.

You must tell your online marketplace if you're GST-registered. If you do not, they may treat you as non-GST-registered. You should also tell them if your GST registration status changes.

Non-GST-registered: Flat-rate credit scheme
-------------------------------------------

A flat-rate credit scheme will apply if you are not GST-registered.

From 1 April 2024, online marketplaces will collect GST at the standard 15% rate on listed services that are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. They will pay 6.5% to us and will pass on 8.5% to you.

This flat-rate credit is for you to keep and recognises the GST on your costs from supplying listed services.

GST-registered
--------------

If you're GST-registered, you must include the supply of listed services sold through a GST-registered online marketplace as a zero-rated supply in your GST return. You can still claim GST on the costs of making supplies of listed services.

If you're also providing listed services that do not go through an online marketplace, the normal GST rules apply. You'll have to pay GST on these services.

If you receive a flat-rate credit when you are GST registered, you'll need to return it to us by making a debit adjustment in your GST return. If you do not do this and carry on receiving flat-rate credits, we may charge you penalties.

Generally, you will have to return GST on the sale of your motor vehicle and property used to provide listed services. There are some situations where you may be able to treat these as non-taxable supplies.

Find out more about electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies on our GST adjustments page.

When apps and websites are not required to collect GST
------------------------------------------------------

Not all apps and websites meet the definition of an [online marketplace](/api/glossary/item?id={89DCEE22-82EC-4535-AE11-9873FDE8EE3C})
.

This is the case if the business operating the website or app is supplying services directly to the customer. For example, the marketplace rules will not apply to a platform that provides delivery services directly to customers, and hires you to be a delivery driver, either as an employee or an independent contractor.

If you are hired as a driver or delivery driver in these situations, flat-rate credits also do not apply.

You should check your own circumstances to determine if the marketplace rules apply to you.
