A family of 2 parents and 2 children is shown in a living room, with 2 circles either side. One circle has Inland Revenue written in it, the other has Work and Income.

The family slides to the right under Work and Income, indicating they’re getting a main benefit and their Working for Families from them.

To register for Working for Families payments, myIR is the simplest, fastest way to go.

You’ll need some details to complete your registration.

If you want to get payments from Inland Revenue, you’ll need IRD numbers for you, your partner, and your children.

If you don’t have an IRD number for your child, you can still get Working for Families payments for up to eight weeks, to give you time to provide this information to us.

If you, your partner or your child don’t have an IRD number, you’ll need to apply.

This can be done online through myIR with document verification at an AA driver licensing agent.

There is further information on ird.govt.nz to help you through this process.

You can register your child’s birth and apply for their IRD number at the same time through smartstart.services.govt.nz.

When you’re registering for Working for Families, you’ll also need to estimate your family income for the tax year, including any child support you receive or pay privately.

If you have a partner, you’ll need to include their income too.

We’ll need your before-tax income from 1 April to 31 March.

For more information on how to estimate your income, visit ird.govt.nz.

If you’re registered for myIR, we’ll fill in some information we already know about to make this easier for you.

You must also provide your bank account number and let us know if you want to get Working for Families payments weekly, fortnightly or as a lump sum at the end of the tax year.

Ok, that’s your registration done.

**Narrator**

Through the tax year, the first of April till thirty-first of March, you get Working for Families payments based on how much you and your partner expect to earn that year.

Then, around June July when we have your and your partner’s income details, from employers or tax returns, we compare it against the amount your family actually earned to work out if you got the correct amount of Working for Families weekly or fortnightly payments.

This is what we call a square up, comparing how much you got based on your expected income to how much you should’ve got based on your actual income.

If you got too much, you’ll have to pay some back.

If you didn’t get quite enough, you’ll get some more.
