Te utu tangohanga ki Te Tari Taake Paying deductions to Inland Revenue
======================================================================

How often you pay deductions
----------------------------

You pay deductions to us once or twice a month.

It depends on your gross annual PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). It's not tied to how often you file your employment information.

### Gross annual PAYE and ESCT less than $500,000 - small to medium employers

If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $500,000 you:

*   need to pay deductions monthly, by the 20th of the following month
*   can choose to pay more often.

For example, if your paydays were on 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 July, you would need to pay the deductions for all paydays by 20 August.

### Gross annual PAYE and ESCT more than $500,000 - large employers

If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is more than $500,000 you:

*   need to pay deductions twice a month
*   can choose to pay more often.

| Payday date | Deductions due to us |
| --- | --- |
| For wages and salaries paid between the 1st and 15th of the month | By the 20th of the same month. |
| For wages and salaries paid between the 16th and end of the month | By the 5th of the following month.  <br>Note: For period 16-31 December pay by 15 January not 5 January of each year. |

For example, if your paydays were on 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 July you do the following:

| Payday date | Deductions due to us |
| --- | --- |
| 2 and 9 July | By 20 July |
| 16, 23 and 30 July | By 5 August |

Working out your deductions
---------------------------

If you file your employment information by paper, you need to add up your total deductions (boxes 3-8 on the Employment information form - IR348).

If you file your employment information in myIR, you can check in 'Returns and transactions' for each period. This shows the deductions you need to pay for the period. The figures are updated every time you file employment information for the period.

Paying your deductions
----------------------

You can pay by:

*   internet banking
*   credit or debit card
*   direct debit.

When you make a payment to us, you'll need to use your IRD number as a reference. This allows us to link the payment to you. You'll also need a payee code showing which type of tax the payment is for.

For the EMP (employment activities) account type, you can make a single payment for:

*   pay as you earn
*   child support deductions
*   KiwiSaver deductions
*   KiwiSaver contributions
*   student loan deductions
*   Employer Superannuation Contribution.

How to pay if you change Employment Information deductionsÂ 
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you change your Employment Information after you have paid and accounted for it, there may be a debit balance. You can pay this using the EMP payment code and the affected period.

Checking your payments
----------------------

You can check your payments and balance for each period in myIR.

Go to 'Returns and transactions' in your payroll account, and select the period. A credit balance will show in green (with a minus sign next to it). A debit balance will show in red.

It can take up to 15 working days to process payments. We will reimburse any penalties or interest we charged you, as long as your payment was on time. Contact us if your payment is not showing after 15 working days.
