1 Ref: 23OIA2100 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 19 May 2023 Dear Thank you for your request of 20 April 2023, made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). You requested: 1) Please provide a copy of all surveys which Inland Revenue has sent to any customers in the past three years. 2) Please also provide any internal codes of conduct relating to communicating with clients who are experiencing liquidation, if any exist. On 9 May 2023, you clarified that in question 2 of your request, you are: ... looking for any codes of best practice or expectations of conduct the IRD has for staff dealing with customers who are either currently in liquidation or who are insolvent and intending to liquidate. If there are no written codes for this, that’s all I need to know. Thank you for clarifying this part of your request. Question 1: All surveys Inland Revenue sent to customers in the past three years We have interpreted “surveys” to be formal questionnaires Inland Revenue has sent to customers (people who file a tax return, including companies, trusts, partnerships, individuals and clubs). The surveys we sent to customers from January 2020 to April 2023 are listed in the table below. Some surveys are ongoing so do not have a specific date. The surveys are released to you in full except for survey number 35. Personal details in survey 35 are withheld under section 9(2)(a) of the OIA, to protect the privacy of natural persons. No public interest in releasing the withheld information has been identified that would be sufficient to outweigh the reasons for withholding.

Documents about the high-wealth individuals research project are published on our website at: Online document library - High-wealth individuals research project (ird.govt.nz) 4 Ref: 23OIA2100 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The four surveys listed below are refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information is publicly available. Ref Survey name Date A Family details collection questionnaire guide Nov 2021 B Entity questionnaire guide Feb 2022 C Financial questionnaire guide Jun 2022 D Supplemental Financial Statement Guide Aug 2022 Question 2: Inland Revenue’s codes of best practice or expectations of conduct for staff communicating with customers who are in liquidation or are insolvent and intending to liquidate Inland Revenue follows the Companies Act 1993, which applies to everyone (not only Inland Revenue). Under section 289 of the Companies Act, a statutory demand is the first step in legal proceedings to wind up an insolvent company. A statutory demand is essentially a test to see whether a company can pay its debts when they fall due. Inland Revenue only triggers a liquidation action where the amount of tax owing is material and previous attempts to obtain or negotiate payment have been unsuccessful, or where a negotiated payment has further defaulted. When a company goes into liquidation, the powers of the directors are suspended, so Inland Revenue only deals with the liquidator or their staff. There are no codes of best practice or expectations of conduct for communicating with the liquidator. There are no codes of best practice or expectations of conduct for communicating with customers who are in difficulty but not yet in liquidation. This part of your request is therefore refused under section 18(g) of the OIA, as Inland Revenue does not hold the information requested. Rights of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. I f you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response P lease note that Inland Revenue regularly publishes responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public on its website. We consider that this response is of public interest so will publish this response in due course. Your personal details, or any information that would identify you, will be removed before it is published. Thank you for your request.

The different ways a customer can receive their annual WfFTC entitlement are: Weekly or fortnightly payments throughout the year – the annual entitlement is calculated at the start of the year based on a family’s estimated annual income. It is then divided and paid as either 52 weekly or 26 fortnightly payments, or A lump-sum payment at the end of the year - the annual entitlement is calculated off the family’s actual annual income at the end of the year and is paid as one lump-sum.
