Repayment thresholds for New Zealand-based borrowers
----------------------------------------------------

New Zealand-based borrowers receiving salary or wages are required to repay 12 cents of every dollar earned over the pay period repayment threshold (For example $464 per week from 1 April 2024). The deductions are considered sufficient and do not result in additional repayments provided they are within a determined threshold. If significant under-deductions occur, the employer is required to make compulsory extra deductions. Past threshold amounts are in the student loan quarterly download above.

Borrowers who earn $500 or more of adjusted net income (income that's not salary and wages and adjustments), and whose total income including salary or wages is $500 or more than the annual repayment threshold, are required to make payments on this income.

Additional information on adjusted net income can be found on our Repaying my student loan when I am self-employed or earn other income page.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/tax-statistics/student-loan/repayments/student-loan-repayments-by-quarter-q1.png?modified=20241215235025)   

As at 30 September 2024:

*   Repayments received directly from New Zealand-based student loan borrowers decreased 2.4% from $50.3 million in September 2023 to $49.1 million in September 2024.
*   Repayments from overseas-based student loan borrowers increased 48.5% from $40.6 million in September 2023 to $60.3 million in September 2024. 
*   Repayments through employer deductions decreased 9.8% from $307.1 million in September 2023 to $276.9 million in September 2024.
*   Total repayments for all borrowers decreased 3.0% from $398.0 million in September 2023 to $386.2 million in September 2024. 

Notes:

*   The amount repaid includes all money received:
*   directly from borrowers (voluntary payments, payments from borrowers with income other than salary and wages and overseas-based borrowers)
*   from employers through deductions from salary or wage earners.
*   The way student loan salary and wage repayment obligations were calculated changed on 1 April 2012, so each payment was considered full and final except if there were significant over or under deductions. The final "square up" payment under the previous regime was February 2013.
*   A borrower is any person who has drawn from the Student Loan Scheme and not yet repaid in full.

Percent of student loan borrowers that meet their obligations
-------------------------------------------------------------

This table shows the percent of student loan borrowers who have met their obligations against Inland Revenue’s performance target of 85%, as at the end of each quarter

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Percent of student loan borrowers that meet their obligations
| Borrowers meeting obligations | 30 September 2023 | 30 September 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New Zealand-based borrowers | 95.0% | 95.0% |
| Overseas-based borrowers | 29.7% | 21.2% |
| **Total** | **83.9%** | **81.5%** |

As at 30 September 2024:

*   New Zealand-based borrowers meeting their obligations remained the same at 95.0% in September 2023 to September 2024.
*   Overseas-based borrowers meeting their obligations decreased by 8.5% from 29.7% in September 2023 to 21.2% in September 2024.

Notes:

*   To be considered compliant borrowers must have met their repayment obligations. For borrowers who do not have payments made through their employers, they will meet their obligations if they pay their assessment by the due date. For borrowers who have repayments through their employers, each payment is considered full and final unless their payment resulted in a significant over or under deduction.
*   A borrower is any person who has drawn from the Student Loan Scheme and not yet repaid in full.
