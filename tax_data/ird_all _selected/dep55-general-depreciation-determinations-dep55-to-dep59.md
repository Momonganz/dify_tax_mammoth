General depreciation determinations DEP55 to DEP59
==================================================

General depreciation determinations for psychological testing sets, metal speed humps, wintering pads, kiwifruit software and baby crayfish traps.

In _Tax Information Bulletin Volume 18_, No 7 (August 2006) on page 4 we advised of the availability of draft general depreciation determinations proposing the setting of general depreciation rates for the following items:

DDG0110: "Psychological testing sets" used in the medical industry  
DDG0111: "Metal speed humps"  
DDG0113: "Wintering pads (rubber)" used in the agriculture industry  
DDG0114: "Kiwiplus – Kiwifruit Software Package – designed for a specific year"  
DDG0115: "Peurulus (baby crayfish) traps" used in the fishing industry

We received no substantive submissions on these drafts.

We have now made the general depreciation determinations and they are reproduced below. The determinations include the rates applying to assets:

*   purchased before 1 April 2005, and
*   purchased on or after 1 April 2005.

The differing rates result from the enactment of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.
