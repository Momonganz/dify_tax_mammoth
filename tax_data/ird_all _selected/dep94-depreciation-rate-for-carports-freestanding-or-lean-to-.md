Depreciation Rate for carports (freestanding or lean-to)
========================================================

General Determination DEP94 (Aug 2015) sets a general depreciation rate for a new asset class, 'Carports (freestanding or lean-to)'.

#### Note to Determination DEP94

The Commissioner has set a general depreciation rate for a new asset class “Carports (freestanding or lean-to)”, under the “Buildings and structures” asset category, within the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates.

A carport is a simple lean-to structure that is attached to an external wall of a building for support or may be freestanding supported by columns. Most carports may be distinguished from buildings because (whilst they obviously have a roof) they do not have four walls, or if they have walls, they are usually not completely enclosed and/or are not weather-tight.

Lean-to carports, although attached to a wall of a building for support, can be easily removed from a building without damage to the building. In addition, a reasonable person could easily distinguish a carport as a separate structure from a building. A lean-to carport would not be viewed as part of the fabric of a building, therefore is viewed as a separate structure.

Carports designed as an open sided extension of a building roof structure, would not be easily removed without damage to the common roof structure. A reasonable person would not easily distinguish a carport as a separate structure from a building, which is more likely to be viewed as being an extension of the building and form part of the fabric of a building. Carports that are an extension of a building roof structure are not viewed as a separate asset and form part of a building.

If the structure used to shelter cars comprises a roof and four complete, weather-tight walls, then the structure is a building. If the structure to provide shelter for vehicles has a roof, three weather-tight walls and an open front (presence or absence of a door in the opening is irrelevant) it is therefore a building.
