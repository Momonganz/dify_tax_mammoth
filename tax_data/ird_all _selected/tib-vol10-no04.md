The new rules result in the controlled foreign companies (CFC) and foreign investment funds (FIF) rules generally no longer applying to income derived by New Zealand resident companies on behalf of their non-resident shareholders. The amendments aim to improve the coherence of New Zealand’s international tax rules. Background In May last year, the Government issued a discussion document on conduit tax reform, which outlined the principles behind the reform and proposed a general reform mechanism. The reform package that has been enacted has remained broadly consistent with the mechanism outlined in the discussion document. Conduit investment is investment by a non-resident into a foreign company that is made through an intermediary company resident in a third country. A foreign investor who wishes to invest into a country other than New Zealand has two options. The first is to invest directly into that third country (or indirectly into that country through a country other than New Zealand). Because the income from the third country is then neither sourced in New Zealand nor derived by a New Zealand resident, it is generally accepted that New Zealand neither could nor should impose tax on the income. The alternative option is to invest into a New Zealand subsidiary that in turn invests into the third country. This is illustrated in the following diagram. Offshore New Zealand New Zealand subsidiary (the ‘conduit’) Foreign investor Foreign subsidiary Effective investment Investment flow Investment flow Income of foreign subsidiary taxed under CFC/FIF rules In this case, New Zealand imposes tax on the worldwide income of the New Zealand subsidiary. This will include the income of the foreign subsidiary, even though the foreign subsidiary (and hence its income) is ultimately owned by the foreign investor. The term “conduit taxation” is used to refer to this taxation by New Zealand of the foreign income derived by a New Zealand com- pany on behalf of its non-resident shareholders. New Zealand’s international tax rules aim to comprehen- sively tax New Zealand residents on their worldwide income as it accrues, whether that income is earned directly or indirectly through foreign entities. At the same time, the rules seek to tax non-residents on their New Zealand-sourced income. Two key components in the rules for taxing New Zealand residents are the CFC and FIF rules, which attribute the income earned by foreign entities back to their New Zealand owners as if those owners had earned the income directly. One problem with this approach, however, is that if these New Zealand owners were companies, there was, before the enactment of conduit reform, no distinction between companies that were owned by residents and those owned by non-residents. To the extent that the companies were owned by non- residents, therefore, the international tax rules had the effect of taxing non-residents on their non-New Zealand- sourced income, a result that was outside the intended effect of the rules. The taxation of conduit income – the foreign-sourced income earned by New Zealand companies on behalf of non-resident shareholders – was an unintended effect brought about by the interaction of a number of other policies. In addressing this effect, conduit tax reform has made New Zealand’s international tax rules more coherent. Conduit tax reform preserves the taxation of resident investors on their worldwide income (the policy underpinning the international tax rules), while relieving tax on non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. Key features •New subpart KH relieves the taxation of a New Zealand company on attributed foreign income derived from CFCs and FIF income calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods, to the extent the company is directly owned by non- resident shareholders. •New subpart MI introduces the new “conduit tax relief” (CTR) account, a memorandum account that will record the amount of relief given to a company. This account is to ensure that the relief is passed to non-resident shareholders on whose behalf it is given. •New subpart FH contains interest allocation rules to measure accurately the amount of conduit income derived by a New Zealand company. The rules apply only for the purposes of determining conduit tax relief. To minimise compliance costs, safe harbours ensure the rules apply only if a group has highly geared its New Zealand operations and a significant amount of conduit relief is involved. •Sections OE 7 and OE 8 introduce special rules that enable: –holding companies wholly owned by a single non-resident to elect to be treated as non-resident for the purposes of determining the conduit relief of other companies in which they hold interests of 10% or greater; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 3 –conduit tax relief to be given to and passed on from a lower-tier company in a 100% chain of companies, to the extent the top-tier company is owned by non-residents. •The existing 15% rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on distributed income is retained. Application date The rules for determining relief from income tax on income derived from CFCs and FIF interests will apply from the start of the 1998/99 income year. The rules for determining relief from dividend withhold- ing payment (DWP) liabilities on foreign-sourced dividends will apply to dividends paid on or after 1 April 1998. Amendments to the rules for maintaining memorandum accounts will apply generally from the start of the 1998/99 imputation year. Overview of conduit tax reform Introduction In broad terms, conduit reform will reduce the tax payable by a New Zealand resident company in propor- tion to its non-resident shareholders when and to the extent that income is derived as: •attributed foreign income from CFCs: •FIF income calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods; and •DWP liabilities on foreign-sourced dividends. The first two sources of income referred to here are defined collectively in section OB 1 to be “foreign attributed income” (not to be confused with “attributed foreign income” derived under the CFC rules). The statutory term “foreign attributed income” will be used subsequently in this Tax Information Bulletin to refer to income of these types. Because relief is given on behalf of non-resident share- holders, a mechanism is necessary to ensure this relief is passed on to those shareholders on whose behalf it is given. A new memorandum account (the conduit tax relief (CTR) account) has been introduced to track conduit relief. The conduit relief mechanism operates at two different points in time. First, relief is given to a New Zealand resident company when it derives foreign attributed income or a foreign- sourced dividend (conduit income). Second, there are implications once the company distributes conduit income by way of dividend. Ultimately, the amount of conduit relief is determined when a company distributes conduit income to its shareholders. In determining the amount of relief to be given when conduit income is derived, the percentage of non-resident shareholders of a company at that time is best seen as a proxy for the percentage of shareholders that will exist on distribution. If the percentage of shareholding changes, the credit allocation mechanism washes out the effect of the shareholding changes. This is discussed further in the separate article on the general conduit relief mechanism, later in this Tax Information Bulletin. Elections To be entitled to relief on conduit income as it is de- rived, companies must elect to maintain a CTR account, thereby becoming conduit tax relief companies. Conduit relief is still available to companies not electing to be conduit tax relief companies. However, this relief will only be available when conduit income is distrib- uted to non-resident shareholders, by way of a refund of DWP credits in excess of the non-residents’ NRWT liabilities (repatriation-based relief). Further, the interest allocation rules will still apply to these companies in determining the amount of income subject to repatria- tion-based relief. Basic mechanism The basic conduit relief mechanism was illustrated by the example in paragraphs 4.2 to 4.7 of the discussion document, The Taxation of Conduit Investment, released in May 1997. The example was basic in the sense that it illustrated the key concepts of: •Determining conduit relief when income is derived; •Crediting the memorandum accounts; and •Distributing conduit income. However, it did not dwell on those aspects of the rules that make conduit reform complex, such as the effect of interest allocation rules, changes in shareholding be- tween the time income is derived and distributed, foreign tax credits and branch equivalent tax account (BETA) offsets. The example is reproduced here because it provides a good illustration of the essential relief mechanism. Subsequent discussion in this Tax Information Bulletin will deal with how more complex aspects of the rules’ interface with the basic mechanism. continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 4 (giving rise to the DWP credits), whereas the relief has been provided for the non-resident shareholders (giving rise to the CTR credits). NZ Co DWPA CTRA $33 $33 $0 $0 Cash dividend Additional div NRWT Net dividend $ 67 $ 33 $( 15) $ 85 Cash dividend DWP credit NZ tax Net dividend $ 67 $ 33 $( 33) $ 67 New Zealand Offshore 50% 50% The second point is that the CTR credits attached to the dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders give rise to a requirement for the company to pay an additional dividend to those shareholders of the amount of the credits. This is to ensure that the benefits of the conduit relief are passed on to non- resident shareholders. The effect is that a cash dividend of $67 is paid to the resident shareholders, while $100 is paid to the non-resident shareholders. However, both resident and non-resident sharehold- ers are liable for tax on $100 of dividend. (The DWP credit forms part of the taxable dividend of the resident shareholders.) Following the imposition of tax on the dividends, the net effect is that the $100 of foreign income attributable to the resident shareholders has been taxed at 33%, while the $100 attributable to the non- resident shareholders has been taxed at 15% (the rate of NRWT). Components of reform package There are three main components to the reform package: •The basic relief mechanism; •Special holding company and 100% group rules; and •Interest allocation rules. A broad outline of these component parts follows. For a detailed explanation, however, reference should be made to the separate articles appearing later in this Tax Information Bulletin. General relief mechanism A general mechanism has been created to determine the amount of relief to which a New Zealand company will be entitled, and to track that relief until it is passed on to non-resident shareholders on whose behalf conduit relief is given. This basic mechanism was illustrated in the previous example. Conduit relief will be available on a current basis only if the company elects to maintain a conduit tax relief account. Further, the amount of any relief will be reduced to the extent the interest allocation rules apply. Example The following example illustrates the operation of what can be referred to as a “current-based” relief mechanism. The mechanism is current-based in the sense that it provides relief as conduit income is derived by a New Zealand company (current), as contrasted to relief that is provided only when conduit income is distributed to non-resident shareholders (“repatriation-based” relief). The example concerns a New Zealand company in which resident and non-resident shareholders each own 50% of the shares. The company earns $200 of attributed income from a CFC or FIF on which no foreign tax is paid. NZ Co New Zealand Offshore 50% 50% NZ Govt Tax $33 DWPA CTRA $33 $33 CFC/FIF Income $200 Under pre-conduit rules, the amount of New Zea- land tax payable on the $200 of foreign income in the example would have been $66 (33% of $200). The payment of this tax would have given rise to a credit in NZ Co’s imputation account of $66. Following conduit reform, however, relief is given for 50% of the tax on the CFC or FIF income, based on the New Zealand company being 50% owned by non-resident shareholders. This gives a net New Zealand tax liability of $33. This amount will now be credited to the DWP account (instead of to the ICA, as previously), while the $33 of tax relieved will be credited to the CTR account. The following diagram illustrates what happens under the proposed reform when the New Zealand company distributes its income to its shareholders. The first point to note in the example is that the DWP credits are allocated to the resident sharehold- ers, while the CTR credits are allocated to the non- resident shareholders. This is appropriate, as the tax has been paid on behalf of the resident shareholders from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 5 General conduit relief mechanism Introduction As noted in the previous article, the conduit relief mechanism operates at two different points in time. First, relief is given to a New Zealand resident company when it derives foreign attributed income or a foreign- sourced dividend (conduit income). Second, there are implications once the company distributes conduit income by way of dividend. Ultimately, the amount of conduit relief is determined when a company distributes conduit income to its shareholders. The percentage of non-resident sharehold- ers when a New Zealand company derives conduit income could, therefore, be perceived as a proxy for the percentage of non-resident shareholders it will have when that income is distributed, and the amount of conduit relief ultimately determined. This article focuses first on the rules that apply to determine the amount of relief to which a New Zealand Holding companies and 100% groups There are special rules for determining whether certain shareholders are non-resident for the purposes of determining the amount of conduit relief. The exceptions to the normal rules are: •Companies wholly owned by a single non-resident (conduit tax relief holding companies) will be treated as if they were themselves non-residents in relation to certain companies in which they hold interests. There are further rules to determine which companies may elect to be conduit tax relief holding companies. •New Zealand resident members of 100% chains of companies will be treated as non-resident to the extent that a non-resident has a direct interest in the top company in the chain, and the company at the bottom of the chain has an interest in a CFC or FIF. •A non-resident will not be treated as a non-resident for conduit relief purposes if it is a CFC or the trustee of a non-qualifying trust. Interest allocation rules Interest allocation rules have been introduced to ensure that companies cannot allocate an excessive amount of debt to their New Zealand operations relative to CFCs and FIFs in which they hold interests, thereby generating an excessive amount of conduit relief. If application of the interest allocation rules determine that the group of a New Zealand company has exces- sively debt geared their New Zealand operations relative to their non-grey list CFC and FIF interests, the amount of conduit relief to which members of the group are entitled will be reduced. The formula in section KH 1 for determining the amount of conduit relief reduces a company’s foreign attributed income by the amount of any excess interest allocation, and determines conduit relief only on the net amount. Thus, if a company has foreign attributed income of $1,000 but has an excess interest allocation of $400, relief will be provided only in relation to the net foreign attributed income of $600 ($1,000 – $400). The fundamental test under the interest allocation rules is whether the New Zealand assets of a group are excessively debt funded relative to the assets of its CFC and FIF interests. If an excess interest allocation is identified in New Zealand, the excess is allocated against the conduit income of the group, thereby reducing the conduit relief to which members of the group are entitled. To reduce compliance costs, two safe harbours have been introduced so that the rules apply only to groups that have high levels of debt in New Zealand and when a substantial amount of conduit relief is involved. To this end, the rules do not apply when: •The debt percentage of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group, as defined under the interest allocation rules, is less than 66%; or •A taxpayer and all companies associated with the taxpayer are entitled to conduit relief for an income year of less than $50,000. Because companies not electing to receive current-based relief can still obtain distribution-based relief, through the refundable nature of DWP credits, the interest allocation rules apply equally to such companies. In applying the $50,000 relief test when such companies are involved, the test is applied to the amount of conduit relief to which such companies would have been entitled had they elected to receive current-based relief. It is expected that these safe harbours will make the interest allocation rules of no real consequence for all but a very small group of taxpayers with high levels of debt in their New Zealand operations, which are entitled to large amounts of conduit relief. Non-conduit relief companies Conduit tax reform also requires that some changes be made to existing rules, even for companies that do not elect to receive conduit tax relief. If a company does not elect to maintain a CTR account, its shareholders will still be entitled to receive conduit relief on foreign attributed income once it is distributed. This can occur if the company still elects to maintain a DWP account. As for companies electing to receive current-based conduit relief, tax on foreign attributed income will be creditable to the DWP account (section ME 5(7)). However, the interest allocation rules will still apply in determining the amount able to be credited to the account. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 6 Applying these amounts into the formula in section KH 1(2) determines the amount of conduit relief as follows: 40% x ((33% x (100,000 – 0 – 0)) – 8,000 – 0) = $10,000 The tax payable by NZ Co on the attributed foreign income from Thai Co can be calculated as: Attributed foreign income100,000 Tax payable @33%33,000 Less: CFC tax credit( 8,000) Less: Conduit rebate (section KH 1(2))(10,000) Net New Zealand tax payable15,000 Caveats to section KH 1(2) result Section KH 2(3) contains two caveats on the result from applying the formula. Application of the formula cannot result in relief of less than nil (section KH 2(3)(a)) or for more than the company’s net tax liability (before taking conduit relief into consideration) for the year (section KH 2(3)(b)). This will have no application for NZ Co in the example above. Application of section KH 1(2) results in a rebate of more than nil, and NZ Co is known to have tax payable on other income, meaning the company’s income tax liability for the year must be more than the conduit rebate. Loss offsets The formula for determining conduit relief calculates the rebate to which a company will be entitled after “foreign attributed loss offsets” (FALO in the formula). The term “foreign attributed loss offsets” is defined in section OB 1 to include only attributed foreign losses (from CFCs) and FIF losses calculated under the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Thus, if a FIF loss calculated under the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method is to be applied against FIF income calculated under the accounting profits method, that offset will not affect the calculation of amount of conduit relief to which the New Zealand company is entitled. On a related issue, an amendment has been made to section DP 2 at Select Committee, dealing with the ability of companies with a FIF loss to offset that loss against other income to the extent that FIF income (other than that calculated under the branch equivalent method) has been returned in previous years. For the purposes of determining the extent to which a taxpayer may make such a loss offset, the amendment reduces the amount of FIF income calculated under the accounting profits method in previous years to the extent that conduit relief has eliminated the New Zealand income tax impost on that income. Foreign tax credits The calculation of the amount of conduit relief to which a company is entitled is determined with reference to the credits allowable to the company for taxes paid by a company will be entitled when it derives foreign attrib- uted income. It then proceeds to discuss the rules for determining relief on foreign-sourced dividends. Finally, it considers the implications when the company distrib- utes conduit income (foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends) by way of dividends. Calculating relief when conduit income derived (section KH 1(2)) The amount of conduit relief on foreign attributed income is determined under the formula in section KH 1(2). The amount is calculated as: NRS x ((TR x (FAI – FALO – EIA)) – FAC – BC) This formula can be broken down into components, representing the process that is effectively followed for determining conduit relief: •Tax is first determined on the company’s foreign attributed income less any foreign attributed losses offset against that income and the amount of any interest expense allocated (TR x (FAI – FALO – EIA)) in the formula). •The amount of tax is then reduced by any credit for tax paid by a CFC or FIF calculated under the branch equivalent method, and by any offset of BETA debits under section MF 5(4) (– FAC – BC in the formula). •Finally, the net amount of tax is then reduced in proportion to the non-resident shareholders in the company. Example NZ Co is a New Zealand resident company, owned 40% by non-resident shareholders. It derives attributed foreign income of $100,000 from a CFC resident in Thailand (Thai Co). Foreign tax of $8,000 has been paid in respect of that income for which a CFC tax credit will arise. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the interest allocation rules do not apply. NZ Co also has a nil balance in its BETA. Finally, NZ Co has income tax payable in respect of other income derived for the year. For NZ Co, the relevant values for the variables are: NRS40%Percentage of non-resident shareholders TR33%Company tax rate FAI$100,000Attributed foreign income from Thai Co FALONilForeign attributed loss offsets EIANilInterest allocation – assumed to be nil FAC$8,000CFC tax credit BCNilNo debit balance in BETA from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 7 CFC. Thus, if a CFC tax credit of say $500 were avail- able in respect of attributed foreign income of $5,000, relief would only be available on the New Zealand tax liability net of the CFC tax credit, that is, on income tax payable of $1,150 ($5,000 x 33% – $500). An amendment was made to section LC 4 at Select Committee. This amendment was a recognition that under the new Core Provisions approach in the Act, rebates (including conduit relief) are applied before a company’s income tax liability is determined. Because conduit relief is determined based on tax credits that will be applied, an amendment was made to section LC 4 to ensure that CFC tax credits are still applied to the extent they are taken into consideration in determining conduit tax relief. BETA offsets The last variable in the formula is BETA debit offsets. If a company pays DWP on a foreign-sourced dividend it derives, a debit arises to its branch equivalent tax account (BETA). This debit can then be applied against the income tax liability arising on subsequent foreign attributed income. As with foreign tax credits, BETA offsets are taken into account in determining the amount of conduit relief to which a taxpayer will be entitled. Thus, if a taxpayer has a BETA debit of say $300 and has foreign attributed income of $3,000 (with no foreign tax credit available), relief would only be available on the New Zealand tax liability net of the BETA offset, that is, on income tax payable of $690 ($3,000 x 33% – $300). Determining percentage of non- resident shareholders (section KH 2) Section KH 2 contains rules for determining what percentage of a company’s shareholders are non-resident for the purposes of determining conduit relief on income derived under the CFC and FIF regimes. The purpose of the measurement dates adopted is to: •permit companies to measure their non-resident shareholders on a date they are already required to determine their non-resident shareholders for dividend purposes; and •prevent the manipulation of different share classes to defeat the intent of the rules. With this aim in mind, section KH 2(1)(a) establishes generally that the last day in the year on which the company pays a dividend to all shareholders as the date on which a measurement of non-resident shareholders is made for conduit relief purposes. This is because companies already have to determine the extent of their non-resident shareholders to apply the NRWT rules. An amendment was made at Select Committee to further refine this rule. Publicly listed companies are able to use the Record Date for calculation of entitlement to divi- dends to determine the extent of their non-resident shareholding, rather than the date on which the dividend is actually paid (section KH 2(2)). This reflects that in practice, it is the Record date that determines who receives the dividends, not the payment date. If the company has not paid a dividend to all sharehold- ers in the income year, the measurement date defaults to the last day of the income year (section KH 2(1)(b)). The requirement to pay dividends to “all shareholders” of a company to avoid having to apply the default end of income year measurement date (section KH 2(1)(b)) created potential problems for companies with multiple classes of shares. For example, dividends being paid on fixed rate shares at a different time to those paid on ordinary shares would cause a company to fail the test, even though fixed rate shares do not affect voting interests on which current-based relief is generally determined. Also Treasury stock would be included within the shareholding, but no dividend would be paid. Consequently, further refinement was introduced into rules at Select Committee. Treasury stock is explicitly excluded from shares by section KH 2(6). Special deeming rules have also been introduced for multiple classes of shares. If a company pays dividends in an income year to all shareholders of each class of share, section KH 2(4) treats the company as having paid a dividend to all shareholders on the last date on which dividends were paid. Further, the shareholding at the time the last dividend was paid to all shareholders of other classes is deemed to have remained constant for the rest of the year in calculating voting and market value interests. The effect of this rule is best illustrated by way of an example. Example Multiclass Co has two classes of shares, with all shares having identical voting rights, regardless of class. Multiclass Co has 1,000 ‘A’ shares on issue and 1,500 ‘B’ shares on issue. Multiclass Co pays dividends in the income year on the following dates: 28 July‘A’ shares40% non-resident 27 November‘B’ shares30% non-resident 3 February‘A’ shares50% non-resident Because dividends have been paid to all sharehold- ers of each class in the income year, section KH 2(4) deems Multiclass Co to have paid a dividend to all shareholders on 3 February. Further, the share- holding of class ‘B’ shares is deemed to be the same at 3 February as it was when a dividend was paid to shareholders of the class on 27 November (section KH 2(5)). The percentage of non-resident shareholders in Multiclass Co, based on voting interests, is calcu- lated as 40%, that is: (50% x 1,000) + (30% x 1,500) 1,000 + 1,500 continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 8 Example High Gearing Ltd derives foreign attributed income of $5,000. No foreign attributed losses, CFC tax credits or BETA offsets arise in respect of that income. An excess interest allocation is determined of $2,000. High Gearing Ltd is 40% owned by non-residents. The gross foreign attributed income is reduced by the amount of excess interest allocation before determining the amount of conduit relief. Thus, High Gearing Ltd’s net foreign attributed income will be $3,000 ($5,000 – $2,000). Tax payable on this net amount will be $990 ($3,000 x 33%) less 40% conduit relief. This results in relief of $396 (credited to the CTR account), with the $594 balance of the tax payable ($990 – $396) credited to the DWP account. However, the actual tax payable on foreign attrib- uted income will be $1,254 ($5,000 x 33% – $396). To the extent that this exceeds the amount credited to the DWP account ($594), a credit will arise to the company’s imputation credit account ($1,254 – $594 = $660). Thus the final result will be: Tax payable on foreign attributed income$1,254 Conduit relief$ 396 Credit to CTR account$ 396 Credit to DWP account$ 594 Credit to ICA$ 660 Time for crediting tax on foreign attributed income to DWP account Because conduit relief on foreign attributed income is not determined until after the end of an income year, it is not possible to be certain at the time of paying provi- sional tax whether it is being paid in respect of foreign attributed income or other income. To resolve this, tax paid in relation to foreign attributed income will be credited to memorandum accounts as follows. First, provisional tax payments will be credited to the ICA as they are made. This preserves the existing treatment of such payments. Subsequently, when an income tax return is filed, identifying the amount of any conduit relief, a transfer is made from the ICA to the DWP account: •On the last day of the imputation year corresponding with the income year, to the extent provisional tax payments have been made for the year on or before that date; and •On the return filing date, to the extent that the amount of tax payable on net foreign attributed income (note that the amount of transfer depends on the application of section KH 1, requiring an adjustment for any interest expense allocated) exceeds provisional tax for the year. Special classes of shareholders For the purposes of determining the extent of non- resident shareholders for conduit relief purposes, conduit tax relief holding companies and higher-tier companies in a 100% chain of companies are treated as also being non-resident (see the article on holding companies later in this Tax Information Bulletin). However, a non-resident shareholder that is associated with the New Zealand resident company that is either a CFC or the trustee of a non-qualifying trust is not treated as being a non-resident shareholder (section OE 8(2)). Crediting CTR account Because conduit relief is given on behalf of non-resident shareholders, it is necessary to track that relief to ensure it is on-paid to them. To this end, a new memorandum account has been established, (the conduit tax relief (CTR) account) to record how relief is treated. A credit arises to the CTR account for the amount of any conduit relief given (in the case of NZ Co, $10,000). A debit will arise to the account when that conduit relief is distributed. New subpart MI contains rules relating to the mainte- nance of the new CTR memorandum account. It is necessary for a company to elect to maintain such an account under section MI 2 if it is to be entitled to conduit relief on foreign attributed income as it is derived. The legislation for CTR accounts is modelled on the legislation in subpart MF relating to branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs). BETAs prevent the double taxation of foreign attributed income and foreign- sourced dividends. Crediting DWP account As will be discussed in the second part of the example, the amount of conduit relief is ultimately determined once conduit income is distributed to shareholders. To ensure that this relief is correctly provided, it is neces- sary to be able to identify conduit income separately from other income. To achieve this, the application of the DWP account has been extended so that it now also records the amount of income tax payable on foreign attributed income. Before conduit tax reform, NZ Co would have credited the $15,000 tax payable on its attributed foreign income from Thai Co to its imputation credit account. Following the reform, section ME 5(1)(o) now permits this tax to be credited to the DWP account. It should be noted, however, that if there was an interest allocation against conduit income, the amount credited to the DWP account would not be the full amount of tax payable on the attributed foreign income. from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 9 For the purposes of the wash-up mechanism, section MI 6 provides that the retrospective crediting of the DWP and CTR accounts occurs before the wash-up mechanism is applied for the year. Example Slow Filing Ltd is a conduit tax relief company with a 31 March balance date. For its 1998/99 income year, it makes the following provisional tax pay- ments: 7 July 1998$15,000 7 November 1998$15,000 7 March 1999$20,000 Slow Filing Ltd also makes a voluntary tax payment of $20,000 on 31 May 1999. On 31 August 2000, Slow Filing Ltd files its 1998/99 income tax return. On the shareholder measurement date for the year, the company is 40% owned by non-resident shareholders. Its return shows the company to be entitled to conduit relief of $40,000, and to have tax payable on net (post-interest alloca- tion) foreign attributed income of $60,000. Under section ME 5(1)(o), Slow Filing Limited is entitled to a transfer from its ICA to its DWP account of $60,000. This transfer is made as follows. First, on 31 March 1999, a transfer is made for $50,000. This amount is the lesser of provisional tax for the year paid on or before that date or the income tax payable on net foreign attributed income for the income year (sections ME 5(2)(l)(i) and MG 4(2)(ba)). Note that this transfer is made at the end of the imputation year corresponding with the income year (1998/99), not the imputation year ending most recently before the income tax return is filed (1999/2000). Second, on 31 August 2000 (the return filing date), a transfer is made for the $10,000 balance of the tax payable on net foreign attributed income. The return filing date is used, notwithstanding that Slow Filing Co has made a payment between the time the imputation year ended and the income tax return was filed. (Note, however, that if Slow Filing Co had not yet paid the remaining $10,000, a transfer to the DWP account would still occur on the return filing date.) The crediting of the CTR account for conduit relief is similarly divided between the last day of the relevant imputation year and the return filing date. Section MI 4(2)(a) credits the CTR account on each date in the same proportion that credits arise to Slow Filing Ltd’s DWP account. Thus on 31 March 1999, a credit will arise to the CTR account for $33,333 ($40,000 x 50,000/ 60,000), and a further credit will arise on 31 August 2000 for $6,667 ($40,000 – $33,333). Transfers from DWP account to ICA For companies that elect to be conduit tax relief account companies, it will no longer to be possible to make a transfer from the DWP account to the ICA (sections MG 7(1) and MG 11(1). This is because making such a transfer would, in principle, require part of the transfer to be made from the associated CTR account, with a corresponding repayment of conduit relief to the extent a transfer is made. There is, however, no straightforward way to create an appropriate credit allocation mechanism to determine the extent the transfer to the ICA should be sourced from the DWP and CTR accounts respectively. To reduce com- plexity, therefore, transfers from the DWP account to the ICA can no longer be made by conduit tax relief compa- nies. This rule does not affect dividend withholding payment account companies that do not elect to receive current- based conduit relief. Relief on DWP (section NH 7) Section NH 7 introduces current-based conduit relief on foreign-sourced dividends subject to DWP. In a similar manner to relief on foreign attributed income, companies that have elected under section MI 2 to maintain a CTR account and be a conduit tax relief company are entitled to have their DWP liabilities reduced to the extent of their non-resident shareholders. The amount of DWP on which relief will be determined is the DWP liability after allowing for underlying foreign tax credits, foreign withholding taxes, BETA offsets and loss offsets. Unlike relief on foreign attributed income, it is unrealis- tic to expect an adjustment for any interest expense allocated to be determined at the time any DWP is due for payment. Section NH 7 therefore does not require an interest allocation to be taken into consideration in determining the amount of relief when the DWP is paid. However, the position is reviewed once interest alloca- tion calculations are performed for the relevant income year. If an excess interest allocation is determined under section FH 5, and that excess is greater than the taxpay- er’s foreign attributed income group’s net foreign attributed income for the year (foreign attributed income less loss offsets), then to the extent the excess allocation exceeds the group’s net foreign attributed income, it will be allocated against DWP relief under section FH 8. Details on the application of section FH 8 can be found in the article on interest allocation rules, later in this Tax Information Bulletin. Summary of memorandum accounts The amount of any tax reduction (whether income tax or DWP) will be credited to the CTR account. This is because the relief has been provided on behalf of the non-resident shareholders and needs to be identified for passing on to them at some time. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 10 Attaching ICA credits to dividends with CTR or DWP credits There is no rule that prevents companies attaching imputation credits to a dividend at the same time as it attaches DWP or CTR credits. The total credits attached will, however, be subject to the credit allocation and benchmark dividend rules in sections MG 8 and MG 10. For the purposes of applying these rules, section MI 8 requires any CTR credit to be treated as if it were a DWP credit. NRWT on distributed conduit income Distributions of conduit income to non-resident share- holders are subject to NRWT of 15%. Section NG 2 has been amended to apply a 15% rate of NRWT to divi- dends paid to non-residents to the extent they have full CTR credits attached. The 15% NRWT rate will also apply to additional dividends paid in respect of the CTR credits. The CTR credit does not form part of the dividend subject to NRWT. Example of distribution mechanism Returning to the example earlier in this article, NZ Co had 40% non-resident shareholding at the time it derived conduit income. It received conduit relief of $10,000, giving rise to a credit in its CTR account. A credit of $15,000 also arose to its DWP account for tax payable on foreign attributed income. NZ Co has now decided that it wants to distribute some of its conduit income to its shareholders. However, at the time of distribution, non-residents own 60% of the company. NZ Co wants to pay fully credited cash dividends of $13,400. Because 40% of the shareholders are resident, 40% of the cash dividends ($5,360) will be paid to them. Full DWP credits of $2,640 (5,360 x 33/67) will be attached to these dividends. In relation to the non-resident shareholders, cash dividends of $8,040 will be paid. Full CTR credits of $3,960 (8,040 x 33/67) will need to be attached (if the company does not attach full CTR credits, an allocation deficit debit will arise under section MG 8, as modified by section MI 8). Additional dividends will also have to be paid to the sharehold- ers of $3,960, equal to the amount of CTR credits attached to the dividends (section LG 1(2)). The dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders will be subject to NRWT as follows: Cash dividends$ 8,040 Additional dividends$ 3,960 Dividends subject to NRWT$12,000 NRWT @ 15%$ 1,800 The non-resident shareholders will then receive post-NRWT dividends of $10,200 (12,000 – 1,800). Tax paid on foreign attributed income will be credited to the DWP account (instead of to the imputation credit account (ICA)). DWP paid on foreign-sourced dividends will still be credited to the DWP account. The effect will be to identify distributions as being from either foreign- sourced or New Zealand-sourced earnings of the com- pany, depending on the type of credits attached. Conduit relief mechanism on distribution As noted previously, the amount of conduit relief is determined ultimately by the percentage of non-resident shareholders when conduit relief is distributed. Conduit reform has introduced, therefore, a new memorandum account to track conduit relief until it is distributed. Distributions of conduit income will be identified through the attachment of DWP or CTR credits. DWP credits indicate that tax has been paid on conduit income, while CTR credits indicate the tax that has been relieved. When a company receives conduit relief, a credit arises in its memorandum account. If the company then wants to distribute conduit income, it attaches a CTR credit to a dividend paid to a non-resident. Each dollar of CTR credits attached reflects a dollar of conduit tax relief given to the company. To pass the benefit of this relief to its non-resident shareholders, the company is required to pay an additional dividend equal to the amount of CTR credits attached (section LG 1). Thus, if a company pays a $67 cash dividend with $33 CTR credits attached, it is required to pay an additional dividends to the share- holder of $33, making a total cash dividend of $100. To minimise compliance costs associated with an allocation mechanism, conduit tax relief companies will be able to attach CTR credits only to dividends paid to non-residents (section MI 7(1)). Dividends paid to resident shareholders will be required to have DWP credits attached (section MG 6(2)), in the same propor- tion as CTR credits are attached to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. Effect of CTR credits on credit allocation rules In a similar manner to the foreign investor tax credit rules, section LG 1 introduces special rules to ensure that the additional dividend mechanism used in conduit reform does not contravene company law and trust deed requirements and credit allocation rules. Specifically: •Section LG 1(3) ensures that the uncredited additional dividend does not affect the credit allocation rules; •Section LG 1(4) ensures that the additional dividend paid only to non-resident shareholders does not breach company law or the company’s articles of association or constitution; and •Section LG 1(5) ensures that a trustee deriving an additional dividend on behalf of a non-resident beneficiary can pass on that additional dividend without contravening the terms of the trust. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 11 Statement to shareholders When a company attaches a CTR credit to a dividend to a non-resident shareholder, it is required to include the amount of the conduit tax relief credit and the amount of the additional dividend in the dividend statement provided to the shareholder (sections 29(1), 30A, Tax Administration Act 1994). Wash-up mechanism As indicated in the example, it is possible that a compa- ny’s level of non-resident shareholding may change between the time conduit relief is given to the company and the time at which it is distributed. In this case, the company will still attach only DWP credits to dividends paid to residents and CTR credits to dividends paid to non-residents. If the requirement to attach certain types of credits to certain types of shareholder results in either the CTR account or the DWP account having a debit balance at the end of the imputation year, section MI 6 allows for a wash-up adjustment to be made. If the CTR account is in debit and the DWP account is in credit (indicating generally that the percentage of non- resident shareholders of the company has increased between the time conduit relief is provided and the time it is distributed), a transfer will be made from the DWP account to the CTR account for the lesser of the amount of the debit or the credit (section MI 6(1)). A payment will be made by Inland Revenue to the company for the amount of the transfer made (section MI 11). If the DWP account is in debit and the CTR account is in credit (indicating generally that the percentage of non- resident shareholders of the company has decreased between the time conduit relief is provided and the time it is distributed), a transfer will be made from the CTR account to the DWP account for the lesser of the amount of the debit or the credit (section MI 6(2)). The company will be required to make a payment to Inland Revenue for the amount of the transfer made (section MI 10(4)). Example Changing Times Ltd had 40% non-resident share- holders at the time it derived conduit income of $10,000. As a result of determining the tax payable on its foreign attributed income, credits of $1,320 and $1,980 arose to its CTR and DWP accounts respectively. At the time of paying a dividend, no other entries had arisen to those memorandum accounts. Changing Times Ltd has decided to pay fully credited dividends from conduit income to its shareholders. However, it now finds that its non- resident shareholders own 75% of the company. Based on having an aggregate of $3,300 of CTR and DWP credits in its account, Changing Times Ltd is able to fully credit $6,700 of cash dividends ($3,300 x 67/33). Fully credited dividends are, therefore, paid as follows: To resident shareholders: Cash dividend$6,700 x 25%$1,675 Full DWP credits$1,675 x 33/67$ 825 To non-resident shareholders: Cash dividend$6,700 x 75%$5,025 Full DWP credits$5,025 x 33/67$2,475 The cash flow of Changing Times Ltd will be as follows: Cash dividend to residents1,675 Cash dividend to non-residents5,025 Additional dividend to non-residents:2,475 Total dividends paid9,175 After paying New Zealand tax of $1,980 (from which DWP credits arose) on foreign attributed income of $10,000, Changing Times Ltd’s post-tax income was only $8,020. However, because of the requirement that the company attach only CTR credits (and not DWP credits) to dividends to non- resident shareholders, the company has had to pay out $9,175 to fully distribute its conduit income. Further, as a consequence of paying the dividends, the balances in its memorandum accounts will become the following: CTR account:1,320 CR – 2,475 DR = $1,155 DR DWP account:1,980 CR – 825 DR = $1,155 CR Had the company been able to attach DWP credits to dividends paid to non-residents, it could have left both memorandum accounts with a nil balance and not been required to fund the additional dividend. If the balances in the memorandum accounts of Changing Times Ltd remain the same at the end of the income year, a wash-up adjustment will result. A transfer will be made from the DWP account to the CTR account for $1,155, leaving both accounts with a nil balance. Changing Times Ltd will also receive a refund from Inland Revenue for the amount of credit transferred. Transitional rule allowing DWP credits to pass to non-residents A transitional rule will allow companies with existing DWP credits at the effective date of the reform to still allocate to non-resident shareholders their proportionate share of those credits until 31 March 2001. This is to reduce the cash flow consequences for companies that would otherwise be unable to make a timely distribution of existing DWP credits relating to tax paid on behalf of their non-resident shareholders. The rule overrides the normal requirement that DWP credits be attached only to dividends paid to resident shareholders. The amount of DWP credits to which this rule can apply is defined in section MZ 4(4). Essentially, it is the aggregate of non-resident shareholders’ share of: •DWP credits existing at 31 March 1998; and •DWP credits arising on foreign-sourced dividends derived by the company in the March 1998 quarter. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 12 Implications of breach of continuity If a breach of continuity occurs, a debit arises to the company’s CTR account to the extent of any credit balance in the account at that time. The company will also be required to repay to Inland Revenue the amount of that debit by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the breach of continuity occurs (section MI 10(1)(a)). The payment is treated as a payment of DWP, but does not give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account (section MI 10(2)). This is broadly consistent with the result that would have been achieved if the company had not been a conduit tax relief company, paid DWP (which correspondingly is now paid in relation to the 34 per- centage point breach), and subsequently had a breach of shareholder continuity giving rise to a debit in its DWP account. Other debits to CTR account A debit to the CTR account under section MI 5(1) will also occur if: •there is an allocation debit resulting from excessive CTR credits being attached to a dividend (section MI 5(1)(c)); or •section GC 22 applies if CTR credits are applied to gain a tax advantage (section MI 5(1)(d)). As with a breach of shareholder continuity, the company will be required to pay to Inland Revenue by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the debit occurs an amount of DWP equal to the amount of that debit. Again, the payment will not give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account (section MI 10(2)). Not crediting the DWP account for the payment made places the taxpayer in the same position it would have been in had it not received conduit tax relief, and a similar credit allocation with DWP credits instead of CTR credits occurred. Finally, a debit will also arise to the CTR account if: •a lower-tier company in a 100% chain ceases to be a member of that chain while having a credit balance in its CTR account (section MI 5(1)(f),(g)); or •a company ceases to be a conduit tax relief company (section MI 5(1)(h)). The company will again be required to pay to Inland Revenue by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the debit occurs an amount of DWP equal to the amount of that debit. However, the payment will now give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account. This is because had the company not elected to be a conduit tax relief company or a conduit tax relief group member, the payment of DWP on foreign attrib- uted income would have given rise to a credit in its DWP account, and that credit would have been unaffected by the action giving rise to the debit to the CTR account. This later rule recognises that while the DWP liability for this quarter is not payable until after 31 March 1998, no conduit relief can arise in respect of these dividends because they have been paid before the application date of the new relief rules. Example In an earlier example, NZ Co paid fully CTR credited dividends to non-resident shareholders of $8,040. It was also required to pay additional dividends of $3,960 in relation to those CTR credits. NZ Co determines under section MZ 4(4) that it has transitional DWP credits of $4,000 available. It could, therefore, attach DWP credits to the divi- dends paid to non-resident shareholders, instead of CTR credits. NZ Co would then not be required to fund an additional dividend. The dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders would then be subject to NRWT as follows: Cash dividends8,040 DWP credits 3,960 Dividends subject to NRWT12,000 DWP credit3,960 NRWT @ 15% 1,800 Refund of excess DWP credits 2,160 Cash dividends received by non-resident shareholders8,040 Refund of excess DWP credits 2,160 Total receipt of non-resident shareholders10,200 The non-resident shareholders obtain the same return as they did when CTR credits were attached to the dividends. However, NZ Co has not been required to fund additional dividends to achieve this result. Breach of shareholder continuity between derivation of conduit income and its distribution Special rules have been introduced to deal with breaches of shareholder continuity, which differ from the continu- ity rules applying to the existing imputation, DWP and BETA rules. Section MI 5(1)(d) defines a breach of continuity to have occurred if, at any time between the time conduit relief is given to the company and the time that relief is distributed, the percentage of resident shareholders of the company increases by 34 or more percentage points. For example, if a company has 30% of its shareholders resident in New Zealand when conduit relief is received, and this increases to 70% at any time before distribution is to occur, the 40 percentage point increase in resident shareholders will represent a continuity breach. from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 13 Crediting the DWP account for the payment made creates a result consistent with what would have oc- curred had the company not utilised the conduit relief rules. CTR and amalgamating companies Section MI 13 introduces rules for amalgamating companies that maintain a CTR account. If the amalgamated company also maintains a CTR account, the balances in the amalgamating companies’ CTR accounts are transferred to the amalgamated company. The 34 percentage point continuity rule applies from the time any credit arose in the CTR account of the amalgamating company until distributed by the amalgamating company, as if the amalgamation had not occurred. If the amalgamated company does not maintain a CTR account, the balance in the amalgamating companies’ CTR at the date of amalgamation is transferred to the amalgamated company’s ICA. The amalgamated company will then be required to pay to Inland Revenue an amount of DWP equal to the amount of the transfer. This payment will not give rise to a credit in either the ICA or DWP account of the amalgamated company. BETA mechanism The BETA mechanism remains largely unchanged from the way it operated before conduit reform. Tax payable on foreign attributed income gives rise to a credit in the BETA, which can be applied to meet the DWP liability on subsequent foreign-sourced dividends. Similarly, DWP deducted in respect of foreign-sourced dividends gives rise to a debit in the BETA, which can be applied to meet the income tax liability on subsequent foreign attributed income. To operate correctly, the BETA mechanism works on the basis of tax payable (including any tax implicitly paid by way of loss offset) before determining conduit relief. This ensures that changes in shareholding, for example, do not affect the BETA mechanism’s ability to ensure double taxation does not occur on the same ultimate source of income. To achieve this effect in relation to conduit income, the BETA rules have been modified to ensure that: •BETA credits and debits on foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends respectively are determined before conduit relief is calculated (section MF 4(1)(a), (3)(a)); and •BETA offsets are applied before calculating conduit relief (section MF 5(2)(a), (6)(c)). Implications of reform for non-CTR companies One of the anomalies identified in the development of conduit tax reform was that the net return to non-resident shareholders of New Zealand companies could be influenced by the order in which the company derived foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends. The BETA mechanism had the general effect of ensuring that New Zealand tax was imposed only on the form of income that was derived first. If a company derived a foreign-sourced dividend before foreign attributed income, the payment of the DWP impost would give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account, instead of to its ICA if the foreign attributed income were derived first. Because of their refundable nature, DWP provided a greater benefit to non-resident shareholders. A key aspect of conduit reform for resolving this anomaly is the ability created for companies to credit the tax paid on net foreign attributed income (foreign attributed income less any excess interest allocation) to their DWP account. This option also exists for non-conduit tax relief compa- nies. If a company maintains a DWP account, the tax payable by the company on foreign attributed income is creditable to the DWP account under section ME 5(7). The interest allocation rules in Subpart FH still apply in determining the amount to be credited to the DWP account. However, given the $50,000 relief threshold for the interest allocation rules, it is not anticipated that compa- nies not electing to be conduit tax relief companies will be affected by the rules. If companies do have enough potential conduit relief to be affected by the interest allocation rules, it is reasonable to expect them to elect into the full mechanism, so they can derive the benefits of current-based conduit relief. Alternatively, such companies may elect to cease to be a DWP account company under section MG 2(4). Conduit reform: holding companies and 100% chains of companies Background to holding company rules Non-resident investors commonly use holding compa- nies as vehicles through which to hold their New Zealand investments. A common structure is illustrated in the following diagram. Non-resident owns 100% of NZ Holding Co, which in turn has an investment in NZ Operating Co. Legally, NZ Holding Co holds the interest in NZ Operating Co, but economically, the real owner is Non- resident. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 14 •eliminate the tax impost on the dividend flow to the holding company (section CB 10(4) and (5)). In determining whether a company is wholly owned by a single non-resident, a small shareholder that is effec- tively a nominee and exists to meet company law requirements will not be treated as a separate share- holder (section OE 7(1)(b)). NRWT of 15% will still be imposed when conduit income is passed on to the actual non-resident investor. If special rules were introduced for all 100% owned holding companies, irrespective of the size of their investment into other New Zealand companies, an inappropriate incentive would be created for every non- resident to incur costs to hold their investments into New Zealand through special holding companies to qualify for conduit tax relief holding company treatment. To reduce this incentive, the special treatment of holding companies will apply only to the extent that they hold interests of 10% or greater in other New Zealand companies (section OE 7(1)(c)). Example The shareholding of NZ Holding Co and its interests in other New Zealand resident companies is as follows: 8% 100% Holding Co NZ Holding Co NZ Co 1NZ Co 2 15% Non-resident Because of the 10% ownership threshold, NZ Holding Co will be treated as a non-resident for conduit relief purposes only in relation to NZ Co 1. In relation to NZ Co 2, NZ Holding Co will be treated the same way as any other New Zealand resident shareholder – its interest in the company will not give rise to any current-based conduit relief. Restrictions on ownership of conduit tax relief holding companies Several special rules targeting the ownership of conduit tax relief holding companies have been introduced to preserve the integrity of the rules. First, consistent with the rules applying to direct interests in New Zealand companies held by non-residents, a CFC or a non-qualifying trust will not be treated as a non- resident shareholder. If a holding company has such a shareholder, it cannot be a conduit tax relief holding company (section OE 7(2)). Second, because of the 10% ownership threshold required before a company can be a conduit tax relief holding company in relation to a conduit tax relief company, rules have been introduced to deal with the NZ Holding Co Non-resident NZ Operating Co CFC/FIF 100% X% Y% Resident investors Z% Because conduit tax relief generally arises only to the extent that non-residents hold direct interests in New Zealand companies with foreign investment, no relief would arise to NZ Operating Co for the above structure in the absence of special holding company rules. One alternative is to require Non-resident to restructure its investment to hold its interest in Operating Co directly to obtain relief. The resulting structure, which is the economic equivalent of the ownership structure illustrated above, is illustrated in the following diagram. Non-resident NZ Operating Co CFC/FIF X% Y% Resident investors Z% There are several reasons, however, why this would have represented a poor policy approach: •It could be expensive for Non-resident, and may disrupt a structure established for non-tax reasons. •Non-resident may be unable to manage the timing of distributions from conduit income, and consequently its NRWT and home country tax liabilities. These liabilities could potentially claw back the benefit of any conduit relief given to Operating Co. •If Operating Co did not pass on the benefits of conduit relief to Non-resident, but instead reinvested it, the benefits from that reinvestment would accrue to both Resident Investors and Non-resident. For Non-resident to fully capture the benefits of conduit relief (includ- ing any income accruing to the reinvested relief), it is necessary that the relief be on-paid and held on its account. However, NRWT acts as a deterrent to this distribution. To resolve these concerns, special rules have been introduced that: •allow New Zealand resident holding companies wholly owned by a single non-resident investor to be treated as if they were themselves non-resident (sections OE 7(1), (2) and OE 8(3)); and from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 15 situation when ownership falls below this threshold. If this occurs, the election to be treated as a non-resident in relation to that conduit tax relief company will be revoked, and subsequent conduit income of the conduit tax relief company and dividends paid to the holding company will no longer qualify for preferred treatment. There will, however, be no consequence for any credits in the holding company’s CTR account at the time it ceases to hold the requisite 10% interest (section MI 5(1)(e),(f) or (g) do not apply). Dividend exemption Dividends paid to a conduit tax relief holding company are exempt income “to the extent fully conduit tax relief credited” (section CB 10(4)). The term “fully conduit tax relief credited” is defined in section OB 1. It is that portion of a cash dividend equal to the CTR tax credits attached, multiplied by 67/33. Thus if a $120 cash dividend is paid with $33 CTR credits attached, the dividend is fully conduit tax relief credited to the extent of $67 of the cash dividend ($33 x 67/33). The remaining $53 of the dividend is not conduit tax relief credited. The additional dividend paid to a conduit tax relief holding company in respect of CTR credits attached is also exempt income (section CB 10(5)). The CTR credit does not form part of the dividend, so is also not subject to tax. Amendments to thin capitalisation rules One of the most difficult policy problems under the thin capitalisation rules is the double counting of equity (and, therefore, assets) that would result if companies under common control were not required to consolidate. To some extent, the ability for companies not to group down a chain for interests of less than 66% leaves this double counting problem unaddressed. Because the holding company rules are concessionary, new rules have been introduced that require generally that a holding company consolidate with any conduit tax relief companies in which it holds a direct interest of more than 50%, notwithstanding that it may have elected to group on the basis of a 66% election. This precludes the holding company from benefiting from both a double counting of assets through not consolidating with lower- tier interests and the special holding company rules. Specifically, section FG 4(14E) modifies the thin capitalisation rules so that the 66% option no longer applies in relation to the direct interest held by a conduit tax relief holding company in any company to which it has forwarded an election (if the 66% option is elected under thin capitalisation, the lower “greater than 50%” option would apply to the direct interest held by the holding company, with the 66% option applying to all other links in the chain). The effect of this rule is illustrated in the following diagram. If NZ Holding Co, as the New Zealand parent of Tax- payer Co under the thin capitalisation rules, elected to apply the 66% grouping threshold, then NZ Holding Co would represent one New Zealand group for thin capitalisation purposes, NZ Operating Co and Taxpayer Co would represent a second group, while NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 would represent third and fourth groups respectively. 100% Non-resident 60% NZ Holding Co NZ Operating Co 100% CFC 80% Taxpayer Co 60% NZ Co 1 60% NZ Co 2 If NZ Holding Co is a conduit tax relief holding com- pany in respect of NZ Operating Co, section FG 4(14E) will prevent the 66% grouping option applying to NZ Holding Co’s interest in NZ Operating Co, because NZ Operating Co is a conduit tax relief company. NZ Holding Co, NZ Operating Co and Taxpayer Co would then become a single New Zealand group for thin capitalisation purposes. However, the 66% grouping election continues to apply other than to direct interests NZ Holding Co has in conduit tax relief companies, and NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 will continue to represent separate New Zealand groups for thin capitalisation purposes. Section FG 4(14E) will not be applicable in every case. If dividends received by a conduit tax relief holding company are on-paid to its non-resident shareholder in the year of receipt (section FG 4(14F)), section FG 4(14E) will not apply. In applying this rule, however, any dividend not on-paid in earlier years will need to be on-paid before a subsequent dividend can be treated as being on-paid in the year of receipt. The specific test for determining whether dividends have been on-paid refers to dividends to the extent fully CTR credited (as defined in section OB 1). Thus the focus is on relief passed through (as evidenced by credits attached to dividends), rather than the amount of divi- dends with any extent of conduit tax relief credits attached. Special rules for 100% owned chains of companies (sections MI 5(1)(f), (g), OE 7(3) to (5) and OE 8) Special rules have also been introduced for 100% chains of companies. These rules allow a lower-tier company in a chain of companies to qualify for conduit tax relief on account of the extent of non-resident shareholding in the top-tier company in the chain. Dividends being passed up the 100% chain will be exempt from tax under existing section CB 10(2). continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 16 Under the 100% group rules, NZ Parent Co will be treated as a non-resident in relation to NZ 100% Co, to the extent of the 60% interest held in NZ Parent Co by non-residents. As a consequence, NZ 100% Co will be entitled to 60% relief on conduit income derived from CFC Co. Effective nominees As with the rules for conduit tax relief holding compa- nies, a small shareholder that is effectively a nominee and exists to meet company law requirements will be disregarded in determining whether 100% ownership exists (section OE 7(4)). Conduit reform: interest allocation rules Introduction The interest allocation rules in new subpart FH aim to ensure that companies do not allocate an excessive amount of interest expense to their New Zealand opera- tions, relative to their foreign interests for which conduit relief is to be provided. If an excessive interest allocation exists, the excess will be reallocated against conduit income, thereby reducing the amount of conduit relief to which the New Zealand company will be entitled. The fundamental test for determining whether an excessive allocation exists will be a comparison of the debt level of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group with that of CFC and FIF interests in which it holds an interest. An excessive allocation in New Zealand exists if the debt level of the New Zealand group exceeds that of its CFC and FIF interests. The required calculations introduce potentially high compliance costs. To minimise these costs, two impor- tant safe harbours have been introduced. Their aim is to ensure that taxpayers are required to perform full calculations only if their New Zealand group has highly geared its New Zealand operations, and a significant amount of conduit relief is involved. To this end, the interest allocation rules will not apply if: •the conduit relief to which the taxpayer, and compa- nies associated with the taxpayer, are entitled for an income year does not exceed $50,000 (section FH 1(2)(a)); or (Note: If any company identified, including the taxpayer, is not a conduit tax relief company, the test applies to that company based on the relief to which it would have been entitled if it had elected to be a conduit tax relief company.) •the “debt percentage” of the taxpayer’s New Zealand group does not exceed 66% (section FH 1(2)(b)). The New Zealand group is labelled as the “foreign attributed income group” in Subpart FH. This is to distinguish it from the “New Zealand group” under the thin capitalisation rules, since the two groups do not necessarily need to be identical. This commentary will, therefore, use the term “foreign attributed income group” to refer subsequently to the New Zealand group under the interest allocation rules. Process for applying interest allocation rules The flow chart on the right sets out an outline of the process to be followed in applying the interest allocation rules. The steps identified are annotated only in greatly summarised form. For a detailed explanation of each step in the process, reference should be made to the explanation that follows. Non-applicability of interest allocation rules if total relief is less than $50,000 The interest allocation rules will not apply to a taxpayer if the aggregate amount of conduit relief to which the taxpayer and all companies associated with the taxpayer for an income year is less than $50,000. Two points should be noted in applying this safe har- bour. First, the purpose of the test is to reduce compliance costs by allowing taxpayers to meet a safe harbour test without performing any interest allocation calculations. Consequently, the test is applied based on the amount of conduit tax relief to which a company would be entitled if there is no interest allocation. Second, there is a special rule for companies that are not conduit tax relief companies but still maintain a DWP account. For each of those companies, the test applies based on the amount of conduit relief the company Example The shareholding chain for a 100% New Zealand group is as follows: 60% Holding Co NZ Parent Co Non-residents 100% Holding Co NZ 100% Co 100% CFC Co from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 17 would have received if it were a conduit tax relief company (section FH 1(2)(a)(i) and (iii)). Identify companies associated with taxpayer Does their aggregate relief exceed $50,000 for income year? Is taxpayer subject to thin capitalisation rules? Taxpayer’s “foreign attributed income group” is same as New Zealand group under thin capitalisation rules Taxpayer’s “foreign attributed income group” includes all companies in same tax group as taxpayer No No Yes Yes Interest allocation rules do not apply Does debt percentage of group exceed 66%? No Does debt percentage exceed consolidated group’s? No Yes Calculate excess interest allocation Yes Calculate debt percentage of group consolidated with CFC/FIF interests? Yes No Applying interest allocation rules Example Taxpayer Co is entitled to conduit relief for an income year of $30,000. Non-conduit Co is a company associated with Taxpayer Co that main- tains a DWP account, but has not elected to be a conduit tax relief company. Consequently, Non-conduit Co does not qualify for conduit relief. However, the company is 75% owned by non-resident shareholders and has received a foreign-sourced dividend in the income year of $100,000. No foreign withholding tax has been deducted and the company does not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. Taxpayer Co would not qualify for exemption from the interest allocation rules under the $50,000 relief threshold. This is because Taxpayer Co’s $30,000 relief, when aggregated with the $24,750 relief Non-conduit Co would have been entitled if it were a conduit tax relief company ($100,000 x 33% x 75%), exceeds the $50,000 threshold. Scheme of rules if $50,000 relief safe harbour threshold breached The central test around which the interest allocation rules are based is a comparison with the level of debt funding of a group against its New Zealand assets against the level of debt funding of CFCs and FIFs for which conduit relief is to be given. The discussion immediately following explains the general framework that the rules follow. Understanding the framework should help to place some of the more detailed rules discussed subsequently in their proper context. To achieve a meaningful comparison, the rules in sections FH 3 to FH 5 for determining the excess interest allocation, in principle, apply the following process: 1.The level of debt is calculated for a consolidated group, which includes members of the taxpayer’s group in New Zealand, and CFCs and FIF calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods from which gross income is derived (re- ferred to subsequently as “non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs) in which those members hold an interest. 2.The amount of consolidated assets for that group are also calculated. 3.The calculations from steps one and two are used to calculate the consolidated group’s debt percentage. This represents the extent to which each dollar of assets is funded by debt. 4.The consolidated group’s debt percentage is applied back to the assets of the New Zealand part of the group to determine the acceptable level of debt relative to those assets. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 18 66% safe harbour debt percentage To reduce compliance costs, section FH 1(2)(b) intro- duces a second safe harbour, which is the 66% debt percentage. If the debt level of the New Zealand assets of the group is less than 66%, the interest allocation rules do not apply. (This safe harbour is replicated in paragraph (a) of variable CGDP in the formula in section FH 5) In effect, what this rule does, in relation to the general scheme of the interest allocation rules, is to allow steps one to three of the process to default to 66%. Thus, in practice, taxpayers will first complete step four of the process to determine whether this 66% threshold is breached. If it is, taxpayers can then proceed, if they wish, to perform the calculations under steps one to three of the process, to see if this permits a higher level of debt funding of the New Zealand assets. The remainder of this commentary examines the interest allocation rules in the order in which they will be applied to taxpayers. Determination of foreign attributed income group (New Zealand group) If a taxpayer company does not qualify for the $50,000 relief safe harbour, the next step will be to identify its foreign attributed income group. In determining whether an excess interest allocation exists, the level of debt funding for that group will need to be determined. The rules for determining a taxpayer’s foreign attributed income group are contained in section FH 2. The basis for determining the group depends on whether the taxpayer is subject to the thin capitalisation rules or not (that is, whether it is controlled by a single non- resident person). If the taxpayer is subject to the thin capitalisation rules, its foreign attributed income group under the interest allocation rules will be the same as the one determined under the existing thin capitalisation rules (Note: this will exclude the special grouping rules for holding companies in section FG 4(14E) and (14F)). If the taxpayer is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules, its foreign attributed income group will consist of itself and any other company with which it has 66% common ownership. The key principle underlying the adoption of this threshold is the ability of group compa- nies to transfer losses. Rationale for using groups As noted in the discussion document, it is necessary for interest allocation rules to apply in relation to a New Zealand group, rather than only to the taxpayer holding a direct interest in a CFC, to prevent a group of New Zealand companies being structured in a way that circumvents the interest allocation rules. This problem is illustrated in the following two dia- grams. (Note: Section FH 3(3) excludes from the assets of the foreign attributed income group any interest held by a member of that group in a CFC or FIF calcu- lated under the accounting profits or branch equiva- lent methods from which gross income is derived (“non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs). This exclusion occurs to the extent non-residents hold interests in that group member. These interests are consolidated out in the full calculations under section FH 4. The exclusion of assets under section FH 3(3) is necessary to get a meaningful comparison of debt levels between the non-conduit assets of the foreign attributed income group and the total assets of the consolidated group.) A brief example illustrates this mechanism further. Example Taxpayer Co is the only member of a foreign attributed income group. It is owned 100% by non- resident shareholders. Its balance sheet is as follows: Taxpayer Co Equity..............6,000Shares in CFC........3,000 Debt...............15,000Other assets..........18,000 21,00021,000 Taxpayer Co holds 100% of the shares in CFC. The balance sheet of CFC is as follows: CFC Equity..............3,000Assets.................12,000 Debt............... 9,000 12,00012,000 Performing a consolidation will result in the follow- ing consolidated balance sheet: Consolidated group Equity..............6,000Assets.................30,000 Debt...............24,000 30,00030,000 Under step one of the process, the level of debt of the consolidated group is $24,000. Under step two, the assets of the consolidated group are $30,000. This gives a debt percentage under step 3 of 80% (24,000/30,000). Applying this percentage in step four of the process, Taxpayer Co’s assets of $18,000 (the equity invest- ment in CFC is not treated as an asset) will be able to be funded to 80% debt before the interest alloca- tion rules apply. This leaves an acceptable debt level of $14,400 (18,000 x 80%) in Taxpayer Co. The excess interest allocation to Taxpayer Co would, therefore, be $600 (15,000 – 14,400). from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 19 100% 100% NZ Parent NZ Sub CFC Debt No debt In the diagram above, rules that considered only the interest expense incurred by the company holding a direct interest in the CFC (NZ Sub) would not take into account interest expense incurred by other companies in the group (NZ Parent). Such rules would not be effective in determining the interest expense properly attributable to the income from the CFC because the loss grouping rules effectively allow the interest expense to be de- ducted anywhere in the group. 100% 100% NZ Parent Debt CFC NZ Sub The situation illustrated in this second diagram, in which a CFC is interposed between the two New Zealand group companies, is similar. If reference were made only to the company holding a direct interest in the CFC, the interest incurred by NZ Sub would not be considered in determining the amount of NZ Parent’s interest expense allocable to the income from the CFC. However, the loss grouping rules still enable NZ Parent to take advantage of the interest expense incurred by NZ Sub in determin- ing its taxable income. Consequently, if interest allocation rules are to be effective, they need to be defined in relation to the group of companies of which a taxpayer is a member. Measurement of “debt level” of foreign attributed income group (“NZ foreign attributed income group debt percentage”) The rules for calculating the group debt percentage are similar to those used for calculating the value of a group’s assets and debt under the thin capitalisation rules. Generally accepted accounting practices for consolidation are applied to the foreign attributed income group determined under section FH 2, eliminat- ing intra-group transactions within that group (section FH 3(1)). Section FH 3(3) contains the exception to the general rule of following a similar calculation approach to the one used under the thin capitalisation rules. Any interests held by a member of the foreign attributed income group in a CFC or FIF calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods from which gross income is derived (“non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs) are excluded from the assets of the group, to the extent non-residents hold interests in that group member. Excluding interests in non-grey list CFCs and FIF interests effectively permits the assets of the group other than these excluded assets to be debt-funded at least to the extent of the 66% safe harbour threshold. To the extent that the debt percentage of the consolidated group (including non-grey list CFC and FIF interests) is higher than 66%, a higher level of debt funding is permitted in the foreign attributed income group. Any debt in excess of 66% (or a higher amount calcu- lated for the consolidated group) is then treated by the rules as relating to the non-resident’s share of investment in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs, on which conduit relief is being provided. This represents interest expense for which an adjustment should, in principle, be made in determining the amount of conduit relief to which the company is entitled. How the interest expense allocation is performed is outlined below. Comparison of New Zealand debt level with that of CFC and FIF interests If taxpayers breach the 66% safe harbour, section FH 4 gives them the option of performing a consolidation calculation with their non-grey list CFC and FIF inter- ests. This determines whether, based on their consoli- dated group, a threshold of higher than 66% is justified for determining the extent to which there is an excessive interest expense allocation to the foreign attributed income group (the “worldwide fungibility approach” is applied to determine whether the allocation of the “worldwide group” to its New Zealand operations exceeds the debt levels borne by the group as a whole). If the taxpayer decides to calculate its “consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage” (including non-grey list CFC and FIF interests), section FH 4 requires the consolidation calculation to be made as follows: •The assets and debt of the New Zealand members of the group will be determined as under section FH 3, except that all interests held in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods are now excluded from the assets of the group (effect of section FH 4(8)). •Full consolidation of assets and debt should be done for non-grey list CFC and FIF interests of 40% or greater (section FH 4(3)). •For interests of between 5% and 40%, taxpayers will include the portion of the underlying interest’s assets and debts owned by the taxpayer (section FH 4(4)). For example, if a New Zealand company held 10% of an underlying CFC or FIF, it would consolidate 10% of that interest’s debt and assets into its group calcula- tions. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 20 conduit income, are contained in section FH 5. The formula in that section confirms that an interest alloca- tion can occur only to the extent that the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group exceeds 66%. If the debt percentage of the consolidated group (including relevant CFCs and FIFs) is higher than 66%, an interest allocation can only occur if, and to the extent that, the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group exceeds that of the consolidated group. Shorthand consolidation Section FH 5 permits a further debt percentage to be applied in determining the extent to which an excess interest allocation exists. This alternative represents a shorthand debt percentage calculation for the consoli- dated group. The example in the following diagram illustrates its effect. In the diagram, NZ Co (the only member in the foreign attributed income group) is 80% funded by debt. The interest expense on the $800 debt in NZ Co is $80. Half of its shares are owned by non-residents. NZ Co applies 50% of its capital to an investment in CFC, with the balance funding other (non-conduit) assets. NZ Co CFC Resident shareholders Non-resident shareholders Equity 100Equity 100 Equity 400 Debt 800 Debt 0 Other assets 600 Assets 400 The New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage for NZ Co is calculated as: 800 =100% 1,000 – (400 x 50%) Prima facie, because this debt percentage exceeds 66%, NZ Co will be subject to an excess interest allocation for the amount of New Zealand debt in excess of this amount. However, if Taxpayer Co were to perform a consolida- tion with CFC, the following consolidated balance sheet would result: Consolidated group Equity....................200Assets......................1,000 Debt.................... 800 1,0001,000 •Assets and debts for CFC and FIF interests should be consolidated using values from their existing financial statements (section FH 4(5)). Non-grey list CFC and FIF interests of less than 5% are excluded from the calculations, and are not included as an asset of the consolidated group. Example NZ Group Co is the only company in its foreign attributed income group. Its balance sheet is as follows: NZ Group Co Equity.................6,600CFC Co....................4,000 Debt..................18,000FIF Co 1...................4,000 FIF Co 2......................600 Other assets.............16,000 24,60024,600 NZ Group Co owns 80% of CFC Co, 25% of FIF Co 1, and 3% of FIF Co 2. The balance sheets of CFC Co, FIF Co 1 and FIF Co 2 are as follows: CFC Co Equity.................5,000Assets.....................13,000 Debt.................. 8,000 13,00013,000 FIF Co 1 Equity...............16,000Assets.....................24,000 Debt.................. 8,000 24,00024,000 FIF Co 2 Equity...............20,000Assets.....................60,000 Debt..................40,000 60,00060,000 The consolidated group debt percentage will be calcu- lated as follows: Consolidated debt: NZ Group Co:18,000 CFC Co:8,000 x 100% =8,000 FIF Co 1:8,000 x 25% =2,000 FIF Co 2: 0 28,000 Consolidated assets: NZ Group Co:16,000 CFC Co:13,000 x 100% =13,000 FIF Co 1:24,000 x 25% =6,000 FIF Co 2: 0 35,000 The consolidated group debt percentage will, therefore, be 80% (28,000/35,000). Determination of group excess interest allocation The rules for calculating whether a “group excess interest allocation amount” exists, and consequently whether interest expense must be allocated against from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 21 This would give a consolidated debt percentage of 80% (800/1000). Because this debt percentage exceeds 66%, using this percentage would reduce the amount of excess interest expense determined for NZ Co. One concern expressed in submissions on the bill is that taxpayers may be reluctant to incur the compliance costs associated with a full consolidation with non-grey list interests. This is despite the fact that such a consolida- tion may result in a lower amount of excess interest expense being determined. In response to this, the third limb added to variable CGDP in the formula in section FH 5 recognises that the scenario outlined above represents the worst-case mischief that the interest allocation rules were intended to address – a non-grey list entity owned 100% by a foreign attributed income group and fully equity funded. In practice, CFCs and FIF interests are likely to have debt levels that are greater than nil. Section FH 5 allows, therefore, a shorthand consolida- tion with non-grey list entities based on the assumption that the entities in which they invest are owned 100% by a foreign attributed income group and fully equity funded. This ignores debt in the underlying CFCs and FIFs. Mechanically, all this requires to measure is to undo the adjustment in section FH 3(3) for non-grey list CFC and FIF interests. In the example illustrated, the effect would be to com- pare the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group (100%) with that of the consolidated group (80%). Applying these amounts in the formula in section FH 5 gives a $20 excess interest. The implications of the rule are best illustrated by considering the original scenario, but with CFC now funding additional assets by acquiring debt funding of its own. This is illustrated in the following diagram. NZ Co CFC Resident shareholders Non-resident shareholders Equity 100Equity 100 Equity 400 Debt 800 Debt 300 Other assets 600 Assets 700 In applying the shorthand test, the debt funding of the CFC is disregarded. As with the previous calculations, the consolidated assets will be $1,000 (the assets of NZ Co) and the consolidated debt will be $800 (the debt of NZ Co), giving a consolidated debt percentage of 80%. From this, it is clear that the shorthand consolida- tion internalises all data to the New Zealand group. It is illustrative however, to consider what happens if a full consolidation is performed with CFC. In that case, the consolidated assets will be $1,300 ($600 + $700), the consolidated debt will be $1,100 ($800 + $300), giving a consolidated debt percentage of 84.6% ($1,100/$1,300). This is higher than the percentage calculated under the shorthand consolidation, and would lead to a lower excess interest allocation determination. In summary, therefore, the shorthand consolidation is a low-compliance cost option of performing the full consolidation calculation which, although being in all but very obscure scenarios less beneficial to the taxpayer than a full consolidation, is nevertheless more favourable than the position if no consolidation is performed at all. Application of excess interest allocation against foreign attributed income If the application of the formula in section FH 5 deter- mines that there is an excess interest allocation, the next question is how that should be applied. The general rule is the excess is to be allocated against the net foreign attributed income (foreign attributed income less foreign attributed losses offset) derived by members of the group under sections FH 6 and FH 7. If the excess is greater than the net foreign attributed income, any surplus is then allocated under section FH 8 against dividends subject to DWP. Determination of net foreign attributed income The effect of the formula in section FH 6 is to determine what percentage the excess interest expense represents of the group’s net foreign attributed income. Section FH 7 then determines that percentage of a group mem- ber’s net foreign attributed income to be its share of the excess interest allocation. This amount is then substi- tuted in the variable “EIA” in the formula in section KH 1(2) to determine the amount of conduit relief (if any) to which the member is entitled. An amendment was made at Select Committee to clarify that the income base against which the excess interest expense is to be allocated is reduced by the income equivalent value of any BETA debit able to be offset against the income tax liability. This is because income tax is only really payable to the extent a BETA offset does not occur. It is not appropriate that interest expense is allocated against income on which no tax is payable because it has been paid in an alternative form. continued on page 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 22 When this amount is applied back into section KH 1(2), conduit relief is determined to be exactly nil: 60% x ((33% x (15,000 – 0 – 5,000)) – 0 – 3,300) The excess interest allocation of $7,000 ($12,000 – $5,000) will be applied against Vice Versa Ltd’s DWP liability under section FH 8. The application of the rules in section FH 8 are discussed in the section that follows. Application of excess interest allocation against DWP If the amount of interest expense allocated to all mem- bers of the foreign attributed income group under section FH 7 is less than the amount calculated in applying section FH 5 in respect of the group, the difference is applied against foreign-sourced dividends derived by members of the group from which a DWP is required to be deducted using the formulae in section FH 7. The first step is to convert the excess amount into its tax cash value, by multiplying the excess by the company tax rate. This tax cash value is then allocated against the DWP liabilities of the companies calculated before the provision of conduit tax relief. To the extent that an allocation is made, the following results: •An amount of gross income equal to the allocated tax cash value divided by the company tax rate is derived by the company under section FH 8(3). •A debit will arise in the company’s CTR account equal to the foreign dividend adjustment amount calculated under section FH 8(5) (section MI 5(1)(b)). This amount is determined by multiplying the amount of gross income by the company tax rate. The reason for an additional amount of gross income under section FH 8(3) requires explanation. It traces back to the position that would have resulted had the company derived foreign attributed income subject to the interest allocation rules, and then used the BETA credit arising from that liability to meet the subsequent DWP liability. In that case, tax on the foreign attributed income would have been credited to the DWP account of the company under section ME 5(6) only to the extent of tax on the income net of the interest allocation. This gives a lower credit to the DWP account than if an equivalent gross dividend had been received. The additional amount of gross income under section FH 8(3) addresses this inconsistency. It ensures that deriving dividends before foreign attributed income does not result in more favourable balances in the memoran- dum account of the company than if foreign attributed income were derived first (DWP credits in preference to ICA credits). Example Vice Versa Ltd derived a foreign-sourced dividend of $10,000 on 1 July 1998. No foreign withholding tax was deducted and the company had no entitle- ment for an underlying foreign tax credit. Vice Versa Ltd is the only company in its foreign attrib- uted income group. Because it had 60% non-resident shareholders, the DWP liability on the dividend was reduced by $1,980 ($3,300 x 60%) from $3,300 ($10,000 x 33%) to $1,320. A debit arose to the BETA for $3,300. Vice Versa Ltd subsequently derived foreign attributed income of $15,000. Again, no foreign tax credit was available. Vice Versa Ltd continued to have 60% non-resident shareholders. In applying the relief formula in section KH 1, variable BC, for BETA offsets, will be $3,300. Because there are no foreign tax credits, relief will, in the absence of an excess interest allocation, be determined as: 60% x ((33% x (15,000 – 0 – 0)) – 0 – 3,300) = $990 Tax will be payable of $660 ($15,000 x 33%, less $3,300 BETA debit, less $990 conduit relief). Overall, therefore, Vice Versa Co will pay tax of $1,980 ($1,320 DWP plus $660 income tax), and receive conduit relief of $2,970 ($1,980 on DWP and $990 on foreign attributed income). Thus the pre-conduit relief tax base is $4,950 ($1,980 tax plus $2,970 relief). As it turns out. Vice Versa Ltd has an excess interest allocation under section FH 5 of $12,000. This has a tax equivalent value of $3,960 ($12,000 x 33%). What the rules in sections FH 6 and FH 7 aim to achieve is to apply this tax equivalent value against the tax payable on conduit income. Thus in princi- ple, the excess interest allocation is to be offset first against the pre-conduit relief income tax liability of $1,650 ($660 tax plus $990 relief), with the excess applied against the DWP liability. Applying the formula in section FH 6 to Vice Versa Ltd, the company’s excess interest allocation percentage would be determined as: $12,000 x 33% = 240% 33% x ($15,000 – 0) – $3,300 Because this percentage exceeds 100%, the variable EIAP in section FH 7 will be 100%. This results in an excess interest allocation for Vice Versa Ltd under section FH 7 to be included in section KH 1(2) of: (15,000 – 0 – $3,300 ) x 100% = $5,000 33% from page 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 23 Example The application of the rules in section NH 7 is illustrated by revisiting Vice Versa Ltd. Recall that Vice Versa Ltd had an excess interest allocation unable to be applied under section FH 7 of $7,000. This is the surplus group excess interest allocation amount calculated under section FH 8(1). The formula in section FH 8(2) then calculates the company’s surplus group excess interest allocation percentage as: $7,000 x 33% =70% $3,300 Applying this percentage into the variable SGEIP in section FH 8(4) then enables the company’s foreign dividend adjustment to be calculated as: $3,300 x 70% =$7,000 33% Under section FH 8(3), the company is deemed to have derived an amount of gross income equal to this amount on the last day of its income year. A debit will also arise to its CTR account under section MI 5(1)(b) of $2,310 ($7,000 x 33%). Detailed example of effect of excess interest allocation against DWP A taxpayer’s foreign attributed income group consists of three members, A Co, B Co and C Co. Following the application of section FH 7 (allocation of excess interest expense against foreign attributed income), a surplus group excess interest amount of $700 is determined under section FH 8(1). The companies have 31 March balance dates, and have respective DWP liabilities for the year to 31 March 1999 as follows: A CoB CoC Co Gross dividends derived10,0008,00016,000 UFTC5,00004,000 Foreign withholding tax 1,000 2,400 DWP payable02,640200 BETA offsets( 640)0 Loss offsets ( 500) 0 01,500200 Conduit relief(600)(20) Net DWP paid 0900180 Balance in CTR account0600 CR20 CR Balance in DWP account0900 CR180 CR B Co’s average percentage of non-resident shareholders was 40%, while C Co’s was 10%. The first step is to convert the excess interest allocation to its tax cash value of $231 ($700 x 33%). This tax cash value is then allocated against the net DWP liabilities of members of the group, determined before the provision of conduit relief. The relevant amounts are ‘nil’ for A Co, $1,500 for B Co and $200 for C Co. Application of the formula in section FH 8(1) determines a surplus group excess interest allocation percentage of 13.59% ( 231 / (1,500 + 200) ). This percentage is then applied as follows: A Co:$0 x 13.59%=$ 0 B Co:$1,500 x 13.59%=$204 C Co:$200 x 13.59%=$ 27 In relation to B Co, the following would then result: •Under section FH 8(3), an amount of gross income of $618 ( 204 / 0.33 ) would be derived on the last day of the 1998/99 income year. •A debit will arise in the company’s CTR account for $82 (equal to $618 x 33% x 40% average non-resident shareholding) under section MI 5(1)(b)). As a consequence, B Co would have paid tax and have credits in its memorandum accounts as follows: Total DWP paid$900= $ 900 Income tax paid$618 x 33%= $ 204 Balance in ICA$618 x 33%= $ 204 Balance in DWP account$900= $ 900 Balance in CTR Account$600 – $82= $ 518 Detailed interest allocation rules example Introduction The Commentary to the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill (No.2) 1997 contained a detailed example of the application of the interest allocation rules. The purpose of that example was to illustrate the overall effect of the rules in their entirety, rather than only aspects of the rules which have been discussed elsewhere in this Tax Information Bulletin. This section reproduces the example in the Commentary to the bill, but has been modified to take into account changes made to the bill at Select Committee. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 24 NZ Co 2 Share capital......20,000Shares in AP FIF 2.60,000 Other shareholders’Loan to funds................180,000NZ Co 1..............800,000 Loan from CFC200,000Other assets.........340,000 Other “tax” debt.........700,000 Other “non-tax” debt 100,000 1,200,0001,200,000 For the year to 31 March 1999, NZ Co 2 had the follow- ing relevant income and expenses: FIF income from AP FIF 2..................................6,231 Interest expense under section DD 1(b).............150,000 CFC CFC’s accounting period ended on 31 December 1998.

Relevant amounts from its balance sheet at that date are as follows: AP FIF 2 Share capital....200,000Assets.................500,000 Other shareholders’ funds................150,000 Liabilities.........150,000 500,000500,000 Step 1: Identify the foreign attributed income group (section FH 2) Because NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 are both subject to the thin capitalisation rules, by virtue of a single non- resident person (Non-resident) holding in them an ownership interest of 50% or greater (section FG 2), the thin capitalisation rules apply to determine the foreign attributed income group. The group will consist, there- fore, of NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2. Example The following example is designed to illustrate the effect of the interest allocation rules, and their interface with the formula for determining conduit relief in section KH 1. The structure is deliberately convoluted to illustrate the various interfaces in the rules. Calculations are to be performed for the income year ending 31 March 1999. Non-resident NZ Co 1 NZ Co 2CFC 75% 60% 80% 25% NZ residents 40% AP FIF 2 30% AP FIF 1 3% Non-residents 20% Relevant information and balance sheets for the various companies is as follows: NZ Co 1 NZ Co 1’s income year ended on 31 March 1999.

Relevant amounts from its balance sheet at that date are as follows: from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 25 Step 2: Calculate New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 3) The New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage is determined by applying the thin capitalisa- tion rules in section FG 4(1) to (14D) to the foreign attributed income group (NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2). The most significant factors to bear in mind here are that: •Section FG 4(2) defines debt on the basis on financial arrangements that provide funds to the recipient and give rise to a deduction for “interest” expense. This differs from the concept of debt used in preparing financial statements. •Assets are measured based on generally accepted accounting principles of New Zealand (section FG 4(3) to (4)). Assets held by group members in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods are also excluded from the asset base to the extent that non-residents hold a direct interest in the New Zealand company holding those CFC and FIF interests. The asset and debt values for the foreign attributed income group comprising NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 are, therefore, calculated as follows. Assets:NZ Co 1’s total assets.......................2,246,800 NZ Co 2’s total assets.......................1,200,000 Less:NZ Co 1’s equity in NZ Co 2...............(15,000) 60% of NZ Co 1’s equity in CFC.......(240,000) 60% of NZ Co 1’s equity in AP FIF 1....(1,800) 25% of NZ Co 2’s equity in AP FIF 2..(15,000) Loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1......( 800,000 ) Total assets.......................................2,375,000 Debt:Other “tax” debt of NZ Co 1.............1,000,000 Other “tax” debt of NZ Co 2............. 700,000 Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2........... 200,000 Total debt.........................................1,900,000 This results in a New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage of 80% ( 1,900,000 / 2,375,000 ). (Note: The thin capitalisation rules will not have any effect here, because the New Zealand group debt percentage for thin capitalisation purposes is only 72.2% ( 1,900,000 / 2,631,800 ).) Step 3: Test whether the New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage exceeds 66% As the New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage does exceed 66%, there is, prima facie, an adjustment to be made for an excess interest alloca- tion under section FH 5. The group must now decide whether to pursue a consolidation including its CFC and FIF interests under section FH 4. Shorthand consolidation If NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 do not want to pursue a full consolidation with CFC, AP FIF 1 and AP FIF 2 under section FH 4, they could consider how the shorthand consolidation would determine their excess interest allocation. In performing this calculation, the assets of the foreign attributed income group would not be adjusted to remove the non-resident shareholders’ share of equity in non-grey list entities. The group’s assets would be calculated as: NZ Co 1’s total assets...................................2,246,800 NZ Co 2’s total assets...................................1,200,000 NZ Co 1’s equity in NZ Co 2...........................(15,000) Loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1..................( 800,000) Group’s total assets......................................2,631,800 The group’s debt remains as 1,900,000, giving a consoli- dated group debt percentage of 72.2% ( 1,900,000 / 2,631,800 ). As this percentage is higher than the 66% safe harbour percentage, the shorthand consolidation can make the group better off. If the company does not perform the calculation under section FH 4, section FH 5 can be applied to determine the group excess interest allocation amount using 72.2% as the threshold percentage, rather than the 66% safe harbour percentage (step 5 of the process). Step 4: Calculate consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 4) If the taxpayer proceeds with a full consolidation with its group’s offshore interests, the asset and debt values calculated at step 2 form the starting point for the further calculations. Adjustments are then made as required by section FH 4. First, the assets of the foreign attributed income group are further reduced to the extent of resident sharehold- ers’ share of its CFC and FIF interests (section FH 3(3)): Adjustment for NZ Co 1’s equity in CFC: 40% x 400,000 =160,000 Adjustment for NZ Co 1’s equity in AP FIF 1: 40% x 3,000 =1,200 Adjustment for NZ Co 2’s equity in AP FIF 2: 75% x 60,000 = 45,000 Total adjustment:206,200 Second, consolidation with the CFC and FIF interests is performed following the rules in section FH 4(3) to (5). In doing this: •100% of the assets and debt of CFC are consolidated into the calculation; •30% of the assets and debt of AP FIF 2 are consoli- dated into the calculation; •AP FIF 1’s assets and debt are disregarded because the foreign attributed income group’s interest is less than 5%. continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 26 (Note: Because the debt percentage calculated using the shorthand consolidation at step 3 exceeds the 66% safe harbour percentage and the consolidated group debt percentage (65.8%), this is the percentage applied in the section FH 5 formula.) Step 6: Determine allocation of excess interest expense between group members The next step in the process is to apply the excess interest allocation rules in section FH 6. As a starting point, this requires the amount of foreign attributed income to be identified to which relief may potentially apply. In the example, this will be the following income: NZ Co 1’s attributed foreign income from CFC..60,000 NZ Co 1’s FIF income from AP FIF 1................10,000 NZ Co 2’s FIF income from AP FIF 2.................6,231 Total foreign attributed income...........................76,231 Applying this amount to the formula in section FH 6, an excess interest allocation percentage of 34.56% is determined ( 26,345 / 76,231 ). The formula in section FH 7 then allocates 34.56c interest against each dollar of net foreign attributed income (in the formula, foreign attributed income less foreign attributed income losses offset). The excess interest allocated to NZ Co 1 will, therefore, be $24,192 (70,000 x 34.56%). The excess interest allocated to NZ Co 2 will be $2,153 (6,231 x 34.56%). Step 7: Determine amount of conduit relief Because all of the interest expense has been allocated against foreign attributed income, it is not necessary to consider whether the rules in section FH 8 relating to the allocation of excess interest expense against DWP apply. This means that all that remains to be determined is the amount of conduit relief arising under section KH 1(2). Application of the formula in section KH 1(2) will determine relief for NZ Co 1 as: 60% x ((33% x (70,000 – 0 – 24,192)) – 12,500 – 0) = $1,570. Application of the formula in section KH 1(2) will determine relief for NZ Co 2 as: 25% x ((33% x (6,321 – 2,153)) – 0 – 0) = $344. The asset and debt of the consolidated foreign attributed income group are, therefore, determined as follows: Assets:Foreign attributed income group’s total assets........................................2,375,000 Less:Adjustment for residents’ share of CFC and FIF interests........................(206,200) Add:100% of CFC's assets.......................1,481,200 Less:Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2...............(200,000) Add:30% of AP FIF 2’s assets.................. 150,000 Total assets.......................................3,600,000 Debt:Foreign attributed income group’s total debt..............................1,900,000 Less:Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2...............(200,000) Add:100% of CFC’s debt............................625,000 30% of AP FIF 2’s debt.................... 45,000 Total debt.........................................2,370,000 This results in a consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage of 65.8% ( 2,370,000 / 3,600,000 ). Because this percentage is less than 66%, the interest allocation rules continue to apply on the basis of the 66% safe harbour threshold (subject to any higher percentage calculated using the shorthand consolida- tion). The group is not forced to now apply the interest allocation rules on the basis of the lower 65.8% consoli- dated foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 5). Step 5: Determine excess interest allocation amount (section FH 5) The first step in determining the excess interest alloca- tion amount under section FH 5 is to identify the amount of interest for the foreign attributed income group that is deductible under section DD 1(b), less any interest paid on loans between members of the group. In the example, this is calculated as follows: Interest expense allowable to NZ Co 1 under section DD 1(b).....................................200,000 Interest expense allowable to NZ Co 2 under section DD 1(b).....................................150,000 Less: interest paid on intra-group loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1.............................( 80,000 ) Total relevant interest expense.........................270,000 This amount is then inserted into the formula in section FH 5 to determine a group excess interest allocation amount of: 270,000 x (80% – 72.2%) = $26,345\* 80% \* 72.2% is a rounded number. The calculation has been made using the actual percentage, which is calculated as $1,900,000 ÷ $2,631,800. from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 27 Local authority trading enterprises Sections CB 4, OB 1 Introduction The amendment has removed the charitable and district improvement income tax exemptions for local authority trading enterprises (LATEs) and local authority income derived from LATEs. Background The Act provides that income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes, or derived from a business carried on by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand is exempt from tax. Charitable purpose is defined to include “the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. The commercial activities carried by most, if not all, LATEs could probably be considered beneficial to the community, so qualifying them for an income tax exemption. It is also likely that the commercial activities of LATEs would also qualify for the district improve- ment income tax exemption. This exemption is provided for societies or associations established substantially or primarily for the purpose of developing any city, borough or district, so as to attract trade, tourists or population, or to develop amenities for the general public. These exemptions may also extend to certain income derived by local authorities. Income derived by local authorities is, generally speaking, exempt from income tax. However, this exemption does not include income derived from LATEs. In 1989 the Government enacted legislation to ensure that LATEs and income derived by local authorities from LATEs were taxable. This was to ensure as much competitive neutrality with the private sector as possible. The ability of local authorities and LATEs to obtain a charitable or district improvement income tax exemption is clearly inconsistent with the policy intent of the 1989 legislation. Key features Section CB 4 has been amended to ensure that charitable income tax exemptions under subsections CB 4(1)(c) and (e) and the district improvement income tax exemp- tion under subsection CB 4(1)(j) do not apply to LATEs and local authority income derived from LATEs. Application date The amendment applies from the 1999/00 income year. Terminal tax date Sections MC 1, MC 2, NC 17, OB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 3, 37(4A) Tax Administration Act 1994 Charitable organisations - addition Section KC 5(1) The New Zealand Viet Nam Health Trust has been granted charitable donee status. From the 1998/99 income year, donations made to the Trust will entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) will be entitled to a deduction from net income up to the amount prescribed by section DJ 4. Introduction The terminal tax date for taxpayers with a tax agent has been extended by two months. The new terminal tax date for taxpayers with a March to September balance date moves from 7 February to 7 April if they have an agent. The change is intended to reduce exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest and reduce compliance costs. The terminal tax date for taxpayers without an agent is not changed. For a standard or late balance date tax- payer, the terminal tax payment date remains 7 February. The change in the terminal tax date will also apply to ACC premiums paid by self-employed taxpayers. Background At present, about 270,000 taxpayers have to consider making a terminal tax payment on 7 February, although their return of income and the calculation of the tax payable is not due until 31 March. Taxpayers and their agents incur substantial compliance costs in preparing an income estimate to determine the amount of terminal tax that should be paid on 7 Febru- ary. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 28 made in accordance with section NC 17(1) is due as follows: •on 7 February; •on 7 April, if the taxpayer’s return of income to which the assessment relates was linked to a tax agent; or •on an earlier date specified in the notice of assessment. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended by adding the definition of the term “tax agent”. A tax agent is a person who prepares the annual returns for ten or more taxpayers and who: •carries on a professional public practice; or •carries on a business in which annual returns are prepared; or •is the Maori Trustee. Section OB 1 has also been amended to include the term “linked to a tax agent”. This term which is used in sections MC 1, MC 2 and NC 17 is required to ensure that the proposed deferral of the terminal tax date applies to returns filed by agents or prepared by agents. Section 37(4) of the Tax Administration Act has been redrafted to reflect the definition of the term “tax agent”. An amendment is also made to clarify that the return being to referred to in the section is not the tax agent’s return. A new section 37(4A) has been inserted to provide that the Commissioner may refuse to extend a tax agent’s time for filing a particular return or cancel an existing extension if the taxpayer has furnished a required return of income for a prior income year. Application date The amendment applies to the 1997/98 income and subsequent years except in the case of the provisions specified. Provisional tax uplift factors Section MB 2 Introduction The amendment adjusts the provisional tax uplift factors to take into account the tax rate reductions for natural persons. With the tax rate reductions applying from 1 July 1998, the use of last year’s tax liability to deter- mine the amount of provisional tax payable this year would lead to natural persons overpaying their provi- sional tax if no adjustment were made. Background The provisional tax regime provides that taxpayers with significant income not subject to sufficient withholding tax must pay their tax in three instalments during the year on the basis of a prior year’s tax liability plus an uplift factor or on the basis of an estimate of their tax liability. With the tax rate reductions from 1 July 1998, using last year’s tax liability to determine the amount of provi- sional tax payable this year would lead to natural persons overpaying their provisional tax. If no adjust- ment were made to the last year’s payment basis, taxpayers would either overpay their tax or estimate their tax liability. To limit the number of cases in which this occurs an adjustment has been made to the provisional tax uplift factors to take into account the tax rate reduc- tions for natural persons. Zealand has estimated the compliance cost associated with the current practice at $22 million. The amendments deal with these compliance cost concerns by extending the terminal tax payment date for taxpayers whose tax return is prepared by a tax agent. Key features Section MC 1(2) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax of a provisional taxpayer is due and payable on the month specified in column E of Schedule 13 if the taxpayer has a tax agent, and on the month specified in column D of that schedule in any other case. This amendment applies solely to the 1997/98 income year. Section MC 1(2) applies from the 1998/99 income year. A new subsection MC 1(4) is inserted to ensure that provision provides the required extension for returns prepared by agents. This subsection applies from the 1998/99 income year. Schedule 13 has been amended by inserting a new column E which sets out the month for payment of terminal tax when a taxpayer has an agent. Section MC 2(1) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax date of a non-resident company which does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand is 7 April if the company has a tax agent. Section MC 2(2) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax of any person is due on the month specified in column E of Schedule 13 if the person has a tax agent, and on the month specified in column D of that schedule in any other case. This amendment applies to the 1997/98 income year with the section inserted applying for 1998/99 and subsequent income years. Section MC 2(3) is inserted to ensure that provision applies correctly. Section NC 17(2) has been amended to provide that the income tax payable by an employee under an assessment from page 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 29 Taxing extra employment income and secondary income Sections NC 2, NC 8(1A) Key features Section MB 2 has been amended so that: •When a natural person’s taxable income for the immediately preceding income year does not exceed $75,000, and the previous year’s tax return has been filed, the person’s provisional tax liability for the current year is 100% of last year’s residual income tax. •When a natural person’s taxable income for the income year before the immediately preceding income year does not exceed $75,000, and the previous year’s tax return has not been filed, the person’s provisional tax liability for the current year is 105% of the residual income tax for the income year before the immediately preceding income year. These adjustments do not apply to taxpayers who estimate their provisional tax liability or for whom the Commissioner determines liability. Application date The amendment applies to provisional tax instalments for the 1998/99 income year due on or after 7 July 1998. Introduction Before these amendments were made, the PAYE regime systematically under-deducted tax from the earnings of those taxpayers paying income tax at the top marginal tax rate of 33%. A number of amendments have being made to increase the PAYE scheme’s flexibility and to reduce the likelihood of under-deduction. These measures are consistent with the Government’s overall objective of simplifying the tax system and they support further reductions in filing tax returns. Background The PAYE system provided that both extra employment income and secondary employment earnings were subject to a withholding tax rate of 24% (which reduces to 21% from 1 July 1998) unless an employee applied for a special tax code. Depending on an employee’s annual income, he or she may have faced an annual tax debit because too little tax has been withheld from that extra employment income or secondary employment income. These measures have been introduced to avoid such debits arising, thereby improving the accuracy of the PAYE system. The changes also prevent employees with significant extra emoluments or secondary employ- ment income being forced into the provisional tax system if their residual income tax exceeds $2,500. Key features Section NC 2(4) provides that employers will be re- quired to apply a 33% withholding rate to extra employ- ment income if the combined total of the extra income and the annualised value of the source deduction pay- ments paid to the employee by the employer in the last four weeks exceed $38,000. The provision applies only to the annualised value of the last four weeks paid to that employee by that employer. No payments by other employers or from other income sources are required to be included in the calculation. Examples Example 1: Employee paid weekly An employee receives the following salary and extra emolument payments: Pay dayWageExtra emolument 30 September 1998$1,000 $0 7 October 1998$1,000 $0 14 October 1998$1,000 $0 21 October 1998$1,000$4,000 The total value of the source deduction payments paid to the employee in the last four weeks is $4,000. These payments represent an annual salary of $52,000 ($4,000 x 52 weeks ÷ 4 weeks). Adding the extra emolument of $4,000 provides an esti- mated annual salary of $56,000. As this expected salary exceeds $38,000 the employer is required to withhold at 33% from the $4,000 extra emolument payment. Example 2: Employee paid monthly An employee receives monthly payments compris- ing the following salary and extra emolument payments: Pay daySalaryExtra emolument 30 September 1998$4,000$1,000 The total value of the source deduction payments paid to the employee in the four weeks includes the payment of salary for September. This payment represents an annual salary of $48,000 ($4,000 x 12 months ÷ 1 month). Adding the extra emolument of $1,000 provides an estimated annual salary of $49,000. As this expected salary exceeds $38,000 the employer is required to withhold at 33% from the $4,000 extra emolument payment. A new paragraph NC 8(1A) has been inserted. This allows employees, via a tax code declaration, to elect continued on page 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 30 NC 8(1A) applies. Similarly the schedule has been amended by inserting a new clause 5A which provides that 33% is the withholding tax rate for secondary employment earnings if an employee has elected the “SH” tax code. Application date The amendments apply to tax deductions from payments of salary or wages or extra employment income for pay periods ending on or after 1 July 1998. Creating forestry right for oneself Section OB 1 Introduction The Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that land owners do not incur a tax liability when they create forestry rights for themselves. Background A new section 2A has been inserted in the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 to allow land owners to create a forestry right for themselves. This amendment is contained the Statutes Amendment Bill (No.2), which at the time this TIB went to print was still before Parlia- ment. A supporting amendment to the Income Tax Act was required to ensure that land owners do not incur a tax liability when they create a forestry right for them- selves. The amendment solves a problem faced by many small forestry owners who want to sell their land but retain ownership of their trees. Key features Subparagraph (c)(i) of the section OB 1 definition of “sale or other disposition” has been amended to exclude a forestry right created for oneself. This amendment means that creating a forestry right does not result in a tax liability under section CJ 1. Application date The amendment applies from the 1997/98 and subse- quent income years but will not take effect until the Statutes Amendment Bill (No.2) has been passed. Overpayments arising under the student loan scheme Section 56, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction An amendment has been made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to allow the Commissioner to offset an annual student loan overpayment against a borrower’s student loan balance, if the borrower has not indicated to Inland Revenue that he or she wishes the overpayment to be refunded. Borrowers are given six months from the date of the notice of assessment to apply for the whole, or part, of the overpayment to be refunded. Background Previously, if borrowers had paid more than their minimum repayment obligation for an income year, and they did not indicate to Inland Revenue that they wished the overpayment to be credited against their loan balance, the overpayment was refunded. A significant number of borrowers in this situation received refunds of payments that were intended to reduce their loan bal- ance. Key features Section 56 has been amended to provide that if a bor- rower has not indicated how an overpayment is to be applied, it will be offset against his or her loan balance. Borrowers are given six months from the date of their notice of assessment to apply for the whole, or part, of the overpayment to be refunded. Application date The amendment applies to overpayments arising on or after 1 April 1998. that a 33% deduction rate applies to any extra emolu- ment payments. Employees with more than one employer are able to request that a 33% withholding rate apply to secondary employment. This is done by way of electing a “SH” code which has been inserted as a paragraph (da) in subsection NC 8(1). Clause 8 of Schedule 19 has been amended to provide that 33% is the withholding tax rate for extra employ- ment income when either new sections NC 2(5) or from page 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 31 National standard cost values and national average market values for specified livestock Sections EL 3A, El 4, EL 8 Introduction This amendment provides that the national standard cost values and the national average market values for specified livestock should be set by the Commissioner rather than by Order in Council The current release dates for these values cause undue pressure on both taxpayers and their agents in calculating tax payments. The new process will allow the values to be released approxi- mately two weeks earlier than is currently the case. Background Section EL 4 provides for the Governor-General to declare, by Order in Council, the national standard costs for each category of specified livestock. Section EL 8 provides that the Governor-General may also, by Order in Council, declare a national average market value in relation to a class of specified livestock. When the regime was introduced, the process of setting the values was seen as a potentially significant issue. However, the process has become routine, and is, in principle, no different from the way the Commissioner determines depreciation rates. Given this and the fact that the delays involved in the current process are imposing a significant compliance Return filing requirements Section 33A Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 removes the requirement for student loan borrowers to file a tax return for an income year if their loan has been fully repaid during that income year. Background Student loan borrowers are required to file an annual tax return to establish their repayment obligation and any entitlement to a base interest write-off. If a borrower repays his or her loan during an income year, the only reason for requiring a return is to calculate any entitle- ment to a base interest write-off. The vast majority of borrowers do not receive a base interest write-off in the final year of repayment. Requiring a return in the final year of repayment imposes unnecessary compliance costs on borrowers who are not otherwise required to file a tax return. Key features An amendment to section 33A removes the requirement for student loan borrowers, who are not otherwise required to file a tax return, to file a tax return for an income year if their loan is fully repaid during that income year. Borrowers entitled to a base interest write-off will still receive it, but only if they file a tax return. The IR 5 and IR 3 tax guides will contain a statement on the possibil- ity of a base interest write-off and Inland Revenue will advise borrowers of this by letter when the loan is repaid. Application date The amendment applies from the 1998/99 income year. Cancellation of interest on student loan repayments Section 60A, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction The amendment has added a new section 60A to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. The amendment provides for interest that has accrued subsequent to a borrower being notified of the amount of the student loan balance outstanding to be cancelled when the loan, and any interest that has accrued to the date of the notification, is paid in full within 15 days of the notifica- tion. Background Borrowers who fully repay their student loan during an income year may accrue small amounts of interest between the date they are notified by Inland Revenue of the total amount outstanding and the date on which they pay that amount. This often necessitates a further small payment. Key features If Inland Revenue notifies a borrower of the amount of his or her student loan, including any accrued interest, and the borrower pays this in full within 15 days, any interest accruing after the date of notification will be cancelled. Application date The amendment applies to notifications issued on or after 1 June 1998. continued on page 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 32 Commissioner may determine (as is currently the case) the methods by which livestock are to be valued under the national standard cost scheme. Section EL 8 has been amended to provide that Commis- sioner may declare those values. A requirement that the Commissioner gazette those values has also been introduced. Application date The application date of these measures is date of enact- ment. The effect of this is that the national average market values for the 1997/98 income year will be set by Commissioner’s determination. Minor remedial issues Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: remedial amendments resulting from the Customs and Excise Act 1996 Reference amendments Sections 1(2) and 2(1) The reference to section 13 in subsection 1(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been removed. Section 13 was repealed by the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The reference in section 2(1), definition of “input tax” to the Customs Act 1966 is replaced with a reference to the Customs and Excise Act 1996. These amendments bring the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in line with the changes resulting from the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The amendments are deemed to apply from 1 October 1996, the application date of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. “Directly in connection with” Section 11(2)(ca) The amendment restores the phrase “directly in connec- tion with” in section 11(2)(ca) after the Customs and Excise Act 1996 replaced it with the phrase “in relation to”. The amendment will apply from 1 October 1996 (the application date of the Customs and Excise Act 1996). However, if registered persons have furnished returns before 18 November 1997, which pertain to taxable periods ending between 30 September 1996 and 18 No- vember 1997, and have relied on the phrase “in relation to”, the amendment applies from 18 November 1997. Introduction A number of minor drafting amendments have been made to the newly enacted provisional tax regime and the compliance and penalty regime. Background These measures are minor drafting corrections or clarifications. Key features The definition of “instalment date” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 refers to all instalments being due on the 7th of the month, when instalments in January are due on the 15th of the month. The definition has been amended to include a reference to the 15th of the month, if the month is January. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “first business day” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act has been amended by replacing the words “ceased to derive” with “derived”. Section 183H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that taxpayers may request remission of liabilities in writing. The section has been amended to make clear that the provision applies to sections 183A and 183D of the Tax Administration Act. Application date The application date for the first two minor amendments is 1 October 1997 while the application date for the amendment to section 183H is the date of enactment. costs on some taxpayers and their advisors, the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to allow the Commis- sioner to determine the values. No change in consultation will occur with this proposal. In practice, more time may actually be made available for consultation, given the simpler process for promul- gating the values themselves. Key features The existing section EL 4 has been split into a new section EL 3A (the Commissioner may issue a determi- nation as to the national standard costs of livestock) and an amended section EL 4 which provides that the from page 31 Credit card transaction duty repealed A supplementary Order paper to the bill amended the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, to repeal credit card transaction duty from 1 April 1998. It confirms that EFT-POS transactions and certain ATM withdrawals are not subject to the duty, and never have been. These amendments will bwe described in more detail in the May Tax Information Bulletin. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 33 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Foreign currency amounts – conversion to NZ currency The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 1998. In the past we’ve published these rates in an annual IR 270G form. However, we now publish them six-monthly in the Tax Information Bulletin instead. The final IR 270G form was to 31 March 1997. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign cur- rency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equiva- lent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key x y xis the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. yis the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 1997. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.1426 = NZ$38,890.83 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 December 1997. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 20.6183 = NZ$16,975.21 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1997 and has a balance date of 30 Novem- ber 1997. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-November 1997: (0.9963 + 0.9824 + 0.9586 + 0.9717 + 0.9563 + 0.9927 + 0.9834) ÷ 7 = 0.9773 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9773 = NZ$511,613.63 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 1998. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 31 December 1997 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 31 December 1997 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 26.7376 = NZ$18,700.26 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible. continued on page 34-35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 34 Table A: Mid-month and 12 month

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 42 Woven reflective mulch Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is currently no general depreciation rate for woven reflective mulch used in the agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture industries. The mulch is a fabric which is placed under trees or vines to reflect solar radiation that would otherwise be absorbed into the ground. This increases the amount of light and heat available to those trees or vines, increasing crop production. Two types of the fabric are available: white woven film and aluminised woven plastic film. There is no need to differentiate between them for depreciation purposes. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination, applicable from the 1997/98 income year, which will insert a new asset class into the “Agri- culture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry cat- egory. The determination, reproduced below in draft form, will set a depreciation rate of 50% DV for this asset and is based on an estimated useful life of 3 years and a residual value of 13.5%.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 43 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. “Forestry”: whether or not it is included in the section CD 1(7) definition of “farming or agricultural business” Summary This item states the Commissioner’s view on whether “forestry” falls within the definition of “farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under this interpretation, the Commis- sioner accepts that “forestry” does fall within the above definition. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background The Commissioner’s previous policy, dated January 1993, sets out the activities Inland Revenue considers are carried on for agricultural or farming purposes. It specifically did not include the growing of trees for the production of timber in the definition of agriculture and farming. The following specified activities were considered to be carried on for farming and agricultural purposes: beekeeping, animal husbandry, dairy farming, grain and seed growing, market gardening, fruit growing, poultry farming, sharemilking, tobacco growing, and vegetable growing. The following activities specifically did not qualify: dealing in livestock, leasing or bailing livestock by the bailor, aerial topdressing, growing trees for the produc- tion of timber, and providing services to persons carry- ing on a farming or agricultural business, e.g. services provided by agricultural contractors and seed cleaners. Legislation Section CD 1(2) includes in a taxpayer’s gross income, any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in some seven categorised circumstances. Section CD 1(7) excludes from the gross income of a taxpayer any amount derived from the sale or disposition of land resulting from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, “or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business”. The following requirements must all be satisfied before the exemption applies: •The land sold must have resulted from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before the division was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, or both, primarily or principally for the purpose of a farming or agricultural business that the relevant persons carried on. •The Commissioner must be satisfied that the land sold is of such an area and nature that it is presently capable of being worked as an economic unit in a farming or agricultural business. •The Commissioner must be satisfied, having regard to the circumstances in which the land was disposed of, that the land was disposed of primarily and principally for the purpose of it being utilised in a farming or agricultural business. Application The question of whether forestry is included in the expression “farming or agricultural business” has been considered by the courts in relation to other sections of the Act that use similar wording, but not directly in relation to section CD 1(7). Earlier cases tended towards the view that forestry was not included in the definition of “farming and agricul- ture”. In Gilchrist v Lanarkshire Assessors (1895) 35 Sc LR 663, the Court had to consider whether a greenhouse used for growing tomatoes was an erection or a structural improvement made or required for agricultural purposes. Lord Stormouth Darling said at page 665: Now that question must be solved by considering the meaning of the phrase in its ordinary acceptation. The appellant considers that a market garden is an agricultural subject because it effects the culture of the ground. No doubt it does but there are three main methods of utilising the soil, which are expressed by the terms agriculture, horticulture and forestry. These three things are distinguishable, and any one of them is not to be held as including any other without special provision to that effect. continued on page 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 44 Richardson J concluded that: Sufficient has been said to show that in New Zealand usage agricultural and farming may include forestry. But in determin- ing the intended scope of the expression “farming or agricul- tural business on land in New Zealand” and so in deciding the intended reach of ss 126 and 127 it is necessary to consider the context ... In our view it is a necessary implication from ss 126 and 127 considered in their statutory setting that they did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry. Richardson J considered by way of necessary implica- tion that sections 126 and 127 when they were consid- ered in their statutory setting did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry, because Parliament subsequently legislated specifically (in section 127A) to provide a similar deductibility regime for any taxpayer who carried on any forestry business. In doing so it allowed for the same range of expenses and followed the model of sections 126 and 127, which would, of course, have been unnecessary had those two provisions already applied to forestry. This did not, however, detract from his initial conclusion that the phrase “farming or agricul- ture” might include forestry on an ordinary meaning of the words. Whilst not all dictionaries give a consistent indication, several other dictionary meanings also indicate that farming and agriculture include forestry: Webster’s International Dictionary, Second Edition, gives a wide meaning to the word “agriculture”: The art or science of cultivating the ground, and raising and harvesting crops, often including also feeding, breeding, and management of livestock; tillage, husbandry; farming; in a broader sense, the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man, including to a variable extent the preparation of these products for man’s use and their disposal by marketing or otherwise. In this broad use it includes farming, horticulture, forestry, dairying, sugar making, etc. Funk and Wagnall’s New Standard Dictionary gives this definition of “agriculture”: 1. The cultivation of the soil for food-products or any other useful or valuable growths of the field or garden; tillage; husbandry; also by extension, farming, including any industry practised by a cultivator of the soil in connection with such cultivation, as forestry, fruit-raising, breeding and rearing of stock, dairying, market-gardening, etc. There is also overseas authority to support the approach that the phrase “farming or agriculture” includes for- estry. In Canada, forestry is considered to be a farming activity. “Farming” is defined in section 248 of the Canadian Income Tax Act 1994 to include the various activities of a person who is engaged in the business of earning income from the tillage of soil, the raising or exhibiting of livestock, the maintenance of horses for racing or exhibiting, the raising of poultry, the keeping of bees, fur farming, dairy farming, and fruit growing. The definition is not exhaustive and it has been decided by the courts that farming also includes tree farming: Her Majesty the Queen v Douglas C Matthews 74 DTC 6193, \[1974\] CTC 230 (FCTD). In Horniblow v Napier \[1985\] NZLR 105, the question was whether an orcharidist was a farmer for the purposes of the Transport Act 1949. Barrowclough CJ referred to the Gilchrist case and said at page 105: It might be very unsafe to accept as applicable to this country’s special type of husbandry (I deliberately use a new and comprehensive word), a classification that was applicable in Scotland over fifty years ago. But it appears to me that that classification is adaptable to New Zealand conditions, and is a classification which is commonly accepted here. Agriculture is essentially the business of the farmer. That is recognised in the interpretation clause of the Transport Act 1949, where the phrase ‘agriculture purpose’ is defined ‘as a purpose concerned directly with the management of a farm’. I would conclude that a farmer is one engaged in the first of the three methods of utilizing the soil referred to by Lord Stormonth Darling, and consequently that a person engaged in either of the two other methods is not a farmer. The viticulturist is in the second group comprising those who utilize the soil of a garden; and so also, is the fruitgrower or an orchardist. They are not properly referred to as farmers. The silviculturist is in the third group; and he too, is not properly referred to as a farmer. In 1994, in the Court of Appeal decision of Hill v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,037, Richardson J concluded that agriculture and farming might include forestry. The Court of Appeal considered whether forestry was included within the expression “farming or agricultural business” in terms of section 126 and 127 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In this case, Richardson J who delivered the judgment of the Court stated at page 11,046: “Farming” and “agricultural” are broad flexible words and the use of both expressions in the phrase on its face suggests that a broad approach casting a wide net was intended. But the particular meaning to be accorded to the words depends on the context in which they are used. In order to determine the intended application of the phrase in ss 126 and 127 it is also necessary to set the sections in context in the Income Tax Act as a whole. After briefly considering the earlier cases, Richardson J stated at page 11,047: Horniblow v Napier and Hill v Rothwell were decided 40 years ago and Gilchrist is even more remote in time. But the classification in Gilchrist and the approach in Re Walker and Township of Uxbridge perhaps indicate that variable meanings and shades of meaning may attach to such expressions. At the same time it is apparent from any reference to standard dictionaries that in their ordinary sense the words have wide meanings. Thus the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definitions are indicative of the potential breadth of the expression. Agriculture is defined as “the science and art of cultivating the soil; including the gathering in of the crops and the rearing of livestock; farming (in the widest sense)”. Farming is “the business of cultivating land, raising stock etc” and a farm is “a tract of land held ... for the purpose of cultivation; sometimes specialised as dairy-, grass-, poultry- farm. Also a tract of water used as a preserve, e.g., fish, oyster, etc.” Interestingly forestry is defined as “the science and art of forming and cultivating forests, management of growing timber”. Closer to home the two Australian dictionaries , The Macquarie Dictionary and Tasman Dictionary, both define agriculture as “the cultivation of land, including crop-raising, forestry, stock raising, etc; farming. from page 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 45 Revenue Canada’s Interpretation Bulletin IT–373R March 14 1985 relating to farm woodlots and tree farms states that proceeds from the sale of logs, lumber, poles or Christmas trees are income from farming. It also states that a taxpayer who is not otherwise engaged in a lumbering or logging business and who undertakes the reforestation of an area of land with the objective of producing mature trees at a date that may be 40 or 50 years in the future, or even longer, is considered to be farming. Possible alternative interpretations Certain provisions in the Income Tax Act indicate that (for those provisions at least) Parliament had clearly intended “farming and agriculture” to not include forestry by having explicit separate treatments. The decision in Hill illustrates one such example, and others include the Income Equalisation provisions in sub-part EI of the Act, and sections DZ 2 and DZ 3. It could certainly be argued that this indicates it was Parliament’s intention or understanding that forestry was not included in the phrase “farming and agriculture”. Whilst such an argument does have some merit, it is considered that the better approach is that expressed by Richardson J in Hill, that forestry does generally come within the phrase, unless the context of a particular provision indicates otherwise. Accordingly, each provision needs to be examined separately, and whilst some (such as those discussed above) will result in a conclusion that forestry is not included, section CD 1 has no such contextual reasons to overturn the general proposition that forestry is included. It might also be suggested that the use of the word “worked” in section CD 1(7) can be seen as suggesting a greater level of day to day activity than might be in- volved in small to medium scale forestry operations. However, the word “worked” is capable of a wide meaning ranging from the application of mental or physical effort for a purpose to cultivating land. The ordinary meaning of the word “worked” tends to suggest that there must be some form of physical activity, but does not necessarily require any particular activity level. Many activities that are clearly regarded as a “farming or agricultural business” do not demand day to day physi- cal work on the part of the proprietor. The existing case law in New Zealand simply analyses as a whole the meaning of the phrase “worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7). It does not look at the meaning of each word in the phrase in isolation. Conclusion The words “farming or agriculture” in their ordinary usage may include forestry. The wording and context of section CD 1(7) do not prevent this interpretation. The New Zealand Court of Appeal case of Hill supports the interpretation that agriculture and farming may include forestry. Several dictionary meanings of these words indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry. Case law and a revenue interpretation bulletin in Canada also indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry The phrase “farming and agriculture” has a wider meaning now than it did many years ago as technology has advanced, and agricultural practices have changed over time. In New Zealand and in the previously men- tioned overseas jurisdictions, the ordinary meaning of “farming and agriculture” may include forestry. In determining whether forestry is included in any phrase of the Income Tax Act, the context of the section must be examined. For the purposes of section CD 1(7), forestry is included in the phrase “agriculture and farming”. There is nothing in the context of section CD 1(7) to indicate that forestry is not included. Note that any claim for exemption under section CD 1(7) in respect of a forestry activity must not only satisfy paragraphs (a) and (c) (“farming or agricultural business”), but the land under consideration must also be “capable of being worked as an economic unit” as required by paragraph (b) of section CD 1(7). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 46 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Tax payments – when received in time Standard Practice Statement PRC-100 Recently there has been considerable comment about the received in time rules for tax payments. This statement sets out the administrative rules which the Commissioner applies to tax payments when those various revenues are due. We prefer customers to pay their tax by posting their cheque – it will be accepted as being received in time if it is mailed and postmarked on the due date. Alternatively, payment may be made by cheque, EFT- POS or cash at any Inland Revenue Office – and will be accepted as being received in time if it is physically handed in to an Inland Revenue Office by the close of business hours on the due date – in most cases this is 4.30 pm. These administrative rules apply to all tax types, includ- ing GST. If a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, the payment will be accepted as being in time if posted or handed in on the next business day. Note that this does not apply to GST payments because GST is due on the last working day of the relevant month. There is one exception to that GST rule, and that is when the GST payment, which would normally be due on the last working day of December, is actually due on 15 January. If 15 January falls on a weekend then the payment will be accepted as being in time if posted or handed in to an Inland Revenue Office on the next business day. Applications to keep records in Maori Standard Practice Statement INV-470 Introduction This standard practice statement advises that the Com- missioner will generally approve applications to keep records in Maori, provided that: •The taxpayer complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GST Act”); and •Numbers are recorded using Arabic numerals. In order to accommodate the needs of third parties, Arabic numerals (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) are to be used to record numbers. This policy applies from 1 May 1998. Background Sections 75 of the GST Act, and 22, 26, and 32 of the Tax Administration Act (“TAA”), require taxpayers to keep and retain sufficient records in the English lan- guage to enable ready ascertainment by the Commis- sioner or his delegates, of their liability to tax. However, each of these sections provides discretion to the Com- missioner who may, following a written application, allow records to be kept in an alternative language. The legislative policy reason for the requirement to keep records in English is administrative convenience. It allows the Commissioner to readily ascertain a taxpay- er’s liability. However, a claim lodged with the Waitangi Tribunal under the Treaty of Waitangi Act prompted Inland Revenue to review its policy for exercising the discretion related to keeping records in a language other than English. When considering a request from a taxpayer to keep records in Maori, Inland Revenue recognises that Maori is an official language of New Zealand. We also recog- nise that the choice of language for business dealings is not a matter for the Commissioner to determine. It is reasonable for persons whose business dealings are conducted in Maori to expect that Inland Revenue will be able to accommodate their language preference. However, the revenue law obligations of third parties must also be considered. When base records such as invoices and receipts are maintained in Maori there may be some inconvenience to other persons. GST tax invoices and debit and credit notes raise a special problem. They are necessary for ascertaining the tax liability of the issuer and of a third party. They are, therefore, records covered by section 75(3) of the GST IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 47 Act (i.e., they must be maintained in English unless the Commissioner gives permission to use another lan- guage). There are also explicit requirements for specific English phrases to be used in these documents. These phrases are: •“tax invoice” (s.24 & 25, GST Act) •“copy only” – on copy of lost tax invoice, credit or debit note (s.25, GST Act) •“buyer created tax invoice – IRD approved” (s.24, GST Act) •“modified tax invoice – IRD approved” (s.24, GST Act) •“credit note” or “debit note” – on credit or debit notes (s.25, GST Act) There is no discretion to allow the use of expressions in Maori (or any other language) to satisfy the require- ments imposed in sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act (which state that specific words must be used). The decision by the Commissioner and his delegates to allow the keeping of records in Maori, is the exercise of an administrative discretion provided by the Revenue Acts having regard to the form of tax invoices and taxpayer obligations as prescribed by legislation. Policy Applications When any person applies in writing to keep records (e.g., invoices, receipts, cash books, and journals) for tax purposes in Maori, permission will usually be granted, provided all numbers are recorded using Arabic numer- als. The application need not be in English, but must specify which records the taxpayer wishes to keep in Maori. An application form in both English and Maori is available from Inland Revenue offices for use by persons wishing to take advantage of this policy. The use of these forms will simplify applications and assist IRD to readily identify requests and provide a more timely response. A person may seek approval to keep only some records in Maori. In addition, where approval to keep certain records in Maori has been obtained, there is nothing to stop a person continuing to keep all or some of those records in English. This would extend to having an individual document completed partly in Maori and partly in English. Approval process The Commissioner has delegated his authority to approve applications to officer level. Authority to decline applications is confined to Team Leaders, Senior Investigators or Managers. Refusals will only be on the basis that those legislative requirements under the GST Act and TAA and the use of Arabic numerals are not satisfied. The letter giving consent will advise: •That the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act in respect of the provision or creation of tax invoices and the issuing of debit and credit notes. •That numbers must be recorded using Arabic numer- als. •The date from which those records can be kept in Maori (generally the date of the letter of approval). •The approval is not a relaxation in the standard of record keeping \[the requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose\]. •The approval does not mean IRD will communicate with taxpayers in Maori. Further conditions If permission is given to keep records in Maori, there is no relaxation in the standard of record keeping. The requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose. The law is silent on the question of the language to be used in completing any returns that a person may be required to provide to the Commissioner. The Commis- sioner will accept returns in the prescribed format, completed in the Maori language with numbers entered using Arabic numerals. Impact on third parties When base records such as invoices and receipts which have been completed in Maori are used by third parties to ascertain their tax liability, that third party need not also apply for permission to use records kept in Maori. The balance of commercial convenience between buyers and sellers will determine what language is used in any particular case. Over time, the usual Maori expressions will become known within the community. Interpreta- tion will, therefore, become less difficult. Policy application date This policy applies from 1 May 1998. It will apply to records coming into existence following approval of an application lodged with the Commissioner on or after that date. Contact Should you have questions about this policy, please contact the Maori Community Officer at your nearest Inland Revenue Service Centre or Branch Office. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy see next page for examples IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 48 Examples The following examples do not form part of the policy but are provided to indicate its general effect. Example 1 A New Zealand resident GST registered person, who is fluent in English, operates a shop in Whangarei. The person is also fluent in Maori and has asked for approval to keep certain GST business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the registered person uses Arabic numer- als and complies with the requirements of sec- tions 24 and 25 of the GST Act. Example 2 A New Zealand resident taxpayer, who regards English as their second language and has limited bookkeeping skills, operates a farm on the East Coast. The taxpayer is fluent in Maori and has asked for approval to keep all their business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that they use Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 of the TAA. As in any other case, the taxpayer’s records must be sufficient to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the taxpayer’s tax liabilities. Example 3 A large Maori incorporation is staffed by persons whose fluency in Maori and in English differs. For cultural and policy reasons the incorporation wishes to maintain its records in Maori to the greatest extent possible within the law. The taxpayer has asked for approval to keep all of its business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 (where applicable) of the TAA. Example 4 A New Zealand resident private company runs a business teaching Te Reo Maori. The company seeks approval to issue GST tax invoices printed and completed entirely in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and section 22 of the TAA. Example 5 A New Zealand resident GST registered person receives a tax invoice completed in Maori. The person, who does not speak or understand Maori, contacts her local Inland Revenue office and asks the office to intervene and require the issuer of the invoice to replace it with one completed in English. Provided the invoice has been completed in accord- ance with the requirement of section 24 of the GST Act and numbers are entered using Arabic numerals, the person would be advised that the document complies with our record keeping requirements in its present form. Any dispute over the language used in completing the invoice is a matter to be settled between the recipient of the invoice and the issuer. Example 6 A New Zealand resident taxpayer makes a claim in their annual income tax return for the housekeeper rebate. This is in respect of payments made to a caregiver that cared for the taxpayer’s child to enable the taxpayer to work. Upon being requested to supply a receipt to substantiate the housekeeper rebate claimed, the taxpayer supplies a receipt completed entirely in Maori, including the numbers for the amount paid written using Maori words. The receipt would not be accepted as a satisfactory record to support the rebate claim because numbers for the amounts paid have not been entered using Arabic numerals. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 49 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Investment portfolio fees – deductibility Section BD 2 – Allowable deductions: A taxpayer has asked if Case T42 (1988) 18 NZTC 8,285 is inconsistent with the Commissioner’s treatment of financial planning fee expenditure as set out in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A (TIB Vol- ume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) at page 18). In summary, that Public Ruling states that: •Regard must be had to the difference between fees paid for planning an investment, implementing the purchase of that investment, and subsequently monitoring it. •“Passive” investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advisors for planning or implementation services, as they are considered to be capital in nature (although the qualified accruals rules may include some implementation fees in the base price adjustment calculation on the maturity of any financial arrangements purchased). •“Passive” investors can deduct fees paid for the monitoring of existing invest- ments, although section EF 1 may require the unexpired portion of such expenditure to be added to the taxpayer’s gross income in any year. •Speculative investors, and persons in the business of investing, can deduct all planning, implementation and monitoring fees when incurred, subject to the applicability of the qualified accruals rules and section EF 1 as mentioned above, and the trading stock provisions of section EE 1. In Case T42, the taxpayers were a husband and wife who had a portfolio of investments that the husband had managed since 1986. In 1992, on receipt of a superannuation scheme lump sum, the taxpayers engaged a firm of investment advisors to manage their overall investments. The investment advisors charged a fee described as “portfolio establishment costs”, and the question was whether or not this fee was a deductible expense. Willy DJ observed that the parties were in agreement as to how the law applied. At page 8,286 he stated: There is no argument about the law. The Commissioner accepts that if the fees were properly incurred in the course of the maintenance and monitoring of an established portfolio of invest- ments then they are properly deductible. The objector accepts that if the fees are for the work involved in the establishment of a portfolio then they are non-deductible. His Honour went on to find on the facts that the taxpayers had an existing in- vestment portfolio, and the financial planning fees related to the monitoring of that investment portfolio, rather than any planning or implementation of a new one. Therefore, the expenditure was deductible under section BD 2. He stated at page 8,287: ...it is clear beyond any doubt that the payments in these cases were expended as part of a process by which the objectors earned their income from their investment portfolios. They would therefore be treated on the ordinary principles of commercial accounting as a debit to revenue not capital. continued on page 50 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 50 ...the objectors decided to recast their investments .... The plain fact is this objector had an estab- lished investment portfolio going back to 1986. The Commissioner has lodged an appeal, but for the purposes of this discussion it is important to note that the decision in Case T42 was a finding on the facts of that case. The application of the law is entirely consistent with Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A, and the Commissioner does not intend to review or withdraw the Public Ruling as a result of this recent case. Write-off of business assets Section EG 12 (section 108K, Income Tax Act 1976) - Depreciation of deprec- iable property that can no longer be used: A taxpayer who wishes to write off some business assets that are no longer used in his business has asked: •what details of the assets is he required to supply to Inland Revenue •what factors Inland Revenue takes into account when considering a write-off application. Under section EG 12(5), a taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for a deter- mination to deduct the remaining adjusted tax value of any depreciable property that can no longer be used. Adjusted tax value in relation to any depreciable property is defined as: bv (base value) – ad (aggregate deductions) We advised the taxpayer that he must complete the form “Application for a deduction for an asset you no longer use” (IR 260D) when making such a re- quest. All the following details must be provided: •asset details such as description, industry/asset category, asset class, depre- ciation rate, date of purchase, purchase price, remaining adjusted tax value •use of the asset by the business – the date when the asset stopped being used in the business, the reason why it is no longer used •disposal of the asset – the estimated cost of selling or disposing of it including the basis of the estimate, estimated gross proceeds from sale or disposal of the asset including the basis for this estimate •use of asset by any business – whether it is likely that the asset could be used in another business and if so, in what type of business and industry is it most likely to be used. In considering such an application, the Commissioner must be satisfied: •that the property is no longer used by the taxpayer, and neither the taxpayer nor a person associated with the taxpayer intends to use the asset in deriving gross income or in a business; and •that the costs of disposing of the property would exceed any consideration that could be derived from the disposition of the property. Only if the Commissioner is satisfied on these two points may the asset be writ- ten off. from page 49 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 51 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Property transfer: differentiation between fixtures and chattels – stamp duty Section 10 – Stamp duty payable: A taxpayer intends selling a commercial property and has asked for details of the stamp duty implications. She is aware that stamp duty is payable on the sale of the land and buildings, but is unsure of the position concerning items within the building: carpets, air-conditioning systems, a suspended ceiling, furniture (including built-in furniture), electric light fittings, partitions, a card access system, and refrigerators. Under section 10, duty is payable on: (a)Conveyances and leases of land; and... “Land” is defined in section 2 as: land within New Zealand, and includes – (a) Buildings, appurtenances, and improvements; and... An “appurtenance” to land includes a right of way or a similar right over some- one’s land. Examples of “improvements” to land are drainage, fencing, and the construction of buildings, while improvements to a building are additions to the building (other than mere repairs). Included in a building may be such items as lifts, sprinkler systems, ceilings, plumbing systems, carpets and vinyl flooring. Case law has established that when such items are an integral part of a building and are permanently affixed to the land or building, they lose their nature as chattels and become fixtures. As fixtures to the building they are part of the land and, therefore, are subject to inclusion in the value of land for assessing stamp duty. This is assuming that the owner of the building also owns the fixtures. Stamp duty is not levied upon chattels (i.e. moveable possessions) as such. Items generally termed “chattels”, including stoves, tables, chairs, electric heaters, and curtains, are not subject to stamp duty as they would not be fixed to the building. At times it can be difficult to differentiate between chattels and fixtures. How- ever, the courts have found that it is the degree and the object of annexation to the land that is important in making this decision. Case law has provided the following factors to be taken into account in deciding whether an object is a chattel or a fixture: •Whether the asset is a permanent improvement. If the asset is for the perma- nent and substantial improvement of the land or building as evidenced by the degree of annexation to the property, this fact would lean heavily towards the asset being a fixture. On the other hand, if the asset is merely resting by its own weight on the property, thereby indicating a temporary use or for its more complete enjoyment and use as a chattel, this could be a determining factor in finding it to be a chattel. In Feickert v Perpetual Trustees Estate and Agency Company of New Zealand Ltd (1989) 1 NZ Conv C 190, 244, the High Court, in finding that such items as partitions, carpets, and light fittings were fixtures, looked at whether they formed part of the fabric of the building. For example, the Court noted that whereas carpet at one time was considered as more of a luxury item in commercial buildings, it has now become common- place and is what a prospective tenant would expect to find. In Case S68 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,422, the Taxation Review Authority reached a similar conclusion in respect of items such as vinyl floor coverings, suspended ceilings, light fittings, a roller door, and handrails. continued on page 52 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 52 •The intention, as evidenced by the circumstances of each case, in bringing the asset on to the land. In approaching this issue, the courts have established it is the purpose for which the asset is used, as seen by the degree and object of annexation, which should be taken into account and not the subjective purpose of the person who placed it there. This factor is borne out in the Court of Appeal case Lockwood Buildings Ltd v Trustbank Canterbury Ltd \[1995\] 1 NZLR 22 where it was found that a show-home was a fixture and not a chattel. The Court followed rules set down in earlier cases in looking at the extent to which the show-home was fixed to the land. It looked like any ordinary house. This finding was not swayed by the possibility that an out- side observer, realising it was a show-home, might question its permanency on the site. Its status, to anyone viewing it, was evident from its outward appearance. In other words, these matters should be examined objectively and not subjectively. This point was emphasised in a recent House of Lords case, Elitestone Ltd v Morris \[1997\] 2 All ER 513 at 524; 1 WLR 687. •Whether the asset can be removed without causing damage to it, the build- ing, or the land. In the Feickert v Perpetual Trustees case, the High Court found that partitions and a bench unit were fixtures – one of the factors being that they would have been damaged if removed. No single factor should be considered alone in determining the issue of whether an item is a fixture or a chattel. Rather, all the factors are important in providing a picture of the degree and object of annexation of a particular item to the land, i.e. whether it is a chattel brought on to the land to continue as a chattel or whether it becomes a fixture. In applying these criteria to the taxpayer, the furniture (excluding built-in furni- ture) and refrigerators are chattels. They are therefore not subject to stamp duty. These assets were not fixed to the building in any way and could easily be re- moved. They could not be regarded as permanent improvements to the building. The remaining assets, i.e., carpets, air-conditioning system, suspended ceiling, built-in furniture, electric light fittings, partitions, and card access system are considered to be fixtures and are therefore part of the building. They exhibit a sufficient degree of permanence to be considered as fixtures because of their integration within, and annexation to, the building, and the fact they could only be removed with some difficulty. It is considered that an outside person coming in and viewing these assets would see that they were of sufficient permanence as to rightly be fixtures. The taxpayer was therefore advised that the items would attract a liability for stamp duty when the property was sold, as they were part of the land. from page 51 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 53 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

The Commissioner served notice on the Bank under section 157 of the Tax Ad- ministration Act 1994 (“the Act”) demanding payment of all monies in the joint account to service the tax payable. The Bank refused payment and requested the matter be resolved under the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908. Decision:Justice Ellis found that to override the wife’s rights as joint account holder there needed to be explicit statutory provision, but no such provisions are contained in the Act. There is a presumption that half the money in the joint account belongs to the wife. His Honour relied upon Hirschorn v Evans \[1938\] 2 KB 801 where the Court of Appeal found that in the absence of proof that an account belonged solely to the husband, a joint account could not be attached to answer a judgment against the husband. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 54 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.
