What

Interest is added to overseas based customers' student loans.

When

Interest is calculated daily and added to your loan balance at the end of the tax year.

Rate

Daily rate: 0.009041%. Annual rate: 3.3%

If you're a New Zealand-based customer, you're entitled to an interest-free student loan.

If you become overseas-based interest will be added to your student loan, but there are some situations where interest is not charged. It's calculated each day on your loan balance using the current interest rate. Interest is always included in your loan balance, but interest is only charged on this interest after 31 March each year.

The interest rate is set at the start of each [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
, 1 April. The annual interest rate is currently 3.3%.

Late payment interest
---------------------

If you do not make your payments on time, we may charge late payment interest. 

This is only charged on the overdue amount, and only if the overdue amount is $334 or more. It will keep being charged until you have caught up with your payments.

The late payment interest rate is currently 7.3%. This is calculated as a monthly rate of 0.588%. The standard interest rate applies to the rest of your loan.

### Reduced late payment interest rates

If you contact us about late payments on your student loan, we may be able to reduce the amount of late payment interest you need to pay.

You can arrange an instalment plan to pay off your late payment amount. If you stick to the plan we can switch you to the reduced late payment rate so you pay less interest.

The reduced late payment interest rate is currently 5.3%. This is calculated as a monthly rate of 0.431%.
