====================================================================================================================================================================================================

Your eligible existing employees, and some of your new ones who do not automatically enrol, can choose to opt into KiwiSaver through you.

Check you can opt them in
-------------------------

Not all your employees can opt in through you. Some of them can only opt in with a scheme provider.

Check employee eligibility for KiwiSaver

Ask your employee for a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2
------------------------------------------------------

They may have already given you their KS2. Ask them to fill it in for you if you do not have it.

It tells you the rate to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their pay.

Keep it for your records.

Give your employee the  KiwiSaver -employee information - KS3 factsheet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Give your employee the KS3. You need to do this within 7 days of getting their KS2.

Not giving them their KS3 may mean a penalty for you.

Give them a product disclosure statement
----------------------------------------

If your employee is opting into:

*   your employer-chosen scheme, you give them the product disclosure statement
*   a default KiwiSaver scheme, they get their product disclosure statement from us. 

Send us your New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K
--------------------------------------------------------

Fill in a IR346K for the employee you're opting in.

You can complete these details in myIR or post it to the address on the form either:

*   before their first pay day
*   with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay.

Keep a copy for your records.

Start deductions and contributions
----------------------------------

From the first pay after you’re notified start:

*   KiwiSaver deductions from your employee’s pay
*   making compulsory employer contributions (CEC) and paying employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT).

Other ways to do this

Sometimes employees opt into KiwiSaver through a scheme provider. This means they've chosen their own scheme and joined KiwiSaver through them.

If your employee opts in with a scheme provider, we’ll write to you to let you know:

*   they’ve opted in with a scheme provider
*   your employee’s IRD number
*   the rate by which they want you to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their pay.
