A. PRIORITY Value assessment and prioritisation is primarily assessed against the BENEFITS Contribution the initiative makes to one or a combination of the three broad benefits categories: 1. Customer (Compliance effort/cost), including improved experience 2. Government (Expected impact to assessed revenue), and 3. Inland Revenue (Change to IR administration costs), (a more efficient IR) If the above is not the primary contribution but rather a purely Technical Contribution the following three broad categories can be substituted: A: Contribution to Reduction of Risk, B: Reduction or Elimination of Technical Debt and C: Contribution to Operational Cost Savings (a more efficient IR) The assessment is then balanced against the CHANGE Impact which is measured against COST Impact (one-off delivery cost (from scoping to early life support) and/ or o ngoing cost to IR, Work Effort / Complexity (High, Medium, Low), and SCHEDULE impact assessed against impact on the programme or project’s (critical path and/or key deliverable dates). To support the above, Organisation/Customer Impact is assessed and measured against the impact of policy change, a change to the work environment, tools used and/or, skills required, as well as new ways of working. In addition to looking at how the change contributes to achieving benefit and how complex it may be to implement, there are several additional factors to consider when assessing the priority and ranking of an opportunity or initiative: • Reputational risk (to the Ministry, to personal & business privacy and to IR as a tax authority) • Key impacted stakeholders (Business, Individuals, Families, Employers, Government Departments, etc) • Number of Customers impacted (Low, Medium, High) • Critical customer processes impacted (Filing at tax return, receiving entitlements, etc) • Government priorities (Legislation, integrity of the tax system, Crown Accounting, etc) • Business impact (hours per month) • Urgency (when do we need to make the change - measured in months) • Is the function available as a standard feature in an off the shelf application or system or available in the next version/release of IR applications or systems? • Workarounds available (Yes or No) A prioritisation & ranking tool is available to assist in assessing the above. B. MoSCoW Prioritisation Must Do (Committed): No further assessment is required. Qualified, definitely in, Fully Committed, no argument, a Quick Win, required to deliver the programme outcome and/or minimum viable product – no further assessment required. Should Do and/or Could Do (For Consideration): On the list but needs a Value Assessment. Use the framework to assess and rank, is aligned to Business Priorities (e.g., data quality, failure-driven demand, peak season flattening, partner efficiency) is needed to ensure the Technology strategy is delivered but is is currently unqualified – complete definition and use framework to rank. • Should Do: Is in IRs best interest to resolve. Customer/IR integrity impact: medium-high. • Could Do: Fixing these issues would either result in an improvement or make things easier either for IR or IR’s customer. Customer/IR integrity impact: low-minimal Won’t Do: • Not in current scope but external influences such as policy, legislation or other may require us to revisit it in the future, it is not clear what the business or customer value is, and we expected there is a lot of analysis required to establish this – no further assessment at present. These issues may impact a small number of customers. Changes that fundamentally impact how START has been designed fall into this category. Customer/IR integrity impact: minimal • No further assessment is required. - Definitely out, the business has found a better way or the requirement and/or problem has gone away.

IMPACT Use the IMPACT table below to derive an early assessment of the overall / summary level scope item impact. As further analysis is completed this initial value will be superseded by the detail assessment values derived. Impact Schedule Risk Effort Resources Benefits Anticipated change to the baselined schedule Risk associated with the change Resource effort incurred Anticipated change to delivery resources Anticipated change to delivery benefits None No change to the critical path, deliverable dates, or milestones. No Risk No change No change No Impact to benefits Low Change that will not affect the critical path or key milestones, but will affect deliverable dates by < 2 weeks Low 0 to 10 days Low (Assess Number Required, Skills Required and Availability) Possible Low Impact ( BT benefits team to provide rating) Medium Change that will not affect the critical path, but will affect key milestones and/or deliverable dates by < 4 weeks Medium 10 to 20 days Medium (Assess Number Required, Skills Required and Availability) Possible Medium Impact (BT benefits team to provide rating) High Change that will affect the critical path and/or key milestones and/or deliverable dates by > 4 weeks High > 2 0 days High (Assess Number Required, Skills Required and Availability) Possible High Impact (BT benefits team to provide rating) If the Fibonacci scale is used to rank scope items, references have been provided in the Benefits Contribution and, Delivery Cost tables below to assist in determining your JIRA ratings for this scale. JIRA uses the Low to Significant value range. D. BENEFITS Contribution Benefit Contribution is used to track the contribution that a scope item makes to the top five benefits listed in the original BT the business plan. (Please see this document for more information about the high-level benefits). Benefits are captured within three broad categories – 1. Customer, 2. Government, and 3. Inland Revenue. It is not expected that a scope item needs to contribute to all benefits. It may contribute at a medium level to multiple benefits. A rule of thumb is to use the highest rating if a scope item contributes across more than one category: Page | 4 https://irnz.sharepoint.com/sites/BT/PMO/lead/IR's Guide to Transformation External Site - Developing the Narrative/Delivering the Transformation (Collateral)/Delivering Learning and Improving/PMO/IR BT Guide to Scope Rating.docx BT Scope Rating \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Benefits Contribution Category Benefits C ontribution Value None Low Medium High Significant 1, 2 and 3 5 and 8 13 and 21 34 and 55 89 and 144 Little to no change < 10% change < 25% change <50% change > 50% change GOVERNMENT (Revenue) Expected impact to and/or additional Crown Revenue Little to no change @$200m/annum ( < $20m p.a.) @$500m/annum (< $50m p.a.) @$1,000m/ annum (< $100m p.a.) $1.5 billion/annum (> $100m p.a.)

DELIVERY COST (and Schedule impact) – CHANGE Impact Delivery cost impact is either the implementation cost, an on-going cost to the business, a combination of these or you may not know these but know the work effort / complexity, either way choose the one with the highest rating to assess against your benefit contribution rating. • On-going cost to the business, is a permanent cost borne by IR per annum \[p.a.\] for example software licenses. Delivery Cost IMPACT None Low Medium High Significant 1, 2 and 3 5 and 8 13 and 21 34 and 55 89 and 144 Implementation Cost “Costs incurred to deliver outputs, services” e.g., commissioning the datacentre None or very little $250K - < $500K $500K ->$1M $1M ->$5M $5M ->$10M On-going cost to IR “Permanent on-going costs borne by IR per annum\[p.a.\] e.g., software licenses” None or very little < $100k p.a. > $100k p.a. > $1m p.a. > $10m p.a. Or use this table: Delivery Cost Impact Programme implementation cost On-going cost to IR “Costs incurred by the programme to deliver outputs, services i.e., commissioning datacentre” “Permanent on-going costs borne by IR per annum\[p.a.\] i.e., software licenses” None 1,2, 3 n/a n/a Low 5, 8 Less than $1m Less than $100k p.a.

If an initiative is being “added via change control” to work that is currently underway and/or baselined, assess schedule impact and balance this against benefit contribution. Once again choose the highest rating to assess against benefit contribution.
