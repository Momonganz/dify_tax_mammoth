Nil trust returns If the trust receives any income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn’t required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether they have derived income.
