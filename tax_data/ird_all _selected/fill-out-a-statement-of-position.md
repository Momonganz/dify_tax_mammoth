Fill in the cover sheet
-----------------------

Tell us:

*   your name, address, IRD number and contact details
*   your tax agent’s details, if you have one
*   which Inland Revenue staff member you’ve been dealing with (if any) – write this under ‘this notice is for the attention of’
*   the date you send us the SOP – this is important as there are time limits for responding.

Tell us the facts about your view
---------------------------------

Tell us the facts and circumstances of your dispute that you’ll be relying on to support your view. If you think the amounts in dispute have changed, give the updated amounts. Do not tell us the reasons for your view yet.

Tell us what questions need to be answered to resolve this dispute
------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if the dispute is about unexplained cash deposits you might put, ‘The main question is whether the cash deposits are my business income. The other question is whether I am liable for a gross carelessness shortfall penalty.’

Tell us why you think your view is correct
------------------------------------------

Give us reasons for your point of view. Tell us why it’s correct and what laws support it.

If you cannot tell us what laws support it, you’ll need to provide enough details that we can identify the laws for you.

List the evidence you're relying on
-----------------------------------

List the evidence that supports your view and the facts you’re relying on. Attach copies of any documents you have not already given us.

For example:

*   receipts and bank records
*   correspondence like letters, texts and emails
*   tax returns
*   anything else that may be relevant.

Double-check you've got everything
----------------------------------

Look at the checklist and make sure you have not missed anything.

If you want to communicate with us by email, tick the box next to ‘Consent for email communication’ and give us your email address.

Save the form and send it to us
-------------------------------

If you’ve been dealing with an Inland Revenue staff member about the dispute, send them the form directly. They may give you the option to email it to them.

If you have not been dealing with a staff member directly, attach the form and any supporting documents to a message in myIR.
