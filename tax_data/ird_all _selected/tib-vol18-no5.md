Corrections
-----------

In SPS 06/02 Writing off outstanding tax published under the section “Standard practice statements” pp 55-64, paragraph 63 is incorrect.

Paragraph 63 of the standard practice statement should read:

63\. If Inland Revenue considers that recovery of part, or all of the outstanding tax would not represent an efficient use of administrative resources, then pursuant to section 176(2)(a), the outstanding tax would be written off. 

In “New Legislation” page 78 in the second part of the example the reference to “1 July 2006” should read “1 July 2005” and the reference to “1 July 2007” should read “1 July 2006”. 

The example implicitly assumes that the employer can use the tax value option in the return for April–June 2006, although the vehicle was owned before that date.

This would be the case if:

*   when the vehicle was owned for the whole year, at least five years had lapsed since the beginning of the vehicle’s initial return period; and
*   when the vehicle was acquired on 7 December 2005, the first return for the vehicle is for the April–June 2006 quarter (that is, the vehicle was not used to provide fringe benefits until that quarter even though it had been purchased some months earlier).
