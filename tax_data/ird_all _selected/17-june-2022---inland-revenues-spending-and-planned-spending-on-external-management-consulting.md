www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22 OIA1895 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 17 June 2022 Kia ora Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 13 May 2022. You requested the following information regarding: IRD’s spending and planned spending on external management consulting over the last five years in the field of change management, executive coaching, workplace culture reviews, evaluations, audits and workshops. I would like to know the organisations or people who have provided these services, the tasks they were employed for and how much it cost. On 19 May 2022, you clarified your request and confirmed that spending/planned spending on “evaluations, audits and workshops” was within the context of/linked to “change management, executive coaching, and workplace cultures”. Inland Revenue’s (IR) planned spending by supplier and activity is provided in the table attached. On a broader scale we are providing the names of the organisations, how much was spent per organisation, and the amount spent on the general type of activity. We have provided figures relating to IR’s spending on external consulting for change management, however we are unable to provide data on executive coaching and workplace culture reviews. For executive coaching, the coaching portion is contained within the overall programme costs and therefore cannot be separately identified, and workplace culture reviews are internally developed and led by IR. For these reasons, this portion of your request is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information requested does not exist and we do not believe any other agency holds the information. Your request for the specific people who have provided these services and the tasks they were employed for is refused under section 9(2)(b)(ii) of the OIA, in order to protect the commercial position of the person who supplied the information or who is the subject of the information. No public interest in releasing the withheld information has been identified that would be sufficient to outweigh the reasons for withholding. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman or Privacy Commissioner for a review.
