Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015
============================================================

2015 legislation covering KiwiSaver allows members to withdraw member tax credits when purchasing a new home, and corrects veteran income replacement payments.

The Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced on 1 December 2014. It received its first reading on 4 December 2014, its second reading on 24 March 2015 and its third reading on 26 March 2015. The new Act received Royal assent on 31 March 2015.
