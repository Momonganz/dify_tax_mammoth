The competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide upon request information for the purposes referred to in Article 1. Such information shall be exchanged without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party. 2. If the information in the possession of the competent authority of the Requested Party is not sufficient to enable it to comply with the request for information, the Requested Party shall use all relevant information gathering measures to provide the Applicant Party with the information requested, notwithstanding that the Requested Party may not need such information for its own tax purposes. 3. If specifically requested by the competent authority of the Applicant Party, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide information under this Article, to the extent allowable under its domestic laws, in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of original records. 4. (a) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its competent authority, for the purposes of this Agreement, has the authority to obtain and provide upon request: (i) information held by banks, other financial institutions, and any person, including nominees and trustees, acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity; (ii) information regarding the legal and beneficial ownership of companies, partnerships and other persons, including, within the constraints of Article 2, ownership information on all such persons in an ownership chain; in the case of trusts, information on settlors, trustees, beneficiaries and the position in an ownership chain. (b) This Agreement does not create an obligation on the Contracting Parties to obtain or provide: (i) ownership information with respect to publicly traded companies or public collective investment funds or schemes unless such information can be obtained without giving rise to disproportionate difficulties; (ii) information relating to a period more than six years prior to the tax period under consideration. (c) If information is requested relating to a person that is not a resident or national in one or other of the Contracting Parties, it also shall be established to the satisfaction of the competent authority of the Requested Party that such information is necessary for the proper administration and enforcement of the fiscal laws of the Applicant Party. Where such necessity has been duly established, the competent authorities shall consult as to the appropriate form of assistance. (d) Where the Applicant Party requests information with respect to a matter which does not constitute serious tax evasion, a senior official of its competent authority shall certify that the request is relevant to, and necessary for, the determination of the tax liability of the taxpayer under the laws of the Applicant Party. 5. The competent authority of the Applicant Party shall provide the following information to the competent authority of the Requested Party when making a request for information under this Agreement to demonstrate the relevance of the information sought to the request: (a) the identity of the taxpayer under examination or investigation and evidence that such taxpayer is a resident in, or national of, one of the Contracting Parties; (b) the nature and type of the information requested, including a description of the specific evidence, information or other assistance sought; (c) the tax purposes for which the information is sought and why it is relevant to, and necessary for, the determination of the tax liability of a taxpayer under the laws of the Applicant Party; (d) the period of time with respect to which the information is required for the tax purposes; (e) reasonable grounds for believing that the information requested is present in the jurisdiction of the Requested Party or is in the possession or control of a person subject to the jurisdiction of the Requested Party and may be relevant to the tax purposes of the request; (f) to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession or control of the information requested; (g) a statement that the request conforms to the law and administrative practice of the Applicant Party and would be obtainable by the Applicant Party under its laws in similar circumstances, both for its own tax purposes and in response to a valid request from the Requested Party under this Agreement; (h) a statement that the Applicant Party has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information, except those that would give rise to disproportionate difficulties; (i) where the request is directed at a person, other than the taxpayer, confirmation that only information in such person's possession or control that directly relates to the taxpayer need be provided. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 in particular, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall forward the requested information as promptly as possible to the Applicant Party. To ensure a prompt response, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall: (a) confirm receipt of a request in writing to the competent authority of the Applicant Party and shall notify the competent authority of the Applicant Party of deficiencies in the request, if any, within 60 days of the receipt of the request; and (b) if the competent authority of the Requested Party has been unable to obtain and provide the information within 90 days of receipt of the request, including if it encounters obstacles in furnishing the information or it refuses to furnish the information, it shall immediately inform the Applicant Party, explaining the reason for its inability, the nature of the obstacles or the reasons for its refusal. ARTICLE 6 Tax examinations abroad 1. The Requested Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the Applicant Party to enter the territory of the Requested Party to interview individuals and examine records with the written consent of the persons concerned. The competent authority of the Applicant Party shall notify the competent authority of the Requested Party of the time and place of the meeting with the individuals concerned. 2. At the request of the competent authority of the Applicant Party, the competent authority of the Requested Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the Applicant Party to be present at the appropriate part of a tax examination in the Requested Party. 3. If the request referred to in paragraph 2 is acceded to, the competent authority of the Requested Party conducting the examination shall, as soon as possible, notify the competent authority of the Applicant Party about the time and place of the examination, the authority or official designated to carry out the examination and the procedures and conditions required by the Requested Party for the conduct of the examination. All decisions with respect to the conduct of the tax examination shall be made by the Requested Party conducting the examination. ARTICLE 7 Possibility of declining a request 1. The competent authority of the Requested Party may decline to assist where: (a) the request is not made in conformity with this Agreement; (b) the Applicant Party has not pursued all means available in its own jurisdiction, except where recourse to such means would give rise to disproportionate difficulty; (c) the disclosure of the information requested would be contrary to the public policy of the Requested Party; (d) the request is directed at a person, other than the taxpayer, in respect of information that does not relate specifically to the tax affairs of the taxpayer; or (e) the Applicant Party would not be able to obtain the information (i) under its own laws for purposes of administration or enforcement of its own tax laws or (ii) in response to a valid request from the Requested Party under this Agreement. 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information of the type referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 5 shall not be treated as such a secret or trade process merely because it meets the criteria in that paragraph. 3. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to obtain or provide information, which would reveal confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative where such communications: (a) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client made in connection with the giving of legal advice to the client; (b) are communications between a professional legal adviser and a client, professional legal adviser acting for the client and another person, or the client and another person made in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings; and (c) include items enclosed with or referred to in such communications and made: (i) in connection with the giving of legal advice; or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of legal proceedings and for the purposes of such proceedings, when the items are in the possession of a person who is entitled to possession of them. 4. A request for information shall not be refused on the ground that the tax claim giving rise to the request is disputed by the taxpayer. 5. The Requested Party may decline a request for information if the information is requested by the Applicant Party to administer or enforce a provision of the tax law of the Applicant Party, or any requirement connected therewith, which discriminates against a national of the Requested Party as compared with a national of the Applicant Party in the same circumstances. ARTICLE 8 Confidentiality Any information received by a Contracting Party under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) in the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use such information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The information may not be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or any other jurisdiction without the express written consent of the competent authority of the Requested Party. ARTICLE 9 SAFEGUARDS The rights and safeguards secured to persons by the laws or administrative practices of the Requested Party remain applicable. The rights and safeguards may not be applied by the Requested Party in a manner that unduly prevents or delays effective exchange of information. ARTICLE 10 COSTS Incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance (including reasonable costs of third parties and external advisors in connection with litigation or otherwise) shall be agreed by the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 11 NO PREJUDICIAL OR RESTRICTIVE MEASURES 1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall apply prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party so long as this Agreement is in force and effective. 2. A "prejudicial or restrictive measure based on harmful tax practices" is a measure applied by one Contracting Party to residents or nationals of either Contracting Party on the basis that the other Contracting Party does not engage in effective exchange of information and/or because it lacks transparency in the operation of its laws, regulations or administrative practices, or on the basis of no or nominal taxes and one of the preceding criteria. 3. Without limiting the generality of paragraph 2 the term "prejudicial or restrictive measure" includes the denial of a deduction, credit or exemption, the imposition of a tax, charge or levy, or special reporting requirements. ARTICLE 12 Mutual agreement procedure 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. 2. In addition to the endeavours referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may mutually determine the procedures to be used under Articles 5 and 6. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. 4. The Contracting Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. ARTICLE 13 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Contracting Parties shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall thereupon have effect in relation to all matters covered by Article 1 for taxable periods beginning on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force, or where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after the first day of the thirteenth month next following entry into force. Article 14 Termination 1. Either Contracting Party may, after the expiration of 3ï¿½years from the date of its entry into force, terminate the Agreement by serving a written notice of termination to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel. 2. Such termination shall become effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of six months after the date of receipt of notice of termination by the other Contracting Party. 3. A Contracting Party shall remain bound by the provisions of Article 8 with respect to any information obtained under the Agreement.     PAGE 9 !3>E\_\`apqrï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
