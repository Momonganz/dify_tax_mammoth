Hōnore David Parker Minita Whiwhinga Pūtea STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 3 A tax and social policy system that is fair and coherent – and is complied with – is essential to New Zealand’s continued stability and prosperity. It supports the Government’s ability to achieve social, economic, and fiscal priorities. These priorities include further COVID-19 recovery initiatives; work on housing affordability; research and development; responding to climate change; improving tax rules for digital multinationals to give New Zealand businesses a level-playing field; addressing inequality and ensuring everyone pays their fair share. Inland Revenue plays an important role in contributing to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand. My role, as the Minister of Revenue, is to ensure Inland Revenue has the resources and mandate it needs to help people pay and receive the right amounts. That means supporting people to get things right from the start and reducing opportunities for non-compliance. Our tax system relies on the majority of people paying the right amount of tax. People by and large believe that paying taxes is for the greater good. Tax funds important public services they, their families and society benefit from. People are finding it easier to comply due to Inland Revenue’s transformation. Where people do not comply and do not pay their fair share there are clear rules and enforcement powers that can be used. By mid-2022 Inland Revenue will have completed its multi- year, multi-stage transformation programme to modernise the revenue system and make tax simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders. Government is already seeing some of the benefits of its investment in the programme, such as the rapid and effective way Inland Revenue was able to implement measures to support businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19. I am confident that by 2023–24 the Government and taxpayers will see the full value of the investment they have made. Tax policy work programme Government’s tax policy work programme for the next 18 months will support the response to COVID-19 and rebuild the economy, enhance productivity and increase the fairness of the tax system. This Statement of Intent sets out Inland Revenue’s plans for helping the Government to meet its economic and social policy goals. I am satisfied that the information on future operating intentions is in accordance with sections 38 and 40 of the Public Finance Act 1989, and is consistent with the policies and performance expectations of the Government.

Naomi Ferguson Kaikōmihana me Te Tumu Whakarae 6 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Introduction from the Commissioner and Chief Executive The needs and wellbeing of New Zealanders are at the heart of the work we do. As the make-up of New Zealand changes, we will continue to evolve to make sure we meet customers’ needs, now and in the future. Our transformed revenue system and organisation Since 2017 Inland Revenue has transformed the way we deliver services by modernising the revenue system and making tax simpler, more open, and certain for our customers. New Zealand now has a modern, digital, revenue system which reduces customer effort and cost, is more resilient, improves compliance levels, and enables policy changes to be made faster and more cost-effectively. This was clearly demonstrated in the way we have been able to support the COVID-19 response. A strong tax and social policy system will continue to support the recovery from COVID-19. We will contribute to Government’s priorities, including economic recovery and social wellbeing, by collecting and distributing money and making it easier for New Zealanders to receive the support they need. We are motivated by the knowledge that what we do is vital for the wellbeing of New Zealanders. As part of our new operating model, we have also invested in our people so they are able and comfortable working digitally. We will continue to support the development of our people’s digital capability to support our new processes and ways of working. With compliance at the heart of our work, our focus will continue to be on helping customers to get things right. This includes designing services around our different customer groups to meet their needs, as well as building in compliance checks right from the start. Our new digital and analytical capabilities enable us to work in increasingly targeted and effective ways to support compliance and maintain integrity and trust in the revenue system. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner and Chief Executive STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 7 Building an effective Māori Crown relationship We are committed to meeting our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency. Becoming a better partner in the Māori Crown relationship is being driven through our Māhutonga programme. This seeks to integrate Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts, and practices into the way we work. A key component of this is delivering on Te Arawhiti’s Whāinga Amorangi expectations to transform Public Service leadership capability in Māori Crown relations. We will also build our people’s Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo Māori and tikanga Māori capability by developing an organisation-wide training programme, Te Arapiki. Looking ahead Working with our partners across government delivers better outcomes for New Zealanders and we will continue to collaborate to improve services. We will look to work with our partners to maximise the benefits of transformation, such as sharing our expertise. By mid-2022 we will have delivered our transformation programme, and the final release will set us up to ensure benefits are fully realised for our customers and the Crown. We are already seeing significant delivery of benefits and outcomes. We will continue to modernise the revenue system and look for further opportunities to leverage the significant investment made in our capabilities. This will support us in guiding our future direction, to deliver a world-class system for the benefit of all New Zealanders.

Our strategic intentions Delivering the tax policy work programme The Government’s tax policy work programme (TPWP) sets out our policy focus. The work areas are: >Taxation of residential investment property. This work will include making changes to our tax settings to improve housing affordability for first home buyers by dampening investor demand for existing property. >Tax administration. This work will focus on leveraging the assets and capabilities developed through our business transformation programme and will include a green paper on options for tax administration reform. >Sustainable economy and the environment. We will work with other agencies to develop a framework for when to use taxes or other charges for environmental and resource issues, review existing tax provisions to ensure they are not biased against environmentally friendly investment and behaviour, and contribute to cross-agency advice on environmental proposals. >International tax. The international tax framework needs to adapt to shifts in the global economy, including increased cross-border activity and digitalisation. This work will include a multilateral solution to the challenges posed by the digital economy to international taxation and consideration of a digital service tax. >Integrity of the tax system. This work will include measures to support the 39% top personal income tax rate, the collection of information about trusts, and a new Tax Principles Act (which will involve the establishment of a reporting framework against a set of principles to measure fairness of the tax system). >COVID-19 response. We will work with other agencies to make any changes required to the range of COVID-19 response measures. What we want to achieve E whai ana mātou i te aha 12 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 >Stewardship. This work will include a review of fringe benefit tax to determine if it’s fit for purpose, a long- term insights briefing, and research work involving the collection of information on the level of tax paid by high wealth individuals. >Maintaining the tax system. Tax legislation needs to be regularly maintained and updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence, or other factors. Our remedial work programme will focus on priorities in this area. >Non-discretionary other agency work. This work involves other agencies’ work programmes that have tax implications or delivery implications for us. Examples of this work include local government reforms, the Three Waters project, and charities review. >Social policy. We have a significant role to play in the delivery of social policy. This work includes the Ministry of Social Development led welfare reform programme (which includes a review of Working for Families), and the development of a social unemployment insurance scheme. Supporting Government priorities Overall, a strong revenue system contributes to making New Zealand a great place for people to live and work. We have had a significant focus on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and expect to play a substantial role in supporting New Zealand’s recovery in the years ahead. We will continue to support customers to pay and receive the right amounts by helping make things easy for them such as setting up instalments, claiming reliefs, and managing the impacts of the pandemic on their businesses or personal finances. Ensuring trust in and the integrity of the revenue system So that New Zealanders continue to provide us with accurate information, pay their taxes, and claim only what they are entitled to, it’s important they believe: >When I pay my tax, I’m doing a good thing (and that’s what people like me do). >When I’m trying to do the right things, Inland Revenue will help me. >When someone else is trying to do the wrong thing, Inland Revenue will find them. We protect the integrity of the revenue system by helping customers get things right as well as correcting them when they get it wrong. We: >Make it easy to pay the right amounts on time and to receive the right payments and difficult not to. >Fix problems when they happen so that customers understand where they have gone wrong and know what to do next time. >Make tax and payments part of business processes or life events where possible. To do this we look at everything from policy settings, the design of products and services, the advice and education we provide, through to how and when we enforce the law. There is a range of ways we can respond when things go wrong, from educating customers new to the system through to investigating and taking people to court where necessary. Finishing our transformation programme Transformation set out to help New Zealanders by reducing effort for customers, improving compliance, making policy changes faster and more cost-effectively, improving the resilience of our systems, and making us more efficient. The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. Customers have moved to digital channels, many transactions are processed in near real-time, and policies and processes have been simplified. This has meant better experiences for customers and new ways of doing things for Inland Revenue. Transformation has been far more than an upgrade of technology. The final release of the programme will move child support to new systems and processes and upgrade our online services. We will then decommission all our old systems and processes. The programme will be complete by 30 June 2022. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 13 Making the most of our new capabilities While the transformation programme will come to an end, Inland Revenue will continue to embed the changes made over the last few years. We will continue to look for opportunities to modernise the revenue system and make the most of our new capabilities: >Self-service options for customers mean they can do more for themselves with less effort and without needing to contact us. This frees us up to help customers who cannot use digital services or have complex needs. >Responsive and resilient systems mean we can respond more quickly and innovatively with new policies and products when required, including collaborating with others on design and implementation. We can operate remotely even when there are disruptions to our offices. >More complete and accurate data combined with our ability to bring information from different places together means we can better understand customers’ needs and risks to the system. We can tailor services depending on customers’ understanding and capability. This is helping us to decide when we should proactively contact customers and how we should communicate with them. >Digital connections with third parties make it easy for the appropriate information to be exchanged between systems. This is reducing effort and re-work for both customers and Inland Revenue. Many new products or services can now be implemented much more quickly than previously as our systems are flexible. We showed this in the way we responded to COVID-19, with new products made available within weeks. We will continue to work with our public and private sector partners to deliver on wider outcomes. This could range from sharing our expertise through to changing how public services are delivered. For example, we can share information with other agencies or organisations, with appropriate security permissions, to help them deliver services. The portal we put in place to support the Ministry of Social Development to administer the wage subsidy shows how this approach can work in practice. Working with others to improve outcomes The Public Service Act 2020 aims to create a more modern, agile, unified Public Service that can deliver across agency boundaries to wrap services around New Zealanders’ needs. We already work with many other agencies and external partners to deliver outcomes for customers. In the private sector, we work with a wide range of organisations, including tax intermediaries and software providers, to ensure that requirements are simple, can be integrated into existing business processes and systems as far as possible, and make it as easy as possible for people to pay and receive the right amounts. In the public sector, with the Ministry of Social Development, we distribute Working for Families payments. We jointly administer student loans with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). We administer paid parental leave for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. We also have a range of information-sharing arrangements in place, including with the Department of Internal Affairs, the New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. While we are committed to playing our part in realising a more joined-up and citizen-focused Public Service, opportunities need to be a good fit with our capabilities and balanced against ensuring we continue to deliver Government priorities and our core business. We must also take care that we do not put at risk our stewardship of the revenue system. We will develop frameworks and processes to ensure that decisions made about the role we play in initiatives that cross agency boundaries are transparent. Our areas of strength are: >Delivering services based on core information – particularly income and customer data. >Collection and payment of money / processing at scale. >High-volume, digital transaction processing – not services that rely on high levels of discretion and/or an extensive customer-facing presence. >Delivering large-scale, consistent, rules-based initiatives that leverage the capabilities of our commercial off-the- shelf systems. >Analytical tools and capability – including ‘what-if ’ analysis and risk assessment. 14 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Putting the customer at the centre of everything we do >We anticipate and proactively support key events in our customers’ lives at the right time. >We use customer insights to inform activities. >Our services are seamless, and tax and social policy are integrated into customers’ lives. >We partner with others to deliver service excellence to customers – from policy design, to education, to audit. >We make it easy for customers to get it right and we reduce compliance costs and effort. Our strategy is to make it easy for our customers to deal with us and to pay and receive the right amounts, whatever their circumstances. It has six interconnected strands. We will continue to focus on modernising the revenue system over the next four years to further improve how we serve New Zealanders. How we will achieve our objectives Pēhea ai te whakatutuki i ā mātou whāinga Customer Through transformation we have become more customer-centric in terms of how we deliver services and evolve services to better meet customers’ needs. We have made considerable progress in putting our customers at the centre of everything we do. We will continue to improve customers’ experiences and decrease their effort when dealing with tax and social policy. We have four ongoing areas of focus: Organising ourselves around our customers and outcomes. Our culture, capabilities, and processes are helping our people to bring a greater understanding of our customers into the design and delivery of services. Building our understanding of our customers and using insights to continuously inform and improve our activities. This includes using continuous learning loops to improve as we go. Delivering Mauri Ora Te Whānau – wellbeing of the family. Delivering customer experiences that reduce customers’ compliance cost and effort and increase their trust in us. We want to provide tailored, timely and seamless services that are integrated across government and other business partners. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 15 Understanding our external environment and positioning ourselves accordingly. We take a holistic view, adapt to changes, and innovate. Extending our boundaries. We continue to collaborate with others in the public and private sectors to make dealing with government easy. Adapting the way we work. We engage with and deliver results in partnership with others. We reduce or remove barriers that stop us using information, knowledge, and expertise to deliver value. 12 3 We work with external parties to innovate, gain insight, and achieve wider economic and social outcomes > We work with others to deliver mutual benefit. > We use our information, knowledge, and expertise to develop our understanding of customers. > We leverage our capabilities, information, and resources to support broad outcomes. External collaboration New Zealanders benefit from Inland Revenue working collaboratively as part of the broader Public Service and with the private sector. Our customers cross boundaries and borders and to provide better support and deliver a seamless experience, we need to work across those boundaries and borders too. There are three broad ways we are bringing this about: Our decisions and actions – for delivering today and shaping our future – are intelligence-led >We understand the information we collect, and the insights and intelligence we generate through the knowledge and experiences of our people, need to be managed and shared appropriately. >We use information and insights to create intelligence we can act on. >Intelligence drives our decision-making, including policy and service design, so we know where and when to direct resources to realise value. Information and intelligence We have made significant progress in three areas: data and analytics, information and knowledge management, and data and information governance. We will continue to drive an integrated approach to help ensure the integrity of the revenue system by supporting more informed policy advice, faster and higher-quality decision-making at scale, and targeting resources to the areas that provide the best value. We will continue to focus on building the data and information management capability of our people, and delegating decision-making so that our people can make well-informed decisions. We will: Make best use of our information and insights at scale to provide increasing value, including participating in and shaping government-wide forums and initiatives. Automate processes to deliver personalised interactions to support compliance and create proactive, risk- based customer interventions. Build on and make best use of our tools and processes, and the capabilities of our people to access, analyse, and use data, information, and knowledge to drive quality decision-making. 123 16 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Digital We fully embrace our place in the digitally connected world >We make it easy to collaborate with customers, agencies, and others. >We design and make changes quickly. >Customers can easily access secure digital services anywhere, any time. >We encourage, empower, and upskill our people to make best use of digital ways of working. The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. Customers now have digital services for all taxes and the social policies we administer. This makes it easier for customers to do what they need to do without needing to call us. Businesses, employers, and tax intermediaries are increasingly managing their tax obligations through software. As part of the final release, we upgraded the digital services that all our customers use. Digital services are better meeting the expectations of our customers and our own people and enabling them to connect more easily with others and share useful information quickly. We will mitigate the risk of digital exclusion by involving customers early in the design of new services and consider where alternative channels / support are required. The key ways we are implementing our digital vision are: Using flexible and extendible digital solutions to provide better self-service options to our customers. Using analytics to understand customers’ shifting patterns of digital interaction to support compliance and improve customers’ ability to self-serve. Providing enabling services to digital service providers and intermediaries for the benefit of customers. Working with our customers, our people, our business partners, and other agencies to continually develop our approach and respond to innovative ideas. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 17 Policy agility Policy change is faster, cheaper, and better – fit for a changing world >Our policy design is proactive, coherent, and integrated, from idea generation and advice, through to implementation. >We implement policy decisions speedily and smoothly. >We deliver high-quality advice that is outcome-focused, realistic about the impacts and based on good information and analysis. >We are a trusted and credible voice that shapes and delivers government and system outcomes. >We use innovative, flexible, and creative practices to design policy, supported by strong economic, social, and wellbeing frameworks and broad consultation. Greater policy agility helps us to meet our regulatory stewardship responsibilities by ensuring we are outcomes-focused, proactive, and collaborative. It applies across the end-to-end process, from idea generation, through to policy development, implementation, and evaluation. We will continue to develop improved ways of working, with multi-disciplinary teams working effectively together. We will retain and grow the capabilities our people need to become policy professionals of the future and improve our use of information and analytics so that our policy advice is high quality, timely and evidence-based. We will focus on making the right connections across government, to support a strong inter-generational and wellbeing approach. We are lifting our policy agility through: Building our focus on regulatory and cross-system collaboration. Maximising the advantages of our new technology platform, operating model, and ways of working, through a cycle of evaluation, learning, and improvement. Lifting information and analytical capability to enable enhanced modelling of impacts (including economic, revenue, compliance, behavioural, and administrative impacts) and better evaluation of policy. Putting in place a focus on gaining a better understanding of Māori needs and perspectives through the development of an enhanced engagement approach. 1234 18 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 People Working as part of Inland Revenue is unique, exciting, fulfilling, and career-enhancing Our vision means: >We value individuals and diversity of thought and capability. >We find, develop, and deploy people on the basis of their capabilities, which are a mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and attitudes. >We design roles to be adaptable, interesting, and empowering. >We work with other organisations to develop fulfilling career journeys in, through, and beyond Inland Revenue. We have established new approaches to role design and performance management, new learning and development practices, and workplace tools and technology that enable a highly capable, diverse, motivated workforce. Our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy supports our aspiration to have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. We will continue to build on what has been achieved including: Maturing our Diversity and Inclusion work programme, aligned with Te Kawa Mataaho (Public Service Commission) and Papa Pounamu (the Chief Executive governance group for the Public Service-wide diversity and inclusion work programme) expectations. Building Te Tiriti o Waitangi experience and our cultural competence in te ao Māori to fulfil our responsibilities as a Tr e a t y p a r t n e r. Embedding our new operating model to enable a cohesive end-to-end people experience. Using insight about the capability and aspirations of our people to deliver on Inland Revenue’s and the wider Public Service’s objectives. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 19 We are committed to meeting our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency and partner in the Māori Crown relationship. Our Māhutonga programme aims to integrate Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts, and practices into the way we work. Māhutonga sets out the direction we want to take with our organisational culture and our Māori customers. It includes a number of strands of activity, ranging from building the Māori cultural capability of our people, to enhancing our engagement and service delivery approach with Māori. A core part of our Māhutonga work is building our Māori cultural capability. We are developing Te Arapiki, a stair-cased learning approach that aligns to the expectations set out by Te Arawhiti (the Office for Māori Crown Relations) for all public servants. Te Mata o Te Arero is our Māori language plan which supports the revitalisation of te reo Māori. We are committed to supporting the use of te reo Māori in our workplace. The service delivery strand of Māhutonga includes Mauri Ora Te Whānau. This is a statement of our intent to improve whānau wellbeing through taking a whānau-centred approach to our work with Māori customers. Our research, including the Māori Customer Landscape, is helping us to bring whānau, hapū and iwi perspectives into our work. By exploring the wider context of the Māori world view and perspectives, we can better understand what is important to our customers. The appropriate application of this understanding helps us to think differently about the types of services that will help best meet their needs and improve outcomes for them. We are in the process of establishing a panel of Māori experts who can advise us on how best to engage on policy issues of significance to Māori so that our tax and social policy advice to Ministers is more informed and better reflects Māori perspectives. Delivering Māhutonga – our approach to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and working with Māori Making it easier for people to get things right and harder to get wrong We will continue to focus on helping customers most in need of our assistance to get the payments they are entitled to and to meet their payment obligations. We will continue to be empathetic to and supportive of customers who are struggling, to help them do the right thing. However, one size does not fit all and we will continue to investigate where necessary. For example, our community education approach provides new business owners with the information they need at the time they set their business up, to help increase their resilience. We are also working with other agencies to ensure that customers get consistent messages and find dealing with government as easy as possible. This will help support a more unified Public Service that has customers at its centre. For new products and services, we are increasingly building in checks at the start. This saves time for both customers and Inland Revenue by stopping incorrect applications and ensuring people receive only the payments they are entitled to. We can quickly collate and make sense of the large variety of data we collect and be more proactive when we see things that are not right. We can move more quickly to help customers get back on track and tailor how we work with customers to help them pay and receive the right amounts. Increasingly third parties, such as tax intermediaries and software providers, are involved in delivering services to customers. We will continue to work with others in both the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for customers. For example, we will continue to work with the Ministry of Social Development on better processes for people moving in and out of work and to help those who have debt with both agencies. 20 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Becoming more diverse and inclusive Meeting the diverse needs of New Zealand’s people is important to us. Having a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture enables us to better understand and respond to our customers’ needs. The varied perspectives of our people will help us design and deliver the right services for customers. We are committed to ensuring a diversity of views and have a comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. Our approach aligns with the Public Service Act 2020 and guidance from Te Kawa Mataaho (Public Service Commission) and Papa Pounamu expectations. We published our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan in 2020 Our strategy aligns with Papa Pounamu expectations The Diversity and Inclusion Group is made up of representatives from our diversity networks and from the business Māori Network Tagata Pasifika Network He Toa Takatini Rainbow Network Women’s Network Diversability Network Multicultural Network Addressing gender and ethnic pay gaps We will address gender and ethnic representation by design rather than expecting it to happen by default. Our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan has five key areas: >People analytics and insights: Regularly measuring and publishing progress on the gender and ethnic pay gap, representation and pay progression to drive visibility, understanding, and accountability. >Attracting a diverse pool of applicants to improve representation of groups at all levels and areas. >Ensuring our candidate selection processes are free from bias. >Career and pay: Supporting our people’s career development. >Whānau friendly: Being a whānau-friendly employer and flexible by default, where flexible options are equally available to men and women and do not undermine career development or pay. Diversity and inclusion at Inland Revenue We are delivering a comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Our Diversity and Inclusion Group shapes Inland Revenue’s initiatives Our people have set up diversity and inclusion networks STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 21 Enhancing the capabilities and technical skills of our people To deliver the best services for our customers, we will continue to invest in our people by building their knowledge and capability in areas such as policy agility, tax technical expertise, and digital skills. Our move to capability-based roles and our new tools and technology mean we can be more agile and resilient, and work more efficiently. Multi-disciplinary teams and devolved decision-making enable us to resolve issues for customers more quickly. Our capability-based approach is integrated into our role design, recruitment, development, and talent management. This approach is based around 12 people capabilities that demonstrate the skills, knowledge, experience, and attitudes needed for a future-fit workforce that is adaptive and responsive to change. Our people capabilities recognise that technical skills and knowledge are critical to delivering our services. Rapid changes in customer demand, technology, and the future of work mean transferrable skills and behaviours are also equally important. We are committed to embedding and evolving the capability of our people through: >Designing and delivering tax and social policy learning that maintains and enhances our technical skills and knowledge. >Building our cultural competence in line with our Māhutonga and diversity and inclusion goals. >Planning and managing our workforce in a way that aligns our future capability needs with the development and aspirations of our people. Monitoring and responding to changes in our environment Across all of our work, we regularly assess how our environment is changing to identify trends, risks, and opportunities. We expect the following to influence our work for the foreseeable future: >The global economy – emerging labour markets, national protectionism, climate change mitigation, changes in how people buy goods and services, and the ongoing impacts from COVID-19 will affect New Zealand, including trade, the economy, and key industries. >The role of tax and transfers – citizens’ expectations of participation in and perceptions of the fairness of the system, and what other countries are considering. >Social change – a broad area that includes expectations of the Māori Treaty partner for the Māori Crown relationship, demographic changes including population growth and distribution, and shifts in attitudes and behaviours towards privacy, trust in public institutions, and the role of media and social media. >Increasing levels of inequality – the drivers of inequality and what this means for what we do and the outcomes we are expected to achieve. >The impact of technology changes on revenue collection – advances in technology are changing how people connect with each other, are enabling a wider range of participants to play a role in the revenue system, enabling businesses and whole sectors to change how they operate, and are shifting payment systems and transactions to the cloud. Cybercrime and terrorism will have implications for revenue collection. 22 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Customer and Compliance Services – Individuals >Makes tax compliance simpler by giving advice and support to individuals, families, tax agents and micro-business customers, including not-for-profit organisations. >Takes a ‘Right from the Start’ approach to assist our customers to get their interactions right, intervene early when they’re getting it wrong and takes action when people choose not to do the right thing.

Managing our organisation effectively It is essential that we continue to be a trusted, effective, and efficient government agency. We will continue to ensure our organisation and governance structure is fit for purpose and that any risks to our business are managed. Our organisational structure We are organised around our customers.

We regularly discuss and update our enterprise risks, and the triggers that could cause each risk to eventuate, the consequences that could result, and the controls in place to reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring and the consequences if it did. Our current enterprise risks are: STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 25 Our outcomes are the long-term results we want to achieve. Our customer outcomes show the difference we want to make. The measures for our three customer outcomes indicate our effectiveness in enabling our customers to get it right from the start. Our services are what we deliver for our customers and stakeholders.
