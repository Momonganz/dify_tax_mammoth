What you need to do based on your situation
-------------------------------------------

Whether you need to provide more information to us or not, is based on your situation.

### If you receive Working for Families payments

We send out most assessments by 7 June, however if we need more information it may take until 31 July. If the information is right, there’s nothing you need to do. You’ll need to contact us if the information is wrong.

You can do this in myIR.

[myIR](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/)

### If you have untaxed income, you will need to file an IR3

You’ll need to let us know about any income you’ve earned that has not had tax deducted by filing an IR3.

Returns are available to file from 1 April. If you use myIR, we'll email or text when your return is in your myIR and ready for you to file. If you do not use myIR, we'll send you a paper return by early April.

If you have a tax agent, get in touch with them first as they may file on your behalf.

### If your employer sorts your salary and wages

If you haven’t heard from us, this means we don’t need more information about your income from you and you should receive your income tax assessment by 7 June in myIR or later by post. 

If you’ve also received income that hasn’t been taxed yet, you will need to let us know and file an IR3 tax return.

### Melissa – gets Working for Families

After the end of the tax year, around June or July, we’ll send Melissa an income tax assessment. This will ask her to check the information we have about her income and family.

We don’t need to hear from Melissa if the information is right. She will need to contact us if it’s wrong.

For Melissa, if either her Working for Families or income tax assessment is a refund and the other is a bill, we will use the refund to pay the bill. She may still have a remaining bill to pay or refund after this.
