3 A portion of the 2021–22 Transformation appropriation funding was returned to the Crown and $35 million transferred to financial years 2022–23 and 2023–24 to the new Residual Activities Following the Transformation Programme’s Substantive Closure appropriation. 

4 PLA refers to appropriations established under a permanent legislative authority.

The budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing the departmental financial statements.
