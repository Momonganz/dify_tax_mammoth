### 5\. The Customer acknowledges that:

7.  If a recurring Direct Debit will exceed the amount of money the Customer owes the Initiator, the Initiator will adjust the last Direct Debit payment and only debit the Customer’s account with the amount of funds necessary to meet the Customer’s outstanding liability. These Instructions will remain in place until the Customer terminates them in accordance with clause 4(a).
