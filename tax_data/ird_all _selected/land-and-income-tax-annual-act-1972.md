This Act fixes the rates of land tax, income tax, excess retention tax and bonus issue tax for the year of assessment which began on 1 April 1972.

### Income Tax - Individuals

The rates to apply to income derived in the 1972/73 income year are those set out in Part D of the First Schedule to the principal Act. A general rebate of 7 1/2 percent of the tax calculated according to that basic scale is to be allowed.

### Income Tax - Companies

The rates to apply to income derived in the 1972/73 income year are those set out in Part-B (resident companies) and Part C (non-resident companies) of the First Schedule to the principal Act. Note that new Parts B and C are substituted by section 38 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1972 - see notes in this bulletin on section 38 of that Act.

### Land Tax - All Taxpayers

The basic rates of land tax for all classes of taxpayers are the same as those in force for last year. These are -

| Exceeds | $20,000 | but does not exceed $30,000 | 5/6 c |
| Exceeds | $30,000 | but does not exceed $40,000 | 1 1/4c |
| Exceeds | $40,000 | ... ... ... | 1 2/3c |

A rebate of 50% is allowed on tax assessed at these rates.

### Excess Retention Tax

The rate of excess retention tax remains the same at 35c in the $ on the amount of the insufficient distribution.

### Bonus Issue Tax

The rate of bonus issue tax remains the same at 17.5c in the $ on the amount of the bonus issue.

Note that under section 34 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1972 - explained earlier in this bulletin - the rate so fixed will also apply to bonus issues made on or after 1 April 1973 and before the passing of the Annual Act for 1973.
