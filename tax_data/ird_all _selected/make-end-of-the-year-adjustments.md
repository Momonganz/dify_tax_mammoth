Some types of income are adjusted when we work out your Working for Families entitlements and student loan repayments.

You can tell us about these types of income by completing the Adjust your income – IR215 form in myIR.

You can complete the form any time during the tax year or after it ends.

What happens next
-----------------

Once your income adjustment has processed, we’ll send you a notice of assessment showing if you’ve received the right Working for Families entitlement or paid the right amount of student loan for the year. You may receive a refund or have a payment to make.

If you adjust your income during the year, this may affect your Working for Families weekly or fortnightly entitlement, or your student loan interim repayments.
