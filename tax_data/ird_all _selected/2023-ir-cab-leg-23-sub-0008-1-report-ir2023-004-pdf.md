This report seeks your agreement to raise the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 6.71% to 7.89%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the quarter beginning 1 April 2023. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 4.78% to 6.71%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 January 2023. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 7.89% for December 2022 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 6.7 1% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer In Confidence IR2023/004: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 16 Fe bruary 2023, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 23 February 2023. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 16 February 2023. Revenue implications 12. Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 7.89% will increase the amount of net tax revenue that will be collected over the remainder of the 2022/23 fiscal year by approximately $0.56 million. The full year impact is estimated to be an increase in tax revenue of $2.23 million per year for subsequent years. $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 0.780 3.100 3.100 3.100 3.100 Company tax (0.220) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) Net revenue 0.560 2.230 2.230 2.230 2.230 Impact on operating balance (0.560) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) 13.
