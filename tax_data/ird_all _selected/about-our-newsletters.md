Important updates and notifications

Our important updates and notifications are sent as soon as an item is published on our website.

There are 5 types of notifications.

### Important Updates for tax agents

This service provides time sensitive information to tax agents to help them provide timely advice to their customers. Updates can include detailed guidance on tax system upgrades. We typically send between 10-40 messages per year.

Our Important Updates service complements the updates information and global alert banners published on our website. You can find important updates on the Tax Agents page and the Updates Index Page.

Our Important Updates format is a basic email template with the title 'Important Updates'.

The title of each important update is also listed within the News and Updates – Tax Agents Newsletter. If you only want to hear from us on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, you can subscribe to this newsletter instead. When an important update is published in these channels, a 'Closed' status is also displayed if the important update is no longer applicable. (For example, where a closing date has passed for a Covid resurgence application).

We keep 'closed' items so that you have a full record of any information we have provided to you.
