Trading in cryptoassets if you work full-time
---------------------------------------------

If you have a full-time job and spend some of your spare time buying and selling cryptoassets, you’re probably not a trader unless your activity is highly organised and structured.

Even if you’re not a trader, you’ll still need to pay tax on any gains if you bought your cryptoassets for the purpose of selling or exchanging them.

Cryptoassets that are not part of your trading business
-------------------------------------------------------

If you’re a trader you might have some cryptoassets that are separate from your trading business.

If you claim that cryptoassets you sold were not part of your trading business, you will need clear and compelling evidence to show that they were not part of your trading business when you both bought and sold them. 

If you hold cryptoassets that are not part of your trading business, you will still need to pay tax if you:

*   bought those cryptoassets to sell or exchange
*   are carrying on a profit-making scheme.
