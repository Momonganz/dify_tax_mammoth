Defined in this Act: company, consolidated group, group of companies Origin: FD 1 FM 2 The consolidation rules Purpose (1) The consolidation rules are intended to ensure that, unless a provision of this Act expressly provides otherwise or the context requires another result, this Act applies to companies in a consolidated group as if they were a single company.

Calculation for each company in group (2) For each company in a consolidated group for all or part of an income year, it is necessary to calculate the amount that would be its taxable income under subpart BC (Calculating and satisfying income tax liabilities) as modified by this section and sections FM 4 to FM 12, for the part of the income year in which the company is in the group. Joint and several liability (3) Each company in a consolidated group is jointly and severally liable for the amount of income tax assessed for the group in relation to the taxable income. Individual liability (4) The joint and several liability of each company in a consolidated group is substituted for their individual income tax liability, but only to the extent— (a) of the income tax liability of the group for the period of the income year in which the company is in the group; and (b) to which section FM 29 does not apply. Group return (5) The nominated company in a consolidated group must assess the amount of income tax and provide a single return of income for a tax year for the companies in the group in the corresponding income year. A group company cannot make a separate assessment or return for the tax year unless it is, for part of the corresponding income year, not part of the group. Credits (6) To determine whether credits are available to be offset against the income tax liability of a group for a tax year, the group is treated as if it were 1 company. Provisions setting limits (7) For the purposes of this Act, if a provision sets a limit or provides a threshold, and its application depends on whether or not something is more or less than the limit or threshold, the consolidated group is treated as if it were 1 company.

Approval by Commissioner (2) The Commissioner must approve a request under subsection (1) unless limiting the liability to the named companies will significantly prejudice the recovery, or likely recovery, of the income tax liability of the group for the tax year. Liability limited to named companies (3) For a tax year to which an approval referred to in subsection (2) relates,— (a) only a company named in the request is liable for the income tax liability of the group, and if more than 1 company is named, the liability is joint and several: (b) section MB 7(1) (Provisional tax of consolidated group members) does not impose on a company other than a named company joint and several liability for the amount of provisional tax payable by the group. When named companies fail to meet liability (4) Despite subsection (3), the joint and several liability of companies in the group other than the named company or companies is not extinguished to the extent to which— (a) a named company fails to satisfy their tax obligations under this section; and Part F - Recharacterisation 6 (b) the Commissioner determines that the income tax liability of the group that is attributable to the taxable income of a company other than a named company is to be recovered from that other company.
