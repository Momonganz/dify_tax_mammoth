Determination : Tax Depreciation Rates Provisional Determination Number PROV20
==============================================================================

Determination PROV20 (2010) sets a provisional depreciation rate for equestrian arenas consisting of permanent construction materials.

#### Equestrian Arenas: consisting of permanent construction materials - depreciation

* * *

The Commissioner has set a provisional depreciation rate for equestrian arenas consisting of permanent construction materials.

Equestrian arenas are made up of several layers. The first layer is a base course consisting of compacted and graded material such as rock, or rubble such as old bricks or roading material. This layer is permanent and does not come within the meaning of "depreciable property".

The next layer, the scalpings, is used to even out the base course. Sand and then a top course consisting of chopped rubber or similar material complete the arena.

Over a number of years the top three layers, (the scalpings, the sand and the top surface) will mingle and lose their separate properties. Eventually, it will be necessary to remove and replace these layers. This will not be the case with the base course which is likely to get better and more stable over time.

_Expense item_  
The top surface may degrade relatively quickly as the top three layers mingle. It may be necessary to top up this top surface from time to time as ongoing repairs and maintenance.
