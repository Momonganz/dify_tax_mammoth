Expense for a holiday home or bach used both privately and to earn income may be subject to the mixed-use asset rules. See the Rental income - IR264 booklet for more information.

You may claim repairs and maintenance but not additions or improvements to property or plant. Improvements to property or plant can be depreciated. If there is not enough space, please attach a separate note. Note 6 Depreciation on buildings From the 2011-2012 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an economic life of more than 50 years. For more information refer to Depreciation – a guide for businesses - IR260 Note 7 Depreciation on assets You may depreciate each item individually or pool some or all of the assets to calculate depreciation. Assets which can be pooled are those which: - are not used privately, and - cost $5,000 or less, or - have been depreciated so their adjusted tax value is $5,000 or less. Pool depreciation is calculated on the average pool value at a single rate using the DV method. The rate you must use for the pool is the lowest rate for an asset in the pool. Once you have included an asset in a pool you can segregate it only if you use the asset for private use. If you switch from the DV to the SL method for assets not pooled, calculate depreciation on the opening adjusted tax value instead of the original cost. To find the correct rate of depreciation for an asset, please see our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Note 8 Residential rental properties From the start of the 2019-2020 income year, deductions for residential rental properties are subject to residential property deduction rules. The new rules limit the amount of deductions you can claim if your residential rental property makes a loss in an income year. You can use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help you complete your return. Note 9 Record keeping Keep your receipts and invoices with your records in case we request them. You must keep all your records for seven years. Note 10 More information Our booklets Rental income - IR264, Depreciation - IR260 and Depreciation rates - IR265 may help you.
