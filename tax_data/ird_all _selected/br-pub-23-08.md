Goods and Services Tax – Payments made by parents to state and state integrated schools
=======================================================================================

GST is not chargeable on payments made by parents to the board of trustees of a state or state integrated school where the payments are made to assist the school with the cost of delivering education services which the student has a statutory entitlement to receive free of charge.

GST is chargeable on payments made for supplies of other goods or services that are not integral to the supply of education to which the student has a statutory entitlement, where that supply is conditional on the payment being made. This Ruling is a reissue of [BR Pub 18/06](/rulings/public/br-pub-1806-goods-and-services-tax-payments-made-by-parents-to-state-and-state-integrated-schools)
 which expired on 20 June 2023. It is substantially the same as BR Pub 18/06 but has been updated to reference the new Education and Training Act 2020 and the Ministry of Education’s revised Education Circular 2021/03.
