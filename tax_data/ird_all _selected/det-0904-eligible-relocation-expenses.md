### Schedule to Determination DET 09/04:

### List of eligible relocation expenses

This list sets out the types of expenditure that may be treated as exempt income when an employee is reimbursed, or the expenditure is paid on an employee's behalf, when the employee (including their immediate family) relocate their accommodation for employment purposes.

"Immediate family" includes the employee's partner, dependent children and any dependent adults that are part of the employee's household. A dependent adult might be a dependent parent of the employee or partner or a disabled relative for whom the employee or the employee's partner is the caregiver.

The costs should be reasonable in the circumstances and, where relevant, should be as if they had been calculated on an arms-length basis between third parties.

Where there is a time limit specified on an item, that limit will be assumed to have been met for payments made prior to the issue of this determination.

Furthermore, the time limit on a specific item is subject to the overall time limit set in the legislation (that is, expenditure must have been incurred by the end of the tax year following that in which the relocation occurred).
