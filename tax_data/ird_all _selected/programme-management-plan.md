purpose of the Programme Management Plan (PMP) is to serve as a key reference document for the Business Transformation (BT) Programme. It describes the programme management processes and activities and includes detail around scope, timeline, delivery methodologies and governance arrangements. It also sets out the responsibilities of the programme and how all these aspects will be managed. The PMP is an internal reference document which supports the programme in the successful execution of agreed scope and in achieving its key objectives. Further, the PMP is used as a key guiding document in the support and management of the programme’s key stakeholders. It is not intended to serve as a design document. The PMP is a living document throughout the life of the programme and will be updated on a regular basis as the programme changes and IR transforms. The following key documents should be read in conjunction with the PMP to gain full insight into the BT Programme. • Programme-level Benefits Management and Realisation Plan • Benefit Management Strategy • Programme Update and Detailed Business Case • Programme Business Case Addendum • BT Framework • BT Operating Model • Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) • Delivery Plan • Release 3 Scope • Release 4 Scope • Stage 4 Scope • BT Programme Change and Release Definitions Page 10 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Inland Revenue (IR) for the Future IR for the Future is the key strategic vision for the organisation and Business Transformation (BT) is integral to its execution and the outcomes it addresses. Te Pae Tawhiti, our te reo Māori name for IR for the future, literally translates as 'the distant horizon'. 2.1 Our Mission We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our mission is our cornerstone, and everything we do individually, as teams, and as an organisation, connects to it. 2.2 Our Vision Our vision is what we want IR to become: A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. IR for the Future focuses on three key areas – Our Purpose, Our Strategic Focus and Ourselves. Figure 1: IR for the Future Our Work/Our Priorities describes what is important for the organisation to focus on and achieve, and what everyone's contribution is in that. Figure 2: Our Work Figure 3: Our Priorities Page 11 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Delivering our future visual helps to tell our strategic story. It i s the companion piece to IR for the future. Figure 4: IR Delivering our Future Page 12 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Programme Background 3.1 Overview The Business Transformation (BT) Programme aims to realise the vision of, and deliver the capabilities required to meet, the strategic objectives outlined in IR for the Future. Delivering the BT will contribute to achieving growth in voluntary compliance and reduction of compliance costs for customers, while providing a foundation that supports Government policy changes in the future. 3.2 Critical Success Factors and Business Principles The Critical Success Factors and business principles that apply to BT are detailed below. These factors and principles form the key foundation for managing all elements of the programme. The business principles are: • the Programme will be business-led and endorsed • there will be a key focus on understanding and delivering the benefits committed. • there will be a key focus on ensuring that the solutions that are selected, developed and deployed are simple, robust, adaptive, and appropriate for, and approved by, the Inland Revenue • there will be a key focus on ensuring that the Programme supports the approved business strategy and target operating model • the establishment of effective governance for the Programme will be essential, and there will be a key focus on ensuring that these governance provisions are adhered to • there will be a key focus on providing effective and rigorous Programme management for all components of the Programme. The Programme management approach will provide for full transparency of all components and phases of the Programme, and will follow a strict entry/exit criteria approach with Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), and/or Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC), and/or Strategic Governance Board ( SGB) approvals for key dates • effective resourcing will be a major priority, including dedicated resources from the business, as well as key vendors • there will be a key focus on managing the organisational change process, including gaining effective stakeholder commitment and buy-in throughout the Programme • all elements of the Programme will be managed as an integrated Programme, under well-defined governance arrangements, and a single Programme Office and management regime • delivery of the Programme will be guided by an integrated Programme Delivery Method, which is compliant with the Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) approach; and • ensuring a balanced focus on the six key dimensions as summarised in the chart below. Figure 5: Business Transformations Critical Success Factors (click link) Page 13 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.3 Programme Constraints The major constraints which may affect the Programme are listed below. • Government priorities: The government’s legislative programme will continue to have implications for B usiness Transformation (BT) . IR will need to take government priorities and the legislative programme into account during programme planning activities. • Availability of resources: A vailability of resources with the right skills and expertise within IR, New Zealand or internationally. • Support two technology environments: As IR continues to transition to a new platform, it will need to support both FIRST and the new technology environment. • Information sharing: Sharing of information is limited by tax secrecy and privacy legislation. • Delegated authorities: IR must operate within delegated authorities and secure ministerial approvals as required in accordance with the agreed tolerances. • Impacts on Customers: A key consideration is ensuring that the impacts on customers are minimised. Maintaining service levels while delivering the programme will be a key planning consideration. • Limited change windows: Some changes may need to be aligned to business cycles and/or tax years. • Ability to handle change: T he capacity of Inland Revenue, customers and other stakeholders to absorb change. 3.4 Programme Assumptions The key assumptions identified for the programme are as follows: • Resourcing: The resources needed to support the critical path are in place. These resources, supported by subject matter experts and shared services in the wider business, have the capacity and capability needed to support a challenging timeframe for the completion of the current phase. • Ministerial decisions: Programme planning takes into consideration enough time to engage and consult with Ministers and all material is provided to the Central agencies and Ministers in accordance with agreed timeframes. All decisions that are required to support critical milestones are achieved. • Programme Governance: The Senior Responsible Office (SRO), P ortfolio Governance Committee (PGC), design forums will have the necessary Delegated Authority to support the execution of the current phase. The PGC provides an appropriate level of challenge and oversight to the programme, whilst allowing decisions to be made at the pace required. • Communications: A robust Communications Plan (high level), Media Plan and Stakeholder Plan are in place, along with the resources necessary to support these plans and effectively manage stakeholders and communications activities. • Sourcing: The programme maintains multiple sourcing channels and approaches. Existing MSAs are in place for our key business partners and service providers, and for these; SoWs will be put in place as appropriate. For new partners the programme will establish both MSAs and SoWs as required. For smaller and more direct sourcing, e.g. contractors, the programme will put in place individual contracts that are managed via People & Culture. • Tax and Social Policy: IR continues to remain accountable for the same set of tax and social policy products as today and should be prepared to assume accountability for administering additional products. • Agreed target state: IR for the Future is the desired end-state. BT is focused on delivering the operating model for IR (including technology platform), with the primary objective being to support the achievement of IR for the Future. Page 14 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Compliance Costs: The shifting of compliance and administration costs between Inland Revenue and taxpayers should only occur if there is a net overall gain for the betterment of New Zealand. • Legislation change: P olicy and legislation changes are defined, developed and approved on time, and can be implemented in line with the BT Programme roadmap. 3.4.1 Investment Objectives Through transformation, IR aims to achieve the following investment objectives: • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing our services. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. Business Transformation will enable a modern, customer-centric revenue system for New Zealanders. This investment in business transformation will deliver the following non- financial and financial benefit commitments: \[Information redacted\] Page 15 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5 Outcomes and Benefits Realisation Business Transformation is enabling IR to deliver significant benefits to the Crown, customers and the department itself. The 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case and the Programme-level Benefit Realisation Plan describe the benefits, measures and frequency of measurement in more detail. Links to these documents can be found in the PMP Appendices. 3.5.1 How we are measuring and reporting progress Three key outcomes are the measures of success against which we track our progress – these are: 1. Easier for customers 2. Reduced time and cost to implement policy 3. Inland Revenue is more efficient Progress is monitored through key performance indicators (KPIs) and outcome measures: • The KPIs track delivery progress against ten aspects of programme health, including benefits. These “10 keys” are reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue every month as part of the programme’s monthly status update. • The outcome measures track achievement of the investment objectives and realisation of benefits. These are reported in the Programme Business Case Addendum prepared by December each year and published on Inland Revenue’s website. Progress towards achieving the three outcomes is measured against several “lead and lag indicators” and through a series of case studies. The indicators and case studies are the basis for monitoring Inland Revenue’s progress in realising benefits and outcomes, as agreed with Joint Ministers and the central agencies. 3.5.1.1 External reporting Business Transformation is required to provide progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year. These updates are a key vehicle for reporting progress in realising benefits and any other material shifts. Ministers will make decisions about any trade-offs that may need to be considered which impact benefit realisation. Since 2018, Business Transformation prepares a Programme Business Case Addendum by December each year, to help to maintain traceability to the 2015 business case. The Addendum documents progress and any material changes to scope or other aspects of the 2015 business case. The annual Addendum also reports progress in realising benefits and outcomes against monitoring thresholds provided by lead and lag indicators. Transformation’s progress towards achieving these three key outcomes is measured against the “lead and lag” indicators (indicator thresholds for dollar benefit figures reflect lower benefit range) that were agreed with the central agencies and Joint Ministers in 2017. \[Information redacted\] Page 16 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5.1.2 Internal reporting Business Transformation (BT) benefit reporting aligns with Inland Revenue’s existing financial and business performance reporting cycles, and draws on enterprise data. Page 17 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.6 IR’s Future State Architecture The complete set of solution blueprints outlines how we will move the entire organisation from our current way of working to the way we will work in the future. Detail can be found on IR’s Business Solution Blueprints site which contains the executive summary, detailed blueprint and other documents for: • Core Tax and Social Policy • Customer Experience • Intelligence Led • Technology and Enterprise Integration • Organisation Design • Policy Business Transformation Vision: Green Paper • Enterprise Support Services • Technology Change and Operations Figure 7: IR’s Future State Architecture Page 18 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.7 Solution Architecture The Solution Architecture defines the target state technology architecture for IR at the end of BT. It represents the technology domains and sub-capabilities that will form the target state to provide technology services to IR staff and all its customers. The Solution Architecture diagram was originally developed in late 2015. Due to the large amount of Change that has been delivered through BT to date, as well as the forthcoming scope and developed thinking around the delivery of technology at IR (e.g. Cloud-first), the diagram has been updated to align with this. It includes input from architectural frameworks, roadmap changes and system/capability ownership changes etc. Figure 8: Future State Solution Architecture Mode Page 19 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.8 Enterprise Wide Change Management Effective Organisational Change Management (OCM) is essential across all stages of the Programme. Change Management discipline forms a core part of the approach. Up to and including Release 3, the Programme OCM Lead led enterprise wide change management through a horizontal integrated model with vertical, release-based delivery responsibilities, including new organisation design and deployment, people transition and capability uplift. With Release 3, the Programme reached a tipping point where change became managed directly through each of the releases, and enterprise wide change management responsibilities were unbundled across Release Change Lead roles. 3.8.1 Release Organisational Change Management From June 2019, all Change Leads/Managers work directly to their Programme Managers. BT will retain experienced change lead capability. A robust organisation change methodology will continue to guide change management within and across releases and this will continue to adapt and mature with the team. Change Leads will continue to act as a ‘networked team’ and be responsible for change integration across releases. \[Information redacted\] IR will be provided with ongoing independent advice through health check reviews on behalf of the Portfolio Governance Committee every six months. This will help ensure that the direction, change solutions and teams are on track and continue to be fit for purpose, and importantly will help IR stay true to its original change vision whilst at the same time working with IR to assess how well the release changes are embedding. Page 20 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.8.2 Organisation Design and Deployment In 2019, responsibility for completing and integrating the organisation transformation was transitioned to a Future Operating Model (FoM) team. The Future Operating Model is being led by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) with specific ELT members assigned to lead specific areas of focus, supported by the Future Operating Model team to provide organisation design support, role design, employment relations, management of change and communications. Underpinning the Future Operating Model is the principle of ELT collectively and visibly leading change, giving consistent and connected communication, and having groups implement at their own pace. 3.8.3 People Capability Uplift IR’s transformation business case recognised that a different approach would be needed to enable a transformed and future fit workforce that is adaptive to rapid and ongoing changes to customer demand, technology disruption and the future of work. The people capability uplift work originated from IR’s Organisation Design blueprint. The capability uplift work has focussed on identifying and developing capabilities IR needs into the future and using those as a basis for an integrated system of people practices and processes centred around empowerment, agility and adaptability. The 12 bespoke People Capabilities have been designed and integrated into IR’s organisational design and people practices – roles, performance, Learning & Development (L&D) and career development. IR people now have integrated tools and guidance to continue to develop and evolve their capabilities. From 2015/16 through to 2018/19, the people capability work has been funded by BT. Since 2017, People & Culture have been accountable for delivery. On 30 June 2019, BT investment concluded, and People & Culture became accountable for funding and the ongoing embedding and evolution of the capability approach. Page 21 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Programme Governance Effective execution of the programme requires focused and effective governance and management. This section introduces IR’s governance system and outlines the programme’s governance and management structures, including roles and responsibilities. 4.1 IR’s Executive Level Governance System The Governance function, which is part of the Governance and Ministerial Services team, has the following functions: •ownership and responsibility for the Executive Level Governance within IR. •provide independent advice to governance chairs and members and to people preparing items for them so that the governance system runs smoothly. •ensure that the information going to the Board and Committees is timely and clear, and that they’re being given a joined-up view from across IR. •make sure governance decisions are accurately recorded and appropriately shared. •provide advice to make sure the governance system changes over time so that it continues to meet the needs of the changing organisation. •support people who are bringing items to the Board and Committees, making sure the papers meet expectations and get good outcomes. •Provide a big-picture view and inform IR’s senior leaders to help them govern the organisation. IR's governance system divides responsibilities across four executive-level governance bodies, Strategic Governance Board, Technical Governance Committee, Portfolio Governance Committee and Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee. Underneath these sit a number of management-level governance bodies. These are usually responsible for specific programmes and projects or other aspects of IR's functional work. The Governance Do main Specialists will work with contributors and governance Chairs to ensure the right conversations are coming to the appropriate place. Refer to the diagram of the governance system to find out more. 4.1.1 Business Transformation Contribution BT is involved with the following IR executive governance meetings: •Strategic Governance Board (SGB): BT reports to the SGB on any elements of transformation that impact the strategic direction of the organisation, and SGB makes any high-level strategic decisions as required, including, any matters relating to scope, finances and benefits that are outside the delegations of the Programme or the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). •Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC): The PGC ensures the Programme is well managed from a cost/benefit, timeline, quality, risk and issues perspective and that the Programme is taking a customer-centric approach to transformation. BT reports monthly to the Committee. T he PMO Governance Advisor works with the Governance Domain Specialists on agenda items raised by the Programme and ensures documentation for the pack aligns to the PGC agenda. The PGC is attended by the DC Transformation and selected PLT members as applicable. •Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC): The EPPC provides an agile governance forum to allow for timely conversations. This Committee is responsible for monitoring the organisation’s performance, health and delivery of key initiatives and activities, including discussing key risks and issues. While BT delivery is governed primarily at PGC, BT will at times submit items to EPPC to test ideas and seek feedback. Such items may then need to be submitted to PGC for final approval. 4.2 Programme Governance groups and management forums An overview of the programme’s governance groups, and management forums is provided in the diagram below: Page 22 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 10: IR Governance & BT Operating Model Further programme governance detail can be found in the PMP Appendices Page 23 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.3 Executive Leadership 4.3.1 Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) Role In the role of SRO, the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) ensures that the assigned programme meets its investment objectives and delivers the benefit enablers. The SRO ensures that the Programme is prepared and reviewed at appropriate stages. The SRO also takes ownership of the business case. This role cannot be delegated. Responsibility As SRO, the CIR ensures IR allocates the necessary executive and financial commitment to the DC Transformation on behalf of the Programme. The SRO undertakes this role with the appropriate organisational accountability and power to maintain Programme momentum in a dynamic business environment. 4.3.2 Deputy Commissioner, Transformation Role The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is the appointed representative of IR and ensures that the day-to-day business decisions are made for the Programme. The primary responsibilities of this role is firstly as Programme Director with internal and external focus, the approving of programme deliverables on behalf of IR, taking overall responsibility for the timely delivery of IR’s obligations, allocating internal and contractor resources to the Programme, monitoring significant risks in conjunction with the Programme Manager(s), addressing of business issues escalated for resolution or escalating these issues for resolution to the PGC, approving and/or escalating PCRs, managing the overall Programme budget including internal costs, and reporting programme progress to the PGC. Responsibility The Deputy Commissioner, Transformation is responsible for: • overall leadership and day to day management of Programme, including internal communications, and status updates to PGC, and ELT members • ensuring that his colleagues on the ELT and the CIR are kept fully informed on progress, issues and risks associated with Transformation • development of Ministerial updates and expediting for approval • Ministerial stakeholder management • all procurement and sourcing of all products and services required • contract management of all service provider(s) contracted for the required products and services • programme and project management – focus on deadlines, deliverables, costs, and quality of solution • identification and management of issues and risks • driving the pace and schedule of the Programme • developing and enforcing programme methods and standards • business process definition • stakeholder management and communications • organisational impact assessment • organisational design • assistance with strategic integration of major change initiatives • learning and development (transactional change management and capability build) • design of BT interventions • aligning the Programme to business strategy • benefits tracking and realisation, including organisational effectiveness • coordination and control of communications and stakeholder management associated with the programme. Page 24 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.4 Programme Delivery Approach When Cabinet agreed to invest in transformation in November 2015, it noted that delivery would be achieved in four overlapping stages across a five-year period, completing delivery in 2021. These stages were/are: • Stage 1: Enabling secure digital services 2016-2017 • Stage 2: Streamline income and business tax processes from 2017 to 2019 • Stage 3: Streamline social policy delivery from 2018 to 2020 • Stage 4: Complete delivery of the future revenue system from 2019 to 2021. Following the successful implementation of Stage 1 (START for GST), the programme determined that taking a release-based approach for Stages 2 and 3 would ensure that ongoing implementation of the new tax and social policy changes were: • logically sequenced. • grouped to enable efficient use of resources; and • risk was minimised for the business and IR customers This “release” approach enabled the programme to deliver the T ax on Income products (Release 2: 2017 to 2018 and Release 3: 2018 to 2019) and at the same time deploy Working for Families, the first social policy product. This was followed by Release 4 for KiwiSaver & Student Loans from 2019 to 2020. The programme is now completing the final stage of transformation, Stage 4, and will formally close down at the conclusion of the Stage as planned. Stage 4, the overarching umbrella implementing change across five workstreams, is the final phase of the Business Transformation Programme and extends from 1 July 2020 to the end of June 2022. Most programme activity will be completed by the end of 2021, with the period in early 2022 focused on decommissioning, key data archiving initiatives and the final programme transition to business as usual, and programme closure activities. Figure 11: Stage 4 Workstream Overview Page 25 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The five workstreams that make up the final stage are: • Workstream 1 (WS1): START Delivery • Workstream 2 (WS2): Technology Optimisation & Decommissioning • Workstream 3 (WS3): Intelligence Led • Workstream 4 (WS4): Enterprise Support Services • Workstream 5 (WS5): Transition and Business Integration The delivery workstreams 1 to 3, will continue to deliver major, minor and independent “releases: • START major releases which includes all the necessary components to build out “end- to-end” the new tax and social policy solution); • START minor releases which could include enhancements to existing functionality or new functionality; or • Independent releases of supporting business or technical change that could include Organisation Model Implementation, Information Knowledge Management (IKM), Advanced Analytics, Digital Experience or Technology infrastructure. Workstream 4 delivering Human Capital Management and Enterprise Performance Management functions concluded work in June 2020. Workstream 5 is part of, but independent from programme delivery and is responsible for transition of enduring processes, frameworks and tools that IR will need to be successful post BT. This stream will also be responsible for closing out the BT Programme. 4.5 Programme Stage and Release Plan The release plan is Inland Revenue’s (IR’s) view of the sequence in which all taxes, services and entitlements will be moved to new systems and processes, thereby realising the programme objectives, and delivering the agreed benefits to IR. The release plan was endorsed by IR’s Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) on 24 August 2017. Figure 12: Programme Stage and Release Plan Page 26 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.5.1 Release Naming Scheme The release naming scheme has been developed to support the release structure and delivery sequencing. Figure 13: Release Naming Scheme 4.6 BT Release Sequencing and Planning Approach The following principles are taken into consideration when shaping the release scope and implementation sequence of the BT Programme: • Risk minimisation – business and technical • Ability to implement in the required time frame (do ability – size of release) • START major releases will be scheduled to align to an appropriate time frame based on the product and/or tax type affected • Initiatives will be implemented at appropriate times aligned to business requirements and to compliment the START solution taking into consideration START Major release windows • Business impact – allowing enough time between releases for change to “bed in” • Policy change considerations (timing of legislative change) • Aligned to achievement of benefits as early as possible • Enablement of the new organisation • Affordability The Programme Release Plan is reviewed at the end of each major release (or at least yearly) to ensure that the sequence remains logical, relevant, and appropriate. Page 27 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.7 Release Delivery Model Modernising the revenue system requires wide-ranging change as outlined in the Release Delivery Model. Figure 14: IR’s Transformation Release Delivery Model Page 28 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.8 Roles and Responsibilities 4.8.1 RACI Model: Solution Design and Delivery The following diagram provides a view of the RACI applied to the solution definition, design and delivery phases of the Release. The diagram provides at minimum the overarching positioning of the key roles and how these are fulfilled in the design and delivery phases of the Release. There are formal IR organisation job descriptions for these roles. Figure 15: Solution Design and Delivery RACI Page 29 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.9 Scope and Timeline The BT programme is being delivered in 4 Stages which commenced in early 2016 and due to conclude at the end of 2021: • START Delivery of the new Tax and Social Policy solutions commenced in 2016 with the key objective of safely migrating all tax & social policy products from the heritage FIRST system to the new START solution, implementing new legislation, including what we needs to be in place to support the government’s COVID-19 response, and Optimise the solution for already delivered products where there is clear and quantifiable benefit to do so (subject to business prioritisation); the solutions have been progressively delivered in Major releases as follows: o 2016 to 2017: Stage 1 - START Release 1 (GST) o 2017 to 2018: Stage 2 - START Release 2 (Tax on Income) o 2018 to 2019: Stage 3 - START Release 3 (Tax on Income & Working for Families) o 2019 to 2020: Stage 3 - START Release 4 (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and PAYE) o 2020 to 2021: Stage 4 – WS1: First Release (Paid Parental Leave, Unclaimed Money, Foreign Trusts, Duties) o 2020 to 2021: Stage 4 – WS1: Second Release (Child Support and START v12 Upgrade): this release will complete the START solution and enable the close out of FIRST and all satellite systems o 2021 to 2022: Stage 4 – WS2: Decommissioning and Data Archiving • Digital Experience initiatives are mainly aligned to the major releases and has responsibility for onboarding our partners to the new solutions and for partner testing across the broad ecosystem. • WS2: Technology Optimisation and Decommissioning is working to ensure that by 2021, IR’s technology landscape is simplified, stable and fit for purpose. Fit for purpose includes having fully supported up to date hardware and software. To do this we’ll physically decommission the Unisys Data Centre. This includes server, storage and network infrastructure, all production and non-production environments. This workstream will also look to ensure that production and non-production environments which remain post business transformation, are optimal and of a size to support business operations. It will also close out the programme as we decommission our old systems and platforms including FIRST, the Enterprise Data Warehouse, and \[INFORMATION REDACTED\]. Decommissioning started in 2017. • WS3: Intelligence Led (Intel Led) will be progressively deliver Content and Knowledge Management and the Information Hub functions during 2019-2021 and will continue working to bring together two distinct programmes of work – data and analytics – and – information and knowledge management – into one cohesive eco- system. The focus will be on accessibility, behaviours and capability uplift, to ensure we embed and continue to optimise intelligence-led activity across IR. • WS4: Enterprise Support Services (ESS) progressively delivered C orporate Functions, Finance, Human Resources and Procurement during 2019-2020. • WS5: Transition and Business Integration (T&BI) will take an enterprise wide view and focus on the support and transition of knowledge, practices, and processes back to the business, to enable the programme to wind down and the business to progressively take on the responsibility for delivering change. • Stage 4 OTHER release changes – BT will deliver additional tax and social policy changes and prioritised solution, process and processing Optimisation between 2019 to 2021, subject to stakeholder, business and legislative requirement. Page 30 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4.9.1 Confirming Stage 4 B enefits Building on the process used to validate Release 3 and Release 4 benefits, the Benefit Realisation Co-ordination Group (BRCG) has facilitated a process in mid-2020 and subsequently in February 2021 with subject matter experts and senior business group representatives to estimate and validate expected benefits from Stage 4. The BRCG is tasked by the ELT with: • Ensuring that the right people are involved in benefit realisation. • Ensuring there is clear identification of the business impacts from Releases. • Identifying any gaps. • Providing assurance to the ELT and ensuring that there is clarity on: - What is going to be different for customers and for Inland Revenue. - What level of benefit will be realised, by when and from which areas? - Any dependencies that are key to realising those benefits • Escalating any risks, issues or further detailed design and/or transition issues requiring ELT’s direction. The BRCG process seeks to ensure that there is a high level of business confidence in the benefit assumptions and estimates. Both the quantum and realisation timeframes will be tested, informed by the detailed design, legislative and process changes that will be introduced for Child Support in the programme’s final release in October 2021. Stage 4 benefits and accountability for their realisation will be confirmed by September/October 2021 and reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee and the Strategic Governance Board (for approval). This report-back will include a progress update against all benefit areas (financial and non-financial). The timeframe for report-back will enable the validated Stage 4 benefit estimates to inform the September sustainability update, the October Baseline Update and the 2021 Programme Business Case addendum. Page 31 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 BT Programme Cost Management The objective of these guidelines is to provide a consistent approach to the accommodation of costs incurred by the BT Programme and those incurred by business units in support of the BT Programme. 5.1 BT Programme Costs As per Inland Revenues standard project charging model, the BT Programme covers direct costs incurred by business units in support of programme deliverables, this includes: Internal resource costs – all staff that are formally assigned or seconded to BT via the BT Sourcing and Onboarding (SOF) approval process are to charge time to the programme using the IR time recording system. This includes permanent staff, fixed term hires, independent consultants, and temporary staff engaged directly by the BT Programme. External Professional Service costs – the costs of all Contractors/consultant firms engaged directly by the BT Programme. Programme Occupancy costs – standard IR fixed overhead charges recognising the costs incurred by Facilities management (rental, site support, cleaning) and TS&O (IR desktop & telephony access) to accommodate the BT Programme team. The monthly charge is based on the number of FTE’s assigned to the programme each month; this includes contractors and consultants who are in an IR site. Travel and accommodation – costs incurred directly in the execution of BT Programme deliverables, this includes the travel cost for IR SMEs or testers who are working for the programme. Training and development – costs associated with equipping staff that are directly affected by BT, including training on new and/or changed business processes, and training on new and/or changes to the enabling technology will be absorbed by the BT Programme. This will include the following: • Advanced subject matter and business skill training – training and development associated with advanced concepts required for impacted roles, for example root cause analysis, continuous improvement, analytics, negotiation skills, and influencing skills • Changes to business processes – including training on all changes to business processes affected by BT • Training in new enabling tools – including training in the selected COTS, \[INFORMATION REDACTED\], or any other new tools deployed as part of BT. Other expenses – costs incurred directly in the execution of Programme deliverables, examples include conference hall hire and catering for BT Programme events. Hardware and software – applications and hardware required to meet programme deliverables including physical and virtual server costs and programme management tools. Excludes ‘as a service cost. Warranty periods – costs incurred to accommodate 90 days warranty and Early Life Support after a Release Go-Live. Production Support – team to support START environment for past releases will remain in Programme until 2021. Page 32 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.2 Costs to be accommodated by IR Business Units Business Units cover the following indirect costs: Indirect Resource costs – business units will not recover the costs of staff who are not directly assigned or seconded to the BT Programme, this includes staff who are: • Involved in requirements gathering, user testing, governance or document review/approval (this includes the attendance at governance meetings, design councils, BOF meetings, CRP’s, workshops, or approval of BT design documents, or blueprints. Ongoing support costs - ongoing licence or maintenance charges initiated by BT workstreams will be transitioned to IR business units immediately. Training and Development – cost of professional development including: • Basic Literacy and Numeracy - Training and development associated with addressing basic literacy and numeracy, including basic computer literacy training • Foundation Skills - Training and development with foundation subject matter expertise, e.g., training associated with the fundamentals of service delivery management, where such training would be required regardless of whether BT were to proceed. Tools or software – costs of providing access to business units to tools or software that BT Programme has procured for use on the programme. 5.3 Baseline Cost Profile The Baseline is the approved fiscal envelope (budget) for BT to deliver transformational change. The budget for each Baseline, typically covering a 12-month period, is determined through a bottom-up process. It consists of the cost of the effort including other non- personnel related costs required to deliver the agreed scope of work for the specific period that each Baseline covers. The final baseline for the Programme that covers all of Stage 4 is Baseline 9 which is from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2022 (a two-y ear period). 5.4 Programme Delegations To ensure the appropriate decisions and approvals are provided within the Programme, Business Transformation adheres to strict guidelines in relation to financial delegations and other IR policy. Further detail on the Business Transformation delegated authorities can be found in the PMP Appendices. Page 33 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Programme Delivery Methodology and Management Approach 6.1 Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) To effectively manage the BT Programme, a Business Transformation Methodology (BTM) was developed. The methodology is a combined programme and project methodology that is tailored to meet the needs of each stage, release and initiative. The methodology aligns with recognised programme methodologies such as Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) and reflects the Treasury’s Better Business Case guidance. It also meets the criteria set for programme methodologies by Central Monitoring Agencies. The methodology has been developed in accordance with the following principles: One BTM • The BTM will apply to the programme, release and work package levels. • The methodology will be tailored to meet the needs of each specific stage, release and initiative work package, including the requirements for non-technical initiatives. • Any tailoring will be discussed and refined in consultation with partners before any variations are made. • For the Solution Delivery Phase, BTM will be complemented by \[Information redacted\]. • Detailed activities will be delivered using the approach and templates as outlined in ADM. Aligning to Managing Successful Programmes (MSP) • This methodology has been refined to align with MSP and the Treasury’s Better Business Case guidance. Drawing on existing IR Methodologies • Where the BTM can draw on existing IR products and processes, these will be used as a starting point, with amendments made where required supporting transformation. • Alignment between existing IR methodologies and the BTM has been achieved by aligning tools, templates and language where possible. All aspects of the programme and its sub-programmes will follow the BTM unless specifically agreed. Maintaining Agility • To complement the BTM, a more agile approach has been developed to support the Programme where appropriate and beneficial. A more agile methodology will help IR to deliver initiatives more quickly by increasing the frequency of delivery and IR’s ability to adapt to customer requirements. • Refer to the Business Transformation Methodology for further information on the Business Transformation Agile methodology. The development of the methodology included stakeholders and practitioners from the wider Change Group and compared a programme-level, transformation methodology with existing frameworks for the Change Initiative Lifecycle (CIL), System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Project Management Framework (PMF). The BTM has been amended to reflect aspects of these frameworks, including emphasis on the customer voice in Design, alignment with the Better Business Case process and adoption of relevant templates where they already existed within the business. Page 34 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.2 BT Programme Prioritisation Principles 2018 to 2021 The BT Release and Transition Plan sets out the delivery releases that will, when fully delivered in 2021, achieve the benefits laid out in the business case. As the programme delivery cycles progress there is a need to group then prioritise new and existing initiatives in a way that enables the programme to manage the planned releases within a major release window given the various contentions that will arise including resources and technology environments. Problem Statement • Large-scale time-based release cycles require a specified delivery scope that can be achieved in the agreed timeframe and aligned to a pre-determined go live date. Headroom should be planned to allow for changes to be accommodated during a major release cycle. • Scope orchestration needs to consider the best use of resources, balancing resource contentions and aligned to achieving the programme outcomes and benefits as quickly as possible. • IR needs to accelerate change where practical which means that non-START releases must be able to deliver in release windows that do not impact the major releases (will need to “shoot the gap”). This includes significant enhancement to customer experience and the delivery of digital services. • Between major START releases IR will leverage the delivered solutions to achieve our customer, digital and intelligence lead vision. Key Objectives & Success Criteria for 2018 and 2019: Priority Objectives: • Safely move the in-scope tax and social policy products from FIRST to START. Products will be implemented in START in a way that enables future policy and product agility • Working for Families recipients must have no disruptions to entitlements including being paid on time for the correct assessment amount as per the Feb 2019 roll over process • Most customers will use new MyIR instead of existing MyIR. New MyIR must be fit for purpose and offer the same or better service for individuals and smaller tax agents • Tax Agents must be able to close out the 2017 to 2018 tax year without disruption • E file users will still require this service and it must work in the same way as it does today • Customers with an income tax filing date of 7 July 2019 must be able to do all required activities in START in a timely manner without disruption • Payday reporting is compulsory from April 2019, all customers required to file on a payday basis must be able to do so by 1 April 2019. Electronic submission is compulsory for Payday reporting employers. • The CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisation units will be operational and embedding Key Objectives & Success Criteria for 2020 and 2021: Priority Objectives: • Safely move all the remaining in scope tax and social policy products from FIRST to START. • All products and services to be decommissioned in FIRST by July 2021 and the resulting systems and infrastructure closed. • Payday reporting is fully implemented and has completed a full business units. • There is no year-end square up required for employers from that point on. • Investment income reporting changes are implemented in 2020 enabling the straight through processing of investment income information for the 2021 income year. Page 35 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Most salary & wage earners and beneficiaries will be straight through processed based on tolerances from 2020 and increasingly from 2021. • All additional information required to complete the tax processing for more complex customers must be enabled through any channel that meets customer needs. • Working for families will be increasingly automated when new policy is approved and implemented this will enable the right amount to be paid without requiring a year end square up process. • The CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisation units will be fully operational and effective. • IRs policy and corporate services will be implementing new organisation designs. • Intelligence capability is fully enabled allowing IR to assess and deliver customer services to meet customer needs and to target campaigns appropriately. • Online services are fully available in multi device formats, with easily actioned summary views of information with easy access (barriers to access must be low). • All returns that do not require any additional information are pre-populated by the 2021 income year and straight through processed, information is enabled on multi devices 6.3 BT Scope and Design BT Scope is defined by PRODUCT, delivered using a PRODUCT based approach, requiring business functions, processes & technology to be transitioned safely, PRODUCT by PRODUCT to the new application platform. 6.3.1 Preparation Preparation for the major START Release includes completing a Product Strategy and Roadmap for each of the products being transitioned to START, F inancial estimates are updated providing a fresh view of the programme out year costs. Business profiles provide a view of the current state. Product strategies provide a view of the vision and desired outcomes, with the product roadmaps capturing the delivery of continuing, new, and emerging requirements, including policy, and delivering legislation. Business blueprints provide a view of the future state Cost to benefit analysis provides the must do, should do, could do view of scope. Collectively these documents and business artefacts inform the baseline scoping exercise. 6.3.2 Scope and Planning High level business requirements are gathered from the business profiles, product strategies, business roadmap documentation and the business blueprints. P roduct strategy overviews inform the outcomes for our Customers, Partners, the Government, and IR, using themes, guiding principles and desired features to form a view of scope. Work, opportunities, strategic and core business requirements, pain points and ideas are gathered into a backlog, the backlog is reviewed using a hypothesis statement, refined understanding, scaled assessment of benefit vs cost, detailed understanding of expected outcomes followed by review, prioritisation, orchestration, validation and finally approval from business and programme governance to form the baseline scope. 6.3.3 Definition / Design The Design Phase for each Release is split into two sub-phases: • High Level Design, and • Detailed Design. Page 36 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] During each subsequent phase of the programme, the High-Level Design will be validated, required updates will be made and the detailed designs developed for that release of work. Product designs (target business profiles), versioned by release, are developed, providing a time boxed release specific view of the c urrent state. These designs present the high-level solution target state, Big Rock’s (design decisions, policy items, external integration definition), k ey items, a pproved characteristics, features, and functions targeted for change. The design captures the current issues and business pain points and identifies opportunities. At the end of the Release there is an activity to update to reflect the “as built” or the “new current state” Product Designs are used to develop the Solution Designs per jellybean or Business Function De finitions (BFD’s). BFD’s are release specific detailed solution requirements, p oint in time definitions, mapped to level 3 processes and contain; Business Rules, Coexistence approach, Customer Impact, Channel Impact, Key Business Process Considerations, Organisation Impact, Technical Integration, Service Area: Assumptions, Definition, Actors, Preconditions, Metrics, Triggers, Conditions, Systems, Correspondence, Content and Reports, etc. The B FD d efines the business function scope which informs Test Scenarios & Change Plan, further key Delivery phase artefacts. \[Information redacted\] Figure 16: Scope to Design Process 6.3.4 Enhancing the Design Approach To ensure optimal solution delivery, aligned to customer and business outcomes, delivering strategic objectives, f ocus areas include ensuring that: • Customers are closer to the design and included earlier in the design process • The design for each Release is aligned to achieving the transformational outcomes and benefits set out in the Business Blueprints and Product Designs • The right people are involved in design decision making at the right time • A mechanism and process are in place to capture design decisions, and escalate promptly at the right time based on risk 6.3.5 Applying the learnings Customer and Digital Design (CX, DX) • Develop an integrated end-to-end customer & digital experience design across all channels to compliment the FAST Implementation Methodology. IR’s Channel Strategy and Customer Blueprint are key inputs. • Design to align to Customers preferred channels & contact points. Customer research, journey maps and voice of the customer outputs are an input to the design of inbound and outbound customer contact points. • Future design of customer interactions will be part of the integrated customer design regardless of the form or substance of that interaction (e.g. forms, letters, web content, emails, text messaging, IVR, click to chat). Business Architecture and Design • Ensure that the right people are involved in the Definition and Design working sessions that includes an appropriate representation especially in the CX, DX design area. Page 37 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Everyone involved in definition and design to be fully versed in the Business Blueprints and the transformational objectives of those blueprints. Blueprints will be updated to show transitional states (by major release). • Ensure that everyone involved in the design process has a pre-requisite knowledge of customers and the customers’ scenarios of use that they are designing to. That’s both internal and external customers. This will be achieved via design immersion sessions at the commencement of definition and design and at key points during. • Design decisions are currently logged during the definition sessions in addition decision review points will be scheduled regularly and be highly visible including weekly design review and design review workshops. Escalation criteria will be clear – propose that the Business Blueprints and the customer scenarios of use be the basis for setting design parameters. 6.4 \[Information redacted\] BTM is complemented by the supplier delivery methods and implementation methodology 6.4.1 \[Information redacted\] 6.4.2 \[Information redacted\] 6.5 Programme Management Approach The Programme’s BTM incorporates core programme management approaches that are used to successfully execute the Programme. These are fully aligned with the MSP Framework. Programme management approaches are applied consistently across all phases of the programme. 6.5.1 Overview Below is an overview of the key aspects of BT’s programme management approach. These approaches are discussed in more detail throughout the document. 6.5.1.1 Planning and Control • There is visibility and accountability for schedule, cost, quality and benefit targets through periodic status reporting and communication to stakeholders. • The programme places an emphasis on the management of project scope through setting agreed baselines at the outset of the Programme and managing deviations through a formal review and approval process. • Deliverable based management has been adopted, involving clearly defined deliverable structure/content, defined review and approval procedures and deliverable based progress tracking. • The Programme follows organisational financial policies and procedures, which are maintained by Performance, Finance and Facilities. These can be found on the Planning and Finance page on the intranet. 6.5.1.2 Finance and Budget Management • In November 2015 the Programme secured a funding envelope for all four stages from Cabinet, including a contingency. • The Strategic Governance Board approved the baseline scope of Stage 4 – the final stage – of the Programme and the funding for this stage in July 2020. • Budgets are allocated by work-stream with an overall contingency held at the Programme level. • Programme leads are accountable for managing within their work-stream budget. Any forecast deviations are managed through a formal review and approval process. Page 38 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Budgeting & Forecasting support and financial advice is provided by the Portfolio finance team. • The Programme provides a comprehensive report to the Portfolio Governance Committee each month on the overall financial position. This includes analysis of actual results and forecast outturn for the budget period. Financial Risks and opportunities outside of Forecast as also analysed. • Formal review and escalation approval are required by the appropriate governance board to access internal contingency. 6.5.1.3 Risk and Issue Management • The Programme has established risk and issue management practices to ensure that risks and issues : o are identified, analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis o information is reported, prioritised and escalated by all workstreams within the Programme and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies in a timely manner. • The Programme has adopted and applied the IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMP/F), which includes the Risk Management Process as described by ISO 31000:20009 a nd ISO Guide 73:2009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks. • All risks and issues of the Programme captured and managed in JIRA. 6.5.1.4 Quality Management • Quality management frameworks and processes are in place to provide a considered and consistent approach to managing the quality of delivery within the programme and to reduce risk. • The Programme has an Assurance Management Plan, which includes the key independent external quality assurance reviews to be undertaken. The Assurance Management Plan is updated regularly. 6.5.1.5 Communications and Stakeholder Management • Messaging is consistent inside and outside of the Programme. • Risks that might otherwise delay or derail the Programme are identified and mitigated through effective communications strategies and stakeholder management. • Positive outcomes are achieved by effectively building stakeholder relationships, with the ability to influence outcomes. 6.5.1.6 Organisational Change Management • BT impacts and changes are understood and validated by relevant Business Groups. • IR’s readiness for change is understood and change strategies developed to manage, mitigate, and address change impacts, issues and risks. • The implementation of solutions and the realisation of benefits are supported by effective change management strategies. • Appropriate organisational structures and resources are in place to effectively support change. 6.6 General Implementation Approaches The Programme maintains a set of general approaches in key delivery areas to ensure consistent application throughout Business Transformation. \[Information redacted\] Page 39 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 19: Design to Test Process 6.6.1 Data Cleansing, Conversion and Migration Approach The primary goal of the data conversion and cleansing approach is to deliver the data conversion and necessary data cleansing activities required to successfully deliver Stage 4 and enable the realisation of benefits from the Business Transformation Programme. 6.6.1.1 Inventory Data Resources Identify and inventory all possible FIRST data sources and other product specific sources. Other conversion activities typically cannot be started until this inventory has been created. The inventory will define the scope of agency data that is available for conversion. 6.6.1.2 Creating the inventory In addition to identifying sources of data for potential conversion, information useful for further actions should be collected. This information will include but will not be limited to: • Types of information such registration or financial information • Inland Revenue personnel such as subject matter experts with expertise regarding specific data • Technology and platforms used for data storage. This task will be done for each release. 6.6.1.3 Reviewing the inventory for integrity and quality Once the inventory has been created and other conversion activities can continue, each data source should be examined for integrity and the quality of its data. This process should seek to determine if the data in the resource is a master data source and is consistent, reliable, and complete. This process will require the conversion team to be granted access to the resources inventoried. If granting access requires a protracted process and an extended amount of time, then it may be necessary to include others in the conversion team who currently have access. 6.6.1.4 Conversion Process The standard START conversion process entails • Obtaining data extracts from the source systems. • Translation of data extracted from source systems to be loaded into START. • Data loads into START via business objects tailored for Inland Revenue business needs. • Reconciliation of data converted to START. • User verification and testing of data when it arrives in START. • Data purification in the source system. Page 40 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 20: Data conversion process for START 6.6.1.5 User verification While computer-based reconciliation of data extracted and loaded into START is necessary, it is insufficient to verify an accurate conversion. During user verification of converted data, knowledgeable users will view converted data in START and compare it to how it appears and is used in the source systems. This stage will greatly increase the confidence in the conversion process and can identify, for instance, incidents of data elements being converted into the wrong field on a return. As users identify issues with the converted data those issues will be logged and triaged and may lead to changes in the conversion plan. It is typical to find issues that will lead to changes in: • Data purification • Training and START Help • START development. 6.6.1.6 Mock Conversion Runs NOTE: This section addresses mock conversion runs not Mock Go-Lives. Mock conversion runs occur more frequently and earlier than Mock Go-Lives (MGLs). Because the conversion process will be a one-time use, it must be tested and trusted. To provide that high degree of trust a series of iterative mock conversions will be completed. A mock conversion, sometimes referred to as a mock run or dry run, will test the conversion process by performing the same steps as will occur during the final live conversion. Mock conversions will include extraction, translation, conversion, reconciliation, and user verification. Mock conversion runs will be executed iteratively and start as partial mock conversion runs and slowly ramp up to full mock conversion runs. A partial mock conversion run lacks either some type of data to be converted or uses limited selection criteria. A full mock conversion run contains all types of data and all data available. Successive mock conversion runs will increase the breadth and/or depth of data in “step” fashion as START configuration for each step becomes more advanced. For example, some steps will include: • Customer level data • Customer and Account level data • Customer, Accounts, and Period level data • Customer, Accounts, Period, and Collection data. Page 41 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] It is important that mock conversion runs use, as close as possible, the actual steps, data, infrastructure, and users that will be involved in the final conversion. This will confirm that the conversion process is accurate, complete, and efficient. Mock conversion runs will verify the following: • The steps in the conversion process are correct and in the proper order • Data is being converted correctly • Assumptions regarding data volumes • The timing of conversion events including but not limited to: • Length of time required for the final full conversion is run • Pre-conversion and post conversion batch jobs in START • Prioritisation and sequencing of reconciliation tasks. • The adequate allocation of hardware resources for conversion. 6.6.2 Testing Approach The approach and procedures for all phases of testing within the Programme is described in the Test Strategy and Plan. Below is a summary of key objectives and test phases for the Programme. BT Programme testing will consist of the following test phases: 6.6.2.1 Functional Testing • Unit/Verification Testing to ensure that field, screen, individual component and modules within each system perform according to the detailed design before promoting the change to the subsequent phases of testing. For START the verification component is where business users are engaged in development iterations. • System Testing or Business System Testing (BST) to ensure that the functional modules and workflow components of the applications perform together according to the test scenarios. Business System Testing includes regression testing of impacted applications or business process. Testing with Converted Data is included inside the BST test phase where applicable. Assembly testing of the interaction of code in is also included in this test phase where applicable. • Integration Testing is where testing is undertaken in a fully integrated domain in a manner like the context of use in the business environment. Integration testing is carried out during business system testing. The scope of testing will be scenario centric aligning to the integrated design across multiple systems. Integration Testing includes regression testing in the integrated context. • Scaled Business Simulation (SBS) Testing covers testing of the conversion, launch sequence and subsequent business processing following launch. The testing is equivalent to an “end-to-end integration test” in a full-scale environment. The testing includes simulated business activity using manual and automated methods. The testing will “time-travel” to significant business events such as GST filing dates to validate the business processing of those events. SBS may include end- to-end testing contexts as part of the SBS scenarios, however testing of integration points will have been completed during business systems test. • Customer Interaction Testing (CIT) will be undertaken to ensure that the user experience is not negatively impacted by the programme. • User Acceptance Testing will be conducted by end users to confirm that the application and associated business processes will fulfil the business requirements. Where business have been engaged in testing earlier phases, it is expected that this phase will reconcile any earlier testing and feed UAT scope into those phases. UAT for the START solution will be integrated as part of BST and SBS and not run as a separate test phase. Page 42 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Final Regression Testing will be conducted on a controlled launch configuration, this testing ensures the final launch configuration is stable and complete. The testing conducted is a selection of Business System Test and Integration Test scenarios. • Functional Security Testing ensures that only authorised users have access to features of a system, and that the users have access to the functionality they need to perform their assigned duties and no more. This testing includes testing user access delegation functions. User access rights creation, updates and deletion will also be tested. • Conversion Verification is the visual inspection of data that has been extracted from the heritage systems and converted into START. START conversion team extracts a new set of data to be verified at weekly intervals and provide checklists that conversion verifiers use to perform the verification in START Verification environment. Progress is reported to Data Owners Forum (DOF). 6.6.2.2 Non-Functional Testing/Technical Testing • Infrastructure Testing covers the non-functional of the production and non- production infrastructure. Infrastructure Testing includes Environment Provisioning, high availability, networking, monitoring, security and backup/restore. Applies to the BT Tech Arch Delivery Programme. Environment Provisioning Testing is a construct of Infrastructure Testing. • Performance Testing will be conducted to verify performance requirements have been achieved. The response times, transaction rates and other time-sensitive requirements of the solution will be measured and evaluated to identify performance tuning opportunities. Testing may extend to other non-functional aspects such as high availability or monitoring. Performance testing will be managed at scale by the technical testing capability. • Security Testing will be performed by an Inland Revenue security service provider and the delivery service providers, the purpose of security testing is to verify that the delivered solution conforms to the Inland Revenue and government minimum security standards (such as NZISM) and addresses the risk identified within the Information Security Risk Assessment through the implementation of the identified controls. Security testing includes both functional testing and compliance testing leading to the Certification and Accreditation of the BT systems as fit for deployment in production. • Disaster Recovery will be conducted to validate that disaster recovery plan can be executed. • Operational Readiness to validate the deployment and operational tasks. This includes testing of operational functions such as Database backup, Database recovery, Software Installation and Configuration, Rollback, Failover, Supportability, Reliability, and Maintainability. Phase entry and exit criteria allows for test phase overlaps within the bounds of the criteria. Entry Criteria provide the basis for controlling the entry of code into the test environment for test execution. This formal process helps to ensure the appropriate level of quality is achieved to commence testing. There is an intentional move away from the traditional approach of a full completion of a test phase before entry into the next phase, the approach allows for concurrency using criteria that measures working software at a functional level. Entry Criteria is measured by way of Test Readiness Assessment. Exit Criteria are used to ensure that functionality does not exit a test phase until an appropriate level of quality has been achieved. For further information on the approach to testing within BT please read the Stage 4 Stream 1 - Release 2 - Test Approach.pptx and the D3083 Test Patterns and Standards. Page 43 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.6.3 Organisational Change Management Approach Effective Organisation Change Management is essential across all stages of the Programme. In accordance with the Business Transformation Methodology, Change Management discipline forms a core part of the approach. Our Change Management approach and methodology continues to evolve applying lessons learnt from previous stages and aligning to the programme operating model. 6.6.3.1 Organisation Impact Assessments and Change Management Each stage and release will have dedicated impact assessments to identify and manage impacts to IR and customers as we traverse the four stages of transformation. Due to the agile nature of the FAST Implementation Methodology and BT Operating Model, identification and planning for these impacts will be iterative as design and solution decisions are made progressively. Our impact assessments and change management plans continue to be the cornerstones of our approach. Specifically: • Understand the change impacts to tax, social policy, processes, platforms and people and validate with relevant Business Groups • Understand IR’s readiness for change and develop and implement business unit and initiative plans to manage, mitigate and address change impacts, issues and risks • Support the implementation of solutions and the realisation of benefits with effective change management strategy and plans • Put in place appropriate resources and methodologies to effectively support change. Stage 4 Workstream 1 (START Delivery) includes safely moving paid parental leave, unclaimed monies, duties and foreign trusts into START in February 2021, followed by child support and upgrading START and myIR to V12 in October 2021. All core tax and social policy products and services will be in START enabling the decommission of FIRST. There will be no co-existence. For example, this high level heatmap provides an early indicative view (as at June 2020) of the organisation impacts based on proposed Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) scope. Figure 21: Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) indicative organisation impacts Page 44 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 4 Workstream 2 (Technology Optimisation & Decommissioning) also includes the decommissioning of all non–enduring (heritage) services, systems and applications including FIRST and all satellite processes and functions, Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and moving \[INFORMATION REDACTED\]. Data will also be tagged for retention, archiving or disposal in line with legislative requirements as set out in IR’s Data Disposal Authorities. Workstream 2 will ensure IR will have a simplified and stable set of services and infrastructure post-BT. 6.6.3.2 Training and User Support The approach to training and user support has been developed and refined each release taking on board lessons learned and adapting to business requirements. The Programme’s Training and Organisational Change Management approach consists of comprehensive yet pragmatic strategies that aim to: • Accelerate acceptance and adoption of the new systems and processes using proven adult learning methods • Maximise the business benefits expected from the solution • Minimise disruption to business operations and/or lost productivity during execution. 6.6.3.3 Customer Impact Assessments and Change Management During the Solution Design and Delivery phases of each stage, the impacts of changing policy, solutions and deployment activities on all affected customers will also be assessed, and clear mitigation and engagement plans established to ensure that such impacts are well understood, effectively communicated, and effectively mitigated. Specifically: • Identify the customer impacts and changes brought about by the business transformation changes, and validate these with relevant Customer Groups and External Parties • Test and understand the Customer and External Parties’ readiness for change and develop and implement plans to understand and facilitate customer willingness, confidence, and ability to accept change. This high-level heat-map provides an early indicative view (as at June 2020) of the customer impacts based on Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) scope. Page 45 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 22: Stage 4 START Delivery (Core Completion) indicative impacts on customers. Page 46 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6.6.4 Programme Readiness Assessment The evaluation of programme delivery in accordance with the BTM will be provided through the following mechanisms: • Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and programme health checks (refer Assurance Management Plan. • Oversight of the programme by the SRO and governance groups • Management and oversight from the DC Transformation and PLT Leaders and • Programme Readiness Checkpoints • Evaluation of programme progress against the programme schedule will be assessed using the following tools: o weekly updates to Schedule Performance. o weekly updates to the High-Level Timeline by each PLT and workstream lead. o fortnightly/monthly RAG status reporting against the 10 Keys for Success at a workstream and programme-level against agreed criteria. 6.6.4.1 Readiness Framework Quality Control The Readiness Framework outlines the approach, content and review cadence used to assess release readiness at key checkpoints leading up to and during deployment. The framework enables the Release to complete the assessment against agreed criteria and recommend approval to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the next. These criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and collectively reflect the readiness of our Customers, Service Providers, Business Units, and the Release Delivery team. The Readiness Framework enables the release to assess quality, progress, and readiness to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the next. • Checkpoint 0: “Aligned” • Checkpoint 1: “Aware/Understand” • Checkpoint 2: “On Track” • Checkpoint 3: “Ready” • Checkpoint 4: “Approve” • Checkpoint 5: “Check” • Checkpoint 6: “Exit” There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline and additional checkpoints will be included as required to provide both assessment and certainty for decision makers. Refer example below. Figure 23: BT Readiness Framework Page 47 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 Programme Structure The high-level current structure for the BT Programme can be viewed below. \[Information redacted\] Figure 24: Business Transformation Organisational Structure Page 48 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 Stakeholder Management 8.1 Managing our Communications and Stakeholders IR recognises that effective communication and stakeholder engagement is critical for achieving organisational change and delivering customer benefits. Business Transformation represents a significant cultural shift for IR and has significant customer impacts, hence the requirement for delivery of consistent, unified messages to stakeholders as part of the organisational change journey. The importance of effective communications and stakeholder management across all stages is reflected in the Business Transformation Methodology and the following objectives are set out within the methodology for effective communications and stakeholder management: • Ensure consistency of messaging within the Programme, within the organisation and to stakeholders outside the organisation • Support the effective mitigation of risks and management of issues which may otherwise delay or potentially derail the Programme • Achieve influence and positive outcomes through effective management of relationships directly and by providing collateral and appropriate support for the account management and relationship management teams • Ensure internal and external change management activities are supported by robust communications strategies and plans. The below diagram shows how the activities are layered: Figure 25: High-level overview of the Business Transformation communications plan Page 49 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8.2 Customers For IR’s Business Transformation to be effective we need to actively manage a variety of different customer segments including: • Customers (both individual and businesses of all sizes) • Service Providers who offer support to our customers to fulfil their obligations (such as tax agents, payroll providers and software developers) • the wider Government sector (both as an enabler and influencer) • Suppliers and Partners whose products we can leverage to support IR ‘s goals and obligations. Figure 26: Customer segments 8.3 Account Management Approach The BT Account Management team is the primary conduit for managing external customer and stakeholder relationships in Business Transformation to ensure delivery of IR’s Business Transformation programme objectives. This is achieved by establishing and maintaining successful engagements with customers (and/or their advocacy groups) who are impacted by IR’s transformation and by providing a channel for their feedback directly to the programme. Account Management: • through successful engagement, understand our customers future plans and requirements, assist their understanding and engagement with IR’s transformation objectives and explore how they will be impacted • engage, advise and support customers when BT changes impact them • use their deep understanding of the customer to ensure the customer voice is heard when design/solutions are being considered • provide feedback within BT on customer’s issues and concerns with change driven by BT • work alongside our customers and the programme teams to stay on track to deliver the outcomes we have agreed Page 50 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • work alongside teams within BT and across the business to support customers impacted by BT changes and to make sure the right transformation messages are shared across all customer segments. BT Account Management work very closely with the business (Community Compliance Officers and Account Managers, Business Lifecycle Managers, External Relationships unit and other business units within IR) and within the BT Programme with the Communications and Marketing teams. BT Account Managers work alongside these existing teams to make sure: • operational teams have the right transformation messages to share with customers • impacted customers are clear about the operational vs. transformational roles • provide support across the business. For each release of the BT Programme, Account Management Strategies for each customer segments have been produced, these point-in-time views are further refined in subsequent iterations of the strategy document. The most recent Account Management Strategy is available on the BT SharePoint site. Page 51 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 Programme Reporting 9.1 The 10 Keys to Success - Management Approach With respect to effective planning and control of the programme, the “10 Keys” programme management framework is employed, focusing on providing proactive and transparent planning, baselining and status reporting. This framework ensures: • early indication of the Programme’s health • timely information, insights and inputs to adjust plans and behaviours. Milestones/ Deliverables/Plan Risks Scope ResourcesStakeholders Issues Delivery Partnerships Interdependencies Benefits Financials 10 Keys to Success Figure 27: Business Transformation 10 Keys to Success for Reporting The following 10 Keys to Success are considered and reported on throughout the life the programme: 1. Confirm stakeholders are committed This key is aimed at identifying, evaluating, informing, influencing and maintaining support by individuals and groups affected by or influencing the Programme. 2. Ensure the Programme scope is manageable This key is aimed at agreeing, managing and modifying, as required, the scope of work needed to be delivered to accomplish the investment objectives. 3. Plan so work, and schedule are predictable This key is focused on controlling the production and acceptance of programme services/deliverables and ensuring delivery is compliant with acceptance criteria and Delegated Authorities. A high emphasis is placed on the programme plan and ensuring that this is realistic and documents the major milestones and deliverables for all phases. 4. Ensure cost is managed and on track This key is aimed at maintaining an up to date programme forecast as well as measuring, managing and reporting actual costs in relation to the approved budget. 5. Mobilising and directing high performance teams This key is aimed at identifying, recruiting, mobilising, structuring, leading and motivating the people necessary for successful completion. Page 52 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6. Mitigate risks This key is focused on risk identification, evaluation and development of avoidance, mitigation and other activities to effectively manage these and minimise impacts on the programme. 7. Mitigate issues This key is focused on issue identification, evaluation and development of avoidance, mitigation and other activities to effectively manage these and minimise impacts on the programme. 8. Support mutually beneficial partnerships This key is aimed at establishing and managing meaningful and effective relationships with key delivery partners, based on sound contracts and contract management processes. 9. Realise benefits This key is focused on estimating, measuring, monitoring and realising benefits to the Crown, customers and IR to be enabled by the Programme. 10. Coordinate Dependent Projects This key is aimed at identifying, planning, coordinating and controlling all projects which have a high level of dependence within and outside the Programme. 9.1.1 RAG Status Guidelines The Programme follows the BT Workstream Reporting Guidelines on the use of Red Amber Green (RAG) status when reporting progress and status at workstream and programme- level. This includes how the programme reports to key stakeholders such as the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC), Central Agencies and Ministers. 9.2 Monthly PGC Dashboards The PGC dashboard presents a monthly programme level report providing: • overall Red Amber Green (RAG) status and schedule performance for BT • key messages to the PGC (opportunities, escalations, special notes, required decisions, requests for direction, etc.) • go -to-green plans for areas requiring remedial action to get back on track or trending to exception (Amber status or worse) • programme-level (PLT and PGC) level risks and /or issues under escalation management • a rolling eight-week window of key activities/dates to provide an inform to the PGC of the future focus of the programme. 9.3 Stage Delivery Leads Meeting The BT Weekly Watch JIRA Kanban board is used for reporting to the Stage Delivery Leads meeting. This provides three swim lanes of information for day to day action/monitoring and weekly review. • Swimlane 1: E scalated items requiring special attention and rapid decision making or active monitoring • Swimlane 2: Issues, Risks, Dependencies, Programme Change Requests PCR’s) and Deliverables that have been escalated to the PLT or PGC that are at either very high or extreme severity rating, or that have not progressed adequately. • Swimlane 3: Any unresolved Risks or Issues at PLT or PGC escalation. 9.4 Workstream Reports Workstream reports are prepared either monthly (support teams) or fortnightly (delivery teams) providing overall Red Amber Green (RAG) status and schedule performance for the Page 53 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] period, together with commentary against the keys, explaining movement, with reference to those in or trending towards exception (Light Amber or worse). Where the overall status is in or trending towards exception, go-to–green plans are provided including the impact these will have on the schedule, their status, required resources, risk and a measure of confidence in the plan’s success. These are particularly important as they may be replicated into the programme dashboard as relevant. Lastly the report includes a rolling eight-week window of key activities, dates and deliverables due (set out in the Master Deliverables List and integrated programme schedule) with RAG and completion status commentary. A section is available within the report for any escalations, special notes and/or required decisions. Workstream classification (support or delivery) can be found within the PMO reporting flow diagram. 9.5 Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) and Central Monitoring Agencies Reports Reports are completed for the PGC on a monthly basis and provided to Central Agencies bi - monthly. An extended detailed version of the PGC dashboard, focussed on the 10 keys and including workstream reports, is then provided to Central Monitoring Agencies and used as a discussion point at regular monitoring meetings. Central Monitoring Agencies also receive the monthly progress report to Joint Ministers and the latest copy of the monthly PGC Risks and Issues. 9.6 Transformation Updates Inland Revenue has been directed to provide updates on transformation to Cabinet by July and December each year. The updates are the principal vehicle for reporting on Inland Revenue’s progress in realising benefits. Once considered, these six monthly Cabinet updates are published on Inland Revenue’s website. 9.7 BT Monthly Status Report for Joint Ministers This report provides an overview of Programme progress monthly. The report provides Joint Ministers with an updated on the following areas: • progress against the plan • the current Phase of work • highlights and challenges. For further information on reporting, please refer to the BT Reporting SharePoint site. Page 54 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 Schedule Management Schedule management is critical to managing delivery across the workstreams within the Programme. It is the aim of the following schedule management process to establish a clear and defined scheduling process for monitoring key milestones and deliverables across the Programme. Specifically, the process aims to: • prepare all schedules in the same format with appropriate interdependencies, linkages and logic • accurately report schedule information to all relevant stakeholders • ensure schedules aid the delivery of Executive-level reports and Business Transformation Programme direction to the Management Team • minimise the requirements for manual entry to management reporting on a weekly basis • ensure activities and deliverables drive the related dependencies throughout the Business Transformation Programme, and • anticipate, discover and report any milestone changes due to schedule movement from the baseline in a timely manner. • present the critical path. 10.1 Programme Plan The Integrated Programme Plan provides a Programme-wide timeline including key activities, deliverables, milestones and dependencies. It is updated weekly based on: • updates to the workstream schedules • updates in the workstream status reports • agreed changes via appropriate channels. 10.2 Integrated Schedule The integrated schedule is a rolled-up view of the workstream schedules from level 2 to level 5 and will be used to inform the high-level programme plan. Integrated schedule and workstream relationship: Figure 28: BT Programme Integrated Schedule Page 55 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.3 Key Activities To plan, track, manage and achieve the baseline Release schedule it is important to identify and schedule the key Release activities and milestones and identify the Release critical path. The typical release key delivery dates and milestones are outlined below. These key dates and milestones are reflected in both the individual workstream schedules and the Integrated Release Schedule.

This measure is taken based on the percent complete for a task. When creating a plan, the following information must be captured (at the lowest task level): • Start Date • Duration • Work (Effort) • % Complete • Finish Date ( calculated based on start date + duration) Note: Resources are not required for the calculation. Once the plan has been baselined, the values entered above are locked and used for the schedule performance calculation unless the task’s planned effort is changed and baselined in which case the revised effort is used. After the plan is updated, the following calculation is used to calculate schedule performance: If a task’s % complete = 100%, task % complete x baseline work = work completed, the schedule performance is work completed compared to budgeted work. For further planning information please refer to the BT Planning SharePoint site Page 57 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.6 High Level Programme Schedule Varying views of the high level Stage 4 integrated schedule are maintained to show integration and manage dependencies between workstreams, highlight key dates, miletsones and show the programme critical path.A separate view is maintained with a focus on decommissioning and meeting the important key dates and milestones for that programme of work, and then finally workstream specific high level schedules for detailed initiative manahement. Updated versions of these can be found at the following links: • BT Programme Critical Path • Decommissioning & Data Archiving High Level Schedule • WS-1: START Delivery Initiative Summary Figure 29: Stage 4 Integrated Workstream Schedule Page 58 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 Dependency Management Together with workstream level dependencies, where a programme workstream has a dependency on a work product being produced by another workstream, the Programme has interdependencies with other projects, initiatives and programmes within both Inland Revenue and the programme itself. These dependencies require continued and careful management, including agreement between delivering and receiving parties, commonly referred to as a “handshake”. It is important that the programme understands the nature of these dependencies and the due dates thereof, particularly where it is dependent on the completion of inputs from dependent initiatives to ensure that milestones are met. Dependencies on key external events and decisions (e.g., from Ministers) may also impact on the programme, these often spill over into risk and risk mitigation management, which can be an effective way to create visibility and escalation if required. There are three types of dependencies within Business Transformation: 1. Workstream level Dependency– These are dependencies that a workstream has on a work product being produced by another BT workstream. 2. External to BT Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with a work product that needs to be produced by a team outside of the BT Programme but internal to IR. 3. External to IR Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with a work product that needs to be produced by a party external to IR. 11.1 Dependency Register All programme dependencies are reflected in the JIRA Dependency Register. This register includes all known and potential dependencies, including an assessment of the strength of each dependency and both the upstream and downstream impacts. The Integrated Programme Schedule also contains all known dependencies. For further information, including process documentation and key contacts please refer to the BT Dependencies SharePoint site. Page 59 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 12 Programme Tools To support the application of the programme management approach, it is necessary to utilise tools that support the key activities and tasks which are easy to use and easily accessible by all relevant parties (i.e., team members, sponsors and stakeholders). The BT PMO Tools team support and develop the BT Programme tools including Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Teams and JIRA. This overview details which of the BT PMO Tools should be used for what on BT. The table below maps the tools to be used for each key programme function: Figure 30: Programme tools to support Business Transformation For training or further information on BT PMO Tools please refer to the BT PMO Tools SharePoint site or email BTPMOTools@ird.govt.nz.

Master Services Agreements have been established for all major suppliers with specific statements of work entered for the delivery of Transformation Programme services. All projects and initiatives within the Programme will have documented contracts covering all external spend whether for goods or services. Regular partner management forums are established with strategic and critical suppliers as part of the governance structure of the programme. These forums are managed by the Head of Commercial and Procurement and the Manager Commercial ICT with attendance from Programme Leadership Team member(s). The DC Transformation is accountable for the management of third-party suppliers through the Head of Commercial and Procurement. The Head of Commercial and Procurement is responsible for the management of suppliers and partners on the BT Programme which includes, but is not restricted to the following: • negotiation of the commercial framework of terms and conditions that suppliers are contractually obligated to deliver within. • management of contractual deliverables. • management of change requests. • performance management of suppliers against the programme scorecard; • milestone deliverables. • managing suppliers to value add. • management of supplier innovation. • sourcing of suppliers to meet IR’s requirements. • contract management and commercial governance of the suppliers. The involvement of third-party suppliers is subject to All of Government (AoG) Procurement Rules and IR’s Buying and Expenses Policy and undertaken through the direction of the Head of Commercial and Procurement. Prior approval of the SRO or CIR in accordance with the agreed levels of financial delegation is sought for all procurement activities and involvement of a third-pa rty supplier. 13.1 Account Review Meeting The purpose of the Account Review Meeting is to provide a Monthly Forum for the management of the programme commercial arrangements and relationships with key service providers. Meetings are held monthly and include engagement effectiveness, cost management, schedule attainment and delivery performance, scope and change management, team performance, risk and issues management, delivery assurance and administration and compliance. The meetings also review the status of commercial activities (acceptances, change requests and invoicing), budget forecasts and actuals and resource planning and changes. The Account Review Meetings are chaired by the Head of Commercial and Procurement or relevant Commercial lead. The score card is shared with the PGC as applicable. Page 61 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14 Resource Management Ensuring a smooth flow and access to the required capabilities at the right time is critical to the success of the Programme. It is integral to have initial conversations with your finance partner prior to starting the process as it will speed the process up for costing. A structured, planned and integrated approach to resource management for the programme will: • reduce programme management time spent on resource planning • hold a single source of truth and one single register of every person on the programme to hold key metadata associated with the person • increase flexibility of staff across the Programme and specific projects • facilitate getting the right people in the right place at the right time • facilitate understanding and awareness regarding Programme resource priorities across IR • enable more effective use of people resources through active career, resource and succession planning. 14.1 Sourcing and Onboarding Form (SOF) Process The process is as follows: 1. The appropriate manager completes the SOF. 2. The PLT Workstream lead with the delegated authority discusses with their Financial Analyst and approves the SOF. If the position reports directly to the PLT Workstream Lead, DC Transformation approval is required 3. The approved SOF is given to the Resource Manager, who then ensures that P&C, Recruitment, IT&C etc. are advised that the approved position is available, and they can commence sourcing. The PLT Workstream are responsible for ensuring all the recruitment policies are followed, these are available on the P&C intranet site 4. Once recruitment is completed the selected person is approved and the completed SOF is returned to the Resource Manager so that onboarding can commence.

The BT Scope Management and JIRA overview document details the background and purpose of the BT approach, and in addition provides an overview to using JIRA for this purpose. Also included is the definition of Must, Should and Could approach used. Throughout the programme requests for new and/or changes to scope (from within and outside the programme) are carefully controlled and managed via the programme change control/request process. Changes, JIRA is used to capture current and future scope, 15.1 Baselined and proposed scope Once the scope has been agreed and baselined it must be tightly managed, with various tiers of approval required for any proposed change. All proposed scope change is assessed for the impact to the baseline cost, programme work and agreed scheduled deliverables, milestones, or dependencies. Scope is captured in JIRA in the JIRA Scope Project and in accompanying documents and definition templates A MoSCoW prioritisation categorisation of “must do”, “should do” and “could do” (MOSCOW principles), together with an business impact assessment supports all scope decisions. Non-BT scope can be recorded but is retained in a Draft status for later consideration. Scope items pass through a delivery workflow from definition to completion (New/Draft, Review, Backlog, Scheduled, Completed), with the resultant status viewed and managed from the JIRA Kanban Board. The JIRA Scope project is underpinned by the following data model to maintain data consistency and allow management and control ( see Scope Management Data Model. Further scope detail can be found on the BT Scope SharePoint site.

A robust change control process helps to manage the change in a consistent manner, formulate the impacts, summarise any risks or issues arising from the change and ensure those impacted by the change fully understand the change . In addition, it ensures that the change is correctly approved and appropriately managed. The change management process is not in place to prevent change; it is in place to confirm that where change is required, it is agreed to by the relevant authority before it is executed. In all cases, the impact of the change will be considered against the agreed baseline, including considerations of the schedule, scope, business benefit, resource, and financial impact. 16.1 Programme Change Requests Programme Change Requests (PCR’s) are used to manage change. The change requests are managed in JIRA via the JIRA PCR Project. The PCR outlines who is informed of and consulted during the creation of the change request. The programme delegation framework provides guidance in determining the change approver. Once approved the Release Delivery Manager will determine who will be responsible for implementing the ‘accepted’ changes and will instruct the PMO as appropriate to update the baseline plan, budgets and any other documentation. 16.1.1 Administering Change The PMO oversees and administers the change process. This includes: • quality assuring PCR’s to confirm that they are ready for submission • maintaining programme change management standards and processes • reporting on change management to appropriate management and governance forums • maintaining soft copy records and archiving any signed hard copies of all PCRs. 16.1.2 Proposing change The change process is based on the principle that accountability for change is with the person who knows most about it. Throughout the PCR approval process, the Change Owner will have responsibility for: • drafting the PCR • co-ordinating the impact assessment (including impact on costs, benefits, and risks) • coordinating mandatory consultation with all relevant parties, such as PLT members, Implementation/Delivery Partners, and the Finance Manager • liaising with the Contract Manager if any impacts on third party Statements of Work are identified • presenting the PCR • completing any necessary activities to action the change. Page 65 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16.1.3 Change Escalation Triggers The following table outlines who has the authority to accept change and the frequency of decision-making forums. However, if an urgent change is required, appropriate management action should be taken to seek out of cycle approval.

Figure 34: Delegations for Change Request approvals (for full detail refer to the PMP Appendices 16.1.4 When is A PCR required? • Once Scope has been baselined for a Release, and the “outcomes” as described in the scope statement are being proposed to be expanded on or reduced, a PCR is required. • Clarifications which do not have a material impact on the outcomes do not require a PCR • Once the “Design Freeze” has been invoked and the estimated effort from any of the delivery streams is “Medium” or higher, a PCR is required • When any stream indicates additional funding will be required • At the discretion of the Workstream Programme Delivery Manager or the Enterprise Architect • A team lead may request a PCR is raised for visibility purposes 16.1.5 What is the difference between a PCR lite (PowerPoint)and Full PCR (MSWord)? A PCR Lite is only used for Workstream 1 (START Delivery) and are intended to impose the least possible information gathering burden in order to carry out a pre-liminary assessment of the impact of change With a PCR Lite not all delivery teams are consulted prior to conditional approval being granted by the Design Authority to proceed with Must Do items The PCR lite preliminary assessment is brought to the Wednesday Delivery meeting where every team is given the opportunity to expand the impact and or “push back” on the Design Authority conditional approval. It is at this meeting the decision will be taken on whether a full PCR will be required Examples of additional attributes which a full PCR (MS Word) will hold are: • Full budget impact assessment resulting from the additional funding request • Alternative options for consideration • A description of the impact of doing nothing • Additional detail on the impact assessments • Impacts on Key milestone/s and or scheduled dates Page 66 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16.1.6 Guidance and framework For further information including guidance on creating a Programme Change Request (PCR) and full PCR impact forms please refer to the BT PCRs SharePoint site.

Functional decisions relate to either Core Tax and Social Policy, i.e. START, or Non- Core Tax and Social Policy, each follow separate processes as outlined within the BT Design Decision Process. The BT PMO manages the workflow for all decisions. 17.1.1 Tax and Social Policy Decisions For all Tax and Social Policy Decision process please refer to the BT Design Decisions (BTDD) SharePoint site.

Page 68 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 18 Risk Management Risk is inherent in any programme. All projects have some degree of uncertainty due to the assumptions associated with them and the environment in which they are executed. A risk is an event or set of events that, should it occur, influence the achievement of programme objectives. The Programme risk management approach recognises that change initiatives of any size, but particularly major programme transformations are high-risk undertakings; and that a focused effort is required to ensure effective and successful delivery of the Programme and associated business benefits. It is recognised that Programme risks cannot be eliminated entirely, but many of them can be anticipated and reduced. 18.1 Risk Management Framework The Programme’s risk management framework is aligned to IR’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework and ISO 31000:2009 To maintain this alignment, the Programme: • has adopted and applied the IR Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMP/F). This includes the Risk Management Process as described by International Standards Organisation (ISO) 31000:20009 to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on risks (refer diagram below) • Aligning the Programme’s JIRA risk project to the ERMF. • works closely with IR Corporate Risk & Assurance (CR&A) to identify changes required to fully align with the new corporate risks policies and standards • uses the CR&A Enterprise framework to assess risks and issues at Programme, Release and Workstream-levels • describes the risk and issue activities undertaken by the Programme in the Risk Strategy and Management Plan. Figure 36: IR’s Enterprise Risk Framework 18.2 Risk Management Plan The Risk Management Plan describes the specific management activities that will be undertaken to support the execution of the Programme’s Risk Strategy. Specifically, it sets out: • the approach to be used for identifying, reviewing and managing risks and issues at Programme, Sub Programme and workstream levels. • the roles and responsibilities for risk and issue management within the Programme Page 69 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • the reporting processes. The risk and issue management process has been established to ensure that: • a robust risk and issue identification process is carried out as part of Programme planning, with an acceptable level of ‘due diligence’ applied • processes are in place for risks and issues to be analysed, monitored/controlled and managed on a regular basis • relevant risk and issue information is reported by all workstreams, and Sub Programmes, within the Programme and as appropriate to the Programme’s governing bodies • risks and issues are prioritised and escalated at the correct level for decision-making in a timely manner • there is active debate and analysis of risk and issue information at Programme governance and executive management levels. For further information on risks and issues please refer to the BT Risks and Issues SharePoint site. Page 70 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 19 Issue Management Managing issues effectively within a large-scale programme environment is crucial to its success, ensuring the programme remains on schedule and delivers the intended outcomes. An issue is an unplanned situation that has occurred and justifies management consideration and possible action. If left unresolved it will impact upon the achievement of investment objectives. An issue can also be a risk which has come to fruition and requires resolution. 19.1 Assessing Issues The Programme uses the IR ERMP/F consequence criteria to assess the issue priority rating. The Risk Management Plan also provides criteria for issues to be reported up to PLT, PGC or higher from an escalation perspective. The Programme records and manages issues using JIRA. For further information on risks and issues please refer to the BT Risks and Issues SharePoint site. Page 71 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 20 Quality Management Business Transformation manages quality on two different levels. • Firstly, the programme seeks Assurance for its stakeholders through conducting planned reviews, engaging independent quality assessments and meeting the Government Gateway requirements. • Secondly, the programme seeks internal quality control through ensuring the artefacts that are produced are of a high standard through the setting of guidelines, quality checklists and peer review. 20.1 Assurance Management Best practice according to industry standard requires that major programmes have a clear and coordinated approach towards assurance. This has been reinforced by key learning’s from major programmes of work across the public sector. The BT Quality Assurance Process ensures: • there is an overall plan for implementing proactive assurance activities. • there is capacity for conducting planned and ad hoc reviews. • ongoing IQA and Gateway reviews are undertaken at key milestones of the Programme (e.g. go-live) • internal reviews are undertaken on an as needed basis. • ongoing reviews of our vendors and business partners. • that progress is continuously monitored by Central Monitoring Agencies. Assurance is coordinated as part of the PMO function and is incorporated into regular programme planning and reporting to the PLT, PGC and other governance groups as required. An Assurance Management Plan is in place for the Programme and is updated for each release. The timings for the quality assurance reviews are regularly reviewed. 20.1.1 \[Information redacted\] 20.1.2 \[Information redacted\] 20.2 Internal Quality Control The primary objectives of quality control within the Programme are to: • provide guidelines and processes to ensure a consistency of quality across programme deliverables and adherence to appropriate quality standards for each deliverable, including adherence to IT architecture principles and reference architectures • provide confidence to the SRO and key stakeholders that all deliverables meet expectations and satisfy stated requirements and objectives • ensure the Programme proactively mitigates risks and issues regarding quality • identify improvement opportunities, which can be acted on to increase the likelihood of programme success. Page 72 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21 Deliverables Management 21.1 Controlled Programme Documents The size and complexity of the BT Programme means that many documents are developed and require robust change control systems to be in place. All programme-level artefacts are control documents. Specifically, this includes but is not limited to: • The Programme Management Plan and documents as listed in the PMP Appendices • Transformation Updates for Cabinet • Baseline Programme Plans and Release Plans • Design Artefacts including Requirements, Business Blueprints, Business Profile, Solution Specifications and Business Function Definitions (BFDs) • Programme-level strategies • Any Master Services Agreements with third parties and associated Statements of Work • Formal RFP responses from third party providers • Operations Manual issued to third party providers. 21.2 Deliverables Quality Control To meet these objectives, the Programme has adopted several Quality Principles in relation to programme deliverables. These are: • Purpose The aim of the document must be clear. It must deliver against the agreed deliverable scope and in the Deliverables Register. • Logic The assumptions underlying the document must be explicit; recommendations must be logical and based on the evidence provided. • Accuracy Data and information used to inform the document must be accurate, with references provided as required. All material facts must have been considered. • Options As appropriate, documents must demonstrate that an adequate range of options have been considered before a recommendation has been made. It must be clear that benefits, costs and impacts on the programme are clearly understood. • Consultation It must be clear that adequate consultation with interested parties has taken place and feedback incorporated where appropriate. • Practicality Implementation, technical feasibility, timing and compatibility with wider projects and policies must be considered and documented. • Presentation The format of the document must be consistent with programme standards and IR standards as appropriate. The material must be clear, concise, well presented visually and free of errors. It is acknowledged that some external facing market documents may require a different view to that which is prescribed in the templates. • Methodology The format of the document must be consistent with the BTM and align to the programme prescribed templates. Page 73 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21.3 Management of Deliverables Deliverables that are produced during the life of the programme are recorded in the release specific deliverables register. This includes deliverables that are led by IR and by third party providers. Responsibilities for these deliverables are as per the definitions of responsibility outlined below: • Lead and Primary Responsibility (LM) (Accountability) - rests with the organisation listed, who will have the responsibility to plan, lead, manage, coordinate, control and deliver all elements of the scope and outcomes as agreed. Lead will include active participation in the drafting and reviewing of the key content areas of the intended deliverables/IR material. • Material Contribution (MC) - rests with the organisation listed, who will have the responsibility to provide significant input into the production of the deliverable/IR material, as specified in Statement of Work (SoW). This may include subject matter expertise, research, and knowledge management, documentation, and production, compliance with quality standards, meeting deadlines, and deliverable assembly/completion. 21.4 RACI Model for Deliverable Execution The BT Programme adopts a deliverable RACI model to provide guidance around the involvement required from individuals to ensure successful deliverable completion. It is important that: • people listed in the RACI model are committed to completing areas of the deliverable that they have been assigned whether a contributor/reviewer • all deliverable expectations are set well in advance of the deliverable being made available for sign off. RACI Description R Responsible This individual is responsible for the completion of the deliverable in accordance with the agreed timeframes, budgets and quality standards. The Responsible Person will confirm that the deliverable meets expected quality standards before it is submitted to the Accountable person for final approval. A Accountable This individual, or group, has responsibility for the final approval of the deliverable. Approval is the formal confirmation that a product is complete and meets its agreed requirements. The Accountable Person is the only approval point for each of the deliverables. A2 Delegated Authority Where accountability for approval of the deliverable sits with a governance group, SRO or CIR, the authority will be given to the DC Transformation to sign the sign-off memo for audit purposes. C Consult These stakeholders are consulted on the deliverable either because their input will add value, or because their buy-in is essential for ultimate implementation. I Inform These stakeholders will be informed of the deliverable and receive a copy of the deliverable for information purposes. 21.4.1 Amendments to RACI On some occasions, it may be necessary to update the RACI for a specific deliverable. Amendments to the RACI require an administrative change request to be approved. Deliverables that have not completed consultation in accordance with the RACI will not meet the mandatory acceptance criteria and will not receive final approval. Page 74 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 21.5 Document Standards All documentation will be developed in accordance with programme standards. These standards reflect broader IR requirements, such as the IR Style Guide. All documentation will include an appropriate section for the Deliverable sign-off and approval. T he purpose of this being for the Responsible Owner to confirm their acceptance of the deliverable, including that the deliverable meets the quality standards and has been consulted on in accordance with the agreed RACI. A Quality Checklist will also be included to provide guidance to workstreams prior to submission of a deliverable for approval. 21.6 Acceptance Criteria for Deliverables The programme’s acceptance criteria form a prioritised list of measurable requirements that need to be met for a deliverable to be accepted by the Accountable Person. These acceptance criteria dictate that the deliverable: • is fit for purpose and meets the agreed quality standards included in the deliverables list. • is consistent with other related programme deliverables. • is fully compliant with the BTM. • has been through the specified consultation and approval process as outlined in the RACI. • supports the achievement of and is traceable to the PGC objectives and benefits. • does not specify requirements that are impossible or impractical to achieve given environmental constraints. Each deliverable may also have a small number of specific acceptance and/or quality criteria. These criteria will be agreed and recorded for each deliverable before work commences. # Criticality Definition C1 Must have completed – critical to be 100% complete for Release Deliverables that must be completed and approved at or by the due date and if not will directly impact the Release critical path. C2 Should have completed – Targeted to be 100% complete for Release Deliverables that must be progressed to an acceptable level and standard of completion at or by the due date and if not will have an impact on activities on the release critical path. C3 Could have completed – Targeted to be 100% complete for Phase/Release Deliverables that are required but will not impact the critical path or other activities on the critical path if not completed by the due date. Completion and approval is however required to achieve Release exit. C4 Not related to current Release Deliverables that are not related to the specific Release and therefore if not completed by a specific Release milestone or checkpoint will have no impact on the solution or schedule. All third-party deliverables meet: • IR requirements and any other specifications, requirements and criteria (if any) for that Approval Item referred to in a Statement of Work; and • The programme’s acceptance criteria for deliverables, as set out in the current version of the Programme Management Plan. Page 75 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Any specific quality criteria that have been agreed with the Accountable Person. 21.7 Administering Deliverables The PMO oversees and administers the programme’s deliverables process. This includes: • quality assuring deliverables • maintaining standards and processes • document management - all final deliverables are saved centrally in the PMO document repository in the BT Deliverables SharePoint site • manage all change via the Programme Change Request process 21.7.1 Deliverable Identification and Version Control • Each deliverable is given a unique ‘D’ number as an identifier • The programme’s deliverables are identified and logged in the Master Deliverable Register and tracked in the individual Workstream schedules. • The programme has agreed conventions for deliverable file names. All final, baselined deliverables are saved as version 1.00. Documents are then placed under version control and all subsequent versions are saved as version 1.01, 1.02 etc. 21.7.2 Deliverable Change Control • For a deliverable to be added or removed from scope, after the workstream schedule is baselined, a PCR is required. • Post PCR approval the PMO will update the Change Register in JIRA (refer BTPCR Board, the Integrated Programme Plan, Master Deliverables Register and re-baseline the workstream schedule. 21.8 Deliverables Process The full deliverables process can be found within the BT Deliverables SharePoint site. This site contains the deliverable registers, deliverable documents, templates and links to JIRA. 21.9 Information Classification and Handling Standard BT complies with IR’s Security Guideline: information security, whereby all IR-held information requires appropriate protection in order to preserve its integrity, availability and confidentiality. All information created, stored, received within IR or transferred from IR must be classified. The security classification specifies how the information and equipment must be protected and handled. For more information on IR’s security guidelines and policies please refer to the Corporate Security site. Page 76 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 22 Lessons Learned At the end of each Release, lessons learned are captured following a • Must do (high priority), • Should do (medium priority), • Could do (low priority) categorisation approach. The aim is to identify, document, analyse, store and retrieve lessons in an open and engaging environment, facilitating continuous improvement, through agreed, actionable and achievable lessons. The key outcome being that these are actionable. Workshops are facilitated to identify, document, analyse and theme lessons, grouped into “keep”, “stop” and “start” lessons and finally, stored and retrieved using JIRA, which facilitates collaboration, action and ownership. The programme has defined a process to standardise the identification and collection of lessons learned. • A lesson learned workshop should be held by all workstreams, projects and releases as soon after deployment (go-live) as possible or after a key milestone/event • A how to guide is available via the BT Lessons Learned SharePoint site, including document libraries for storing relevant documentation • Resulting lessons should be consolidated, prioritised and presented • Ensuing actions and follow-up tasks should be captured in JIRA through the JIRA Lessons Learned Project • Through this process, lessons and/or actions can be assigned to those acting and tracked by action owners, • All lessons learned at priority level “1- High” will have PGC and/or PLT visibility. • Lessons learned are recorded even if the action has already been implemented. • The full BT Lessons Learned Process can be found on the BT Lessons Learned SharePoint site, including useful summaries, prior lessons learned, etc. Page 77 of 77 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 23 Closure and Handover Management BT’s approach to formally close programme initiatives provides assurance that activities are wrapped up in a consistent manner and that there are no loose ends. The Closure Report and Closure Memo provide assurance that all work has been implemented and confirms formal recognition of completion. Both include the capture of lessons learned and applicable items for closure/handover. Formal sign off is required from the responsible and accountable persons, and for noting by the PMO Lead. The completion date for closure activity is reflected in the schedules and tracked formally through JIRA deliverables management processes. Requirements and Guidance Sub-programmes, workstreams and discrete projects complete closure reports or closure memos as detailed within the BT Closure Reports & Memos list. Supporting instruction is supplied within the templates and examples of completed closure reports are available. Key Contacts for further information and support: • PMO • Release Delivery Support Lead Responsible The Project Manager or Workstream Lead (responsible person), supported by the Project Coordinator. Timeframe This process should be considered and entered as a key deliverable within the workstream schedules. The due dates are aligned to the final Business Readiness Checkpoint for the Release. Templates and Activities The Closure Report and Closure Memo templates are available on the Templates and Processes site: Templates and Processes > Closure and Handover • BT Closure Memo Workstream name • BT Closure Report Workstream name A final status report is submitted in line with the BT Reporting timeline.
