People-led networks
===================

Our people-led networks enable individuals to come together, share ideas and provide support for one another. Some of the reasons they come together include their culture, ethnicity, ability, gender or sexuality.

They are led and organised by people who are passionate about creating an inclusive culture for all at Inland Revenue.

Working in partnership
----------------------

Our networks operate in a way that acknowledges the unique position of Māori as tangata whenua (people of the land) and Te Tiriti o Waitangi (The Treaty of Waitangi) partners. Doing this mahi (work) in partnership, is about creating a mana (standing, respect, status) enhancing experience that will build mutual trust and respect.

Opportunities within people-led networks
----------------------------------------

Joining our networks gives people the opportunity to:

*   champion and advocate for others
*   learn and share knowledge
*   grow your capabilities
*   share stories
*   create events, activities and opportunities to get involved
*   contribute to change at IR.
