PNZHL is the holding company for Powerco limited, which is New Zealand's second largest Electricity and Gas Distribution Company. Powerco ltd owns infrastructure assets that transport electricity and gas to end customers in the residential, agricultural and indus t rial sectors. We are writing in relation to the Government Discussion Document "BEPS - Strengthening our interest limitation rules" (the "discussio n document") . We appreciate the opportunity to make a submission on this discussion document. Th e key items we raise in our su bmission are su mmarised as follows: • Reducing the effective gearing ratio through the exclusion of non -debt liabiliti es will unfairly impact industries such as regulated infrastructure industries which have traditionally been funded using greater than average gearing given the predictable cash flows generate d by their underlying busine sses; • This is exacerbated by the inclu sion of deferred tax liabilities in the calcu lation of the deductible debt limit which in asset intensive industries can be significant and which can be treated by financiers in debt covena nts as akin to equity; • The interest rate cap is a novel and untested approach which we believe is unnecessary in light of the current and proposed transfer pricing rules and is incon sisten t with internationally accepted transfer pricing requirements; • In our view, the issue being addressed by the proposed interest rate cap is best solv ed through the application of the current and proposed transfer pricing rule s; • The proposed changes create an unequa l playing field between foreign and New Zealand investors, which can have the impact of reducing appetite from foreign investors as well as potentially harming local New Zealand investors who frequently invest alongside foreign investors. • As a net im porter of cap ital, the proposed changes wou ld increase the average cos t of capital in New Zealand, particularly for capital-intensive industries where capital structures would likely #008 become l ess efficient, increasing the cost to New Zea land of building the infrastructure necessary to su pport and grow its economy. BACKGROUND QIC appreciates that New Zealand needs to ensure that all businesses cont ribute an appropriate level of tax . However , in this context, we note t he OECD as part of its BEPS project acknowledges that special rules may be needed for inf ra structure businesse s given their long -term capital intensive nature and public benefit outcome. The prop osals suggested in the discu ss ion document however are likely to result in hori zo ntal inequity between bu sin esses ba se d on the re si dency of their owners and it will have the greatest i mpac t on lon g term infrastructure bu sinesses, which t ypically rely on at least a portion of overseas capital. Furthe r, a series of recent law ch anges have already signifi ca ntly reduced the perceived tax benefits that the se measures are seeking to curtai l. TR EATMEN T OF NON-DEBT LIABILITIES - I NTRODUCTION OF AN ARM'S LENGTH FALL BACK The discussion document proposes changes in the current thin capitalisation rules to be based on assets net of non-debt liabilities rather than total assets. We consider the existing 60% gearing ratio to be too low for regulated public benefit Infra st ructure as external debt can be secured on economic terms in excess of the exis ting 60 % thin capitalisation gearing ratio . The impa ct of movin g to a net asset ca lculation will r educe thi s gear ing threshold even further. MEASUREMENT DATE FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The proposal to require quart erly or daily measurement risks impos in g signif i ca nt and unn ecess ary complia nce costs given that the ca lculation is based on IFRS accou ntin g values which may not be prep ar ed on a quarterly basis. IFRS accounting require s certain complex calcu lations including impairment testin g, fair value and marked to market calculations. To require these to be done solely for tax purposes at point s in the year when they are not already being done for finan cial reporting pu rposes impo ses addi tio nal and unnecessary com pliance costs. I NT E REST RATE CAP- USE TRANSFER PRICING PRINCIPLES INSTEAD The discussion paper suggests a bolster to the asset-based thin capitalisation rules in the form of an interest rate cap. This is a novel and untested approach. We consi d er that the cap on related party loans adds sig nifi ca nt comp lexity , li mits flexibi lity in raising debt cap it al, increases horizontal inequity betw een local and foreign -ow ned busine sses and when combined with t he red uced debt to asset ratio, makes New Zealand a uniquely comp l ex th in capita lisation regime in the internationa l communi ty. We expect thi s would result in a higher cost of capi t al for New Zealand infrastructure assets, resulting in higher cha r ges to end users and/or cost to Government. The interest rate cap introduce s a high risk of double taxation when dealing with jurisdictions that apply transfer pricing principles. The ability to utili se the mutual agreement process in our double tax treatie s (MAP) help s avoid double taxation and supports the integrity of the global tax system . While thin capitalisa tion ad justmen ts have always been unilateral, managing debt levels within the curre nt safe harbour rule s ha s been relativ ely st raightforward . However, the combined impact of t he thin capitalisation rules and the interest rate cap will make it much harder to avoid double taxation where interest is not deductible in New Zealand but assessable in the offshore jurisdiction. 2 of 4 ·. ~ OIC . These fundamental concerns ca n be addressed if the interest rate cap is replaced or supplemented by an arm 's length debt pricing test relying on tran sfer pricing rules. ALTERNATIV E APPROACHES Paragraph 2.19 of the discussion paper notes that failure to address the perceived problems with the rules may mean an EBITDA based rule is adopted . We do not accept that an EBITDA based rule is the logical outcome of rejecting the interest rate cap. As identified by the discussion paper, there are also a number of problem s with the EBITDA approach and as noted above , the OECD recognises that public benefit infrastructure has special characte ristics that might mean an exemption from the EBITDA test is appropriate . In the discussion document "New Zealand's taxat ion framework for in bound investment " (June 2016 ), it is noted that " a priority for the Gove rnment is ensuring that New Zealand continues to be a good place to invest and for businesses to be based, grow and flourish". In our view , the imposition of an EBITDA based rule without an exemption for public benefit infrastructure would be at odds with this priority. Further , in that discussion document the Government stated that it co nsidered the use of non-resident withholding tax on related party lending as a "back stop to income tax ... minimising the potential for ba se erosion by \[related party interest\] payments " . The OECD 2016 update emphasised the difficulty for European jurisdictions in particular to apply withholding tax to interest payments. The EBITDA approach may make some sense in an environment like Europe where there is limited application of non-resident withholding tax. However, the recent broadening and strengthening of New Zealand's non -resident withholding tax rules (which focused on closing a perceived gap in taxation of related party lending) negate s the need for New Zealand to consider an EBITDA approach. We submit that following a series of recent amendments to the deductibility of interest on shareholder loans, the tran sfer pricing rule s (current and proposed) are more than adequate in dealing with the appropriateness of interest rate cha rges, are well supported by a non -resident withholding tax backstop , and avoid the policy compromises caused by the interest rate cap. I MPLEMENTATION CONCERNS We note that a common theme of recent law changes affecting interest deduction s is the New Zealand Government 's focus on reducing the use of loan s from equity inve stors . We wish to make Treasury aware that where we have considered proposal s to reduce loans from equity investors in response to the law changes, a number of New Zealand tax provision s (e.g. general anti avoidance rule) have had the potential to resu lt in very significant New Zealand tax consequences when such loans are repaid. This is in addition to tax consequences in the for eign investor's home jurisdiction (i.e . realisation for tax purposes of foreign exchange gains due to appreciation of the NZ dollar) . For the se reasons , should our earlier comments on the appropriatene ss of the propo se d amendments be put aside, we request that considera tion be given to grandfathering existing arrangement s given regulat ed infrastructure investments are large investments made with long term investment hori zo ns based on the policy settings at the investment time, or at the least , providing relief where lo ans from equity investors are repaid . 3 of 4 ·. ~ OIC ' GENERA L We trust you find our comments useful.
