1 TIB Index – Volume 1 No 1 to Volume 31 No 5 A – Z • TIB & Page column: The reference is to the TIB volume and issue number, followed by the page number, eg, 6.10:25 means TIB Vol 6, No 10, p 25. Multiple page references are separated by commas or hyphens (eg, 6.10:12, 25 or 6.10:12- 14) while multiple issue references are separated by semi- colons (eg, 6.10:12; 7.3:15). • Appendices: Some entries show an “A” after the TIB issue number. This means the item appears in the appendix to that TIB, or in Appendix A if that TIB has more than one appendix. Similarly, a “B” or “C” suffix means the item is in the respective appendix. The brief introduction in the main TIB is generally not indexed for these items. • Case notes: The subject-matter of cases is listed under “Court decisions” and “Taxation Review Authority decisions” and is also listed alphabetically by subject throughout the index, with the case name or number following the entry (in italics if a Court case). • Questions we’ve been asked: “QWBA” or “QB #/#” (eg, QB 08/01) appears in the index entry. These articles generally restate existing policy, rather than covering any new ground. • Public binding rulings: These are listed under “Binding rulings”, and also listed alphabetically by subject throughout the index, with “BR Pub” after the entry. • Product binding rulings: These are listed under “Binding rulings”, but do not appear separately under their respective subjects because they apply only to the product or arrangement named in the ruling. • Number of TIBs in each volume: Volume 1 11 issues Volume 13 12 issues Volume 2 9 issues Volume 14 12 issues Volume 3 9 issues Volume 15 12 issues Volume 4 11 issues Volume 16 11 issues Volume 5 13 issues Volume 17 10 issues Volume 6 14 issues Volume 18 11 issues Volume 7 14 issues Volume 19 11 issues Volume 8 11 issues Volume 20 11 issues Volume 9 13 issues Volume 21 9 issues Volume 10 12 issues Volume 22 11 issues Volume 11 11 issues Volume 23 10 issues Volume 12 Volume 25 Volume 26 Volume 27 Volume 28 Volume 29 Volume 30 Volume 31 12 issues 11 issues 11 issues 11 issues 12 issues 11 issues 11 issues 5 issues Volume 24 10 issues This index has been updated by CCH New Zealand Limited 2 Abuse of process . application by Commissioner to strike out NOPA claim as abuse of process declined (Chesterfield Preschools) 24.8:16-17 . application by taxpayers to prevent Crown Law from acting for Commissioner (Accent Management) 24.7.114-115 . application to set aside statutory demand as abuse of process rejected (Accent Management) 26.2:22-23 .
