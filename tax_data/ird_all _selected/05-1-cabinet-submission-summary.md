| Portfolio | **Revenue** |
| Purpose | This paper seeks approval of the text and agreement to sign the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the MLI). |
| Previous Consideration | In February 2017, EGI noted that there is significant global media and political concern about base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), and agreed to the release of an officials’ issues paper on _New Zealand’s Implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Prevent BEPS_ \[EGI-17-MIN-0005\]. |
| Summary | Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties which are designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border services, trade, and investment without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax avoidance or evasion. DTAs also enable tax administrations to support each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and avoidance.<br><br>The MLI (attached as **Annex 1**) proposes to quickly and efficiently amend a significant number of DTAs to take into account new treaty standards relating to treaty abuse and dispute resolution resulting from the OECD and G20’s 15 point Action Plan on base erosion and profit shifting. New Zealand’s MLI will cover 34 DTAs (i.e. those New Zealand holds with jurisdictions who are also signing the MLI). New Zealand’s MLI position is discussed in **paragraphs 18-24**.<br><br>Submissions on the officials’ issues paper concerning BEPS identified issues relating to the need for a New Zealand-specific approach (as the MLI is broadly drafted), the need for additional guidance and administrative resources to help taxpayers apply DTAs as modified by the MLI, and domestic law updates to support a smooth implementation of the MLI (discussed in **paragraph 29**). |
| Regulatory Impact Analysis | The Regulatory Impact Analysis and tax strategy teams at the Treasury consider that the National Impact Statement meets quality assurance criteria. |
| Baseline Implications | Data limitations prevent an accurate estimation of the impact on net tax revenue, though it is expected that the overall impact will be positive. There will be some administrative costs to IRD, which are expected to be small. |
| Legislative Implications | The Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the regulation and giving of effect to DTAs. An Order in Council will give effect to the MLI. |
| Timing Issues | The MLI signing ceremony is 7 June 2017. An Instrument of Full Powers will need be obtained from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable the Minister of Revenue to sign the MLI. |
| Announcement | National communications relating to this matter will be managed by the office of the Minister of Revenue.<br><br>The text of the MLI, New Zealand’s notifications and reservations, and the NIA will be tabled in the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination, as the MLI it is subject to ratification. |
| Proactive Release | None proposed. |
| Consultation | Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. MBIE and MFAT were consulted.<br><br>The Minister of Revenue indicates that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. |
