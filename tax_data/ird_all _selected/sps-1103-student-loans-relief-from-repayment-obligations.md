This item has been withdrawn and replaced by [SPS 20/05: Student loan repayment – options for relief](/standard-practice-statements/returns-and-debt-collection/sps-20-05)
.

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for providing relief from payment of student loan repayment obligations. However, where a student loan borrower has a tax debt or a child support debt, they should refer to SPS 11/01 (_Instalment arrangements for payment of tax_) or SPS 11/02 (_Child Support Debt – Requesting an instalment arrangement_).  
      
    
2.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 ("SLSA").

### Application

3.  This SPS applies to applications for relief from payment of:
    *   overdue student loan repayment obligations;
    *   student loan repayment obligations not yet due;
    *   student loan repayment deductions for the current tax year;
    *   penalties imposed on overdue student loan repayment obligations.

### Summary

4.  The SLSA provides very limited discretion for hardship relief where serious or significant financial hardship is experienced by a student loan borrower although the SLSA provides for hardship relief if there are special reasons which would make it fair and reasonable to grant that relief.  
      
    
5.  Those forms of relief are generally referred to in this SPS as hardship relief. They are:

*   The Commissioner may:
    *   refrain from issuing a notice of assessment or collecting and write off any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the amount in any tax year is $20 or less;
    *   refrain from the collection of any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the due date for payment has passed and the amount is more than $20 but less than $334 (excluding penalties). The amount not collected will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   reduce any amount that must be deducted or paid by a borrower, for example, issue a special repayment deduction rate certificate (formerly "Special Tax Code") to vary a deduction for the current or next year in order to change a borrower's student loan repayment obligation. The amount not collected as a consequence of a reduction will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   reduce a repayment obligation for the previous tax year. The amount not collected as a consequence of a reduction will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   refund any amount that was deducted or paid to meet a student loan repayment obligation in the previous tax year where he is satisfied the repayment has, or would, cause serious hardship to a borrower.

6.  A borrower can apply for the remission of late payment penalties imposed on any student loan repayment obligation. The Commissioner will look at the circumstances of each case and if the Commissioner thinks it equitable, may grant relief.

### Legislation

7.  The relevant legislative provisions of the SLSA are:

##### 51 Power of Commissioner in respect of small amounts

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

### Discussion

#### Application for relief

8.  A borrower can make an application to Inland Revenue for hardship relief where they believe that payment of their student loan obligation would cause or has caused "serious hardship". A borrower can also apply for hardship relief if they consider that there are "other special reasons" that would justify relief from their repayment obligations. Each application will be considered on its own merits.  
      
    
9.  If a borrower anticipates that they will experience serious hardship or serious financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet their student loan repayment obligations for the next year, their application for hardship relief should be sent to Inland Revenue by 31 March of the current tax year. However, the Commissioner will also consider applications on a retrospective basis.  
      
    
10.  Applications can be made by telephone, in writing or by electronic means using the IR website on-line service.

#### Available options for relief

11.  Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the repayment of a student loan obligation (and related penalties) will cause the borrower serious hardship or there are other special reasons, the following options are available:
    *   refrain to collect a repayment obligation of less than $334;
    *   remit a penalty;
    *   reduce a student loan repayment obligation;
    *   refund repayments for the tax year immediately prior to the current tax year.

#### When relief will be provided

12.  Although the SLSA does not define the meaning of "serious hardship" or "other special reasons", section 57D (see above) sets out circumstances that would indicate a borrower is experiencing "significant financial hardship". This provides a guide to circumstances where the Commissioner will provide relief, although it is not an exhaustive list.  
      
    
13.  Applications for hardship relief are considered on a case-by-case basis. The onus is on the borrower to show that payment of their student loan obligations has or will cause hardship, or that there are special reasons why the Commissioner should not pursue full payment for a period.

#### Timing of applications for future relief

14.  When a borrower anticipates that they will experience financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet their student loan repayment obligations for a future tax year, their application for hardship relief should be sent to Inland Revenue on or before 31 March in the current tax year.

#### Information to support applications

15.  The application for hardship relief should set out the borrower's circumstances and clearly explain the reason for requesting hardship relief. The Commissioner may require the borrower to provide further information in support of their application.  
      
    
16.  Resident borrowers may use the IR40 "Statement of financial position" form as a guide for the information required on support of their application for hardship relief.  
      
    
17.  Overseas-based borrowers are required to apply for hardship relief in writing, providing full details of their financial situation, or by completing an IR219 "Student loan overseas-based repayment application" form.  
      
    
18.  The IR40 and IR219 forms are available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides.

#### When relief is provided

##### _Refrain from collection_

19.  The Commissioner may refrain from issuing a notice of assessment or may write off any student loan repayment obligation payable by the borrower if the amount payable in any tax year is $20 or less.  
      
    
20.  The Commissioner may refrain from collecting a student loan repayment obligation of more than $20 and less than $334 if the due date for payment has passed. When the Commissioner refrains from collecting payment of a loan obligation, the unpaid amount is added back to the loan balance and attracts interest (if applicable).

##### _Remit a penalty_

21.  Late payment penalties are imposed if a borrower does not meet their student loan repayment obligations in full and on time. Those penalties compound monthly until the arrears are paid.  
      
    
22.  The Commissioner will consider an application for remission of late payment penalties once the initial arrears have been paid or at any time the borrower requests.  
      
    
23.  Late payment penalties may be remitted when a payment default was:
    *   beyond the control of the borrower or the borrower's agent; or
    *   the result of a genuine error; or
    *   in any other situation in which the Commissioner deems it equitable to do so.  
          
        
24.  When considering an application to remit a late payment penalty the Commissioner will take into account the borrower's previous compliance record, including whether they have paid their student loan repayment obligations as soon as practicable. The borrower's overall compliance history; including their other general tax and Child Support obligations (if applicable), will also be a factor in deciding whether or not to remit a late payment penalty.

##### _Reduce a repayment obligation_

25.  A borrower's student loan repayment obligation is the amount of their student loan repayable for a particular tax year. That student loan repayment obligation is generally calculated by taking the borrower's income (that exceeds the repayment threshold) and multiplying by the repayment percentage, to establish the amount of the student loan to be repaid for that tax year.  
      
    
26.  If the Commissioner grants serious hardship relief, or there are other special reasons that would make it fair and reasonable to reduce a borrower's student loan repayment obligation for a tax year, the following will occur:
    *   the borrower will be issued with a special repayment deduction rate certificate that varies the deduction rate for a current or future year to reflect a reduced repayment obligation. (The borrower will need to give the certificate to their employer so that the employer can deduct student loan repayment deductions at a reduced rate); or
    *   the percentage payable by the borrower (receiving income not subject to PAYE) will be reduced.
    *   the amount not collected, as a consequence of a reduction, will be added back to the loan balance.
    *   consideration will be given to a borrower who is overseas to see if they are entitled to a repayment holiday or an opt-out period, from their repayment obligations.

##### _Refund repayments for previous tax year_

27.  When payments by a borrower exceed their student loan repayment obligations, the overpayment will be offset against any other student loan amounts that are due but remain unpaid. Any remaining overpayment will then be offset against the borrower's loan balance.  
      
    
28.  Resident borrowers can request that an overpayment be refunded directly to them within six months from the date of issue of the Commissioner's notice of assessment advising of the overpayment. Overseas-based borrowers have two months to make a request.

#### Change of circumstances

29.  A borrower is are required to advise Inland Revenue of any change to their circumstances that is likely to mean that an earlier decision to provide hardship relief, or their ability to repay their loan obligations, will need to be reviewed.  
      
    
30.  Should a borrower's financial situation improve, they may make voluntary payments in addition to their amended student loan repayment obligation.

#### Year-end review

31.  The Commissioner may review any decision to provide hardship relief at the end of the tax year (31 March). Where the borrower's circumstances have materially changed, the Commissioner may review the hardship relief previously agreed too.

### Standard Practice

32.  A borrower should contact Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they think repayment of their student loan will cause them serious hardship, or if there are other special reasons for making an application for financial relief.  
      
    
33.  Applications are generally not required by any specific time, although an application for anticipated hardship for future year's obligations must be received by Inland Revenue on or before 31 March in the current tax year.  
      
    
34.  An application will be considered on the basis of the borrower's current or future ability to meet their student loan repayment obligation. In considering an application the Commissioner will look at all options available to a borrower to enable them to meet their loan repayment obligations.  
      
    
35.  A resident borrower may make application in writing, by telephone, or other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. An overseas-based borrower is required to apply in writing or complete an IR219 "Student loan overseas-based repayment application" form.  
      
    
36.  A borrower will need to show why payment of their loan repayment obligation will cause them serious hardship, or show why they think relief should be given for some other special reason.  
      
    
37.  If the Commissioner is satisfied that payment of a repayment obligation will cause serious or significant financial hardship to a borrower, or is satisfied that there are special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to provide relief, the Commissioner may:
    *   refund[1](#ftn01)
         any amount that was deducted or paid that is more than the Commissioner considers a borrower is able to afford to pay without causing hardship; and/or
    *   reduce any amount that must be deducted or paid in order for the borrower to meet their adjusted repayment obligation.  
          
        
38.  The unpaid balance of the original student loan repayment obligation not recovered as a result of providing hardship relief, will be added back to the loan balance owing and will incur interest (if applicable).  
      
    
39.  When the Commissioner agrees to provide hardship relief the terms and details of the adjusted student loan repayment obligation and consequential matters (e.g. refunds, changed tax code for PAYE purposes) will be confirmed so that the borrower is advised of the impact on their student loan account for the relevant year.  
      
    
40.  A borrower who applies for hardship relief must advise the Commissioner, as soon as practicable, of any change in their circumstances that is likely to impact on information previously relied upon in deciding to grant hardship relief, or may impact on the borrower's ability to pay their student loan obligation.  
      
    
41.  The Commissioner may, at the end of a tax year, review any decision to grant hardship relief. If the Commissioner considers that the circumstances upon which the relief had been agreed to have materially changed, he may reinstate all or part of the repayment deduction or repayment obligation.
