24OIA1840 Page 1 of 3 19 March 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 21 February 2024. The information you requested is outlined in Appendix A. Question one The decision document you requested relating to the Information & Intelligence Services change is enclosed as Appendix B. Question two Your request for the impact table before the October 2020 Corporate & Enabling Service restructure occurred is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information does not exist. Inland Revenue did not compare old and new organisation charts to communicate changes. The structure chart documentation produced at the time of final decisions being made is the confirmed new structure information contained in Appendix C. Question three Inland Revenue’s employment construct for Deputy Commissioners provides for changes in portfolio without requiring a formal change process. The reference made to ‘disestablishment’ and ‘establishment’ of these roles in Inland Revenue’s 2022 Annual Report relates to the portfolio, rather than the role of Deputy Commissioner. Your request for the consultation and decision documents for this change is refused under section 18(e) of the OIA as the information does not exist. This change was managed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue directly with the relevant Deputy Commissioners. No consultation or decision documents were produced for this process. While four portfolios were disestablished, only two of these roles were held by permanent employees. The four portfolios disestablished were – Chief Technology Officer (permanently filled); Chief People Officer (temporarily filled); Chief Financial Officer (temporarily filled); Deputy Commissioner Corporate Integrity & Assurance (permanently filled). Question four The consultation and decision documents relating to changes to the Policy and Strategy business unit in 2019 is enclosed as Appendix D. Some information has been removed from this document, on the OIA grounds described in the document. This process replaced the Policy and Strategy function with Policy and Regulatory Stewardship and the Deputy Commissioner portfolio was replaced accordingly to lead this business unit. 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Corporate and Enabling Services structure charts These are the structure charts for the Corporate and Enabling Services change, in list format.

take pride in their work. It is regarded as a strong and well performing policy group and, like the policy profession more broadly, we need to maintain that reputation in a changing world, now and into the future. We need to develop and hone some important policy capabilities and different ways of working to ensure that Inland Revenue continues to be the Government’s trusted advisor and deliver high quality advice. We have talked about this work as the ‘future operating model’. We have already started the journey by beginning to implement some of the changes outlined in this document. We’ve identified key shifts that will make the difference we need and our progress in these areas is showing us we’re on the right track. The three key shifts we are driving are: 1. Outcomes focused policy development Our advice achieves the results intended because we have worked up solutions right from the start with those who need to implement them and who will be affected by them 2. Being responsive today and shaping tomorrow We take account of the future and ensure that the tax and social policy systems we advise on continue to be fit for purpose 3. More broadly influencing the social and economic agenda We improve the overall outcomes across government by supporting the Government’s broader economic and social objectives There is no single silver bullet to achieve these key shifts. In some cases, this is about how we work, the way we prioritise, engage, ensure consistent quality, grow and develop our skills, and even our broader culture and behaviours. In some cases, it’s about how our roles and structures are designed and how we’ve put together our teams and focus areas. In the main we will achieve these shifts through some key enablers which are to prioritise and manage our workflows well, engage effectively at the right stages with the right people, develop some core capabilities across all of our people, and to ensure that our behaviours (and therefore culture) support these shifts. It is proposed to move to capability-based role descriptions and design the group following the principles determined through the first stage of Inland Revenue’s organisational design. The alignment to the rest of IR is important so using the capability-based role description model to update the roles in Policy is the right move, as well as giving opportunities to leverage the development offerings on the organisation-wide capabilities we want to grow. There are some structural changes proposed, designed to ensure the policy shop operates efficiently and make best use of our strengths, talents and teams. These include: • Bigger and more flexible teams, that can adapt as demands change. • Some new roles created which recognise we need to be at the top of our game in terms of strategic technical and intellectual leadership. 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Some roles disestablished as we move to a model which is more integrated with the rest of the organisation and fit for purpose now and in the future. Our aim is to ensure that our policy capability is as strong, if not stronger, in 10 years’ time as it is today, which will be achieved by growing the talents of our people. We want to create opportunities for you to build your institutional knowledge, but also to grow your leadership and broader capabilities. It is great to see people being challenged with leadership opportunities when they arise on key projects or supporting teams and growing as a result. We will continue to build on this as we go forward. This shows we can grow our future leaders regardless of the structure we proceed with. Please give us all your feedback on what is proposed. We need it to make sure that our final decision is right – what will work, what won’t work and where could it be better. We will need time to consider your feedback and then to confirm a final approach with ELT and will share the decisions with you as soon as she can. A fundamental requirement to ensuring success with this process is that it has been led and developed by people in PAS. This is part of the 7 implementation principles developed following feedback on what we could improve on from Phase One. Leader-led, designed with people experience front of mind, implemented at the right pace for each group as determined by them, and multi-staged to achieve the right outcomes at the right times. They all have an influence on how each part of our organisation in the future operating model streams find the right way for their people to head towards the outcome we’re all aiming for – an organisation that is intelligence-led, customer-centric and agile. You’ll see differences to what has gone before in almost every aspect, from timing and phases through to some of the specific changes proposed, but we hope you’ll also see the key themes of our transformation and the design principles of our new organisation coming through loud and clear. We have appreciated the input many people have provided to date whether it was at open homes or in working on the contents of the change proposal. Again, thank you for taking the time to be part of this. Cath and Mark Cath Atkins, Deputy Commissioner Policy & Strategy, and Mark Daldorf, Deputy Commissioner People and Culture and Chair of the Organisation Development Committee (ODC). How we’ve structured this proposal We’ve split the proposal into 3 parts so that it’s easier to find the information you’re looking for. We recognise you may want to skip ahead to the impacts, proposed structure and specific roles so we’ve made these easy to locate. It’s important that you read carefully through Part A as well to understand the background, context and key shifts we are aiming to achieve with the changes we are proposing and consulting on. Please take the time to read, ask questions and consider the information in Part A before giving feedback as it may answer many of your questions or explain why we proposed going down a particular path. 5 IN CONFIDENCE The three parts in this consultation pack are: Part A – Background, context and the key shifts we are working towards. Overview of the enablers of change and work to date in these areas. Further detail on the way we’ll work in future and how this differs from today, as well as what carries on. Part B - Overview of the proposal for our future operating model, and detail on what this would mean for our structure, teams and roles. Part C - Impact of the proposed change and change process, including expressions of interest. Extra information on proposed new roles and the analysis for current jobs and proposed future roles is available on the Policy Future Operating Model intranet page. Understanding Consultation Why we are consulting We have shared our design thinking around how we will be organised in the future, and about the different ways we will need to work to support our future operating model. Many of our people have been involved in helping shape the work, particularly through the enabler workstreams. Everyone has contributed in some way to shaping our prioritisation and quality practices, provided feedback on engagement, or given their thoughts on role descriptions or capability development. While we have a proposed design and proposed transition process and our enabler workstreams are already underway and making great progress, we have not made any final decisions about our future operating model structure, roles and teams. Consultation provides an opportunity to contribute your ideas, views and perspectives enhancing our decision-making process. We will not make any final decisions until we have collected and considered your feedback. What we are consulting on We are seeking your feedback on: 1. The proposed design and structure of the Policy group. 2. The proposed capability-based roles that will exist in the future Policy team. 3. The proposed transition process that would be used to move from our current state to our proposed future state. Put simply, we are consulting on the proposals contained in Parts B, C and the associated details including new role descriptions. Part A provides the background, context and work to date on our enablers and ways of working which we are already underway and making progress with. You can share your thoughts on any aspect of the proposal including the enabler workstreams, ways of working, key shifts and opportunities for change as these have had influence on our proposed changes to structure and roles. We welcome any feedback you 7 IN CONFIDENCE Where can I get more information? Electronic copies of information that is related to the consultation process are also available here including this consultation document and the PowerPoint presentation from the proposal announcement. You can also: • Check the regularly updated questions and answers on the Policy FOM intranet page • Attend the drop-in discussions • Speak to your leader • Contact your union • Ask a question via the Policy Future Operating Model email address policyFOM@ird.govt.nz We will endeavour to respond to your question within 48 hours so you can participate fully in the consultation process. Supporting you through change As you read through this document and consider what the changes and the proposal might mean for you, remember there is support available. Change can sometimes be unsettling no matter who you are, and especially if you are directly impacted by change. It’s important to take care of yourself through the process. Talk to people, discuss what is being proposed, and get support that is right for you, whether that’s from your leader, work colleagues, family or friends. You can also access a range of free support such as: Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provides a free, confidential and independent service. To make an appointment, contact EAP directly on 0800 327 669 or visit their website: www.eapservices.co.nz Hauora Hub is our one-stop, interactive site for a wealth of information and ideas to help improve your health and wellbeing. It’s constantly updated and easy to use. Find it under “quick links” on the IR homepage. If you’re a union member, your union is also available to provide support and advice during the change process. 9 IN CONFIDENCE Policy is one of these streams The capabilities in the Policy stream enable IR to provide advice to government on the tax revenue and transfer systems and develop policy for how these can be used to support economic and social wellbeing for current and future generations. We have thought about what the future looks like for Policy and how it will feel different for us and those we work with. Some of this is enhancing what we already do well, some is about consistency, some a different approach or outcome focus, and all of it centres around our people. Scope The Policy stream is different to PAS. The Future Operating Model Policy stream solely focuses on the Policy part of PAS as the Strategy part is covered by another stream. While this means the consultation and information in this proposal is primarily for those within the scope of the stream, we also welcome feedback from those who work closely with our Policy people which includes the Strategy team. As you’ll see in the next section about our Key Shifts, the way we work together with others is a major focus of this work. The Key Shifts We engaged with a large range of stakeholders both internal and external to consider how we could improve our focus. While very positive about PAS they identified several ways we could make a bigger contribution. Many stakeholders talked about the pace of change and the increasingly complex world we are operating in due to advances in technology, the ways of doing business, and the way people live their lives. They talked about us needing to ensure that a wider range of voices were heard in the policy making process. They told us solutions that might have worked theoretically in the past may no longer be fit for purpose in a complex and fast changing world. They felt we need to engage more, and earlier in the policy process, with customers and users to ensure policy would work in the real world. They also felt that we could be clearer about why we pick the things we do to work on. Some of these concerns were echoed within PAS. It was felt that we can sometimes start developing solutions before being clear about the problem and that this can lead to a more complex solution than was necessary. Another concern is that often once consultation had begun it was very challenging and difficult to significantly revisit options and solutions already identified. Someone likened it to being on a waterfall and trying to swim back up. This can mean that sometimes our policy solutions may not accomplish the optimal balance between achieving what was intended and being practical to implement. They encouraged us to think beyond just the legislation as the lever to influence behaviour. The consequences of legislating for every possible behavioural response and circumstance has sometimes led to complexity and uncertainty in the legislation. 11 IN CONFIDENCE We lift our view up and out to focus on what matters for economic and social wellbeing We are focused on the sustainability of advice we provide for today’s issues, while maintaining awareness of future opportunities and challenges. This includes influencing across the economic and social agenda, recognising Inland Revenue’s role as part of the wider public service. We are key partners in supporting the government’s economic and social policy agenda. Prioritisation is undertaken with a focus on what matters most for the outcomes that we are trying to achieve, including consideration for future needs. Decisions and priorities are visible to Inland Revenue and our stakeholders and we regularly reassess to ensure the work remains appropriately prioritised. Being responsive today and shaping tomorrow We regularly review the parts of the tax and social policy system most in need to ensure that policy intent is achieved. Furthermore, we apply ourselves and prepare for the large strategic issues that either have not been solved before or that are expected to emerge in the future. Enabling the Key Shifts Enablers are key to facilitating and achieving the shifts Although an essential part of our future operating model, changes to roles and structure alone will not achieve the key shifts. The structural change only supports what we need to change in the way we work – our enabler streams. We have discussed, workshopped and tested with a wide range of people (policy, PAS, IR and stakeholders) what the key things are that we need to do differently. We are calling the areas we’ve identified that require change for us to achieve the key shifts our Enablers. The Enablers we have prioritised to support the three key shifts are: • Effective engagement • Clear prioritisation, assurance of quality and resource allocation • Capability uplift including leadership • An enabling culture These enablers are interdependent. It will be through these enablers working in alignment that we will drive changes to our processes, capability and behaviour that will become noticeable to policy staff, colleagues and stakeholders. The enablers have been led by the following teams: • Engagement – Mike Nutsford • Prioritisation and Quality – Carolyn Elliott and Maraina Hak • Capability uplift – Chris Gillion, Anna Pearson and Cory Smith • Culture – Eddie Edmonds and David Carrigan (with support from Nigel Mehta- Wilson and Anna Pearson) 12 IN CONFIDENCE This next section covers the work to date in each of these enabler streams, all of which have influenced, informed or supported the proposed changes to roles and structure and provide important context for the proposal overall. Effective engagement Effective engagement will require: • Greater integration and networking with other parts of IR, other agencies, stakeholders and customers • seeking stakeholder perspectives at all stages in the policy development process • greater diversity and inclusion in the policy process, through involvement of other areas and applying differing 'lenses' to a common problem/issue/opportunity • improved understanding of decision rights • new skills and capabilities It is essential that we consider, initiate and maintain relationships with key stakeholders and regularly engage with them alongside the policy development process. This is where we’ll have the most influence on achieving the key shifts of being responsive today and shaping tomorrow as well as more broadly influencing the social and economic agenda. To achieve outcomes focused policy development, all products developed from our policy advice should lead towards achieving the policy intent, including legislation, communications, IT system rules, operational processes and customer actions. Ways of working that will embed this shift include: • A networked approach: policy is developed with others from the outset, rather than in isolation – ensuring various perspectives inform and are given due consideration in development of the problem definition, advice, design and implementation, and legislative drafting. • Participation and co-design: engaging earlier and more often with different customers and stakeholders in different ways – a tailored approach rather than a standard approach which ensures involvement of diverse perspectives and opinions and testing of our assumptions at the right time. • A systemic, integrated, iterative change process: working with change teams and external providers (e.g. software providers) early and iteratively to access the benefits of technological change to deliver better solutions. This could include more experimental approaches, and trialling change with fast feedback loops to then develop wider solutions. • More evidence-based policy: use of more qualitative evidence from customer insights to help identify areas where more research/analytics are needed, undertake post-implementation review/evaluation, and more constant monitoring of products. We need to involve the right people at the right time in the right way with the right information – a tangible example of the benefits of being intelligence-led, customer-centric and agile! The appropriate extent and intensity of engagement will vary from project to project and it is unlikely this can be prescribed. For each project we undertake we need to think 16 IN CONFIDENCE Things we can improve: Data and information (intelligence-led) Policy will continuously improve our intelligence capability in the future operating model. Business Transformation provides an opportunity to enhance and obtain more useful information for the Commissioner’s assessment, assurance and stewardship functions. This is a key component of Inland Revenue’s intelligence strategy. Policy will work across Inland Revenue to improve the information collected for our stewardship role. Policy will also contribute to, and benefit from, wider intelligence initiatives, within Inland Revenue, across agencies and internationally. We will increasingly combine qualitative and quantitative information to: • Help with the early identification of areas for policy improvement; • Inform post-implementation evaluation of new legislation; • Prioritise items not yet on the tax policy work programme and • Contribute to our wider stewardship role across government. Legislative drafting We have received feedback that our legislative drafting may not always follow ‘re-write’ and/or plain language principles and can therefore sometimes be difficult to follow and suffer from an internal inconsistency of style. Feedback we received said that we are sometimes more prescriptive than necessary. Where this happens the reasons will vary, but can include: • insufficient drafting (and policy) time available to produce a quality product and complete all the necessary quality review processes (including, where appropriate, external consultation on draft wording for legislation); • inconsistent adherence to re-write principles; • inherent complexities in the policies being drafted; • lack of early and meaningful engagement in the policy process with those who need to apply the legislation (in order to ensure that the end output will achieve agreed and intended policy outcomes); • wanting to ensure every possible scenario is covered in the legislation and • not having drafters involved early enough in the policy development process, where it is appropriate to do so. In reaction to this we intend to apply the engagement guidelines for policy to the drafting process to ensure that stakeholder views are elicited early and can guide, where appropriate, the drafting of legislation. We are seeking a third-party assessment to confirm (or otherwise) the continued appropriateness of the drafting ‘re-write’ principles. Against an agreed framework, we then assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of our drafting by undertaking a quality review (similar to that which we currently undertake for policy projects). This review will help us to determine where we are achieving our drafting goals, and where we need to focus more in developing our policy and drafting processes and outputs. 17 IN CONFIDENCE We will continue to ensure that there is sufficient time and drafting capacity to both draft legislation and, crucially, undertake effective peer review. For larger policy changes, where appropriate, we will plan for a more structured iterative drafting process and look for more external opportunities to test the drafting output wherever time permits. Those accountable for developing the policy advice to the point of Ministerial endorsement will be responsible for ensuring that the legislative output delivers on the policy intent, although the accountability for the final form of the draft legislation will rest with the drafting team. Editing and communications It is proposed that: • A simple statement of editing, peer review, accountabilities and expectations be produced which should clarify who is to edit and what can be expected from that. This will not change the primary accountability of the proposed Policy Lead to ensure that the outputs from their team are fit for purpose. • Leaders need to find ways of providing feedback to editors to ensure continuous improvement of the quality of editing especially in terms of the uptake of technical knowledge that will improve the value from edits over time. • There is clearer demarcation of accountability for information that is released on the website. This would result in for example the support team, comms team and policy team accountabilities being clear about who is to do what and who can make decisions about when something is ready to upload or whether timelines can be extended. Guidance on the policy process • We need up to date reference material and guidance on the policy process including how to engage with Ministers or select committees. This will be enhanced by reintroducing the FEC Ministerial training course, and a lateral hire induction programme. Quality assurance To increase consistency across teams it is proposed that: • Clear accountabilities are established for roles at each stage of the policy process including peer review. • Peer review guidance sets expectations for what should be peer reviewed and what this entails. Capability uplift including leadership Supporting Policy Careers Our key shifts will establish and maintain our reputation as one of the best policy shops in New Zealand. One of the unique challenges of Policy at IR is that our people not only need to develop the policy craft, but also build up technical knowledge of the complex tax and social welfare systems and how they work. The way we look after and develop our people is critical to achieving the reputation of being one of the best policy shops in NZ and should benefit those who work with us now and in the future. 18 IN CONFIDENCE Our People’s Capabilities We will need new and improved capabilities across the group to engage effectively, prioritise well and influence broadly with a view to ensuring we develop policy that is fit for purpose in the future as well as now. We are building on IR’s people capabilities and have adopted the DPMC policy project’s skills framework to tailor our capability approach to the specialisation of the Policy Group. This melding of frameworks allows Policy to align how we grow and recognise capability within IR and draw on development offerings from across IR while remaining relevant to the wider public sector. This will ensure we build the capabilities we need to work in IR while also building policy skills more broadly. The emphasis for this enabler stream of work is to uplift capabilities at a team and group- wide basis, whereas the shift to capability-based role descriptions helps us to identify the areas where we may need to develop as individuals to achieve the outcomes we are aiming for. More information about the capability-based roles we are proposing can be found in Parts B, C & the supporting documents on the policy intranet page. The increasing recognition and use of the DPMC policy skills framework across the New Zealand public sector reflects the relevance of the capabilities and skills expressed by that work for policy practitioners and a modern policy group. Using the IR people capabilities, the DPMC policy skills framework and the DPMC policy capability maturity matrix, as well as drawing on the experience of our practitioners, the following capabilities were identified as priorities to address across the group: Leadership and Change Management Our leaders are role models and need to demonstrate the behaviours we expect of our people. Leaders need a strong focus on coaching and developing others to ensure our people are supported and empowered to do their best work and develop their careers. Effective leadership will be needed to: • Achieve and maintain a culture which encourages innovation, manages risk, and expects quality outputs • have quality coaching conversations with individuals which support and encourage our people to grow their capabilities and contributions • support and encourage our people to achieve quality outcomes and to innovate in their work • role model our desired culture and behaviours Some of the leadership development we will explore includes: • Diversity and Inclusion - how to be mindful allowing others to have their say and being open to differing perspectives • Leadership and development of people as well as leadership of strategic projects and thinking • Managing Change – how to participate in, shepherd, and embrace change with dignity and respect (Change Management) • Leading and coaching for success and for capability development 19 IN CONFIDENCE Policy Quality & Agility We need to learn and embed design thinking – the process of forming policy solutions with a system mindset that anticipates the future. Customer Advisory and Business Acumen This may include an uplift in: • Project Management – how to run a process to time • Political and Parliamentary Engagement – how to address and respond in FEC and with Ministers (engagement training) • How to write for the audience • Engagement and Consultation – how to facilitate and draw out perspectives and interests while negotiating and managing expectations (this should include establishing good working relationships and will naturally support ‘business acumen and partnering’) • Te Reo (language) and Tikanga Maori (protocols) – the essential skills to participate in engagement sensitively and appropriately Digital Literacy • Technology – making the most out of our infrastructure We will deliver enhanced capabilities through a prioritised learning and development programme based around these priority areas. Policy as part of an Inland Revenue Ecosystem The proposed changes we are consulting on reflect a decision to focus our policy expertise and capability uplift on policy specific areas rather than to duplicate capability that is strong in other parts of Inland Revenue. Policy capability is inherently dependent on outputs from other parts of our organisation such as strong and sustainable infrastructure and systems including information management, intelligence and website hosting. It is more efficient and effective to draw on the wider organisations’ expertise and capacity rather than replicating infrastructure and processes that require specialist but not policy expertise. This principle is also applied to the proposed policy operating model. For example, rather than having our own web hosting arrangements we will access the service provided by IT&C, or rather than initiating our own information collection we will draw on II&S to collect the information we need. This means our policy resources can be focused on the policy work for which we have the strongest capability. 20 IN CONFIDENCE An enabling culture Achieving the shifts will mean that we need to develop a culture which values: • Being open and responsive to the contributions of others through effective engagement and, • prioritising what we work on and the quality of our outputs To achieve our key shifts, we’ll need to make changes in behaviour, capability, and processes and the convergence of these is where we’ll see tangible improvements in our openness and quality, supporting the success of our other enablers and making the progress we need. To be open and curious to engage with others effectively we need to establish and reinforce a culture where we: • Are comfortable and secure in not having all the answers ourselves • See the value in ‘enabling’ the development of robust solutions, and believe that this is a valued behaviour • Appreciate the value of diverse ideas and thinking in producing a better outcome • Don’t equate engaging others in the process with a loss of ownership • Feel it is a valuable use of time to contribute to work led by others We also identified that any sustained change would only come by ensuring: • Leaders set expectations, and model actions • Acknowledgement and rewards for good engagement practices • Processes that are clear and documented such as the engagement ‘cook book’ and process guidelines • Building facilitation capabilities, and meeting protocols • Increased capability in Tikanga Maori (Protocols) and Te Reo. How it all comes together The enabler workstreams are well underway and are making progress towards our key shifts. We also need to consider how our structure, teams and roles support the future direction we are heading in, and what this means for our people. The next section (Part B) takes you through the detail of the proposed structure, teams and roles, then Part C provides more detail on the impacts. Individual role descriptions are available on the PAS intranet page. 21 IN CONFIDENCE PART B: Policy’s organising model and structure We developed a proposed organising model to deliver our key shifts and support us to realise the benefits from the Enabler workstreams. We are now proposing a structure that will give effect to that model. New larger flexible teams Our current structure is based around a team structure that was developed for historical reasons and has remained fairly constant over time. While there are advantages in the stability of teams and ensuring we maintain capability and expertise in key areas, fixed teams can make it more difficult to adjust resources to easily adapt to the priorities as they change. This is key to achieving Inland Revenue’s aim to become an agile organisation, working at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly and focusing on the things that matter most. Our proposed model for Policy is based on Domain Teams. Domains are designed to align products and customer types where possible, and to achieve a roughly even distribution of people while recognising and responding to different demands. Greater team size will reduce silos and create opportunities for our senior advisors/analysts to grow their leadership skills, as they will be required to support leaders run the business in leading projects and policy work. Domains could be reallocated across teams (if required) to follow shifting emphasis over time. This would be considered following planning and prioritisation of the work programme. The table below shows you the five domains we are proposing to organise teams around in the first instance of the Future Operating Model, which could change over time. Alongside these domains are two functional teams – Economics & Stewardship, and Legislative drafting. The five domain teams and Legislative drafting will be led by a Policy Lead. The Economics & Stewardship team will be led by the Chief Economist. Two teams are in essence focused on ensuring the sustainability of the Income Tax Base – one with an international focus and the other addressing taxation issues concerning businesses and other entities key to the tax base. 24 IN CONFIDENCE Policy Director / Policy Lead Achieving the shifts necessary for Policy will require dedicated and skilled leadership in the form of proposed new Policy Director and Policy Lead roles, which alongside the Deputy Commissioner set the strategic vision while coaching and supporting the people they lead. The proposed new Policy Director roles have a broad leadership responsibility across the group as well as being responsible for the portfolios allocated to the teams they oversee, and any other strategic portfolios allocated by the Deputy Commissioner. These portfolios will change from time to time as priorities and work pressures change. The domain teams within each Policy Director’s portfolio will be determined by a combination of factors such as: • Aligning teams likely to have a lot of interdependency • Sharing the focus on high priority and strategic/conceptual and system maintenance • Balancing workload The proposed domain teams will be led by a Policy Lead. It is proposed there are 6 Policy Leads. One of those will lead the Legislative Drafting Team. We are proposing that each Policy team will have on average 10 people. This is an increase from the existing average of about 7 people and will necessitate a shift from the current Policy Manager towards greater emphasis on leading the team over leading policy development. Chief Economist and the Economics and Stewardship team The proposed Economics and Stewardship team would be led by a Chief Economist. It is proposed that this Leader will be appointed based on their economics specialisation. It is proposed that the Chief Economist will have a reporting line change from the Deputy Commissioner to a Policy Director, as this allows for greater alignment between the work of the Chief Economist and that led by the Policy Director. The Chief Economist role is included in the Policy Lead role description, due to the similarities in requirements of people, team and domain leadership, while still recognising the importance of the economics specialism. The team will build up the Policy group knowledge and understanding of the likely economic impacts and distributional effects of tax and social policy changes, work on policy issues with major economic impacts and be a resource to support the five domain teams. An additional focus for the team is on leadership of strategic policy/policy stewardship. This will include leading Inland Revenue’s regulatory stewardship and forming the strategic guidance for planning the tax policy work programme. A more system-based approach to identifying priorities and future stewardship focus will be developed. This team will also need to work closely with the strategy team. New networked ways of working in recent years has increased the flow of information on policy problems being identified and passed on to the right teams in Policy. Examples include the introduction of the Right from the Start Committee, Customer Centric Committee, the Technical Governance Committee, the customer segment strategies, and various other groups. Policy intelligence is becoming a critical part of every team’s role. 25 IN CONFIDENCE This has reduced the need for Policy to have a dedicated role to liaise with other parts of Inland Revenue to identify policy intelligence concerns. Strategic Policy Advisors The proposed new Strategic Policy Advisor positions provide a unique opportunity for highly capable leaders to influence in a specific domain or strategic area by applying a greater focus than is possible when leading a team. To achieve the key shifts we need to have the capacity to provide strong technical and intellectual leadership and retain our reputation domestically and internationally with key stakeholders. With bigger teams and more focus from Policy Leads on growing and developing their people, it is proposed that reporting to each Policy Director is a Strategic Policy Advisor. These Strategic Policy Advisors will provide additional intellectual leadership and build strategic policy capability in the group, and within IR. They will play a critical role in supporting our focus on the future of the tax system and our contribution to the Government’s economic and social agenda and joining the dots. They will be recognised both nationally and internationally for their technical expertise and strategic influence. These roles are essential for our increased stewardship capability and will provide capacity for new product innovation. This could include, for example, leading large cross-cutting projects, working closely with Directors on system level questions, or influencing external thinking on particular issues. A recent example would have been to lead our thinking across the group on the Tax Working Group. Strategic Policy Advisors will be key members of the broader leadership team. Policy Advisors We propose to have a Policy Advisor job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Policy Advisor role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Policy Analyst • Level 2 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Analyst • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Advisor. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. However, while it is proposed the new role descriptions will no longer formally refer to levels of ‘seniority’ we will continue to use titles that are recognisable for external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment. The naming convention we propose to use for these roles is: • Policy Advisor (i.e. level 1) • Senior Policy Advisor (i.e. level 2) • Principal Policy Advisor (i.e. level 3) An advantage of the proposed policy advisor job family is that appointments can be made to the role and the level based on business need (affordability and capability requirement) 26 IN CONFIDENCE and candidate quality. For example, rather than a team having 2 Senior Policy Advisors, 4 Senior Policy Analysts and 2 Policy Analysts (as currently), the team might have 8 Policy Advisor roles, where the distribution of Levels 1, 2 and 3 can flex as required for budget and capability needs over time. We recognise we will need to do further work on identifying how this will happen in a more transparent way. The Policy Advisor – Level 2, currently ‘Senior Policy Analyst’ should be seen as a role from which one may develop their career in both the technical and people leadership aspects to varying degrees depending on where you would like to head. For example, aiming towards a Policy Lead role, or Policy Advisor – Level 3 role. The Policy Advisor – Level 3, currently ‘Senior Policy Advisor’ will continue to be a role to aspire to for those wishing to advance their career. Appointments to the Policy Advisor - Level 3 role will be made when exceptional skills and experience are needed to maintain or increase the capability of the Policy Group. Graduates (Assistant Policy Analysts) Graduates will be appointed to the Policy Advisor – Level 1 role and will be paid in a ‘graduate development remuneration range’ which would be an extension of the range for the Policy Advisor – Level 1. After eighteen months a graduate Policy Advisor paid in this ‘graduate development remuneration range’ and who has developed as expected will have their salary adjusted to the bottom of the Policy Advisor – Level 1 remuneration range. This is consistent with the process that we currently apply to graduates employed as assistant policy analysts. Legislative Counsel We propose to have a Legislative Counsel job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Legislative Counsel role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Assistant Legislative Counsel • Level 2 has no current equivalent job expectation • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Legislative Counsel. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. There is a question as to whether or not it would be beneficial for the Legislative Counsel job family to include seniority in the titles. One possibility could be to use the following titles with external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Parliament/Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment: • Associate Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 1) • Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 2) • Senior Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 3) 27 IN CONFIDENCE Business Support Business support in policy requires different activities to be carried out from business support across the rest of the organisation. However, the capabilities we require for efficient and effective business support reflect the capability needs in other parts of Inland Revenue. On this basis it is proposed that business support roles within Policy use enterprise wide capability-based role descriptions. Traditionally PAS has set up its own support roles, despite these roles sometimes being duplicated elsewhere in the organisation. The new model ensures that where infrastructure or generic support services are provided across IR we will not duplicate these in our policy business support. Many of these functions are provided by, for example, Facilities Management, and will be superseded as people increasingly self-help through the Enterprise Support Service. We also expect that there will be a need to participate in any further thinking about the future of business support across IR given the pending introduction of Enterprise Support Services and our intention to align with the wider organisational direction. Key Partners Communications The work of the Communications team will be impacted by the changes in the way that we work in Policy in the future as this team is essential to supporting effective engagement and producing quality policy products. The Communications team is not included in the organisational changes proposed and an assumption is that the communications team capacity will continue to be available. Forecasting Forecasting is integral to the policy process. This team and their work has not been considered as part of this proposed future operating model. An assumption is that the forecasting team outputs will continue to be available. Strategy This proposal does not address the strategy future operating model. However, it is acknowledged that a strong link exists which is assumed will be maintained to strategic policy and fore-sighting and maintaining cross agency support. Policy design and implementation This proposal does not include changes to the policy design and implementation capability that the policy process is dependent on. It is assumed that this capability will continue to be available to the policy group. The Policy future operating model is intended to be flexible and able to accommodate alternate models for the delivery of the design and implementation functionality. 29 IN CONFIDENCE New enterprise role descriptions developed for this proposal We are consulting on the Role Description, as well as the proposal to implement it in Policy Programme Lead Existing enterprise role descriptions proposed in this proposal We are consulting on the proposal to implement the Role Description in Policy Team Lead – Level 1 Capability & Outcomes Specialist – Level 1 Analyst – Level 2 Business Support – Level 2 Should this proposal proceed it is expected that new Policy Advisors would be recruited into permanent roles. While it is expected that this could be two to three new Policy Advisors, the actual number and level sought for permanent roles may be influenced by appointments made through the transition process. Potential impact on positions within Policy & Strategy The tables below provide detailed information for each current position in the Policy & Strategy team, outlining potential impacts if the proposed changes go ahead. Positions out of scope The following positions are not included in this proposal. Role Title Number of positions Reason Deputy Commissioner 1 This role will be considered when similar roles in other parts of the organisation are designed Personal Assistant to Deputy Commissioner 1 This role will be considered when similar roles in other parts of the organisation are designed Senior Officer Legislative Drafting 1 The wording of this role description needs to be considered alongside other roles that support business delivery across the organisation Strategy Director and teams All The Strategy group function is not included in this proposal. These roles will be considered when other parts of the organisation are designed. Potential impact on positions As mentioned in Part A, we are proposing to move to capability-based role descriptions and align Policy with Inland Revenue’s organisational design. From a technical employment perspective this means that all ‘in scope’ roles are proposed to be disestablished. 30 IN CONFIDENCE Where the proposed role is determined as being the ‘same or similar’ as the current role and there is no change to the number of new roles, the proposed transition is for the person to be confirmed into the new role. Where this is not the case an alternative transition approach is proposed. The table below provides you with further information on the nature of proposed changes for the ‘in scope’ roles. Current Role Current Number of positions What is proposed to change? What would be different if the proposed changes are implemented? What is the proposed transition/selection process to implement the change? Policy Director 2 positions A new Policy Director capability-based role has been developed. Under the new organisational structure, it is proposed that these roles will also have a change in the teams that report to them.

Fixed term arrangements – what these changes mean Unless advised otherwise you will remain in your fixed term role. You may apply for any other roles that come available through the usual recruitment processes. Secondments – what these changes mean The proposed changes have implications for some people who are on secondment. Every secondment is different in terms of its length and history, and some people may have moved through multiple secondments. If you are currently on secondment into Policy from a different business group, and your secondment position is to be disestablished, you will return to your substantive position at that time, or when your secondment ends, whichever is sooner. If you are applying for one of the new positions, your skills and abilities will be considered during the selection process, whether these have been gained in your substantive position or on secondment. Proposed Transition Process If the proposed change goes ahead then there will be a transition process to implement the change. This section details how we are proposing to implement the changes. This process has been developed with the aim of providing clarity for people for whom there may be significant change. This process meets the requirements of our employment agreements. We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the Management of Change provisions of your Employment Agreement. 35 IN CONFIDENCE If your permanent substantive position has been disestablished and you have not been confirmed into a position, a transition approach will apply for you. This will include consideration of a role that may be a suitable alternative position and looking for alternative pathways where appropriate. We will work closely with you through this process to ensure that you have the right support. Proposed Selection Criteria for Policy Lead and Strategic Policy Advisor positions If the proposal goes ahead, and the proposed number of Policy Lead roles and Strategic Policy Advisor positions are established, we are proposing to use an Expression of Interest (EOI) process form Policy Managers for the appointment to these positions. Documented below is the proposed process. Substantive Policy Managers will be invited to indicate their interest in the Policy Lead, Policy Lead – Chief Economist, and Strategic Policy Advisor roles by order of preference. If they have no preference, they could indicate this. If you express an interest in one of the Policy Lead roles, we will ask you to indicate which Domain(s) or team you wish to express an interest in, including your order of preference, and provide us with a view of the skills and experience that would enable your success in the role, and an explanation of your reasons for your expression of interest. For the Policy Lead – Chief Economist, we will ask you to provide us with a view of the knowledge and capability that would enable your success in relation to the economics specialisation and discipline. For the Strategic Policy Advisor roles, we will ask you to provide us your view of the skills and experience that would enable your success in relation to the Policy Quality & Agility capability, at the Expert level. For all roles, we will ask you for your view of the skills and experience that enable your success in relation to the leadership capability, at the appropriate level. Wherever possible, we will consider placing people in their preferred role. However, indicating your preference doesn’t solely determine which role you are or aren’t offered. It’s one of a range of considerations Inland Revenue uses to ensure we have the right number of people with the right capabilities and knowledge in the right roles. As previously noted, in the future Policy operating model leadership matters, and we will require leaders to have a strong focus on coaching and developing others. There will be a greater emphasis on leaders to role model and demonstrate the behaviours expected of all Inland Revenue leaders. The leadership expected of Strategic Policy Advisors will emphasise the ability to resolve highly complex strategic policy issues and collaborate successfully to achieve policy outcomes on a cross agency, national or international level. During the Expression of Interest (EOI) process we will be asking you to demonstrate your knowledge, skills and capability in leadership, as well as other areas appropriate to the roles. As we have previously noted during this consultation and during briefings, this is a proposal. We want to hear and consider your views and ideas, before any decisions are made. We will confirm the selection criteria for these roles when we communicate final decisions. 36 IN CONFIDENCE Why are we proposing an Expression of Interest (EOI) Process for Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors and how will the proposed process help inform selection outcomes? The total number of Policy Lead positions is proposed to be less than the number of Policy Manager positions we currently have and therefore all current Policy Managers will be impacted, and eligible to be considered for the new Policy Lead and the new Strategic Policy Advisor roles. The EOI process is designed to facilitate the placement of affected people by achieving an agreed match between impacted individual employee preferences for identified options, and Inland Revenue’s business needs. The process is designed to facilitate fairness and transparency for our people. How will I complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) process? If the proposal goes ahead, you will receive a link to the EOI form. The EOI form will ask you to indicate your role preferences and share with us any other information you wish to be taken into consideration, including personal circumstances. What will happen next? All EOIs will be considered by the Deputy Commissioner PAS, in conjunction with the Policy Director’s and the PAS Programme Manager. They will consider all the information provided, the requirements of the roles to deliver the future Policy model, and Inland Revenue’s business needs, to facilitate the placement of people into roles. There may not need to be any formal interview process as part of the decision-making, however a member of the panel considering the EOIs may have a conversation with you to explore or clarify the information you have provided further. What will happen once selection decisions are made? Once selection decisions have been made a member of the panel will contact you to discuss the proposed placement with you. You will have an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed placement and this will be considered before the outcome is confirmed in writing. The provisions of your Employment Agreement in relation to a suitable alternative position will apply through this process. If there are any vacancies at the end of this process, they may be advertised internally and externally using Inland Revenue’s normal recruitment process. 37 IN CONFIDENCE Transition for people into Domain and functional teams. If the proposal goes ahead we will first appoint Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors. People currently in the Drafting and Economics teams would stay in the new incarnation of those teams. Following the setting of the tax policy work programme we will confirm the domains each Policy Lead is responsible for. During this we will retain existing teams and reporting lines. We will then work through the reassignment of projects and people to Domain teams with a view to maintaining continuity in terms of what people are currently working on. When the proposed reassignments have been worked through this will be available to Policy Advisors for comment. Exactly how we facilitate these comments will be determined closer to the time and will depend in part on the Policy Lead appointments. For additional information on specific roles and other supporting documents please see the Policy Future Operating Model intranet page. 2 IN CONFIDENCE Table of Contents Final Decisions Overview

to engage with the proposal document, ask questions and give feedback. We received some really thoughtful and constructive input. Over the last few weeks the team have been considering this feedback, making some changes as a result, and focusing on where to from here. In this document you will find a summary of the key themes from your feedback, the changes we have made as a result, and some further information about some areas of the model people had questions about. With the incorporation of ideas received in consultation we are in an even stronger position to continue our journey to fully implement our three key shifts. We said in our proposal document, and many of you reflected in your feedback, that achieving our key shifts is driven by and dependant on the enablers we have identified: prioritisation, engagement, capability uplift, and culture and behaviour. These are at the core of our transition to the Future Operating Model. Following your feedback, we have made three key changes. They are: • the Chief Economist will report to the Deputy Commissioner rather than reporting to a Policy Director as originally proposed (the role is otherwise unchanged from the proposal) • the policy domain for the Legislative Drafting Team is planned to include the second Business tax domain – the nature of the policy work this team would work on was not stated in the original proposal • the graduate policy advisors will be referred to as Policy Advisors – there is no need to call out their former educationally-based status. Aside from these amendments, we will proceed with the changes as they were outlined in the proposal and confirmed in this document. A common theme from feedback was the need to lift our people leadership to achieve the changes. And this was a key enabler we had identified. However, some concerns were raised about the increased average size of policy teams and that the higher staff to Policy Lead reporting ratio may actually work against the key shifts. We have listened to and respect these concerns but in order to achieve the optimal balance between Policy Leads having an increased focus on people leadership, providing senior people with leadership opportunities and establishing the greater stewardship capability through the new Strategic Policy Advisor roles we have chosen to proceed with the proposed number of Policy Leads and resulting reporting ratios. We have also highlighted some things we will put in place to ensure we do not lose the focus on people leadership. Many of you sought clarity about how some aspects of the Future Operating Model would work. Where possible we have included some further information in this document to assist – for example regarding the role of Strategic Policy Advisor. In some cases, however, the areas identified will be part of an iterative process that we will develop as we transition to our new ways of working. An implementation plan will kick in immediately and those areas not already developed will be done at this time, in many cases in conjunction with the new Policy Leads and our people. 4 IN CONFIDENCE We have some immediate priorities in the next few weeks, including working closely with those affected by the decisions and conducting the Expression of Interest (EOI) process for the Policy Lead and Strategic Policy Advisor roles. We know that you want certainty as soon as possible so we can settle the new teams and people have clarity about who they are reporting to and working with. We plan to have the EOI process completed and roles confirmed by the end of July. Following confirmation of people into these roles, and alongside the ongoing development of our refreshed work programme, we will start to map people into teams. This may not happen immediately for everyone, but we are working to ensure people have certainty as soon as possible. We recognise that this can be an unsettling time for people and encourage you to continue to talk to your colleagues and seek support if you need it. We know you will also continue to support each other at this time. Thank you once again for your constructive and thoughtful feedback. Cath Cath Atkins, Deputy Commissioner Policy & Strategy. Supporting you through change You may feel like you’ve read this information before, but we know it’s important that we keep making sure you are aware of the support available to you at all stages of this change. Change can sometimes be unsettling no matter who you are, and especially if you are directly impacted by change. It’s important to take care of yourself through the process. Talk to people, and get support that is right for you, whether that’s from your leader, work colleagues, family or friends. You can also access a range of free support such as: Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provides a free, confidential and independent service. To make an appointment, contact EAP directly on 0800 327 669 or visit their website: www.eapservices.co.nz Hauora Hub is our one-stop, interactive site for a wealth of information and ideas to help improve your health and wellbeing. It’s constantly updated and easy to use. Find it under “quick links” on the IR homepage. If you’re a union member, your union is also available to provide support and advice during the change process. 5 IN CONFIDENCE Overview of feedback Key theme – Chief Economist and economics team Feedback was received on both the positioning of the Chief Economist and the role of the Economics and Regulatory team. There was concern that the Chief Economist role should be kept at Tier 3 (i.e. reporting to the Deputy Commissioner rather than a Policy Director as proposed). The key reasons for this concern were ensuring the role retained the appropriate level of influence and that it was able to attract the right calibre of candidates. We have considered this feedback and were persuaded that on balance there is a good rationale to have the reporting line direct to the Deputy Commissioner rather than through a Policy Director. This is reflected in the final model. The role is otherwise as proposed. We also received feedback on the role of the Economics and Stewardship team. As a result, we have included some further information in the section about the role of this team. Key theme – clarity on how operating model will work Feedback on this theme covered a range of issues relating in particular to team size and how the larger flexible teams were intended to work. This included how sign off and reporting lines would work, and what would be the respective responsibilities of Policy Leads, Strategic Advisors and Principal or Senior advisors leading projects. Some people were very supportive of the larger policy teams. However, some people expressed concern that the proposed team size was too large and if not managed properly could lead to less time being devoted to people management, increased silos, bottle-necks for sign-off and less technical oversight. Others noted these risks and either sought clarification or made suggestions about steps that could mitigate these risks. A key area of focus was the interaction and division of responsibility between Policy Leads and Principal or Senior Advisors who would be leading projects. We have considered the feedback on team size but have confirmed the proposed approach of moving to larger teams. We note that similar sized teams, if not larger, are very common in other policy shops around town. The intent of larger teams is to reduce silos and to have Policy Leads focus more of their time on the leadership and development of their people. This does not mean that our Leads will not be required to provide technical support, as rather than using organisation-wide leader roles, we have created a specialised Policy Lead role. We recognise to develop and grow our capability, Leads will continue to play a key role in supporting technical capability building. However, we expect the key focus of our Policy Leads is to lead and develop their people well. Some of the submissions discussed the placement of some Policy Advisors in the drafting team. There was concern this would not be an attractive option for advisors if the work didn’t provide the opportunity to undertake full policy projects or if it was not clear what domain or area that team would focus on. However, some submissions noted that it could potentially provide a development opportunity for those advisors interested in trying their hand at drafting. We now confirm that a number of Policy Advisors may be placed in a team with the Legislative Counsel as proposed. In the first instance we expect that these Policy Advisors 6 IN CONFIDENCE will be working in the Business and Entity Taxation domain. The final distribution of domains will need to be confirmed as we finalise the Tax Policy Work Programme but based on its development so far and feedback received it seems likely that the Business and Entity Taxation domain will need to cover more than one team. The addition of Policy Advisors in a second team will provide a better balance of people across teams, will help ensure the integration of that team with the wider group, and will create development opportunities for the Policy Lead in this area. Many submissions focused on key success factors for the larger teams and the operating model in general. These included accountability and expectations, workload management, capability, development opportunities and the way in which senior members of the team work with and support the Policy Leads. These factors all form a key part of the implementation approach. We have included some more detail on these topics in this document, however some aspects will continue to be worked through as we move into the new model and transition to our new teams and roles. It will be important for both our Policy Leads and our people to be involved in designing any new processes and expectations as part of the implementation plan to ensure they are fit for purpose. This may involve some refinement as we find the balance that works best. An initial step has been taken by introducing a RACI accountability matrix to ensure people are clear about their role in a project (RACI = Responsible / Accountable / Consult / Inform) to the projects being commissioned as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme refresh. Another key aspect of the transition will be updating “My Plans” for all people to ensure these are a clear and up-to-date record of workload and development needs and opportunities. Policy Leads will update these as a priority with their people. This will be an ongoing key focus as part of the Whanake approach. These plans will be particularly important in the transition to ensure workloads are managed and people settle into their new teams with a clear development and work plan. The role of the Strategic Policy Advisor was another area where many people sought greater detail. We have added some further information about this role later in this document. Key theme – capability uplift and developing leadership Submissions highlighted that capability uplift is a core success factor for embedding the Future Operating Model. Leadership was a particularly strong theme, as was ensuring that enough coaching, training, and support was given to both Policy Leads and to Principal and Senior Advisors leading projects. Capability uplift was highlighted in Part A of the proposal document as a key enabler of the change. As many people have identified, one of the key areas of focus needs to be on leadership – both for those in formal leadership roles and for those Senior and Principal Advisors potentially taking on greater leadership of projects. We were pleased to see managers raising this as an area where they would be looking for support. We are committed to an ongoing focus on leadership and this will form a key part of development and support for Policy Leads in particular. This will commence immediately upon confirming Policy Leads into their new roles. Development pathways for people was an area mentioned in submissions, in particular how leadership development would occur in the new model. We recognise that this was an area of concern for some. Informal (non-structural) leadership opportunities, project 7 IN CONFIDENCE leadership and acting roles will continue to be important ways for people to contribute and develop. The new model with larger more flexible teams provides more opportunity for senior and principal advisors to lead projects and work with Policy Leads to lead policy development and assist with the development of others in the team. It was also suggested that mentoring of people (outside of specific projects) could be another tool to both provide support and development opportunities. Another area identified in submissions was Māori capability. Again, this is an area already identified as needing investment in training to support engagement with Māori. We see this as a priority. We were also challenged to think further about how to grow our Māori capability over time, including by potentially identifying suitably qualified people across IR to move into Policy. This is something we intend to investigate further as part of our ongoing capability uplift work. Key theme – role titles and role descriptions In general, feedback on the new roles was positive, particularly regarding the Policy Advisor roles and the externally facing titles proposed for these roles. It was suggested that it might be preferable not to use “graduate” in the title of those advisors on the graduate programme, as this might hinder their ability to interact with other agencies or stakeholders. Rather than having a stand-alone role description, this role sits within the development range for Advisor Level 1, which equates to the Advisor title externally. We agree that it is appropriate for graduates to also use the Advisor title when communicating externally. Concern was raised that the Policy Lead role should retain the current Policy Manager designation because “Policy Lead” may not be clear for external stakeholders, was not consistent with wider public sector naming, and potentially signalled something less than the current “Policy Manager” title. Replacing Manager titles with Lead wherever possible is an organisation-wide decision as part of Inland Revenue’s principles of the new organisation. “Lead” titles are used to signify the importance of people leadership to the role. While “Policy Manager” is used in a number of other agencies, we do not consider the Policy Lead title will cause significant confusion for external stakeholders and it should be relatively simple for Policy Leads to explain their role by referencing the old title of “Policy Manager” if needed. Some specific questions and comments were received about the role descriptions, mostly relating to the identified capabilities for each. Setting the capabilities at the right level always requires some judgement. These have been reviewed and we have confirmed that the current role descriptions and capabilities are fit for purpose at this stage for the organisational design. 10 IN CONFIDENCE matrix) framework for projects in the planning phase – this process is being introduced as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme refresh. The expectation of the new Policy Lead role is that the focus is on leadership of the team and development of people. Leadership capability and support will be a key focus of the transition. We will be seeking feedback from people as the new model settles in, to ensure that these expectations are being met. As part of the transition process Policy Leads will be ensuring they have “My Plans” in place for all people reporting to them so there is a clear understanding of workload alongside development needs and opportunities. This is something Policy Leads will be expected to maintain a focus on over time and will require input from, and coordination with, those in the team leading projects and with other Policy Leads and Strategic Advisors where people are working across teams or projects. Chief Economist and the Economics and Stewardship team The Economics and Stewardship team will be led by a Chief Economist who will be appointed based on their economics specialisation. The Chief Economist will report to the Deputy Commissioner. This will preserve the influence of this role. The role size and role description is unchanged from that which was proposed. The Chief Economist role is included in the Policy Lead role description, due to the similarities in requirements of people, team and domain leadership, while still recognising the importance of the economics specialism. The team will build up the Policy group’s knowledge and understanding of the likely economic impacts and distributional effects of tax and social policy changes, work on policy issues with major economic impacts and be a resource to support the five domain teams. An additional focus for the team is on leadership of strategic policy/policy stewardship. This will include supporting Inland Revenue’s regulatory stewardship and forming the strategic guidance for planning the tax policy work programme. A more system-based approach to identifying priorities and future stewardship focus will be developed. This team will also need to work closely with the strategy team. The role of the economics team will primarily fall into the following key areas: • Guardian/steward – understanding how the whole system fits together, its strengths and weaknesses, how different systems might operate and why or how we might want to change over time. A core aspect of this role will be leading Policy input into processes such as the BIM that explain the frameworks underpinning our tax system. • Advisor – providing economic input into policy projects. This is a key role of the team and will occupy a significant amount of the day-to-day work. • Educative – involvement in policy roundtables, tax economics reading group and policy courses to help inform and kindle an interest in economics across Policy. • Engagement – including with external stakeholders, the Treasury tax strategy team, and other agencies. Internal engagement will also be a feature, with areas such as research, forecasting and strategy. • Regulatory stewardship – including the regular reporting obligations agencies have in place to report to central agencies on regulatory performance. This will include involvement in making more information available to the public to enable greater 11 IN CONFIDENCE visibility over aspects of the tax and social policy systems of which Inland Revenue is a part. New networked ways of working in recent years has increased the flow of information on policy problems being identified and passed on to the right teams in Policy. Examples include the introduction of the Right from the Start Committee, Customer Centric Committee, the Technical Governance Committee, the customer segment strategies, and various other groups. Policy intelligence is becoming a critical part of every team’s role. This has reduced the need for Policy to have a dedicated role to liaise with other parts of Inland Revenue to identify policy intelligence concerns. However, it is important to ensure that other areas within Inland Revenue can easily refer material or questions to the right teams. A process will be established for this. Strategic Policy Advisors A Strategic Policy Advisor will advise on a specific domain or strategic area. Being part of the Policy broader leadership team will mean that the Strategic Policy Advisor will achieve strong engagement with and influence the Policy Leads and Directors to ensure that the domain or strategic area gets the necessary leadership attention. A Domain or strategic area befitting allocation to a Strategic Policy Advisor could be one in which: • there is a need to develop and continue to maintain and enhance a relationship with an especially demanding stakeholder group • the reputation of the responsible advisor or key policy contact is critical to success • the complexity is such that continuity is necessary to build a deep understanding of a specialised body of knowledge • the stakes are high on the success of the project (reputation of the whole group may depend on it) Strategic Policy Advisors are expected to be our strongest policy practitioners with a deep and broad understanding of the tax and or social policy systems. They will be recognised both nationally and internationally for their technical expertise and strategic influence. They will be trusted to lead the most complex or the most sensitive of policy projects and have earned the reputation for delivery to exceedingly high standards in exceptionally demanding situations. They will be capable of leading IR’s engagement with senior Ministers and key stakeholders. To achieve the key shifts we need to have the capacity to provide strong technical and intellectual leadership and retain our reputation domestically and internationally with key stakeholders. Strategic Policy Advisors will provide this intellectual leadership and build strategic policy capability in the group, and within IR. These roles are essential for our increased stewardship capability and will provide capacity for new product innovation. Strategic Policy Advisors will be key members of the broader leadership team. Examples of the type of responsibilities a Strategic Policy Advisor may have are: • leading the development of a new tax regime (eg a corrective environmental tax regime) • leading a review of our tax system • representing New Zealand and leading the resolution of issues with international implications 12 IN CONFIDENCE • designing a capital gains tax • leading large cross-cutting projects, working closely with Directors on system level questions, or influencing external thinking on particular issues. Policy Advisors We will have a Policy Advisor job family with three levels. The use of job families means that fewer separate role descriptions are needed. Job families make sense when a number of roles are working toward the same outcomes and the more complex roles subsume the capabilities of the less complex roles. The new levels in the Policy Advisor role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Policy Analyst • Level 2 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Analyst • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Senior Policy Advisor. Inland Revenue is no longer including “seniority labels” in role descriptions. However, while the new role descriptions will no longer formally refer to levels of ‘seniority’ we will continue to use titles that are recognisable for external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment. The naming convention we will use for these roles is: • Policy Advisor (i.e. level 1) • Senior Policy Advisor (i.e. level 2) • Principal Policy Advisor (i.e. level 3) An advantage of the Policy Advisor job family is that appointments can be made to the role and the level based on business need (affordability and capability requirement) and candidate quality. For example, rather than a team having 2 Senior Policy Advisors, 4 Senior Policy Analysts and 2 Policy Analysts (as currently), the team might have 8 Policy Advisor roles, where the distribution of Levels 1, 2 and 3 can flex as required for budget and capability needs over time. We recognise we will need to do further work on identifying how this will happen in a more transparent way. The Policy Advisor – Level 1, equates to the current Policy Analyst position. Graduates will be appointed to the Policy Advisor – Level 1 role and will be paid in a ‘graduate development remuneration range’ which would be an extension of the range for the Policy Advisor – Level 1. From your feedback the reference to “Graduate” in the role title will not be used. The Policy Advisor – Level 2, currently ‘Senior Policy Analyst’ should be seen as a role from which one may develop their career in both the technical and people leadership aspects to varying degrees depending on where you would like to head. For example, aiming towards a Policy Lead role, or Policy Advisor – Level 3 role. The Policy Advisor – Level 3, currently ‘Senior Policy Advisor’ will continue to be a role to aspire to for those wishing to advance their career. Appointments to the Policy Advisor - Level 3 role will be made when exceptional skills and experience are needed to maintain or increase the capability of the Policy Group. Thus, the decision to recruit Policy Advisors at Level 3 will be made based on ‘business need’ assessed by the recruiting Policy Lead with the endorsement of a Policy Director. 13 IN CONFIDENCE Legislative Counsel We will have a Legislative Counsel job family with three levels. The new levels in the Legislative Counsel role description equate to existing roles as follows: • Level 1 is equivalent to the existing Assistant Legislative Counsel • Level 2 has no current equivalent job expectation • Level 3 is equivalent to the existing Legislative Counsel. The following titles will be used with external stakeholders to identify expertise or authority, for example with Parliament/Ministers/other agencies and for recruitment: • Associate Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 1) • Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 2) • Senior Legislative Counsel (i.e. level 3) Business Support Business support roles within Policy will use enterprise wide capability-based role descriptions. Business support will need to align with the Policy Future Operating Model and this will necessitate rethinking how teams are supported and how our business support capability is used most effectively and efficiently across the group. We expect that there will also be a need to participate in any further thinking about the future of business support across IR given the pending introduction of Enterprise Support Services and our intention to align with the wider organisational direction. 19 IN CONFIDENCE Leadership (Applied) Demonstrated experience of: - Role modelling IR’s values through your behaviours and decisions - Providing thought leadership within the policy function, identifying emerging trends and considering potential implications to support appropriate policy responses Customer Advisory (Expert) Demonstrated experience of: - Being a recognised subject matter expert to enhance the national and international tax policy social system What will happen once selection decisions are made Once selection decisions have been made a member of the panel will contact you to discuss the proposed outcome with you. You will have an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed outcome and this will be considered before the outcome is confirmed in writing. The provisions of your Employment Agreement in relation to a suitable alternative position will apply through this process. If there are any vacancies at the end of this process, they may be advertised internally and externally using Inland Revenue’s normal recruitment process. Transition for people into Domain and functional teams We will first appoint Policy Leads and Strategic Policy Advisors. People currently in the Drafting and Economics teams will stay in the new form of those teams (Legislative Drafting and Economics and Stewardship respectively). Following the setting of the tax policy work programme we will confirm the domains each Policy Lead is responsible for. Until then we will retain existing teams and reporting lines. We will then work through the reassignment of projects and people to Domain teams with a view to maintaining continuity in terms of what people are currently working on. When the reassignments have been worked through this will be available to Policy Advisors for comment. Exactly how we facilitate these comments will be determined closer to the time and will depend in part on the Policy Lead appointments. 21 IN CONFIDENCE • Capability uplift has been identified as particularly important, especially in relation to leadership skills. A focus on leadership training and support will commence immediately. • Capability uplift for people other than our people leaders is also key. The proposal document included areas that we have identified as priorities to address across the group. As we have indicated, an assessment of development needs and work for each person will be undertaken by their Policy Lead. This will highlight areas where individual development needs or opportunities exist. The Inland Revenue capabilities and the DPMC Skills Framework also provide tools to assist with identifying development needs and ways to develop desired skills and capabilities. We expect that leadership opportunities and options to help people develop these skills would be identified as part of the development plans for senior and principal advisors. We will also continue to work through the options for development opportunities as we progress the capability uplift enabler stream. We recognise that there is still considerable work to do to successfully embed the Future Operating Model. While many aspects are well underway, this work needs to continue, and additional work needs to start. We also want to provide opportunities for people to be involved and take ownership in this transition, in particular as we continue the work on the enablers. Governance of the next stage of the Policy Future Operating Model ODC is the governance group overseeing the implementation of the Policy Future Operating model. At a (yet to be agreed) future date an external review will take place to test whether the implementation of the Future Operating Model is achieving what is intended. A sub-group of the PAS Governance Group (Deputy Commissioner PAS, Director Strategy, Policy Directors, Programme Lead) will co-opt Cath Atkins as the Deputy Commissioner CCS-B to review progress and achievements on the Policy Future Operating Model implementation plan on a monthly basis. The intention being that Cath will ensure from an ‘outside of PAS’ perspective that the changes continue as planned.
