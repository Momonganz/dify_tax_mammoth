Ngā pāpātanga tāke painga tāpiri Fringe benefit tax rates
=========================================================

 There are 4 different options when calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT) rates: 

*   Single rate 
*   Short form alternate rate 
*   Full alternate rate
*   Pooled alternate rate.  

The rate you can choose depends on whether: 

*   the benefit must be attributed to a particular employee, and 
*   you want to calculate FBT every quarter or only once a year. 

You need to know your filing frequency so you can choose the available rate that best suits your business.

Rates for quarterly filers
--------------------------

If you are a quarterly filer, in quarters 1 to 3 you can use either the: 

*   single rate 63.93%  
*   alternate rate 49.25%.

In quarter 4, if: 

*   the alternate rate was used in any of the first 3 quarters, you must use the alternate rate calculation in the fourth quarter. 
*   only the single rate was used, you can use either the single rate or complete the alternate rate calculation. 

Rates for annual or income year filers 
---------------------------------------

Annual or income year filers can use either the:

*   Single rate 63.93% 
*   Alternate rate calculation

Alternate rate calculation
--------------------------

There are 3 alternate rate calculation options, the full alternate rate, short form alternate rate and pooled alternate rate. 

### Full alternate rate 

A separate calculation must be done for each employee who receives an attributed fringe benefit.

#### Please note

There are changes to how you calculate the full alternate rate from 1 April 2024. Our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 has these details.

Non-attributed benefits are pooled, and a flat rate is applied:

*   For shareholder employees 63.93% 
*   For all other employees 49.25% 

### Short form alternate rate 

*   For attributed benefits 63.93% 
*   For non-attributed benefits to shareholder employees 63.93% 
*   For non-attributed benefits to all other employees 49.25% 

### Pooled alternate rate

The pooled alternate rate applies from 1 April 2021. You can use it to file your income year or annual return, or your return for quarter 4 of the 2021 – 2022 tax year.

You might choose this option if you mostly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn within the safe harbour thresholds (up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year). 

#### Attributed benefits

*   for employees who earn within the "safe harbour" thresholds of up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year 49.25%.
*   for employees earning above either of the "safe harbour" thresholds 63.93%, unless
*   you know that the employee has received less than $129,681 up to 1 April 2025 and $130,724 from 1 April 2025 in net pay plus attributed benefits (all-inclusive pay) for the year, then you can choose to use 49.25%.

If attributed benefits are taxed at 49.25% for some employees and 63.93% for others, two pools may be needed.

#### Non-attributed benefits

*   when one or more recipients are major shareholders 63.93%,
*   otherwise 49.25%.

Changing FBT rates
------------------

*   If you file quarterly you can change the rate options during the year.
*   If you file annually you can choose any of the 3 rate options. You can change rate options each year.
*   If you use the full or short form alternate rate option in any of the first 3 quarters, you must use the full or short form alternate rate option in the fourth quarter.
