Volume Eight, No.7October 1996 The Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill was introduced into Parliament in October 1995 and passed in July 1996. The compliance and penalties provi- sions of the legislation resulted in amendments to these Acts: •Tax Administration Act 1994 •Income Tax Act 1994 •Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 •Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 •Gaming Duties Act 1971 •Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 •Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 •Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 •Child Support Act 1991 This Tax Information Bulletin deals with the legislative changes relating to compliance and penalties. The changes pertaining to the new disputes resolution procedures were addressed in TIB Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996). The main features of the new legislation are: •a clear statement of taxpayer obligations •new interest rules for overpayments and underpayments of tax •new penalty and remission rules. All section references in this document relate to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. These reforms follow on from the Government discussion documents Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties (August 1994), and Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2 (April 1995).

the 1992 budget the Government announced its intention to launch a review and a reform of the compliance and penalties rules in the Inland Revenue Acts. There was widespread consultation about the changes. The principles of the reforms were outlined in a discussion document issued August 1994. The Government then issued a second document in April 1995, for further consultation, which contained detailed proposals and draft legislation. In October 1995 the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill was introduced into Parliament. The Finance and Expenditure Committee considered the bill and submissions from various groups and individuals. Problems with the existing rules The current legislative scheme dates back at least to 1916, particularly in respect of income tax. Since then many major changes and new rules have been added to make up the tax system that exists today. At the same time, the nature of tax administration has changed from a system in which each taxpayer’s liability was quantified using a manual process to one that is largely based on modern technology. The provisions detailing taxpayer obligations and standards of behaviour, and sanctions which enforce these have not kept pace with the changing nature of tax legislation and administration. The current rules have a number of weaknesses which broadly relate to gaps in coverage, flaws in design and inconsistencies in application. This has resulted in several problems: •The rules are unfair to the majority of taxpayers, who comply with the law. •There are unnecessary costs for taxpayers, their agents and the tax administration. •The legal processes and requirements are unclear to taxpayers. •The rules are less effective than desirable in supporting taxpayers’ obligations in a self-assessment environment. The new provisions comprehensively address these problems. Benefits of the new rules The last ten years have seen major reforms in taxation and tax administration. They include: •a significant broadening of the tax base, and associated changes in tax rates •modernisation of tax administration •an increasing responsibility placed on taxpayers to assess their own tax liability. All these changes have taken place in an environment of increasing business and commercial sophisti- cation. However, the rules relating to taxpayers’ compliance obligations have never been clearly stated. Fundamental defects in the area of sanctions have meant that taxpayers who wish to “play the system”, could do so, usually without risk of loss. However, under the new rules those found to be engaged in this activity will face interest from the original due date of the tax and the prospect of significant penalties. There will be considerable benefits from the new rules. Replacing the current ad hoc structure with a comprehensive new structure will encourage all taxpayers to comply with their obligations. The foundation of the new rules is a clear statement of the appropriate standards that taxpayers must meet in complying with their obligations. These standards are reinforced by a comprehensive structure of penalties. Many people regard these amendments to taxpayer obligations and tax penalties as the most important change to the tax system in many years.

The taxpayer obligations are contained in new sections 15A and 15B. Background A recent review of the Inland Revenue Department, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson, identified New Zealand as operating a system of substantial self-assessment. Under such a system individuals and companies must assess their own tax liability and pay tax according to the requirements of the law. For taxpayers to be able to satisfy the requirements placed upon them by self-assessment, they must be aware of their primary tax obligations. The new amend- ments clarify taxpayers’ obligation to assess their tax liability and clearly spell out their responsibility to determine the correct amount payable and pay it on time. The obligations represent the target taxpayers should be aiming for. However, in some circumstances failure to satisfy a tax obligation may not justify imposing a penalty. To reflect this, standards are introduced to define how far taxpayers are expected to go to meet their tax obligations. Legislation Section 15A states the purpose of the new part and Section 15B sets out taxpayers’ primary obligations as follows: •correctly determine their amount of tax payable •deduct or withhold the correct amount of tax from payments or receipts •pay tax on time •keep all necessary information and maintain all necessary accounts or balances •disclose all information that the Commissioner requires in a timely and useful way •co-operate with the Commissioner to the extent required by the Inland Revenue Acts •comply with other specific tax obligations. Discussion An obligation to comply with the Act remains with the person on whom it is imposed; it cannot be transferred to a third party even if the taxpayer contracts with a third party to meet that obligation. For example, a taxpayer who must file a tax return employs a tax agent. If the return is not filed, it is the taxpayer, and not the agent, who is liable, as the obligation is the taxpayer’s. Part 2 - Interest Introduction Use of money interest is not a penalty. Rather, it is intended to reduce any advantage or disadvantage when taxpayers overpay or underpay tax. Interest will be a cost imposed on taxpayers or on the Government to compensate for having the use of the other party’s money over a period of time. The principle behind use of money interest is that all taxpayers’ tax payments are due on prescribed dates, and taxpayers have an obligation to pay on those applicable dates. Interest will provide an incentive to taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time by removing the timing benefit from deferring tax payments. The interest provisions have adopted a commercial approach, together with safeguards to ensure that Inland Revenue is not used as a financing or investment vehicle. Adopting a commercial approach to the payment of interest permits the concepts of interest and penalties to be clearly distinguished, and allows them to be applied separately. Interest charges do not imply any culpability on the part of the taxpayer. The primary objective of interest is to provide compensation. The new interest rules apply to all taxes and duties from the 1997-98 income year onwards, as set out in the table on page 2. Background The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee recommended that a full two-way interest system be implemented. It considered that charging interest on underpayments or late payments of tax would give taxpayers an incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time by removing any timing benefits from deferrals. Paying interest on overpayments would recognise that taxpayers had lost the use of their funds continued on page 4 and should be compensated, especially when large refunds are involved and the time delay is significant. Under the present system interest is not applied consist- ently across revenues, and does not apply at all in some areas. Key features •Split interest rates will apply consistently to all taxes and duties. •There are comprehensive interest rules for overpayments and underpayments of tax. •Interest will generally be payable on underpaid and overpaid tax from the original date tax was due until paid or refunded. •Interest rates will be determined on a market basis to reflect their compensation function and to encourage timely payments. •Interest will be assessable and subject to resident withholding tax (or NRWT as appropriate). •Interest will be deductible, subject to the usual business test. Legislation Interest is covered in Part VII. Section 120A states that Part VII has three purposes: •to compensate the Commissioner for the loss of use of money through taxpayers paying too little tax •to compensate taxpayers for the loss of use of money through their paying too much tax •to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. Section 120(2) provides that interest is not a penalty. Discussion In accordance with section 120D, interest will compen- sate taxpayers if they overpay tax, and the Commis- sioner if taxpayers underpay tax. Interest will apply simultaneously with any late payment penalty on any underpaid tax. Currently, interest applies only to a small number of tax types and duties. The new interest rules will apply consistently to all taxes and duties. The taxes and duties to which use of money interest will apply are as follows: •Accident compensation premium deductions by employers (employer and earner premium) •casino duty •cheque duty •Child Support deductions by employers •credit card transaction duty •Family Support •dividend withholding payment accounts •fringe benefit tax •gaming machine duty •gift duty •goods and services tax •imputation accounts •income tax •lottery duty •non-resident withholding tax (on interest and divi- dends) •PAYE deductions •qualifying company election tax •resident withholding tax (on interest and dividends) •stamp duty •Student Loan deductions by employers •specified superannuation contribution withholding tax •totalisator duty However, interest will not apply to the following: •Student Loan borrowers •custodians and liable parents •persons who fail to deduct amounts and return them to the Commissioner under section 157, section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 154 of the Child Support Act 1991 and section 46 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. (These sections require third parties to make deductions from any payments made to the taxpayer and forward them to Inland Revenue.) There have been changes to some tax and duty rules to make them consistent with use of money interest. Each is briefly discussed below. Duties (stamp and cheque duties, gift duty and gaming duties) Each duty previously contained a provision so that if it wasn’t paid by the due date, interest at 5% per month was chargeable. This was effectively a late payment penalty, not interest. These rules have been repealed and duties will be subject to use of money interest. Dividend withholding payment accounts The present dividend withholding payment (DWP) interest rules have been incorporated into the new use of money interest rules. Currently, interest applies to underpayments only if late payment penalty is not imposed. From 1 April 1997 interest and late payment penalty can apply at the same time. Fringe benefit tax Currently, if a taxpayer elects to pay fringe benefit tax on an annual or income year basis, interest is charged from the due dates which would have applied had the taxpayer not made the election. This was to compensate the Government for the deferral. The regulation which gave effect to this has now been repealed, and section from page 3 120S sets out the amount and nature of interest to be added to fringe benefit tax paid on an annual or income year basis. Section 120S gives the same effect as the now-repealed regulation. However, under the new rules interest will be paid on overpayments. Provisional tax The new interest rules are effectively an extension of the current provisional tax use of money interest provisions. However, they don’t eliminate specific provisions relating to provisional taxpayers, such as dates from which interest applies, and the criteria used to establish who is a provisional taxpayer. Sections 120K to 120N cover the implications of the new rules for provisional taxpayers. A $100 tax threshold will apply before any use of money interest is imposed or paid. This is provided for in section 183F. The interest rates applying to provisional tax will be consistent with the general interest rates applying to all taxes and duties. Calculating the interest Section 120E sets out the formula for calculating interest. It will be calculated on a daily basis on the amount of unpaid or overpaid tax. Interest will not compound or be included in the calculation of late payment penalties. However, it will be assessable and deductible and subject to resident withholding tax or NRWT. Use of money interest will be calculated on the daily balance of the taxpayer’s account, excluding any court costs and solicitors’ fees. Interest on underpayments will be charged on any amount of tax owing to the Commissioner, including any accumulated penalties. This will include any late payment penalty, underestimation penalty, late filing penalty and any shortfall penalty due. The start date for interest will be the day after the date the penalty is due. Under the previous provisional tax interest rules, payments received after specific due dates were not taken into account when calculating interest. However, under the new rules any payment made at any date will be taken into account for interest calculations. This means taxpayers could incur both debit and credit interest within the same tax period. Section 120F(4) provides that when debit and credit interest amounts are calculated for the same period, the sum of those amounts will constitute the interest figure that is applied to the taxpayer’s account. Start date Underpayments Use of money interest on underpayments will start on the day after the original due date for paying the tax, and end on the date the tax is fully paid. For example, if a reassessment increases a taxpayer’s income tax liability of three years ago, three years’ interest will be owing to the Commissioner. Interest will be charged on the difference between the original amount of tax paid and the new amount assessed, even though time will be allowed for payment before a late payment penalty is imposed. Overpayments Use of money interest on overpayments will start on the later of: 1.the day after the original payment due date 2.the day after the date the payment was made. The stop date is the date the tax is fully refunded or transferred to another account. If a tax return must be filed for the tax to which the interest relates, the start date for credit interest will be the later of either 1 and 2 above, or the day after the tax return is filed. This is because Inland Revenue cannot refund the tax until the return is filed. An exception is made for provisional taxpayers, to ensure they receive interest on overpaid provisional tax. GST refunds For a GST refund, use of money interest starts on the latest of the following days: 1.the day after the earlier of: –the 15th working day after Inland Revenue receives the GST return –the original due date for payment 2.the day after the return is received 3.the day after the date payment is made. Interest rate Section 120H states that the interest rate for both underpayments and overpayments will be set by Order in Council. The rate may be reviewed “from time to time”. The interest rates have yet to be determined. They will be determined before 7 February 1997, and based on market interest rates applicable at that time. Threshold Under section 183F, a threshold of $100 of underpaid or overpaid tax will apply before interest is charged or paid. This means that only unpaid or overpaid tax greater than $100 on a specific due date will attract interest. Payment application Section 120F provides that payments made by taxpayers will first clear any unpaid interest amounts and then be credited against the tax outstanding. This is consistent with the commercial approach to charging and collect- ing interest. Recovery of interest For recovery purposes, debit interest is treated as being of the same nature as the tax to which it relates. Like- continued on page 6 wise, overpayments of credit interest can also be recov- ered in the same manner. Credit interest may be applied towards payment of unpaid tax. This approach also avoids the need to impose late payment penalty on interest. Assessability and deductibility Interest paid on overpayments will be assessable, and interest charged on underpayments will be deductible under the normal income tax rules. Interest will be deemed to be interest on money lent for the purposes of determining whether a deduction is available under the Income Tax Act. Interest will be assessable in the income year in which it is refunded to the taxpayer or transferred to clear tax owing in another revenue account. For reassessments, interest will be assessable in the income year following the year of reassessment. Interest will be deductible in the income year in which it is assessed. For reassessments, it will be deductible in the income year following the year of reassessment. Tax in dispute The tax in dispute provisions were introduced to compensate taxpayers and Inland Revenue for the time value of money over the period of the dispute, and to reduce the taxpayers’ incentives to continue litigation simply to defer paying tax. Under the new disputes resolution rules, the obligation to pay non-deferrable tax in dispute before requesting a case stated or commencing a challenge is unchanged. If the taxpayer is successful in the dispute, the Commis- sioner will pay interest on the tax which the taxpayer paid before litigation. Alternatively, if the Commis- sioner is successful the taxpayer will be liable for interest on the unpaid portion of the tax which is outstanding from the original due date. Objection to interest Section 120I provides that a taxpayer may not object to or challenge the imposition of interest payable. How- ever, if the amount of interest imposed has been calcu- lated incorrectly, the taxpayer is still able to require the Commissioner to make the appropriate amendments to ensure that the interest charged is correct. Special provisions The following sections contain provisions which relate to particular areas. Section 120G states that the payment date for interest payable by a taxpayer to the Commissioner is “immedi- ately and without the need for a demand.” This means that interest is due from the date that it is charged whether or not a statement of account is sent to the taxpayer. Section 120O deals with the date interest starts on tax reconciliations. It provides that when tax is overpaid, interest will start on whichever of the following is applicable: 1.If the due date is unchanged, the day after the later of: –the due date for payment –the date the payment is made 2.If there is a new due date, the later of: –the day after the original due date for paying the tax –the date the payment is made. Section 120P applies when taxpayers can elect to spread income back over previous income years. It states that no interest is payable before the terminal tax date for the election income year or apportionment income year. Example A taxpayer incurred a tax shortfall in the 1998 year and elected to apportion it back over the 1995, 1996 and 1997 years. Interest would apply only from the 1998 payment due date. Section 120Q states that for the purposes of Part VII, the due date of underestimation penalty tax is the taxpayer’s third instalment date. Currently the due date is the due date for the payment of terminal tax. Section 120R states that for foreign dividend withhold- ing payments, if a taxpayer elects to reduce losses instead of making foreign dividend withholding pay- ments, payment will be deemed to be made within the required period if the notice of election is given within that time. Section 120U provides that when a taxpayer pays a bond or other security rather than making a deduction from a payment to a non-resident, and it is later established that a deduction should have been made, the interest start date will be the day after the day on which the amount would have been payable if a bond or other security had not been provided. from page 5 Part 3 - Penalties Introduction Section 139 sets out the purpose of the penalties provi- sions of the Act, which are as follows: •to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations and to co-operate with Inland Revenue •to ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently •to act against non-compliance with tax obligations effectively and at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. The legislation introduces important changes to the penalty provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. These changes promote fairer and more effective enforcement and improve the consistency in applying penalties overall and between the different tax types. The foundation of the new rules is a statement of standards which taxpayers must meet in complying with their obligations. These standards are then reinforced by a comprehensive structure of penalties. At the core of the penalty rules is a positive standard of reasonable care. This means that individual taxpayers’ actions in meeting obligations should be at the standard expected of a reasonable person. In addition, for inter- pretive matters which involve significant amounts of tax, taxpayers must ensure that they have interpreted the law in a reasonable way. Background Existing provisions do not comprehensively address the different ways taxpayers may fail to meet the require- ments placed on them. They tend to focus on taxpayers’ responsibilities to provide factual information, even though today’s environment requires more than just the provision of information. The current system generally relies on taxpayers to make a first assessment of their own tax liability, so the standards they are expected to meet in interpreting and applying the law needed to be clarified. The new penalty rules support self-assessment concepts by encouraging voluntary compliance with the law. They clarify the standards and obligations expected of taxpayers in relation to their tax liability, and reinforce these with a comprehensive structure of penalties. Key features •The legislation introduces a late filing penalty of $50, $250 or $500, depending on the taxpayer’s net income for the relevant year. •The late payment penalty has been changed from 10% to 5%, with 2% monthly incremental penalties. •Shortfall penalties for taxpayers who do not take reasonable care to determine the correct amount of tax have been introduced. •There is a new penalty of 20% of the resulting tax shortfall if taxpayers have an unacceptable interpreta- tion of how the law applies to their tax affairs. The penalty will apply if the tax at stake exceeds a speci- fied threshold. •Taxpayers who engage in an abusive tax position will be liable to a shortfall penalty of 100% of the result- ing tax shortfall. •Shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% for volun- tary disclosure before audit and by 40% for voluntary disclosure during an audit. Adequate disclosure at time of filing of an unacceptable interpretation will result in a 75% reduction. •Shortfall penalties will be increased by 25% if a taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner. •Shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% if an incorrect tax position is reversed or corrected in a return period prior to an audit. •Criminal penalties have been standardised and a maximum five-year term of imprisonment for evasion and related offences introduced. Monetary penalties of up to $50,000 apply to most offences. •Additional tax and penal tax have been repealed. •Court orders to obtain information have been intro- duced. Civil penalties Section 3(1) defines civil penalty as: •an underestimation penalty •a late filing penalty •a late payment penalty •a shortfall penalty Each category of civil penalty is discussed below. Non-deductibility of civil penalties Section DB of the Income Tax Act 1994 prohibits tax deductions for income tax penalties. This has been amended to include civil penalties. Civil penalties are therefore not tax-deductible. Underestimation penalty The provisional tax underestimation penalty has been retained. This penalty is still necessary as it has been designed specifically to enforce a particular obligation which cannot be effectively enforced using generic civil penalties like the late payment penalty. continued on page 8 Late filing penalty Legislation Section 139A states that late filing penalties will apply to the following annual returns which are required under the TAA: •annual income tax returns •Family Support end of year statements •partnership returns, •returns by executors and administrators •special returns for agents, non-resident traders, taxpayers leaving New Zealand or who have ceased business, returns to date of death, bankruptcy or liquidation •PAYE and ACC earner premium reconciliation statements •ACC employer premium calculation returns. A taxpayer is liable to a late filing penalty if the re- quired return is not filed on time and the taxpayer has been notified that the penalty is payable. For income tax returns the amount of the penalty is as follows: Amount ofLate filing net incomepenalty less than $100,000 $50 $100,000 - $1,000,000$250 greater than $1,000,000$500 reconciliation statements$250 Initially Inland Revenue will restrict the late filing penalty to annual income tax returns for individuals and companies, PAYE reconciliations and ACC reconcilia- tions. Note that this penalty does not apply to either GST or FBT returns, or other periodic returns that require a payment at the time of filing. Discussion The International Monetary Fund recommended introducing a late filing penalty after its review of Inland Revenue in 1989. It proposed that the penalty be a flat fine automatically imposed by Inland Revenue. The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee supported this recommendation in 1990. The obligation for taxpayers to file income tax returns by the due date is a basic one, but previously there was no effective penalty for those who failed to do so. Because the tax system relies on taxpayers filing their returns on time, it was considered that a failure to meet this obligation should attract a penalty. Application of penalty The late filing penalty may apply to a taxpayer who does not file a return “on time”, which means on or before the due date. This means the late filing penalty could apply both to late and non-filers of returns. The late filing penalty will be imposed at the Commis- sioner’s discretion, and only after the taxpayer has been notified that a return is required. The notification would advise taxpayers that they must file a return or notify Inland Revenue if there is some valid reason for not filing the return. Taxpayers who do not file their return or notify Inland Revenue of the reason for not filing will have the late filing penalty imposed. The amount of late filing penalty will depend on the amount of the “net income” returned. Net income is the gross income less expenses and before any loss offsets. The late filing penalty may be remitted if taxpayers were not able to file on time for reasons beyond their control. This is discussed in detail in Part 6, which deals with remissions. Any taxpayer who files a “nil” or incomplete return by the due date to avoid the late filing penalty may be liable to shortfall penalties. At the very least, a taxpayer who files a return knowing that it may be incorrect would not have shown reasonable care. Due date for late filing penalty The late filing penalty for annual income tax returns will be due and payable on the latest of these dates: •30 days after the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that the penalty is payable •7 February for IR 5 taxpayers •the terminal tax due date for all other taxpayers. The due date for paying the late filing fee for reconcilia- tions will be the latest of these dates: •30 days after the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer •31 May following the income year to which the reconciliation relates. A late filing penalty may be imposed even if the return results in no tax to pay or a refund, as the penalty is related to the filing of returns and not the amount of tax payable. The objective of the late filing penalty is to get taxpayers to file their returns on time. The late filing penalty will be subject to late payment penalty and interest if not paid by the due date. Extension of time issues Section 37(3) allows the Commissioner to extend the due date for filing returns if a taxpayer makes a written application on or before the due date for filing. The Commissioner also has a discretion to accept a late request for extension of time. Written requests for extension of time should state the return period to which the extension application relates, the length of time the extension is required and the reasons for requesting the extension. Acceptable reasons for requesting an extension of time are generally from page 7 reasons beyond the taxpayer’s control. Some examples of acceptable reasons would be illness or accident. If a taxpayer becomes a client of an agent who receives an extension of time, and the late filing penalty has already been imposed, the penalty will stand. Also, if an agent’s extension of time for a client is withdrawn, the client could become liable for the penalty for the unfiled return. In this situation, Inland Revenue will give the taxpayer notice before we impose the penalty. Late payment penalty Legislation Section 139B states that a taxpayer who does not pay the tax (called ‘unpaid tax’) by the due date is liable to pay a late payment penalty. The initial penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax, and is imposed on the day after the due date for paying the unpaid tax. The incremental late payment penalty is 2% of the amount of tax to pay as at each month after the day on which a penalty is imposed. It continues for successive monthly intervals as long as any tax to pay remains unpaid. The term ‘tax to pay’ means the unpaid tax together with any accumulated late payment penalty or incre- mental penalty. The term ‘unpaid tax’ includes deductions that must be made and paid to the Commissioner (such as a PAYE deductions made and not returned), but does not include a late payment penalty. Discussion Application The new rules introduce a standardised late payment penalty across all tax types except Student Loan repay- ments and Child Support. There are two parts to the late payment penalty: an initial component which penalises taxpayers for not meeting a tax obligation by a due date, and an incre- mental component which encourages prompt payment of the debt over time. The initial late payment penalty of 5% will be charged on the amount of tax outstanding after the payment due date. The existing incremental penalties allow payment to be deferred by almost six months before further penalties apply. The new system shortens this interval, but reduces the rate of penalty. The new incremental penalties of 2% per month will be charged on the amount of tax outstanding as at the date of imposition. The late payment penalty will apply from the day after the due date for paying the tax. Threshold Under section 183F the late payment penalty will not apply to unpaid tax of less than $100. Only unpaid tax greater than $100 will attract a late payment penalty and interest. Late payment penalties are deemed to be of the same nature as the tax to which they relate, so they are included in the base amount when calculating interest. Due date for paying tax For various duties, the payment due dates are as follows: Totalisator-20 days from the end of the month in dutywhich the race or sporting event was held Lottery duty-14 days after the lottery is drawn Cheque duty -the due dates remain unchanged Stamp duty-for an instrument stamped in New Zealand: six months after the date the instrument was executed -for an instrument stamped outside New Zealand: six months after the date it was first received in New Zealand after execution Gift duty-six months after dutiable gift is made If a tax liability is increased as a result of a reassess- ment, a new due date will be set for paying the addi- tional tax assessed. The late payment penalty will apply only if the taxpayer does not pay the tax due by the new due date. The previous “original due date” provisions for calculat- ing additional tax when a taxpayer has been guilty of neglect or default have been repealed and replaced with the interest rules explained in Part 2 of this bulletin. Taxpayers in financial difficulties will be able to minimise the impact of the late payment penalties by making an instalment arrangement with the Commis- sioner. The Commissioner will also be able to remit late payment penalties in limited circumstances. This is discussed in detail in Part 6, which deals with remis- sions. Specific provisions The following sections also relate to the late payment pen- alties: Section 139C - Late payment penalty and provisional tax Section 140 - If another person deducts and pays resident withholding tax Section 140A - Underestimation penalty when income tax underestimated as at the final instalment date Section 140B - Imputation penalty tax payable when there is an end of year debit balance Section 140C - Dividend withholding payment penalty tax payable when there is an end of year debit balance Section 140D - Application of other provisions of Act to imputation penalty tax and dividend withholding payment penalty tax. continued on page 10 from page 9 Shortfall penalties The following table summarises the breaches and shortfall penalty rates applicable and includes the various adjust- ments that may be made to the base penalty rate. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Penalty - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - If reducedIf reducedIf reduced by 75% forby 40% forby 75% forIf increased Standarddisclosuredisclosuredisclosureby 25% for Action subject to penaltyratebefore auditduring auditwhen filingobstruction Lack of reasonable care20%5%12%n/a\*25% Unacceptable interpretation20%5%12% 5%25% Gross carelessness40%10%24%n/a\*50% Abusive tax position100%25%60%25%125% Evasion150%37.5%90%n/a\*187.5% \*This reduction is limited to the unacceptable interpretation and abusive tax position penalties because it specifically relates to the disclosure of the taxpayer’s interpretation at time of filing. The following diagram summarises how to determine whether an action is subject to a penalty, and the penalty rate that will apply. Reasonable care Legislation Section 141A provides that a taxpayer who does not take reasonable care in taking a tax position is liable to pay a shortfall penalty. This penalty will be 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. If a taxpayer uses an acceptable interpretation of tax law in taking a tax position, he or she has also taken reasonable care in taking that tax position. Discussion The penalty for lack of reasonable care applies to any taxpayer who must take a tax position. That means it includes taxpayers who are required to make source deductions and who fail to exercise reasonable care in calculating the amount of tax to deduct or account for. For example, if an employer is away on a planned absence and forgot to make arrangements to pay tax deductions, that employer may incur a penalty for lack of reasonable care. Whether the taxpayer acted intentionally is not a consideration. The reasonable care test requires a taxpayer to exercise the care that a reasonable person would be likely to exercise in the taxpayer’s circum- stances to fulfil the tax obligations. It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the same circum- stances would have foreseen the shortfall as a reason- able probability. It equates with the concept of negli- gence in the civil law of Torts, and the jurisprudence is well established: “Negligence is to be measured objec- tively by ascertaining what in the circumstances would be done or omitted by the reasonable man.” (Meulan’s Hair Stylists Ltd v CIR) In the tax context, reasonable care includes exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position. It also includes keeping adequate books and records to substantiate items properly, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. The reasonable care test is not intended to be overly onerous to taxpayers. Reasonable care does not mean perfection. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with that of a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. Factors to consider Ordinarily what is expected is the achievement of a standard appropriate to the category of taxpayer, rather than of the individual taxpayer involved. The category of taxpayer will affect what constitutes reasonable care in each particular case. The standard required of a salary and wage earner will differ from that required of a business taxpayer. For most PAYE taxpayers, an earnest effort to follow the Tax Pack instructions will be sufficient to pass the reasonable care test. For business taxpayers, reasonable care means there must be an appropriate record keeping system and other procedures to ensure that the income and expendi- ture of the business is properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. The circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reason- able care include: •the complexity of the law and the transaction (the difficulty in interpreting complex legislation) •the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk) •the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution •the taxpayer’s age, health and background. Business taxpayers For a business, reasonable care may also take into account: •the size and nature of the business •the internal controls in place •the business’s record keeping practices •system failures (however, this would be balanced with consideration as to why the system failure occurred). If a taxpayer’s accounting systems are designed to correctly classify entries according to their attributes and the system is monitored to ensure that the likeli- hood of error is reduced to an acceptable level, reason- able care is exercised. Arithmetical errors Arithmetical errors may indicate a failure to take reasonable care, but they are not conclusive. The decision will depend on the procedures the taxpayer had in place to detect such errors, the size, nature and frequency of the error, or the circumstances in which the taxpayer made the error. Interpretations On questions of interpretation, reasonable care requires a taxpayer to come to conclusions that a reasonable person would come to in the particular category of taxpayer. If a taxpayer is uncertain about the correct tax treatment of an item, reasonable care requires the taxpayer to make reasonable enquires. Accordingly, for questions of interpretation, reasonable care will depend on: •what efforts the taxpayer had taken to resolve the issue •the types of advice received •the certainty of the law. Materiality Materiality is implicit in the standard of “reasonable care”. In considering whether a taxpayer has taken reasonable care, consideration will be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also to the size of the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer. continued on page 12 Case law In Australia, to date, there has been only one case of “lack of reasonable care” taken to the courts. It is Case 34/95, 95 ATC 319, which involved the deduction of a superannuation claim. The judge referred to the explanatory memorandum which illuminates Parliament’s intended meaning of the phrase “reasonable care”. It explained that reasonable care “....requires a taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of \[the Act\] and regulations. The effort required is one commensurate with all the taxpayer’s circumstances, including the taxpayer’s knowledge, education, experience and skill”. The judgment then stated that “...given that the taxpay- er’s return was prepared by experienced tax agents, who objectively should have known, or at the very least, had the resources to find out, the requirements in respect of the deduction of superannuation contributions, and who furthermore prepared the returns for the particular employer involved, it is difficult to find that reasonable care has been exercised.” A similar case in New Zealand would have a different outcome. This is because New Zealand taxpayers are not vicariously liable for a tax adviser’s carelessness. In such a case in New Zealand, if it was established that the taxpayer had reasonably relied on the tax adviser’s advice, the taxpayer would be considered to have taken reasonable care. Burden and standard of proof The burden of proof rests with the taxpayer to show that he or she has taken reasonable care. The standard of proof is the civil standard of “balance of probabilities”. Accordingly, a taxpayer who can show that it is prob- able that he or she took reasonable care will have satisfied the standard. Example 2 Facts: A newly-established business was experienc- ing rapid growth, and its accounting system had not kept pace and had become inadequate. The firm’s tax return was prepared from this accounting system Inland Revenue audited the business and found several omissions of income (from accounts for services rendered by the firm), along with over- stated claims for deductions. The tax shortfalls could have been avoided if proper records had been maintained. Penalty: The taxpayer had been careless in main- taining an inadequate accounting system, which resulted in the tax shortfall. For business taxpayers, reasonable care would require having an appropri- ate record keeping system to ensure that the busi- ness’s income and expenditure is properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. A reasonable person conducting the business would have foreseen during the year that unless the accounting system was improved it could have resulted in a tax shortfall. The taxpayer is subject to a penalty of 20% for lack of reasonable care. Example 1 A retired taxpayer receives NZ Superannuation, interest income from three bank accounts and dividend income on several parcels of shares inherited from her late husband. She has not previously prepared a tax return because her husband always dealt with tax matters. Accord- ingly, she is now completing a tax return for the first time. When she filled in the first tax return since her husband’s death, she overlooked a dividend re- ceived from a parcel of shares that had been sold during the year and a small amount of interest. However, she has otherwise carefully returned all other amounts of interest and dividends received as well as the NZ Superannuation. In this situation, the taxpayer has exercised reason- able care. The oversight was minor and does not detract from her generally careful approach. No penalty would be applied to any resulting tax shortfall. Defence to reasonable care In large adjustment cases when the matter turns on a question of interpretation, the acceptable interpretation standard must be satisfied. A taxpayer who can demon- strate that the position taken is an acceptable interpreta- tion is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Tax agents/advisers A taxpayer who has reasonably relied on the advice of a tax adviser or Inland Revenue will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. However, a taxpayer could still be liable for a penalty for lack of reasonable care by taking any of these actions: •providing inadequate information when seeking advice •failing to give reasonable instructions to a tax adviser •relying unreasonably on a tax adviser or on wrong advice. A taxpayer does not satisfy his or her obligation to take reasonable care simply by using the services of a tax agent or tax adviser. The taxpayer is still responsible for the proper recording of his or her tax affairs during the year, and for drawing all the relevant facts to the attention of the agent or adviser, in order to satisfy the reasonable care test. Taxpayers are expected to answer honestly any questions asked by the agent or adviser to do with preparing the return. Taxpayers are unlikely to be considered to have breached the standard if Inland Revenue has failed to provide adequate information in our guides, if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information from reputable sources, or if the relevant information is extremely complex or specialised. Errors made for these reasons are understandable. from page 11 Example 3 Facts: The same as in the previous example, except that the amounts involved were small in relation to total income for the year. The errors occurred early during the period of rapid expansion, and the taxpayer had fixed the problem with the accounting system before the end of the taxable period, by introducing a new system to cope with the expan- sion of the business. No errors were detected in the later part of the year. Penalty: The taxpayer had realised that the ac- counting system had proven inadequate for the expanding needs of the growing business and had taken positive steps to resolve the problem as soon as it became apparent. A reasonable business taxpayer, when establishing the business, may not have foreseen that the accounting system would be inadequate at the outset, but would have foreseen during the year that unless the system was improved it would result in a tax shortfall. Accordingly, there would be no penalty. Example 4 Facts: During the stock take an employee trans- posed the cost price of one category of stock. The entire stock take involved counting 2000 different categories of stock. The error was not found during normal checking procedures used by the company, but came to light during an audit. The shortfall was minimal in relation to the entire stock figure. Penalty: The taxpayer had taken reasonable care in carrying out the stock take. The procedures in place would have normally picked up any discrepancies. The error was also not sufficiently material to put the taxpayer on notice. Accordingly, there would be no penalty. Example 5 Facts: The taxpayers, a husband and wife, own a corner dairy. The husband looks after all operations in the shop. His wife helps in the shop and keeps basic accounts which are sent to their accountant at year end for preparation of the final tax return. The business is registered for GST and files two- monthly returns. During previous audits it has been ascertained that good records are kept for each return, comprising a full worksheet substantiated by relevant documentation. One of the taxpayers prepares the GST return and, after completion, the return is checked by the other. As a result of an audit, a tax shortfall is found in the return for one period. The discrepancy is due to an arithmetical error and is small relative to the GST payable for the period. Penalty: Inland Revenue considers that the taxpay- ers have taken reasonable care to complete the GST return. Good records are maintained and the return was carefully prepared and checked as usual. The shortfall is not material and therefore does not detract from the fact that the taxpayers took reason- able care in completing the GST return. Accord- ingly, no penalty would be imposed in this case. Example 6 Facts: The taxpayer is a salary and wage earner who regularly gives money to a church group that meets weekly at a member’s house to pray. The group is raising funds to build a church. At year end, she refers to the IR 5 income tax return guide to prepare her income tax return. She notes that the guide states that she may claim a rebate for “donations to churches” provided that she holds a receipt to substantiate her claim. She claims the maximum rebate of $500 as she holds a receipt which she has received from the group which substantiates that she has donated $1,500 for the building of the church. The return is audited and Inland Revenue notes that the receipt in the return is not from a recognised church in New Zealand that holds approved donee status. The receipt is not eligible for the rebate claimed. Accordingly, the return is reassessed, creating a tax shortfall of the amount of the rebate claimed. Penalty: The taxpayer has exercised reasonable care as she has followed the instruction as set out in the guide. There was no apparent reason to make further enquires. A reasonable person in the taxpay- er’s circumstances would not have been aware that the church was required to hold approved donee status. There would be no penalty in this case. Example 7 Facts: A salary and wage earner started up a lawn mowing business which he operates in the evenings and weekends, to make some additional income. The taxpayer knows that this additional income is taxable and has set up a cash book system for recording his lawn mowing income. However, occasionally when he is busy he forgets to record some of this income. He prepares his income tax return using the infor- mation in his records. As a result of an audit, he incurs a tax shortfall resulting from lawn mowing income being understated. Penalty: The taxpayer has displayed a lack of reasonable care. Although he has set up a system and kept records, he has not maintained them sufficiently to return the correct amount of income for tax purposes. The result of not keeping accurate records would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in this taxpayer’s circumstances. Therefore there is a 20% penalty for lack of reasonable care. continued on page 14 consequences should take extra care. The standard is designed to encourage taxpayers to ensure that the conclusions they reach are sound. Interpretation or application of a tax law The unacceptable interpretation standard only applies to tax shortfalls caused by a taxpayer treating a tax law as applying in a particular way. A taxpayer treats the tax law as applying in a particular way by concluding that, on the basis of the facts and the way the law applies to those facts, a particular conse- quence follows. An example would be concluding that an amount of expenditure is deductible. In some cases a taxpayer’s tax position may not represent the taxpayer’s conclusions, but instead reflect errors in calculation or transposition. As a broad rule, if a tax shortfall was caused by an error in calculation or transposition error, section 141B will not apply because the taxpayer will not have treated a tax law as applying in relation to a matter in a particular way. An example would be a transposition error in a depreciation schedule. However, in such a case the reasonable care standard would need to be considered. Threshold The unacceptable interpretation standard applies only if the tax shortfall exceeds a specified threshold. Section 141B(2) states: A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if - (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds both - (i)$10,000; and (ii)The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. Tax cap There is a $200,000 tax cap attached to the one percent threshold. The reason for this is that any tax shortfall over $200,000 is considered significant to the revenue, even if it isn’t considered significant to the taxpayer. For example, if a taxpayer’s total tax position was $30 million the cap of $200,000 tax would apply, as one percent of $30 million is $300,000. The taxpayer’s total tax figure The taxpayer’s total tax figure is defined in section 141B(3) as: (a)The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position before any group offset election or subvention payment; or (b)Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period, - (i)Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of - (A)The net losses of the taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (B)The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return; or Example 8 Facts: The taxpayer inherited two rental properties in 1996. The properties had been rented out before he inherited them, and each was being managed by a separate real estate firm. The taxpayer noted that the property values in the area where one of the houses was situated had increased substantially. He undertook renovations in this house which involved redecorating the interior and replacing carpet in the living room. He also had a carport built at this property as there had previ- ously been no off-street parking. In the tax return for the year ended 31 March 1998 he understated his gross income by omitting to return the March rental from one of the properties, because he had not received the rental income statement from the real estate agent. He also claimed a deduction for the expenditure incurred in erecting the carport, along with the cost of redeco- rating and recarpeting one of the properties. As a result of an audit, a tax shortfall was ascer- tained for the understated income, and the expendi- ture claimed for building the carport was disal- lowed. Penalty: The taxpayer had been careless in not returning the rental income for March as he should have been aware that not all of the income for the year had been accounted for. Before claiming the carport as a revenue expense, a reasonable person would have contacted Inland Revenue or an adviser to find out if this expenditure was deductible for tax purposes. Accordingly, there will be a 20% penalty for lack of reasonable care . Unacceptable interpretation Legislation Section 141B provides a penalty for unacceptable interpretations. A taxpayer who has a tax shortfall for a return period will be liable to pay a shortfall penalty if all of the following apply: •The shortfall was caused by a tax position involving an interpretation or application of a tax law. •The tax shortfall exceeded both $10,000 and the lesser of $200,000 or 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. •The tax position taken, when viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. The penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax short- fall. Discussion The unacceptable interpretation standard signals that taxpayers who take a position which has significant tax from page 13 (ii)In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period, - that is shown as tax paid or payable, or losses incurred, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided on time by the taxpayer for the return period. Accordingly, a taxpayer who is in a loss situation for the relevant period may convert the tax losses into a tax figure for the purposes of establishing the total tax position. This is done by using the company tax rate applicable for that period. This applies both for indi- viduals and companies, for the purposes of converting the losses in the relevant period. Note that the losses to be converted are only those incurred for that relevant period - they do not include losses carried forward. For example, if a company made a profit of $50,000 in 1999 and had losses carried forward from 1998 of $100,000, the taxpayer’s total tax position for 1999 would be $50,000, as this is the taxpayer’s tax position before any losses carried forward or offsetting occurs. The relevant return period “Return period” is defined as “..the period covered by a tax return, or which would be covered by a tax return if one were provided”. Therefore if a discrepancy spanned several periods, a separate tax shortfall would be calculated for each return period. Other entities Partnerships Section 141B(8)(a) provides that in establishing whether a partnership is over the threshold it is neces- sary to consider the shortfall incurred by the partnership against the partnership income. This means that for the purposes of calculating whether a partnership is over the threshold, it is treated as a separate entity, as it currently would be for GST. Section 141B(8)(b) provides that the company tax rate applies when calculating the tax shortfall to determine whether a partnership is over the threshold. Example In one return period, a partnership takes various tax positions which result in $1,200,000 tax to pay. During an audit Inland Revenue disallows a claim for a non-allowable deduction, resulting in a tax shortfall of $14,000 for the partnership. The two partners in the partnership share equally in the profits, so each partner would be assessed with an additional $7,000 tax. For the purposes of establishing whether an unac- ceptable interpretation standard applies, the short- fall of the partnership ($14,000) is considered, not that of the individual partners. As the partnership tax shortfall exceeds both $10,000 and $12,000 (being 1% of $1,200,000), the partnership must have an acceptable interpretation. If it is determined that the partnership has an unacceptable interpretation, a shortfall penalty would be imposed. The penalty would be $2,800, being 20% of the tax shortfall. Accordingly, each partner would be assessed with $7,000 tax and a shortfall penalty of $1,400. Trusts When a shortfall arises from a trust the tax shortfall will be assessed as trustee income and any shortfall penalties will be imposed on the trustee. This is because the trust is a separate legal entity, with the trustee liable for tax on any income which is not beneficiary income. Accordingly, when establishing whether the trust is over the threshold it is necessary to consider the shortfall incurred by the trust. Joint ventures Joint venturers will be separately liable for any shortfall penalty as they are independent parties for tax purposes. Generally, a share of gross income is returned by each venturer and the individual expenses of each venturer deducted. In these situations it is appropriate that the threshold for the penalty be determined on each indi- vidual venturer. Similar or identical items Section 141(10) states: If (a)In a return period, a taxpayer takes a taxpayer’s tax position - (i)In respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, an arrangement; or (ii)In respect of an article, item, or matter; and (b)In the same return period, the taxpayer takes a similar or identical taxpayer’s tax position - (i)In respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, a similar or identical arrangement; or (ii)In respect of a similar or identical article, item, or matter, - the tax shortfalls arising from the taxpayer’s tax positions are to be aggregated and deemed to be one tax shortfall. “Identical” and “similar” items are to be treated as one tax shortfall. As no guidance is given in the Act on what “similar” means, it takes its ordinary meaning. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of similar is: Of the same substance or structure throughout; homogeneous. Having a resemblance or likeness; of the same nature or kind. The second of the Government’s discussion documents on this subject provided the following example: Separate lease payments for two cars leased on the same terms will be added together for the purposes of testing whether the threshold has been reached. continued on page 16 Accordingly, identical and similar items must be treated as one for the purposes of determining whether the tax position is over the threshold. What is an “unacceptable interpretation” Section 141B of the Act provides that ..an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law is, in relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer that ....(b) Fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be the correct tax position. Level of standard The unacceptable interpretation standard does not require that the treatment a taxpayer gives to a particu- lar matter must be the better view, or must be more likely than not the correct treatment. The test is “about as likely as not to be correct”. The commentary to the Bill states ...the words ‘about as likely as not correct’ are intended to confirm that it need not be a 50% or more expectation that the taxpayer’s position is the better view. A slightly lower expectation will be accepted... Significant emphasis should be given to the word “about”. It is not intended to remove the right of a taxpayer to take up issues with the Commissioner, rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration, but not necessarily agree with. This means that the prospect of the taxpayer’s interpre- tation being upheld by the court must be substantial, although not necessarily 50 percent. The taxpayer’s argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court. If a taxpayer adopts one of several equally likely interpretations this will generally satisfy the standard, as each position is about as likely as any other position to be the correct tax position. Taxpayer effort The unacceptable interpretation standard is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts. This means that it is not relevant that a taxpayer believes that the position taken was an acceptable interpretation. The unacceptable interpretation standard does not take into account taxpayers’ efforts in resolving unclear issues. The standard is intended to focus on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer’s effort in resolving issues. The strength of the argument is weighed by considering the existence and reasoning of relevant authorities. Relevant authorities have not been defined in the legislation, but the following matters must be considered. Matters which must be considered Section 141B(7) states: The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include - (a)The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b)Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position). Relevant tax laws Tax law is defined in section 3(1), which states: Tax law means - (a)A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b)An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c)A non-disputable decision: (d)In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act:” Section 141B(7)(a) specifically refers to the anti- avoidance provisions. This ensures that it cannot be argued that a tax position or interpretation is an accept- able interpretation in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provi- sions such as general anti-avoidance provisions. This is a scheme and purpose view of tax legislation. Relevant court decisions Factors that affect the weight of an authority: •Source - This refers to the court or tribunal which made the decision upon which the taxpayer places reliance. The higher the source of a decision in the judicial hierarchy, the greater the weight. For exam- ple, a Court of Appeal decision will be accorded greater weight than a TRA decision. •Relevance - Authorities that have similar factual circumstances to the case asserted by a taxpayer are more relevant than those authorities which can be materially distinguished on the facts. •Persuasiveness - An authority that merely states a conclusion is ordinarily less persuasive than one that reaches its conclusions by cogently relating the applicable law to pertinent facts. However, if a taxpayer has no authorities to support a case there may still exist an acceptable interpretation. In such cases, a taxpayer needs a well-reasoned construc- tion of the statutory provision which is about as likely as not to be correct. Opinions expressed by tax professionals The commentary to the bill states ...In the absence of relevant case law, information which supports a reasonable argument may include such items as......the contents of tax opinions, legal articles and related material. However, the mere existence of an opinion from an adviser would not on its own indicate that an acceptable interpretation exists. It is the contents of the opinion, not the fact of seeking advice, which will be relevant. from page 15 Accordingly, the existence of a tax professional’s opinion does not of itself indicate an acceptable inter- pretation, but the contents of that opinion may support an acceptable interpretation. Other matters Other matters which may be considered in particular circumstances include the commentary to the bill, enacting the relevant law, binding public rulings on similar issues, articles written by tax professionals with expertise in the particular field, and related material, and references made to statutes other than the Inland Revenue Acts. Timing Under section 141B(5), whether an interpretation of a tax law is acceptable is to be determined at the time the taxpayer takes a tax position in which the interpretation is involved. To determine whether an unacceptable interpretation exists, one must consider the authorities available at the time the taxpayer took the tax position - generally when the taxpayer files the tax return. In addition, subsequent clarification or development of case law or public rulings in a particular area may confirm that a position taken is acceptable. However, subsequent developments will not be used to argue that a taxpayer’s position was an unacceptable interpretation. For example, a taxpayer may have relied on a court case which was later overturned. The taxpayer would not be penalised because at the time of taking the tax position the law supported the interpretation. An unacceptable interpretation standard applies whether or not the taxpayer has articulated that position. Tax- payers will be able to substantiate their arguments if a dispute arises after filing their returns. However, in most cases taxpayers will need to consider the validity of an interpretation relating to a sizeable transaction when they take the position in their returns or earlier. Binding rulings and the unacceptable interpretation standard The fact that a taxpayer adopts an interpretation that differs from that of a ruling will not necessarily mean that the taxpayer has an unacceptable interpretation. However, the existence of an applicable binding ruling supporting the taxpayer’s position will be an absolute defence against the imposition of a penalty as there will be no tax shortfall. Relationship to the reasonable care standard The aim of the unacceptable interpretation standard is to ensure that taxpayers take care in considering their position. This is also required by the reasonable care standard, but the unacceptable interpretation standard takes away some of the so called “subjective elements” (for example, taxpayer effort) when there is a significant amount of tax at stake. A taxpayer who satisfies the unacceptable interpretation standard is also deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Example 1 Facts: When preparing its tax return, a corporate taxpayer claims a $500,000 deduction for the purchase of a particular item. This deduction exceeds the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation. In taking this tax position, the corporate taxpayer adopted an old TRA decision in which it had been held that items of that nature were revenue expendi- ture. However, over subsequent years case law in this area has evolved, and a recent Privy Council decision clearly established that this type of ex- penditure is of a capital nature and should be capitalised and depreciated, rather than deducted. That decision was given 12 months before the taxpayer took the tax position. Penalty: The taxpayer’s tax position was based on a TRA authority which had similar factual circum- stances, so it would not be considered unreasonable. However, the recent Privy Council decision also had similar factual circumstances which could not be materially distinguished from those of the taxpayer, so its authority outweighs the TRA decision. Accordingly, the corporate taxpayer’s tax position fails to satisfy the standard of “about as likely as not to be correct”. The corporate taxpayer did not have an acceptable interpretation, so a penalty of 20% would be imposed on the tax shortfall resulting from the tax position taken. Example 2 Facts: The taxpayer is a corporate entity involved in property development. Its in-house accountant prepares the year end tax return. During the year the taxpayer purchased land which cost $1,000,000, for the purpose of a large residen- tial housing development project. However, at year end development of the land had not started. The taxpayer sought advice from an outside tax adviser on the appropriate tax treatment of the development of the project. The tax adviser consid- ered that the taxpayer could claim the cost of the land as a deductible expense. However, the adviser overlooked the fact that as development had not yet started the cost of the land had to be added back to income. The corporate taxpayer’s tax return showed that the total tax payable for the year was $210,000. Inland Revenue audited the taxpayer’s income tax return. Even though the cost of the land was a deductible expense, no development had started by year end. The purchase price of the land was considered to be trading stock, and accordingly added back to assessable income. The result was that the taxpayer incurred a tax shortfall in excess of the threshold for requiring an acceptable inter- pretation. continued on page 18 Penalty: The taxpayer had taken reasonable care with its tax affairs as it had sought advice regarding the correct tax treatment of the land purchased. The taxpayer had no reason to doubt the tax advice received about the development project. As the unacceptable interpretation standard is objective, the taxpayer’s efforts and intention are irrelevant. The unacceptable interpretation standard focuses on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer’s effort in resolving the issues. It is clear in statute law that any trading stock must be added back to income at year end, and case law supports this interpretation. The purchase of the land is considered to be trading stock, so the taxpayer’s position does not meet the test of being “about as likely as not correct”. Consequently, the taxpayer is liable to a 20% shortfall penalty for an unacceptable interpretation. Example 3 Facts: A large corporate taxpayer values its closing trading stock at cost price for the year ended 31 March 1998. In accordance with the group’s policy on trading stock it then adjusts the closing stock values, based on a formula which writes down all trading stock by a fixed percentage. The adjust- ment is made to allow for obsolescence. In compiling its tax return for the year ended 31 March 1998, the taxpayer did not add back the adjustment made to the closing stock. The adjust- ment for the return period ended 31 March 1998 was for $730,000 which exceeded the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation. Tax law clearly provides that taxpayers must value their closing stock at either cost price, market selling price or replacement price. The taxpayer has valued the closing stock at cost price, and then made an adjustment to this value, resulting in an overall lower value of trading stock. The taxpayer considers that tax law allows for adjustments to trading stock for obsolescence and, accordingly, contends that the adjustment should not be added back for taxation purposes. It is accepted that adjustments can be made to trading stock for obsolescence. However, using a fixed percentage writedown across all closing stock does not fairly reflect the obsolescence of the individual lines of stock. Statute law requires that the basis used must be fair and reasonable and gives guidance in this area on the factors to be consid- ered. Penalty: Even though the taxpayer used what it considered to be the most appropriate method of valuation, it is well established in tax law that such global adjustments to trading stock, resulting in a stock reserve, are not allowable for tax purposes. To reasonably reflect the obsolescence of stock, the taxpayer should have considered the stock items held on a line by line basis. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s tax position does not meet the test of being “about as likely as not correct”. A 20% penalty for an unacceptable interpretation would be imposed on the tax shortfall. Gross carelessness Legislation Section 141C deals with gross carelessness. It states: (1)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking the taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). (2)The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3)For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences.” Discussion Gross carelessness is a more serious breach than lack of reasonable care. Gross carelessness will occur if a taxpayer’s behaviour displays a high degree of careless- ness and disregard of consequences. Typically, a high level of carelessness will be characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring when this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. Gross carelessness does not require taxpayers to intend to pay less than is owed, but will require more than mere inadvertence or carelessness. Gross carelessness is a new objective standard. It is something more than a lack of reasonable care but less than evasion in that it does not require the necessary intention to evade. Gross carelessness is similar to recklessness. However, the standard does not consider the knowledge or intent of the taxpayer concerned, but rather whether a reason- able person would have known that there was a high chance that the action or inaction would have resulted in a tax shortfall. Gross carelessness is not tax evasion because the taxpayer may not have the requisite criminal intent (mens rea) to evade. However, such action is more than negligence. Gross carelessness is “the doing of some- thing which in fact involves a risk, whether the doer realises it or not, and the risk being such having regard to all the circumstances, that the taking of that risk would be described as ‘gross carelessness’. from page 17 Example 1 Facts: A taxpayer started up a window cleaning business. She knows that her income from this venture is taxable and, after taking the advice of a tax agent, has set up a cash book system for record- ing the income and expenditure. However, over the year she has neglected on numerous occasions to record her income in the cash book. She could find the time to update her cash book if she was better organised, but felt that personal matters were more important. At year end, before giving her records to the tax agent to prepare her income tax return, she makes a guess as to how much income she has earned and notes the cash book accordingly. As a result of an audit by Inland Revenue, it is ascertained that her income has been substantially understated. Penalty: Although the taxpayer is aware that her business income is taxable, she has not kept suffi- cient records to accurately record the income. The result of not keeping complete records would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in this taxpay- er’s circumstances. The taxpayer has demonstrated such a level of carelessness that it resulted in a high risk of her income being understated. This is a higher breach then failure to take reasonable care as there is clearly a complete disregard for the consequences. She would therefore be charged a 40% penalty for gross carelessness. Note that the taxpayer has not intended to evade paying tax. She has consistently, over the year, neglected to take the necessary steps to ensure that the correct amount of income is returned. Example 2 Facts: During the year a large company spent a substantial amount of money on renovations to part of its premises. At year end, the company’s in-house tax accountant claimed all of the expenditure as deductible repairs and maintenance. The accountant was unsure whether all of the items were deductible for tax purposes, but did not bother to review the account to ascertain which items of expenditure were of a capital nature and therefore not deduct- ible. As a result of an IRD audit, a substantial tax shortfall was revealed. Penalty: Any reasonable person in this same situation would have analysed the repairs and expenditure account to ensure that capital items had not been claimed. In neglecting to do so, the company has shown complete disregard for the consequences. Therefore the penalty of 40% for gross carelessness is imposed. The company had not intended to evade paying tax. However, the accountant neglected to take the necessary steps to ensure that the correct amount of income was returned. This is a more serious breach than not taking reasonable care. Example 3 Facts: A company rents some space in a neighbour- ing warehouse as its existing premises are no longer adequate owing to the increase in business. The owner of the company oversees the year end stock take, as he has done for many years. He forgets to include the stock held off premises. Before completing his records to give to his ac- countant, the manager recalls that his stock take figure is not correct. He is aware that he should have accurate figures available for the accountant but considers that he is too busy to take the time to check the stock held off-site. He makes a guess at the value of the stock in the other building and includes this in the total stock take figure. As a result of an IRD audit, a substantial tax shortfall which is caused by the inaccurate stock figures is ascertained. Penalty: The taxpayer did not intentionally set out to underestimate his tax liability. However, he was grossly careless in not ensuring that the stock take figures were accurate. A reasonable person would have foreseen the results of inadequate attention to ensuring the accuracy of the stock take figures. He has displayed a high level of disregard for the consequences. Accordingly, a 40% penalty for gross carelessness is imposed. Abusive tax position Legislation Section 141D introduces a penalty for abusive tax positions. A taxpayer who has a shortfall for a return period will be liable to pay a shortfall penalty for abusive tax position if all of the following apply: •The tax shortfall exceeded $10,000. •The tax position taken is an unacceptable interpretation. •It has a dominant purpose of avoiding of tax. The penalty payable is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. Purpose statement The purpose statement is relatively new to tax law. It is intended to give the judiciary, taxpayers, tax advisers and Inland Revenue officers further guidance on what Parliament intended to achieve. Section 141D(1) introduces the purpose statement for ‘abusive tax positions’. It states: The purpose of this section is to penalise those taxpayers who, having applied an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law, have entered into or acted in respect of arrangements or interpreted or applied tax laws with a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, tax positions, that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits. continued on page 20 Discussion The objective of an avoidance penalty is to deter taxpay- ers from entering into arrangements which have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Such arrangements are a risk to the revenue base. They may rely on literal interpretations of the law but abuse the law’s intent. It is intended that the penalty for abusive tax positions may apply not only when an anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also when other provisions have been applied. This is important to ensure that identical conduct is not penalised differently solely because taxpayers are of different levels of sophistication or because Inland Revenue is not required to resort to an anti-avoidance provision. Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met: •The position taken must be an unacceptable interpre- tation. •It must involve over $10,000 tax. •There must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Unacceptable interpretation The unacceptable interpretation standard will be applied to determine if a penalty is warranted. The standard recognises that there are many uncertainties in law and that more than one valid interpretation of that law is possible. In determining whether an interpretation is unaccept- able, all provisions of the relevant legislation, including the potential application of any general or specific anti- avoidance provisions, will be considered. Therefore, it can not be argued that a tax position or interpretation is acceptable in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provisions such as general anti-avoidance provisions. This is a scheme and purpose view of the tax legislation. (This is discussed under the section on Unacceptable Interpretation.) Threshold Section 141D(4) states: This section applies to a taxpayer only if - ... (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds $10,000. Accordingly, this threshold differs from the threshold for an unacceptable interpretation. The 1% materiality threshold which applies to the “unacceptable interpreta- tion” penalty does not apply to the “abusive tax posi- tion” penalty. Dominant purpose of avoiding tax Section 141D(7) states: For the purposes of this Part, an ‘abusive tax position’ means a tax position that, -... (b)Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes - (i)In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii)Where the tax position does not relate to an arrange- ment described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indi- rectly.” Dominant purpose The Act refers to a dominant “purpose”. This differs from section BB 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which refers to “its purpose or effect is tax avoidance”. Inland Revenue considers that nothing turns on the distinction between “purpose or effect” and “purpose”. In the context of section BB 9, case law certainly supports this view (Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726 ,734). It could be considered that the term “purpose” is more of a “subjective” term than that of “effect”, which is an objective term. However, the new legislation is explicit that the test of whether an arrangement has the domi- nant purpose of avoiding tax is an objective one 1 . It is also firmly established in case law that the purpose of an arrangement is to be argued objectively for section BB 9: Purpose is something to be decided not subjectively in terms of motive but objectively by reference to the arrangement itself 2 . It is well established that the approach is objective not subjective; the taxpayer’s motives are irrelevant, purpose and effect being gathered from the arrangement itself 3 : Avoiding tax The concept of “avoiding tax” encompasses the deferral of tax and the claiming of tax credits. Inland Revenue considers that “avoiding tax” would incorporate “tax avoidance” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Facts to consider The commentary to the bill states that: indicators of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non-availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. Situations which do not involve anti-avoidance provisions A taxpayer may be reassessed under a substantive provision of the Inland Revenue Acts rather than an anti-avoidance provision. This does not mean that the penalty for an abusive tax position cannot apply. Section 141D(6) states: A taxpayer’s tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of either or both of - 1.“Abusive tax position” means a tax position that, viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes ... with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 2.Challenge v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513,533 (CA) 3.Hadlee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1989\] 2 NZLR 447,466 (HC) from page 19 continued on page 21 (a)A general tax law, or (b)A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. The commentary to the bill stated The penalty for abusive tax positions will apply not only in situations where a general or specific anti-avoidance provision is invoked but also where other provisions have been applied. The need for the Commissioner to rely explicitly on an anti- avoidance provision does not necessarily indicate that the tax position is more deserving of a high penalty than an aggres- sive interpretation intended to avoid tax but which fails under another provision. Accordingly, the penalty can apply even when an anti- avoidance provision has not been used. Evasion or similar act Legislation Section 141E of the TAA imposes a penalty for evasion if a taxpayer takes any of the following actions: •evades the assessment or payment of tax on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any another person •knowingly applies or permits someone else to apply a deduction or withholding of tax which had to be paid to the Commissioner •knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax which had to be made; •obtains a refund or payment of tax knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment •enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment. The penalty payable for evasion or similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. Discussion Wilful or knowing breach of an obligation is the most serious form of non-compliance. The civil penalty for tax evasion has been rewritten to apply generically to all revenue tax types. Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to cheat the revenue. This may include a taxpayer obtaining refunds (tax credits, rebates) knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to them and knowingly not accounting for tax deductions to the Commissioner. The category for “evasion or similar act” is not signifi- cantly different from the previous penal tax provision for evasion. The main difference lies in the standard of proof. The difference between the standard of “on balance of probabilities” and “beyond reasonable doubt”, is explained under “Onus and standard of proof” on page 34 of this TIB. Under section 149(5), if a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. However, prosecution does not preclude the Commissioner from imposing the civil penalty for evasion. Example 1 Facts: A salary and wage earner who enjoys working with cars has trained as a mechanic. In the evenings and on weekends he undertakes mechani- cal repairs for customers that he has gained through advertising in the local paper. The taxpayer knows that the money he earns from his private business is taxable but he has no inten- tion of returning the income. To this end, he asks his customers to pay him in cash. He puts this cash into a separate bank account under a false name. At year end, he prepares his income tax return omit- ting all mention of his income earned from his mechanical repair business. Penalty: This taxpayer deliberately attempted to cheat the revenue. He is fully aware that this income is taxable and has taken steps to conceal the income from Inland Revenue. Penalty of 150% for tax evasion is imposed. In addition, he is liable to prosecution for knowingly making a false return with the intention to evade tax. However, prosecu- tion must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Example 2 Facts: A taxpayer owns a business which mainly has cash sales. During the year he took $100 per week from the till for personal use. He banked the remainder in the business bank account. The taxpayer’s accountant prepares his income tax returns. At year end the taxpayer told his account- ant that all the money earned from the business was deposited into the business bank account and none was taken for private use. The taxpayer knew that his income would be understated in his tax return. Penalty: The taxpayer deliberately lied to his accountant to get his income understated and his tax liability reduced. He is liable for a penalty of 150% for tax evasion. In addition, he is liable to prosecution for knowingly filing a false return with the intention of evading tax. However, prosecution must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Example 3 Facts: The taxpayer operates a small business. During the year he has materials and goods deliv- ered to his home. He falsifies details on the invoices to show the delivery details to be his business premises and claims the expenditure as deductible for tax purposes. Inland Revenue undertakes an investigation and the auditor confirms that the expenditure claimed using the altered invoices was private expenditure. Penalty: The taxpayer has deliberately altered invoices to make them appear to be for business expenditure. He is liable to the 150% penalty for continued on page 22 Legislation Section 141G provides that a shortfall penalty imposed on a taxpayer under sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure of all details relating to the tax shortfall. The disclosure must be made either before the taxpayer receives the first notice that an audit or investigation is to be under- taken, or after the first notification but before the audit or investigation starts. The Commissioner may at any time specify the information required for a full volun- tary disclosure and advise the form in which it must be provided The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced is: •for pre-notification disclosure - 75% •for post-notification disclosure - 40% Discussion Disclosure before notification of an audit The fixed rate for shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% (reflecting a minimum penalty of 5% for breaches) for full voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit. The reduced penalty for voluntary disclosure before an audit will apply if the disclosure is made before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. This follows similar procedures already in practice. Notification of a pending audit or investigation will be the date of the written confirmation advising the start of the audit or investigation. In the case of registration checks and other unan- nounced visits, the date of first contact with the taxpayer will be the date of notification. If an investigator is carrying out an audit of one revenue and the taxpayer discloses a discrepancy in another revenue, and the taxpayer has not been notified that the other revenue was going to be audited, then the taxpayer will qualify for the voluntary disclosure before notifica- tion of an audit. Disclosure after notification of an audit A 40 percent shortfall penalty reduction is available for disclosure made after notification of an audit. This reduction will apply if the disclosure is made after the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investiga- tion, but before the start of the audit or investigation. Subsection (4) provides that a taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation if any of the follow- ing persons have received notification: •the taxpayer •an officer of the taxpayer •a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies) •a tax adviser acting for the taxpayer •a partner in a partnership •a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer. evasion. He is also liable to prosecution for know- ingly making a false return with the intention to evade tax. However, prosecution must be taken before a shortfall penalty is imposed. Officers liable to pay amounts equal to shortfall penalties Legislation Section 141F of the TAA deals with cases involving tax deductions and withholding payments. It provides that officers may be liable to pay a shortfall penalty equal to that which could be incurred by their employer if: •the law requires the employer to deduct or withhold tax and pay it to the Commissioner, •an officer of the employer fails to deduct or withhold the tax, or applies or permits the tax to be used for anything other than payment to the Commissioner. Discussion Section 194 previously imposed penal tax upon an employer or any other person who knowingly permitted a deduction to be applied in any way other than to the Commissioner. This section is now repealed. Section 141F replaces the previous provision and allows a shortfall penalty to be imposed upon the officer responsible. The shortfall penalty imposed would be equal to that which could have been imposed on the taxpayer. Accordingly, the Commissioner has not changed the policy on this offence. It is clear that the person who failed to make and/or account for the deductions would have had to do so knowing that the deductions were to be made or accounted for to the Commissioner. This would usually be a person in a responsible position within the company, such as a director or secretary. It would be very unlikely that a person in a clerical position, merely following instructions from a senior officer, would be accountable for the penalty. Factors affecting level of penalty imposed The amount of shortfall penalty may be adjusted for the following reasons: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •disclosure of an unacceptable interpretation at time of filing the return •self-amended returns •obstruction of an Inland Revenue officer during an investigation •temporary shortfall Voluntary disclosure There are two areas of voluntary disclosure: •voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit •voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit. from page 21 Subsection (5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of: 1.the end of the first interview an Inland Revenue officer has with either the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative, after the taxpayer receives the notice. 2.the time when: –an Inland Revenue officer inspects the taxpayer’s information (including books or records) after the taxpayer receives notice; and –the taxpayer is notified of the inspection. Any disclosure made by a taxpayer during an unan- nounced visit would be a disclosure made after notifica- tion of an audit and a 40% reduction in the shortfall penalty will be allowed. Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries in the group. In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notified. If the parent company had received notification that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit. However, if another company in the group has been notified that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notification of an audit. When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notified at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company, not separate entities. Methods of making a voluntary disclosure A voluntary disclosure can be made by either visiting, telephoning or writing to Inland Revenue. In addition, specified forms for voluntary disclosure are available from Inland Revenue. Adequate disclosure Disclosure must be full and complete. This does not mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar, but does require providing enough information to enable the Commissioner to make an assessment. It is not up to the Commissioner to elicit the required information from the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer’s responsibility to have the necessary accounts and returns prepared. If a taxpayer is not able to make a full disclosure at the first point of contact with Inland Revenue, he or she may still make the disclosure and advise the Commis- sioner when the remaining information will be pro- vided. A time limit will be imposed for providing the remaining information. To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times) •an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred •enough information to enable an assessment to be made •a declaration and signature by taxpayer. Section 146(2) states that the Commissioner must not publish the names of taxpayers who make a voluntary disclosure before notification of an audit, if they give complete information and full particulars of: •the relevant offence; or •their tax position giving rise to the relevant shortfall penalty. In addition, a taxpayer who makes a voluntary disclo- sure will not be prosecuted. Self-amended returns Self-amended returns will be treated as a form of voluntary disclosure if they are made before notification of an audit. Accordingly, if the tax shortfall being amended is due to a culpable act, the taxpayer will receive a reduced penalty in accordance with a volun- tary disclosure made before notification of an audit. If a self-amended return is made after notification of an audit but before the start of the audit the taxpayer must provide sufficient details, as is required for voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit, before the amended return will be treated as a voluntary disclosure and any reduction made to the shortfall penalty. If a taxpayer files an amended return after the audit has already started, it will not be treated as a form of voluntary disclosure. For income tax purposes, if an amended return is made before the earlier of the issuing of an assessment for the tax or the due date for payment of the tax, no penalty will be imposed as there will be no tax shortfall. In addition, if a tax shortfall is corrected in a later return period from that in which the original tax position was taken and before notification of an audit, it will be treated as a temporary tax shortfall. Temporary tax shortfalls are discussed later. Disclosure at time of filing Legislation Section 141H provides that: •A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for having an unacceptable interpretation or having taken an abusive tax position may be reduced if adequate disclosure of the tax position is made at the time of filing the tax return. •The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure is 75%. •The Commissioner may at any time specify the type of information required for adequate disclosure and the form in which the information must be provided. continued on page 24 (2)A person who is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) is liable— (a)The first time the person is convicted of that type of offence, to a fine not exceeding $25,000; and (b)on every other occasion the person is convicted of the same type of offence, to a fine not exceeding $50,000. Discussion Taxpayers must co-operate with Inland Revenue, to the extent required by the tax laws, in providing informa- tion and facilitating investigations. Obstruction is a term used to describe situations in which a taxpayer takes steps to prevent the Commissioner from discover- ing part or all of the deficient tax in an audit. Differences between civil obstruction and criminal obstruction For both civil and criminal obstruction the onus of proof rests with the Commissioner. However, the standard of proof varies. The standard of proof for civil obstruction is the civil standard of “on balance of probabilities”. This requires the Commissioner to show that it was more than probable that the event occurred. The standard of proof for criminal obstruction is “beyond reasonable doubt”. In addition, the civil penalty for obstruction can be applied only if there is a tax shortfall, but a tax shortfall is not necessary for the criminal sanction. Meaning of obstruction The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of obstruction is: The action or an act of obstructing something or someone; the condition of being obstructed; the action of impeding the movement of traffic on a highway. A thing impeding or preventing passage or progress; an obstacle, a blockage Case law In Urlich v Police (1989) 4 CRNZ 144: “the ordinary meaning of “obstruct” is to impede or to make more difficult.....” Accordingly, obstruction occurs when the action or actions make it more difficult for the Commissioner or officer to carry out their lawful duties. Obstruction does not require physical use. In Urlich v Police it was found that “there is no reason why words alone, provided they are uttered in circumstances under which they can be believed, cannot amount to obstruc- tion.” Before obstruction can constitute an offence, the con- duct must be without justification and lawful excuse. This was discussed in the following cases: •Goldsmith v Police (1993) 10 CRNZ 106: “The conduct must be obstructive and without justification or lawful excuse.” •Police v Hardaker \[1959\]: “Once a prima facie case of obstruction is made out against a defendant, the onus lies on him to satisfy the Court that his conduct was with lawful justification or excuse.” Discussion A taxpayer can disclose the tax position taken in his or her tax return at the time of filing. Provided the disclo- sure is adequate and the position taken is not frivolous, the taxpayer would be eligible for a reduced penalty if the position is later found to be an unacceptable inter- pretation. For disclosure to be effective, the taxpayer must provide full and relevant arguments for the tax position taken. The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure at the time of filing is 75%. Adequate disclosure at time of filing Section 141H(3) states that the Commissioner may from time to time specify the type of information required for adequate disclosure. Disclosure must be made on a specified form. The following information will be required in order to satisfy the requirement of adequate disclosure: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times) •overview of the position taken •interpretation of case law on the subject, contents of any tax opinions, legal articles and related material •any relevant Inland Revenue public ruling •a calculation, if necessary, to show the position and how it was arrived at •a declaration and signature by taxpayer. The disclosure form must be filed with the return in which the particular tax position has been taken. E-File If the tax return is filed electronically, the specified form will need to be sent to Inland Revenue separately. Obstruction Legislation The new penalty provisions contain both a civil penalty and criminal penalty for obstruction. Section 141K provides for the civil penalty for obstruction as follows: (1)A shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be increased by the Commis- sioner if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position in respect of the taxpayer’s tax liabilities. (2)The level by which a shortfall penalty may be increased for obstruction is 25%. Section 143H provides for the criminal penalty for obstruction as follows: (1)A person who obstructs the Commissioner or an officer of the Department acting in the lawful discharge of the duties or in the exercise of the Commissioner’s or officer’s powers under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. from page 23 •Stewart v Police \[1961\] NZLR 680: “The appellant in evidence gave no reason for his decision to do what he, in fact, did. He might, for example, have given evidence of some reasonable excuse such as sudden illness or the like.” Accordingly, it is clear from case law that two factors must be present before a penalty can be imposed for obstruction. First, the conduct must be obstructive and second, it must be without justification or lawful excuse. Actions that are not obstruction A taxpayer is entitled to: •exercise legal rights (Accordingly, obstruction does not include asserting the right to legal privilege.) •contest an assessment (The obstruction offences are not intended to discourage taxpayers from using legal processes in the course of any disagreement with Inland Revenue.) •maintain an opinion contrary to that of Inland Revenue. Examples of obstruction Examples may include: •refusing reasonable access to business premises •destroying relevant records •successful prosecution of a taxpayer for a section 17 offence of failing to provide records or information requested •lying at an interview •falsifying details in a statement of assets and liabili- ties (IR 110) •deliberate delay by the taxpayer to frustrate Inland Revenue enquiries. Agents and other third parties The civil penalty for obstruction will not apply to agents and third parties. For example, when an agent obstructs an Inland Revenue officer, the civil penalty for obstruc- tion cannot be applied, as it must be the taxpayer who obstructs and there must be a resulting tax shortfall. If agents and third parties obstruct, the criminal offence of obstruction may be used, resulting in prosecution and possible fines. Temporary shortfalls Legislation Section 141I deals with temporary shortfalls. A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall if all of these conditions are met: •It has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability. •No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period for a similar item or matter. •No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage. •The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or cor- rected before the taxpayer was first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. If a shortfall is temporary the shortfall penalty must be reduced; it will be 75% of the penalty that would otherwise apply. Discussion This section is restricted to tax shortfalls which have been permanently reversed or corrected in a return period before notification of an audit or investigation. The definition applies provided that no arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage. Example A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase contract to sell a townhouse. The purchaser pays a deposit to the property developer on 1 June 1997, with the balance being due when the purchaser takes actual possession of the townhouse three months later. The property developer is registered for GST on an invoice basis and files two-monthly GST returns. She returns the amount of the deposit received in the GST return for the period ended 30 June and the balance of the sale price in the GST return for the period ended 31 October. However, the time of supply took place when the contract became unconditional and the deposit was received, so she must return the entire amount of the sale price in the GST period ended 30 June. This results in a tax shortfall of $15,000. As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and the amount is over the specified threshold, she must have an acceptable interpretation for the position taken. Assuming that she doesn’t have an acceptable interpretation, she would be liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall. However, the tax shortfall qualifies as a temporary shortfall because it has been corrected in a later return period before an audit and there is no arrangement to reverse the correction out in a later period. Accordingly, the shortfall penalty imposed would be 5%. continued on page 26 (return) for the same return period, the credit will be offset against the debit for the purposes of calculating the tax shortfall. •If a debit adjustment is made to a taxpayer’s return and that adjustment causes a corresponding credit adjustment in an associated person’s return for the same return period, the resulting refund or increased refund will be offset against the debit. •The Commissioner may treat companies in a wholly- owned group as a single taxpayer when determining a tax shortfall. •If two tax types have different return periods (for example, income tax and GST), the Commissioner may treat one of the tax types as having the same return period as the other. •Similar or identical tax shortfalls will be aggregated and deemed to be one tax shortfall. •If an adjustment to a return increases the taxpayer’s assessable income under section EC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and the taxpayer elects to allocate that increased income to the year of adjustment and any other income year, the total tax shortfall will be computed for the year of adjustment when calculating the penalty. •The tax effect of a tax position taken by a taxpayer in a return period is to be calculated using the taxpayer’s marginal tax rates for that return period. •If a taxpayer has no tax to pay in the return period, the rate of tax that would apply is the lowest marginal rate that would apply to the return period if the taxpayer did have tax to pay. •For the purposes of this section, “tax” does not include a civil penalty. Discussion Before a shortfall penalty can be imposed, there must be a tax shortfall. In calculating this shortfall, adjustments will be offset between wholly-owned group companies and associated persons, and within the same tax type on a return basis. This section also provides that offsets will be allowed across different tax types if these two conditions are met: •An adjustment to one tax type has a direct effect on another tax type. •The effect on the other tax type results in a credit available to be refunded. The amount of the offset will be the lesser of the amount of the refund and the credit available as a direct result of the adjustment. Taxpayers in a loss situation will still be subject to shortfall penalties, but they may elect to pay those penalties by offsetting an equivalent amount of tax losses in accordance with section IG 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994. To calculate the equivalent amount of tax losses, the lowest marginal tax rates are used. Limit to reduction Legislation Section 141J sets out the limit on reducing a shortfall penalty. When a taxpayer who is liable to a shortfall penalty makes a voluntary disclosure, and the penalty is for a temporary tax shortfall, the shortfall penalty will be reduced only once. This means the total reduction will be 75%. Discussion Taxpayers may make a voluntary disclosure of a tempo- rary shortfall. The fixed rate for shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% for voluntary disclosures made before notification of any pending tax audit or investigation. This reduction is consistent with the reduction offered when the tax shortfall is temporary. However, a taxpayer will not receive a reduction for both a temporary shortfall and voluntary disclosure before an audit. In such a case the total penalty reduc- tion will still be 75%. Disputes resolution A taxpayer has the right to disagree with the Commis- sioner’s decision to impose shortfall penalties. The Commissioner will raise the issue of shortfall penalties as soon as practicable, which in most cases will be at the time the substantive issues are being discussed. A Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) will be issued before any assessment or adjustment of shortfall penalties unless there is full agreement with the taxpayer before the issue of the NOPA or a court has directed the adjustment. If the taxpayer cannot resolve the issues in the NOPA with the Inland Revenue officer who initially dealt with the case, the matter will be referred to Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit for further consideration before any assessments are issued. A taxpayer who still disagrees with the assessment has the normal rights of review through the courts. Calculating shortfall penalties Legislation Section 141 deals with calculating tax shortfalls. Here is a summary of its provisions: •A tax shortfall is calculated each time a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty. •A separate tax shortfall calculation is required for each return period and for each tax type. •Each tax deemed to be another tax is a separate tax type. •The tax shortfalls in the return will be calculated taking any overstatement into account on a pro rata basis. •If a debit adjustment in a tax type (return) results in a corresponding credit adjustment in another tax type from page 25 Example An individual taxpayer files a tax return which shows tax losses of $20,000. An audit of the taxpayer establishes that a deduction of $10,000 was not deductible for tax purposes, so there is a tax shortfall of $2,400. A penalty of $480 for lack of reasonable care is imposed, being 20% of the tax shortfall. The taxpayer still has $10,000 losses available, so he may elect to use some of these losses to pay the shortfall penalty of $480. The taxpayer would need to forfeit $2,000 of losses. ($480 ÷ 0.24 = $2,000). 0.24 is the lowest marginal tax rate that applies - 24 cents in the dollar. A taxpayer who has no losses carried forward from prior years, but who expects to have losses in the current year, can elect to use those losses, even though the final determination of the losses for that current year has not been established. Section IG 9A(2) provides that if the taxpayer does incur sufficient losses for that current income tax year, then the shortfall penalties will be deemed to have been paid by the due date. However, if at the end of the income year the taxpayer does not incur sufficient losses, late payment penalties and interest will be imposed on the tax shortfall penalty that should have been absorbed by the losses. A tax shortfall may result in adjustments across varying tax types, which are likely to have different return periods. In such cases, the Commissioner may deem one tax type to have the same return period as another. An example would be when a taxpayer’s income tax return period ends on 31 March, and the GST period spanning that date is 1 March to 30 April. In this case, the Commissioner may decide to treat both tax types as having the 31 March return period. The two examples that follow demonstrate how the penalty offset applies. The shortfall penalty categories used in these examples have been applied for calcula- tion purposes only. Example 1 This example includes calculations for shortfall penalties, late payment penalties and interest. A taxpayer is audited as follows: •Income tax - year ended 31 March 1998 •GST - 6 two-monthly periods from the period ended 31 May 1997 •FBT - four quarters from the quarter ended 30 June 1997 Several shortfalls were found in all three revenues. Because of the interrelationship between GST and income tax, and between FBT and income tax, a credit adjustment occurred in the income tax calculation. In the following calculations, the shortfalls have been converted into tax shortfalls. Shortfall penalties Income tax The following income tax shortfalls attract shortfall penalties: Gross carelessness$12,339.364%40%$4,834.73 Lack of reasonable care$36,442.7912%20% $7,252.10 Lack of reasonable care - temporary shortfall 4 $259,247.3484% 5% $12,691.17 Total$308,029.49 $24,778.00 Less adjustments for GST and FBT assessed ($5,858.64) Tax shortfall$302,170.85 1 Calculating tax shortfall: any credits that became available to the taxpayer as a result of the audit must be taken into account. Therefore the tax shortfall equals the total tax discrepancy less the tax value of any credits ascertained. 2 Calculating percentage of total: percentage of total is calculated on the total tax discrepancy before the credit adjustments are deducted as follows: 12,339.36 ÷ 308,029.49 = 4% 36,442.79 ÷ 308,029.49 = 12% 259,247.34 ÷ 308,029.49 = 84% 3 Calculating the penalty: to calculate the total, the adjusted tax shortfall is used \[as the denominator\] to obtain the amount of penalty attributed to each tax shortfall: 302,170.85 x 4% = 12,086.83 x 40%=4,834.73 302,170.85 x 12% = 36,260.50 x 20%=7,252.10 302,170.85 x 84% = 253,823.51 x 5%=12,691.17 Total shortfall penalty=24,778.00 4 Calculating temporary shortfall: Penalty rate for temporary shortfall is 75% of the standard rate for a culpable act. In this example there is a penalty for lack of reasonable care, but the tax shortfall was temporary. The lack of reasonable care penalty (20%) is therefore reduced to 5%. Goods and services tax The taxpayer did not take reasonable care in calculating the GST liability, so there is a 20% shortfall penalty. The following tax shortfalls were established: 31 May 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Jul 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 30 Sept 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Oct 1997$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Jan 1998$3,379.5720%$675.91 31 Mar 1998 $3,379.57 20% $675.91 Total$20,277.42$4,055.46 Fringe benefit tax The taxpayer did not take reasonable care in calculating the FBT liability, so there is a 20% shortfall penalty. The following tax shortfalls were established: continued on page 28 Interest Income tax Interest will be calculated from the time the tax shortfall was originally due (7 February 1999) until the date of the amended Notice of Assessment (30 November 1999) - a total of 296 days. The amount of interest shown on the amended notice of assessment would be as follows: $302,170.85 x 296 x 12% = $29,405.77 365 In this example the taxpayer was allowed two months in which to pay the tax shortfall, interest and penalties. The taxpayer did not pay within this time so interest continues to accrue from the date the amended Notice of Assessment is issued (30 No- vember 1999) to the date payment is made. Calcula- tions for the various periods are as follows: –1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000 (61 days): $302,170.85 x 61 x 12% = $6,059.97 365 –1 January 2000 to 27 February 2000 (28 days): $334,296.29 x 28 x 12% = $3,160.21 365 –28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000 (31 days): $350,162.21 x 31 x 12% = $3,568.78 365 –31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 (16 days): $357,165.45 x 16 x 12% = $1,878.79 365 Therefore total interest calculated would be as follows: 7 February 1999 to 30 November 1999$29,405.77 1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000$6,059.97 31 January 2000 to 27 February 2000$3,160.21 28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000$3,568.78 31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 $1,878.79 Total$44,073.52 The taxpayer’s statement of account issued on 15 April 2000 would look like this: 30/11/99Shortfall$302,170.85$302,170.85 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$24,778.00$326,948.85 31/1/20005% LPP$16,347.44$343,296.29 28/2/20002% LPP$6,865.92$350,162.21 31/3/20002% LPP$7,003.24$357,165.45 15/4/2000Interest$44,073.52$401,238.97 Goods and services tax Interest is calculated on each period up to the date of the amended notice of assessment as follows: –For the period ended 31 May 1997 the original due date was 30 June 1997. From 1 July 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 883 days. $3,379.57 x 883 x 12% = $ 981.09 365 30 Jun 1997$12,722.0620%$2,544.41 30 Sept 1997$12,722.0620% $2,544.41 31 Dec 1997$12,722.0620%$2,544.41 31 Mar 1998$12,722.06 20% $2,544.41 Total$50,888.24$10,177.64 Summary of shortfall penalties Total shortfall penalties incurred by the taxpayer are as follows: Income tax$24,788.00 Goods and services tax$4,055.48 Fringe benefit tax$10,177.64 Total$39,011.12 Late payment penalties Income tax Amount of tax shortfall$302,170.85 Amount of shortfall penalty$24,778.00 The original due date for the 1998 income tax period is 7 February 1999. The amended notice of assessment is dated 30 November 1999, and it sets a new due date of 30 January 2000. Assuming that, as at 15 April 2000, the taxpayer has not paid the tax shortfall or the shortfall penalties, the late payment penalty would be calculated as follows: 30/11/99Shortfall$302,170.85$302,170.85 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$24,778.00$326,948.85 31/1/20005% LPP$16,347.44$343,296.29 28/2/20002% LPP$6,865.92$350,162.21 31/3/20002% LPP$7,003.24$357,165.45 Goods and services tax For this example, late payment penalty has been calculated for the period ended 31 May 1997 only. The calculations for other periods are similar. Tax shortfall attributed to each period$3,379.57 Shortfall penalty attributed to each period$675.91 The amended notice of assessment is dated 30 No- vember 1999, and it sets a new due date of 30 Janu- ary 2000. Assuming that, as at 15 April 2000, the taxpayer has not paid the tax shortfall or the shortfall penalties, the late payment penalty is calculated as follows: 30/11/99Shortfall$3,379.57$3,379.57 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$675.91$4,055.48 31/1/20005% LPP$202.77$4,258.25 28/2/20002% LPP$85.16$4,343.41 31/3/20002% LPP$86.86$4,430.27 Fringe benefit tax In this example the FBT shortfall and associated shortfall penalties were paid by the new due date of 30 January 2000. Accordingly, no late payment penalties would be imposed. from page 27 –For the period ended 31 July 1997 the original due date was 31 August 1997. From 1 September 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 821 days. $3,379.57 x 821 x 12% = $ 912.20 365 –For the period ended 30 September 1997 the original due date was 31 October 1997. From 1 November 1997 to 30 November 1999 is 760 days. $3,379.57 x 760 x 12% = $ 844.42 365 –For the period ended 30 November 1997 the original due date was 15 January 1998.

From 1 March 1998 to 30 November 1999 is 640 days. $3,379.57 x 640 x 12% = $ 711.09 365 –For the period ended 31 March 1998 the original due date was 30 April 1998. From 1 May 1998 to 30 November 1999 is 579 days. $3,379.57 x 579 x 12% = $643.32 365 Total interest = $4,852.10 For this example, further interest has been calcu- lated on the period ended 31 May 1997 only. The calculations for other periods are similar. The taxpayer’s Notice of Assessment was issued on 30 November 1997, and allowed the taxpayer until 30 January 1998 to pay the tax shortfall, interest and penalties. However, the taxpayer did not pay until 15 April 2000, so interest continued to accrue from the date of the amended notice of assessment (30 November 1999) until the date payment is made. The calculations are as follows: –1 December 1999 - 30 January 2000 (61 days): $3,379.57 x 61 x 12% = $67.77 365 –31 January 2000 - 27 February 2000 (28 days): $4,258.25 x 28 x 12% = $39.20 365 –28 February 2000 - 30 March 2000 (31 days): $4,343.25 x 31 x 12% = $44.26 365 –31 March 2000 - 15 April 2000 (16 days): $4,430.27 x 16 x 12% = $23.30 365 Therefore total interest calculated for the period ended 31 May 1997 would be as follows: 30 June 1997 to 30 November 1999$ 981.09 1 December 1999 to 30 January 2000$67.77 31 January 2000 to 27 February 2000$39.20 28 February 2000 to 30 March 2000$44.26 31 March 2000 to 15 April 2000 $23.30 Total$1,155.62 The taxpayer’s statement of account for the May 1997 period will look like this: 15/4/2000Interest$44,073.52$401,238.97 30/11/99Shortfall$3,379.57$3,379.57 30/11/99Shortfall penalty$675.91$4,055.48 31/1/20005 % LPP$202.77$4,258.25 28/2/20002 % LPP$85.16$4,343.41 31/3/20002 % LPP$86.86$4,430.27 15/4/2000Interest$1,155.62$5,585.89 Fringe benefit tax The calculation that applied for GST will also apply to each FBT quarter. Interest will be calculated on each quarterly shortfall from the date the tax was originally due to the date of the amended notice of assessment, and then on the account balance including shortfall penalty and late payment penalty (but not on any previous interest charged) through to the date of payment. Only interest has been calculated in this case. Shortfall attributed to each quarter = $12,722.06 Interest calculated on each period up to the date of the amended notice assessment is as follows: –Period ended 30 June 1997 (original due date 20 July 1997). From 21 July 1997 to 30 Novem- ber 1999 = 863 days. $12,722.06 x 863 x 12% = $3,609.57 365 –Period ended 30 September 1997 (original due date 20 October 1997). From 21 October 1997 to 30 November 1999 = 771 days. $12,722.06 x 771 x 12% = $3,224.78 365 –Period ended 31 December 1997 (original due date 20 January 1998). From 21 January 1998 to 30 November 1999 = 679 days. $12,722.06 x 679 x 12% = $2,839.98 365 –Period ended 31 March 1998 (original due date 20 April 1998).

Accordingly, no further interest is accrued. continued on page 30 Therefore, after considering the culpability resulting from the partnership shortfall, the amount of shortfall is then allocated to the partners and the tax shortfall ascertained. Shortfall penalties are then imposed on the individual partners based on each individual partner’s tax shortfall. As a result of the audit of the partnership the following shortfalls have been ascertained and are liable to penalty: Year ended 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $2,955, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $1,477.50 (50% of total shortfall). Year ended 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $23,140, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $11,570 (50% of total shortfall). Unacceptable interpretation 5 : The partnership shortfall ascertained is $33,634, so the share of shortfall allocated to each partner is $16,817. Individual partners As a direct result of the audit of the company and partnership the partners have incurred tax short- falls. The shortfalls arose due to the assessing of deemed dividends to the partners in their respective returns. The partners are liable to penalty as follows: Note: for the purpose of the exercise, tax shortfall is calculated at a rate of 33%. Year ended 31 March 1998 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $3,407 (50% of deemed dividends disallowed). The tax shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $1,124.31 Year ended 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $2,804 (50% of deemed dividends disallowed). The tax shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $925.32. Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $2,954. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $1,477 (50% of total shortfall). This means each partner’s tax shortfall is $487.41. 5 When determining whether the shortfall breaches the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation, the figure used is the shortfall in the partnership return, not the amount allocated to the original partners. Example 2 This example involves a partnership consisting of two 50/50 partners who also run a company. The partners are the company shareholders, and they do all of their own day to day accounting. At the end of the year they give their paperwork to their account- ant. During the year end meeting with the accountant, the partners neglected to advise the accountant that they sometimes pay personal accounts through the company. The accountant assumed that all accounts paid were company expenses. Inland Revenue audited both the company and the partnership. Company The audit covered the income tax return periods ended 31 March 1998, 31 March 1999 and 31 March 2000. A number of discrepancies were ascertained and culpability has been considered. In the years ended 31 March 1999 and 2000, the taxpayer incurred shortfalls for which Inland Revenue considered shortfall penalties were war- ranted. However, as a result of the audit, credits were ascertained in those years which reduced the tax shortfall to a negative amount. As a result no penalty was imposed for those years. In the following example, the shortfall has been converted into a tax shortfall. 31.3.98 Lack of reasonable care$6,81420%$1,362.80 31.3.99 Lack of reasonable care$5,608Nil Less cr. adjustments($20,428 ) Tax shortfall($14,820) 31.3.2000 Lack of reasonable care$4,000Nil Unacceptable interpretation11,367Nil Less cr.adjustments($17,615) Tax shortfall($2,248) Partnership During the audit of the partnership for the return periods ended 31 March 1999 and 2000, shortfalls were ascertained and penalties imposed. The partnership return for the year ended 31 March 1998 did not require reassessment, but the partners incurred a 1998 shortfall each as a result of the audit of their company. As the partnership is not assessed with tax, the shortfall is allocated to the partners in their respec- tive percentages and at their respective tax rates. from page 29 Year ended 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care: The total deemed dividend allocated to each partner as a result of company audit is $2,000 (50% of deemed dividend disallowed). Tax shortfall allo- cated to each partner is therefore $660. Lack of reasonable care: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $23,140. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $11,570 (50% of total shortfall), and each partner’s tax shortfall is $3,818.10 Unacceptable interpretation: The partnership shortfall ascertained is $33,634. The share of shortfall allocated to each partner is therefore $16,817. Each partner’s tax shortfall is $5,549.61. Penalties will be calculated for each partner as follows: 31 March 1998 Lack of reasonable care$1,124.3120%$224.86 31 March 1999 Lack of reasonable care$925.3220%$185.06 Lack of reasonable care $487.4120% $97.48 Total penalty$282.54 31 March 2000 Lack of reasonable care$660.0020%$132.00 Lack of reasonable care$3,818.1020%$763.62 Unacceptable interpretation $5,549.61 20%$1,123.10 Total penalty$2,005.54 Summary Total penalty imposed for each partner: Year ended31.3.98$224.86 31.3.99$282.54 31.3.2000$2,005.54 Total penalty$2,512.94 Due dates for paying penalties Legislation These sections set the due dates for paying penalties: 142Late filing penaltylater of 30 days after notification and various dates as set out in legislation 142ATax that is not aat least 30 days after notice penalty (if amountof assessment or reassess- due on a due datement issued is increased) 142BShortfall penaltiesat least 30 days after notice of assessment or reassess- ment issued 142CPayments by officersat least 30 days after notice of assessment or reassess- ment issued 142DRepayment of excesslater of 30 days after the refund or credit of taxdate of notification requiring payment or the date specified in the notice 142EImputation penalty20 June following the end tax and dividend with-of the imputation year holding penalty tax 142EunderestimationTerminal tax date for penalty taxincome year to which unpaid provisional tax relates 142Fdeferrable tax30th day after the last day of the relevant period of deferral Discussion A taxpayer who is charged a shortfall penalty will generally receive a new due date for paying both the penalty and the tax shortfall to which the penalty relates. The exception is if the taxpayer has failed to file a return. However, interest on the unpaid tax will still be charged from the original due date until the date the assessment identifying the shortfall is issued. Criminal penalties Legislation The legislation provides for criminal penalties under the following sections: 143 -Absolute liability offences 143A -Knowledge offences 143B -Evasion or similar offences 143C -Offence for failure of officers of Department to maintain secrecy 143D -Offence for failure of other persons to maintain secrecy 143E -Secrecy requirements where information given by Department 143F -Offence in relation to inquiries 143G -Offence in relation to court orders 143H -Obstruction 145 -Penalties for offences for which no specific penalty imposed 147 -Employees and officers 148 -Aiding or abetting Discussion In current legislation criminal offences and penalties are contained in a number of the Inland Revenue Acts. They duplicate each other and treat similar breaches in an inconsistent manner. In many cases the penalties are ineffective. The new legislation consolidates the criminal offences and standardises the resulting penalties across all revenues. The sanctions for some offences have been increased so they act as a more effective deterrent. A maximum jail continued on page 32 •knowingly provides altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information (including tax returns and tax forms) •knowingly does not account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax deducted or withheld •knowingly does not deduct or withhold tax •knowingly issues two tax invoices (as defined in the GST Act) for the same taxable supply. Several subsections provide that persons or companies are not liable to conviction if they did not hold the information requested, or any failure to make or account for withholding payments was beyond their control. The maximum penalties for conviction under section 143A are: •$25,000 for a first offence •$50,000 for any subsequent offence. However, under subsection (8) the penalty for know- ingly not accounting to the Commissioner for a deduc- tion or withholding payment made is imprisonment for up to five years, and/or a fine of up to $50,000. This applies for each occasion the person is convicted. A taxpayer who makes a deduction but fails to return it to Inland Revenue has committed an offence similar to evasion, and will be penalised accordingly. This offence will only require the proof of knowledge. Evasion or similar offences Section 143B(1) provides that the following are offences: •knowingly not keeping the books and documents that must be kept •knowingly not providing information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so •knowingly providing altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information (including tax returns and tax forms) •knowingly not making a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made •pretending to be another person for any purpose or reason relating to a tax law – – if a person does them for any of these reasons: •to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or any other person •to obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment •to enable another person to obtain a refund or pay- ment of tax in the knowledge that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment. In addition, section 143B(2) provides that a person who evades or attempts to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or another person commits an offence. The penalty, if convicted under section 143B is impris- onment for up to five years, and/or a fine of up to $50,000. term of five years may be imposed for evasion, and for most offences a maximum monetary fine of $50,000 may be imposed. While higher sanctions have been introduced, the nature and scope of the offences have not changed signifi- cantly. Tax offences relating to negligence have been repealed as the new shortfall penalties will punish negligent conduct. Criminal offences fall into three broad categories: •absolute liability offences •offences for knowingly failing to comply with an obligation •evasion or similar offences Absolute liability offences Section 143(1) provides that it is offence if a person – •does not keep the books and documents required to be kept by a tax law •does not provide information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so by a tax law •does not apply for registration as required under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It is fundamental to the operation of the tax system that taxpayers provide and maintain information. Accord- ingly, failure to keep the books and documents required by a tax law and provide information to the Commis- sioner when required to do so by a tax law are to remain absolute liability offences. The only defence against conviction under the absolute liability offences would be if the person required to provide information, other than tax returns and tax forms, did not have the information in his or her “...knowledge, possession, or control...” However, the obligation always remains with the taxpayer to provide tax returns or tax forms even if the taxpayer has con- tracted with a third party to meet that obligation. The penalty for conviction of an absolute liability offence is: •a maximum of $4,000 for a first offence; •a maximum of $8,000 for a second offence; •a maximum of $12,000 for any subsequent offence. Knowledge offences A person may be convicted for a number of offences for knowingly breaching a tax obligation. Section 143A outlines the knowledge offences. Knowledge offences include instances when a person: •knowingly does not keep the books and documents that must be kept •knowingly does not provide information (including tax returns and tax forms) when required to do so from page 31 Offences relating to court orders Legislation Under section 143G a person who fails to comply with the terms of a Court order made under section 17A commits an offence. Anyone who is convicted of such an offence is liable to the same penalties that may be imposed under section 112 of the District Courts Act 1947. Discussion Section 112(c) of the District Courts Act 1947 sets out the penalty for disobeying the order or direction of any officer of the Court. For each offence, the Judge may sentence the person to prison for up to three months, or to a fine of up to $1,000. Obstruction Section 143H states: a person who obstructs the Commissioner or an officer of the Department acting in the lawful discharge of the duties or in the exercise of the Commissioner’s or officer’s powers under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. The penalty for this offence is a maximum fine of $25,000 for the first offence and $50,000 for subsequent offences. Civil and criminal penalties for obstruction are ex- plained on page 24 of this TIB. Aiding or abetting Section 148 states: (1)A person who aids, abets, incites, or conspires with another person to commit an offence...also commits an offence against this Act. (2)A person convicted of aiding, abetting, inciting, or conspiring...is liable for up to the same maximum fine or term of imprisonment, or both, that could apply to a person who commits the principal offence. A person who aids or abets another to commit an offence will be liable to the same penalty as the person who commits the principal offence. This could result in a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. Penalties for offences for which no specific penalty is imposed Section 145 imposes fines for offences for which no particular penalty is prescribed. It imposes a fine of up to $15,000 for a first offence and up to $25,000 for any subsequent offences. Other offences The following sections have been carried over from the previous Inland Revenue Acts: Section 143C - Offence for failure of Inland Revenue officers to maintain secrecy Section 143D - Offence for failure of other persons to maintain secrecy Section 143E - Secrecy requirements where information given by Inland Revenue Section 143F - Offence in relation to inquiries Section 144 - Certain offences in relation to Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Section 150 - Information may charge several offences Section 150A - Information may be laid within 10 years for income tax and GST offences Section 150B - Information may be laid within 4 years for stamp duty and gaming duty offences Section 150C - Authority to lay information Section 150D - Evidence in proceedings for failure to furnish returns and information Section 150E - Evidence inconsistent with instrument not admissible to reduce stamp duty Section 151 - Non-presentation of instrument for stamping Section 152 - Evidence of financial or property transac- tions Publication of names Section 146 specifies that names of the following must be published in the Gazette: •anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position •anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or similar act (including knowingly failing to deduct a tax deduction) •anyone convicted of knowingly failing to account for a tax deduction •anyone convicted of evasion or similar act •anyone convicted of aiding, abetting, inciting or conspiring with another person to evade tax or fail to account for a tax deduction. The section also sets out the details which the Commis- sioner must publish about each person. Employees and officers Legislation Under section 147 a company’s employee, agent, or officer commits an offence if the company commits an offence (the principal offence) and either of the follow- ing apply: •The principal offence was caused by an act or omis- sion of the employee, agent or officer, or through knowledge attributable to him or her. •The principal offence is evasion committed by the employee, agent, or officer. An employee or officer of a company includes anyone who is responsible for undertaking an action on the company’s behalf. If such a person is convicted, he or she is liable for up to the same maximum fine and/or term of imprisonment that apply for committing the principal offence. continued on page 34 •whether or not to make an order requiring the tax- payer to produce the information requested •whether or not the information required is subject to legal professional privilege. Subsection (8) authorises the court to order production of information or any part for review by the Commis- sioner if the court is satisfied that the information is not subject to legal professional privilege, and meets either of these conditions: •It is likely to be relevant for a purpose relating to administering or enforcing any Inland Revenue Act. •It involves a matter connected with another function conferred on the Commissioner. Forms of legal professional privilege other than that established in section 20 may be claimed for tax pur- poses. For example, litigation privilege under which information obtained from third parties for the purposes of litigation against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is protected from disclosure, even though it does not strictly fall within section 20. Standard of proof When deciding whether or not to grant a court order the court considers whether the request is reasonable. The standard of proof required in proving that the request is reasonable is the balance of probabilities. Interaction with section 17 Section 17 allows the Commissioner to obtain informa- tion which is necessary to administer or enforce the Inland Revenue Acts. This provision will be used first to obtain information. If the information is not forthcom- ing the Commissioner can either prosecute the taxpayer or seek a court order. The imposition of a court order is an additional incentive for the taxpayer to provide the information. A taxpayer who fails to provide the information could be liable to a harsher sanction than that provided by section 17, including a term of impris- onment. Onus and standard of proof Section 149A sets out the standard and onus of proof as follows: PenaltyStandard of proofOnus of proof Civil penalty exceptBalance ofTaxpayer evasion or obstructionprobabilities Civil penalty forBalance ofCommissioner evasion or obstructionprobabilities Criminal penaltiesBeyondCommissioner reasonable doubt Application of CourtBalance ofCommissioner Orders under sec. 17Aprobabilities Civil standard and criminal standard - the difference The difference between the two standards is clearly established in case law. The standard in criminal cases is proof “beyond reasonable doubt” and the civil stand- ard is proof “on the balance of probabilities”. Discussion This section imposes a penalty upon a company’s employee, agent or officer if that person was responsible for the company committing a breach. Such a person is liable to the same fine as any other person who would have committed the offence. The penalty could include a fine or term of imprisonment, or both. For a fine to be imposed upon a company’s employee, agent or officer, the Commissioner would have to prove to the standard of “beyond reasonable doubt” that the person had knowingly or intentionally committed the breach. Obviously, a clerk who follows instructions given by a senior officer and does not know that a breach is being committed would not be liable to a fine or imprisonment if the company was found to have committed a breach. Court orders Legislation Section 17A gives the Commissioner an additional power to obtain information or tax returns which are necessary to administer or enforce the Inland Revenue Acts. If a taxpayer fails to provide information or tax returns requested under section 17, the Commissioner may apply to the District Court for an order requiring the person to produce the information for review. A court order can be used instead of or in conjunction with prosecution for failure to furnish information or a return, or after prosecution has occurred and the information or return is still outstanding. Discussion Application The Commissioner can apply to the District Court for an order asking the person named in the application to provide information or a return. The court will then issue notice to the person, who will have the opportunity to appear at the hearing of the application. On hearing the application, the court may order the person to produce the documents or may vary the order. Appeal rights A taxpayer may appeal the District Court decision to the High Court, as the High Court has jurisdiction over any District Court decisions. Likewise the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over High Court decisions. Legal professional privilege A court order cannot require the production of docu- ments which are subject to legal professional privilege. This is in line with section 20. In general, claims to legal professional privilege are expected to be deter- mined by the court in the course of hearing the Com- missioner’s application for the court order. Subsection (7) authorises the courts to review the information requested to determine: from page 33 The difference cannot be any more clearly defined than the often quoted exposition by Lord Denning in Miller v Minister of Pensions \[1947\] 2 All ER 372, at 373-374. His lordship began with the criminal standard: That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reason- able doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence “of course it is possible but not in the least probable” the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice. In relation to the civil standard, Lord Denning said: That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of probability but not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the evidence is such that the tribunal can say: ‘We think it more probable than not’, the burden is discharged, but if the probabilities are equal, it is not. Garrow and McGechan’s Principals of Law of Evidence (1984 7 ed, at p.27) commented: ...in a civil action the standard is merely ‘more likely than not’, permitting a reasonable doubt nevertheless whether the finding is correct; whereas in a criminal case the Court must be ‘sure’ in the sense that no reasonable doubt remains. It is to be emphasised that doubt, to be effective to preclude proof, in a criminal case must be ‘reasonable’, as distinguished from fantastic or purely speculative or irrational. Garrow and McGechan (at p.29) also cautioned on the use of substitutes for beyond reasonable doubt: Epithets such as ‘morally certain’ should not be used. The expression ‘giving the prisoner the benefit of the doubt’ should not be used. It is not a question of giving the benefit of doubt; if the jury are left with any degree of doubt that the prisoner is guilty, then the case has not been proved: R v Onufrejczyk \[1955\] 1 QB 388. Clearly, the standard of proof for imposing a criminal penalty is much higher than that required to impose a civil penalty. Onus of proof When challenging the imposition of a civil penalty, except for evasion or obstruction, the onus of proof will lie with the taxpayer. This is considered reasonable as matters raised by way of defence by a taxpayer are primarily within the knowledge of the taxpayer. In these circumstances it would be extremely difficult for the Commissioner to discharge the onus. Proper record keeping, full and honest disclosure to agents and conformity with the advice of agents are all matters within a taxpayer’s control. However, the onus rests with the Commissioner for civil penalties for evasion and obstruction and all criminal penalties. These are more serious breaches of the Inland Revenue Acts, and before imposing penalties for such breaches the Commissioner should be required to have gathered sufficient evidence to discharge the onus of proof. The Commissioner must also satisfy the onus of proof for court orders. Imposition of civil and criminal penalties Legislation Section 149 sets down the following rules about impos- ing a penalty: •Each time a taxpayer breaches a tax obligation he or she may be liable to a civil penalty, and/or to a criminal penalty (if convicted). •A taxpayer is liable to only one shortfall penalty for each tax shortfall. •If a taxpayer could be liable to more than one shortfall penalty for a tax shortfall, the highest shortfall penalty is to be imposed. •The Commissioner may assess and impose civil penalties after a taxpayer has been prosecuted for an offence under the Act, whether or not the prosecution is successful. •If a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. Discussion There are instances when a single breach will make the taxpayer liable to both a civil and a criminal penalty. Examples are evasion and failure to file a tax return. The Commissioner may impose both civil and criminal penalties for the same breach provided that the Com- missioner prosecutes the taxpayer before imposing the civil penalty. A new section 94A provides that when assessing civil penalties, the Commissioner must use the same proc- esses as apply to the tax on which the penalty is im- posed. Section 94A states: (1)The Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of a civil penalty in the same way as the Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of the tax in respect of which the penalty is imposed; (2)The Commissioner must assess a shortfall penalty in the same way as the tax to which it relates, but separately from the tax; (3)The Commissioner may assess a shortfall penalty before or after unpaid tax has been assessed, or has become assessable or payable, or has been paid. Late filing penalties and late payment penalties will be imposed at the time that the non-compliant action occurs. These penalties will not be subject to the new disputes resolution rules. Section 138K(2) provides that a taxpayer has no right to challenge charging or amount of a civil penalty assessed by the Commissioner for late filing of a tax return or late payment of tax. Taxpayers may dispute the imposition of shortfall penalties, but they cannot dispute the amount. Part 6 - Remissions Introduction Remission provisions are needed to allow the Commis- sioner to accommodate circumstances when a penalty is not appropriate. The main remission provisions the Act provides are: •remission for reasonable cause •remission consistent with collecting the highest net revenue over time. Provisions that apply to specific situations, such as the provisional tax underestimation provision, will remain. The new provisions will apply to all the Inland Revenue Acts and the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act. Provisions to remit late payment penalties, late filing penalties and interest accommodate circumstances in which it was not equitable to impose penalties or interest. There is no provision to remit shortfall penalties. This is because a taxpayer’s circumstances are taken into account before a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion is imposed. Background The Inland Revenue Acts currently provide for the remission of penalties if the Commissioner considers remission “equitable”. If a penalty can be imposed because a taxpayer has failed to meet an obligation, but not applying it can be justified on equity grounds, the penalty is remitted. Remission is initiated by a taxpayer and results in the debt being legally forgiven. Key features •Late payment penalties and late filing penalties may be remitted when taxpayers have “reasonable cause beyond their control”. •Shortfall penalties will not be remitted. •Interest may be remitted or cancelled in limited circumstances. •There is a general discretionary remission consistent with the Commissioner’s objective to collect the highest net revenue over time. •There are specific legislative guidelines for instalment arrangements. Legislation Under section 183A the Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty, a late payment penalty, any imputation penalty tax or any dividend withholding penalty tax if both of these conditions are met: •The taxpayer has reasonable cause for paying late or not filing a return on time. •The taxpayer pays the unpaid tax as soon as practica- ble. Reasonable cause could include an event such as accident or disaster, or illness or emotional or mental distress. It does not include an omission by an agent, unless caused by an event or circumstance beyond the agent’s control which could not have been avoided by following accepted business standards and professional conduct. Reasonable cause also excludes the taxpayer’s financial position. Section 183B provides that the Commissioner may cancel incremental late payment penalties if taxpayers have satisfied the terms of an instalment arrangement entered into with the Commissioner. If taxpayers arrange to pay a tax debt by instalment before the due date for the tax (knowing they are in financial difficulty) the initial late payment penalty will also be reduced from 5% to 2%. Section 183C provides that interest will be cancelled for the period from the date of the notice until the due date specified in the notice if tax is paid by the due date stated in the notice. It also provides that late payment penalties on deferrable tax in the period of deferral will be cancelled if the taxpayer makes a competent objection or starts proceed- ings to challenge an assessment. Section 183D states that the Commissioner may remit a late filing penalty, late payment penalty or interest if it is consistent with the collection of the highest net revenue over time. Section 183E states that if the unpaid tax is remitted, the interest relating to that tax will be remitted. Section 183F states that late payment penalty and interest will not be charged if the related unpaid tax is $100 or less on a specific due date. Section 183G states that if the Commissioner remits an amount of penalty or tax and the taxpayer has already paid it, the amount will be refunded to the taxpayer or applied towards meeting another tax liability. Section 183H states that a taxpayer who wishes to apply for remission or cancellation must apply in writing, and must produce any information the Commissioner requires about the request. Discussion Late payment penalties and late filing penalties may be remitted under two categories: reasonable cause, or if remission will result in collecting the highest net revenue over time. Interest may only be remitted if remission will result in collecting the highest net revenue over time. Shortfall penalties cannot be remit- ted. Difference between remission, cancellation and reversal Remission: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest is correctly imposed at the time but a decision has been made to relieve the taxpayer of the liability to pay. Cancellation: occurs when the tax, penalty or interest was correctly imposed at the time but a provision of the legislation relieves the taxpayer from the obliga- tion to pay, such as, adhering to an instalment arrangement. Reversal: the tax, penalty or interest should not have been charged in the first place. Reasonable cause A late filing penalty or late payment penalty can be remitted if the Commissioner is satisfied that late filing or late payment was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control. The taxpayer is responsi- ble for filing and paying, so specific action or inaction by a tax agent will not constitute reasonable cause. The legislation gives guidance as to what could be considered to be events or circumstances beyond a taxpayer’s control, as well as events or circumstances which would not fall within that category. The events and circumstances set out in the legislation are not exhaustive, so the Commissioner may consider other matters on a case by case basis. Collecting highest net revenue over time The Commissioner has a discretion to remit late filing penalty, late payment penalty and interest if it is consistent with the duty to collect, over time, the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. The intent is to allow for genuine circumstances if those circumstances are not consistent with reasonable cause. With regards to the late filing and late payment penal- ties, the sort of situation which may be given favourable consideration would be if non-payment is caused by genuine oversight. However, in these situations payment of the underlying tax should have been made as soon as the oversight was recognised. With interest, the sort of situation which may be given favourable consideration would be if non-payment is caused by Inland Revenue error. The provision to remit is discretionary, so prior consid- eration may be given to the taxpayer’s circumstances, liquidity and assets and liabilities. Only in exceptional circumstances will interest be remitted, as it is compensation for the use of crown money. Cancellation of interest When the Commissioner issues a notice of assessment and the amount specified in the notice (assessment plus interest) is paid by the due date, the interest applying from the date of the notice until the due date specified in the notice will be cancelled. Cancellation if instalment arrangement made Late payment penalty can be cancelled if a taxpayer makes a payment arrangement which requires two or more instalments. Sixty percent of the initial late payment penalty may be cancelled if the arrangement is entered into before the due date for payment and all the terms of the arrange- ment are strictly adhered to. This would reduce the initial late payment penalty from 5% to 2% and cancel any incremental late payment penalties. If the arrangement is made after the due date of the tax or after a notice under section 157 of the TAA or section 43 of the GST Act is issued, all incremental late payment penalties imposed after the date of the arrange- ment or notice may be cancelled if the arrangement is adhered to. The penalties will only be cancelled if the taxpayer keeps all terms of the arrangement. This means that if, as part of the arrangement, returns must be filed or current taxes kept up to date, and the taxpayer does not meet these obligations, the Commissioner can enforce payment of penalties incurred after the date of the arrangement. Application dates Late payment penalty remissions considered after 1 April 1997, regardless of the period they apply to, will be considered under the new rules. Any instalment arrangements entered into before 1 April 1997 will come under the current rules, regardless of when the arrangement ends. Part 7 - Amendments to other Acts Other Acts As discussed earlier, the new penalties apply to all the Inland Revenue Acts and the premiums of earners, employers and the self-employed under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act, not just to the Income Tax Act and Goods and Services Tax Act. Broadly speaking, the old penalty provisions in those Acts were repealed and replaced with the new generic penalty provisions in the Tax Administration Act. The exception is the Student Loan Scheme Act and the Child Support Act - in these the new penalty provisions apply only to employer obligations. In addition, some minor changes were made to aspects of various Inland Revenue Acts. These changes are discussed below. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act Stamp duty is now payable six months after a document is executed or received in New Zealand. However, if a document is presented for stamping more than six months after execution because of delay in approval from, say, the Land Tribunal or the Overseas Invest- ment Commission, the new remission provisions will generally apply. Estate and Gift Duties Act Gift duty is now payable six months after the making of a dutiable gift. Approved issuer levy (AIL) The new penalty rules do not explicitly apply to AIL. This is because if the issuer of a security does not comply with the requirements of AIL, the taxpayer automatically defaults back to the non-resident with- holding tax (NRWT) rules. The new penalties apply to any non-compliance with the NRWT requirements. Gaming Duties Act The due date for paying totalisator duty is now the 20th of the month following the last race. Accordingly, if totalisator duty is not paid by this due date, late payment and interest will apply.
