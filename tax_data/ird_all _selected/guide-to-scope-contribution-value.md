Qualified, Definitely in, Fully Committed, No argument, a Quick Win, Required to deliver the programme outcome and/or minimum viable product –no further assessment required. (These are the issues that are an imperative to fix. This is usually because there is related time-pressure (e.g. a legislative change), there isn’t a workaround, or a workaround isn’t a viable alternative: Customer/IR integrity impact: major B: Should Do and/or Could Do- For Consideration: On the list but needs a Value Assessment. Use the framework to assess and rank, is aligned to Business Priorities (e.g. data quality,failure-driven demand, peak season flattening, partner efficiency) is needed to ensure the Technology strategy is delivered but is is currently unqualified – complete definition and use framework to rank. Should Do: Is in IRs best interest to resolve. Customer/IR integrity impact: medium-high. Could Do: Fixing these issues would either result in an improvement, or make things easier either for IR or IR’s customer. Customer/IR integrity impact: low-minimal C: Won’t Do in BT Programme: No further assessment is required. Not in current scope but external influences such as policy, legislation or other may require us to revisit it in the future, it is not clear what the business or customer value is, and we expected there is a lot of analysis required to establish this – no further assessment at present. These issues may impact a small number of customers. Changes that fundamentally impact how START has been designed fall into this category. Customer/IR integrity impact: minimal D: Wont’ DoAt All: No further assessment is required. Definitely out, the business has found a better way or the requirement and/or problem has gone away. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Digital Experience Scoping Definitions - 9 - Some items are a Must-Do (e.g., to get Child Support live) •1 Must-do Some are a Should-do due to alignment to Business Priorities •2d Data Quality •2fFailure-driven Demand •2pPeak Season Flattening •2t Partner Efficiency (e.g., tax agents, payroll providers etc) And/or a Should-do to ensure technology strategy is delivered •2x Technology Enhancement Items in the BT backlog that are bigger than DES and need business/x-stream analysis / design •3 Business-/ Analysis-driven Some items are a Won’t Do (e.g., agreed as such in a prior release, or the external party won't be ready within BT timeframes) •4 Won’t Do •These are mostly Info Shares and Supplier interfaces. •We will use the well-proven approach from previous releases to deliver these. •These are mostly Gateway Services, with a few Info Shares and Supplier interfaces. •They require a value case to be created but we expect this be quite straight-forward. •DES have enough information to be able to drive early analysis/design in conjunction with the BTMs/Product Owners/externals. •It is not clear what the business/customer value is, and we expected there is a lot of analysis required to establish this. •For these items, integration is only a small part of the overall answer. Implementing an interface won’t resolve the underlying problem without other business/process changes. •DES are keen to support the analysis work (including external engagement). •Note that these might end up going into a “BAU backlog” but they will not be delivered under BT.
