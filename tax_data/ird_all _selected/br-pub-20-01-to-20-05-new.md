Investing into a US Limited Liability Company – NZ tax consequences (WITHDRAWN)
===============================================================================

These 5 rulings and the accompanying commentary set out the income tax treatment and availability of foreign tax credits for NZ investors in a US LLC that is taxed on a fiscally transparent basis as a partnership in the US, but as a foreign company in NZ. The Rulings demonstrate the different treatment depending on whether the interest in the US LLC is classified as under the FIF threshold, or as a FIF, or as a CFC. It then explores the impact for different categories of FIF (AFIM/other methods/non-attributing active FIF) and CFC (attributing/non-attributing active). There is also an analysis of the operation of the relevant fiscal transparency and double tax relief provisions (arts 1(6) and 22) in the NZ/US DTA.
