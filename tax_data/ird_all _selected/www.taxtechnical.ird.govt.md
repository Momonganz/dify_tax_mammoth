The Commissioner was the successful party in Goodricke v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2024\] NZHC 3639 and entitled to costs. 

The parties were unable to agree on the quantum to be paid. Mr Goodricke said no costs should be paid to the Commissioner because a Calderbank offer had been made. The Commissioner said the Calderbank principles do not apply and sought costs on a 2B basis. 

The High Court awarded costs on a 2A basis on the basis that the issues on appeal were limited and procedural in nature.
