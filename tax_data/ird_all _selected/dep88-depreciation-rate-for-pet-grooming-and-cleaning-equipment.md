Depreciation rate for pet grooming and cleaning equipment
=========================================================

Determination DEP88 (2014) sets a depreciation rate for pet grooming and cleaning equipment.

#### Note to Determination DEP88

The Commissioner has set general depreciation rates for pet grooming and cleaning equipment by adding a new asset category of "Pet grooming and cleaning equipment". The new asset category applies only to services provided for the grooming and cleaning of domestic animals (including horses).

As the determination shows, the pet grooming and cleaning equipment consists of a number of components that have different useful lives. To date we have identified:

*   Pet washers (portable);
*   Pet dryer units (portable);
*   Pet/animal vacuum clipper units;
*   Pet/animal clippers.

An asset category default rate is also set, to provide for other equipment used for pet grooming and cleaning not listed above.
