You can get the independent earner tax credit (IETC) during the year. This means you'll pay less tax each payday. 

You can also get it after the end of the tax year.

After the end of the tax year we'll send you an income tax assessment. If you did not receive the right amount of independent earner tax credit, you might get a refund or have tax to pay. 

If you earn more than $24,000 from your main job
------------------------------------------------

If you have 1 job and you earn between $24,000 and $70,000, or if you have more than 1 job and you earn more than $24,000 in your main job and your total income is between $24,000 and $70,000:

*   fill in the Tax code declaration - IR330. Choose tax code ME or, if you have a student loan, ME SL for your main job.
*   give the IR330 to your employer before your next payday.  

If you earn less than $24,000 from your main job
------------------------------------------------

If you earn less than $24,000 in your main job but your total income is between $24,000 and $70,000, you have 2 options.

*   Receive your IETC at the end of the year.

*   Apply for a tailored tax code during the tax year.

Tailored tax codes help you pay the right amount of tax if your circumstances mean you often have a large tax bill or refund.

[Apply for a tailored tax code](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-codes-for-individuals/apply-for-a-tailored-tax-code)

2025 tax year
-------------

The income thresholds for IETC changed on 31 July 2024. You may not get the full credit in this tax year if your income was between $48,000 and $70,000 as the threshold only increased part way through the year.

If you start a new job
----------------------

Fill out a Tax code declaration - IR330 every time you start a new job.

If you’re still eligible for the independent earner tax credit, choose tax code ME or ME SL for your main job. Give the IR330 to your employer before your next payday.

If your new salary means you’re no longer eligible, choose tax code M or M SL for your main job.

The independent earner tax credit is worked out on whole months. Starting a new job might mean you get too little or too much independent earner tax credit. You can apply for a tailored tax code to help make sure you get the right amount of independent earner tax credit.

Get the independent earner tax credit at the end of the tax year
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you're entitled to get the independent earner tax credit but did not get it during the year, you'll get it at the end of the year, after your income tax assessment has been processed.
