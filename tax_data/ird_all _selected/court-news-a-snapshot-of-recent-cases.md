Court News: a snapshot of recent cases
======================================

**05 April 2019**

Inland Revenue collects more than $70 billion in revenue each year – money which goes towards our hospitals, schools and society in general.

When taxpayers evade tax and don’t file returns, neglect to pay workers KiwiSaver contributions or do cash jobs they’re stealing from all Kiwis.

We rely on trust and honesty of taxpayers but when people aren’t upfront and try to cheat the system, Inland Revenue regularly prosecutes taxpayers who don’t pay their fair share. Here are sentences handed down in recent months.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Maria Kinloch**

A now bankrupt exercise trainer has been sentenced to just over six months home detention after claiming more than $61,000 in tax refunds that she wasn’t entitled to.

Maria Kinloch was sentenced in the Marton District Court on March 27. As well as home detention Kinloch also has 10 months standard post detention conditions.

Kinloch admitted she had intentionally filed false GST returns to obtain refunds that she knew she was not entitled to. Total refunds obtained $61,465.22.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Ranjit Singh**
