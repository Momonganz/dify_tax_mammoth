24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 1 of 5 5 July 2024 Dear Thank you for your requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 6 June 2024. You requested the following: We would like to know how much P3 income tax was paid by March balance date taxpayers on 7 May 2024, compared to the same time in 2023 and 2022. In the past when we have requested similar information, you have captured tax payments for a period (I think up to 2 weeks) either side of the provisional tax date, recognising that taxpayers make payments before and shortly after the due date. We also recognise that 7 May is P1 for November balance dates, and P2 for July balance dates. If it is possible to exclude those tax payments from the data across the three years, please do so. And: ...published on the Inland Revenue website is the response to 24OIA1094 (attached). Although the information is presented in a different format, the letter and the table at Appendix A both refer to the population group being taxpayers with RIT in excess of $5,000 for the 2022 tax year. However in this case, the number of taxpayers is shown as 400,177. Can you please advise why there is a large difference in the taxpayer count on request 24OIA1094, and 24OIA1707. The below table shows the number of customers, number of transactions, and total value of payments made between the dates of 23 April 2024 to 19 May 2024 for the tax years 2022, 2023, and 2024 for customers who had residual income tax of $5,000 or more for the previous tax year and a standard balance date of 31 March. Tax year # of customers # of transactions Total amount ($) 2022 223,959 238,182 -$3,619,312,236 2023 258,473 288,511 -$3,926,876,390 2024 270,287 329,185 -$2,891,262,754 Grand Total 752,719 855,878 -$10,437,451,382 24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 2 of 5 I have reviewed the data in the responses for 24OIA1094 and 24OIA1707 and determined that there was an error that caused approximately 84,000 provisional taxpayers to be excluded from the data in 24OIA1094 if they were not a provisional taxpayer in the preceding year. The enclosed tables below, labelled Appendix A, restate the figures from 24OIA1707 with this error corrected. This data was extracted from Inland Revenue systems on 30 June 2024. Restated figures relating to the tax pooling and terminal tax due dates tables will be made available on Inland Revenue’s website at Tax statistics (ird.govt.nz) l ater this calendar year. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. Thank you for your request.
