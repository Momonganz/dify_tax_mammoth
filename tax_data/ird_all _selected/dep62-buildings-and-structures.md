Buildings and structures
========================

Determination DEP62 (2007) amends the 'Building and structures' rate following legislation changing the methods for calculating depreciation rates.

This determination results from the depreciation changes in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. This legislation changed the methods for calculating depreciation rates for items of depreciable property. The depreciation rates for certain items that are not buildings, acquired on or after 1 April 2005 are calculated using the double declining balance method (i.e. the diminishing value rate), with a straight-line equivalent. The depreciation rate for buildings, acquired on or after 19 May 2005 is calculated using a straight-line formula, with a diminishing value equivalent.  
  
As a result of these legislative amendments, this determination amends the "Buildings and Structures (not specified)" asset class in the "Buildings and Structures" asset category in Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1. This is because the buildings and structures economic rates are calculated using different provisions and also because not all structures are buildings.  
  
There are two parts to this determination. The first part applies to structures and to buildings acquired before 19 May 2005. It separates out structures from the "Buildings and structures (not specified)" asset class to create two separate classes: the "Buildings (not specified) (acquired before 19 May 2005)" asset class and the "Structures (not specified)" asset class. The second part of the determination inserts a new asset class: the "Buildings (not specified) (acquired on or after 19 May 2005)" asset class.
