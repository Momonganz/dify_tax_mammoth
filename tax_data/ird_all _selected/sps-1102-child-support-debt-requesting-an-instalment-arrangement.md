This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 23, No 2 (March 2011).

### Introduction

1.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue's practice for providing relief when the immediate payment of an overdue child support obligation is not possible. The relief is provided in the form of an instalment arrangement to pay the debt. However, taxpayers who have a tax debt or Student Loan repayment arrears should refer to SPS 11/01 (_Instalment arrangements for payment of tax_) or SPS 11/03 (_Student Loans - Relief from repayment obligations_).  
     
2.  For the purpose of this SPS, the term "instalment arrangement" has been used instead of "payment agreement" which is used in the Child Support Act 1991 ("CSA").  
     
3.  A debt owing by a custodian will be collected by the Commissioner in the same manner as if it was financial support owing by a liable person. Reference to "liable person" may include a custodian for the purpose of this SPS.  
     
4.  Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the CSA.

### Application

5.  This SPS applies to the Commissioner's discretion to provide relief when giving consideration to:
    *   requests for instalment arrangements to settle child support debt; and
    *   write-off of incremental penalty debt when the instalment arrangements are adhered to.

### Summary

6.  The CSA provides limited discretion where a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt in full and on time. The Commissioner may:
    *   agree to an instalment arrangement to pay child support debt; and
    *   write-off incremental penalties when instalment arrangements are adhered to.  
         
7.  As a result, the Commissioner will look at the circumstances of a case and may agree to an instalment arrangement to pay child support debt.

### Legislation

8.  The relevant legislative provisions of the CSA:

##### 135G Discretionary relief for residual incremental penalty debt

|     |     |

| (a) | the liable person has paid all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties to which the incremental penalties relate; and |     |
| (b) | the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of the incremental penalties- |     |
| (i) | would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resources; or |
| (ii) | would place the liable person in serious hardship. |

##### 135H Relief from initial late payment penalty if payment arrangement

|     |     |

| (1) | The Commissioner must write off an initial late payment penalty in relation to a financial support debt if the Commissioner is satisfied that- |     |     |     |
| (a) | the initial late payment penalty relates to the first payment of financial support payable by the liable person; and |     |     |
| (b) | within the 3-month period beginning on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment under which the first payment is payable, either- |     |     |
| (i) | the liable person enters into a payment agreement with the Commissioner to pay, in 2 or more instalments,- |     |
| (A) | the first payment; and |
| (B) | other payments of financial support that are or will become payable by the liable person; or |
| (ii) | the Commissioner gives a person a deduction notice under section 154 in relation to the liable person for the purpose of collecting, in 2 or more deductions and payments,- |     |

| (B) | other payments of financial support that are or will become payable by the liable person; and |
| (c) | either,- |     |     |
| (i) | in the case of paragraph (b)(i), every one of those instalments is paid in full in accordance with that payment agreement; or |     |
| (ii) | in the case of paragraph (b)(ii), every one of those deductions and payments is made in accordance with that notice. |     |
| (2) | If an initial late payment penalty is written off under this section, and that penalty has been paid in whole or in part, the Commissioner must refund to the liable person the whole or part of the initial late payment penalty that has been paid. |     |     |     |
| (3) | For the purposes of this section, **first payment** means the first amount of financial support that is required to be paid by a liable person under an assessment made by the Commissioner under section 24(1)(a). |     |     |     |

##### 135J Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into

### Discussion

9.  A liable person should contact Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they think they are likely to be unable to pay their child support obligations on time and in full so that options for payment, which may include an instalment arrangement, can be discussed. The Commissioner will consider a request for an instalment arrangement on a case-by-case basis.  
     
10.  Early contact may also minimise penalties where an instalment arrangement can be entered into.  
     
11.  Applications may be made by telephone, in writing or by electronic means.

#### Available options for relief

12.  The Commissioner may, when satisfied that immediate payment of child support debt is not possible, grant relief to a liable person through the following options:
    *   agree to an instalment arrangement;
    *   write-off incremental penalties - provided that the instalment arrangement is adhered to.

#### When will relief be provided?

13.  Requests for instalment arrangements will largely rely on the liable person being able to show that they are not able to make immediate payment of their child support debt.  
     
14.  The Commissioner will consider all options available for payment and will look to maximise recovery of child support debt (that is, payment of the debt in the shortest possible time) while ensuring the liable person maintains their current child support obligations.

#### Instalment arrangements

15.  An instalment arrangement may consist of one or more payments to settle a child support debt. It may also include any current year child support obligation payable during the term of the instalment arrangement. This is to ensure that the liable person meets their current child support obligations.  
     
16.  When an instalment arrangement includes current year child support obligations, it must provide for the minimum annual rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the outstanding debt.  
     
17.  Consequently, an instalment arrangement must be for more than the minimum annual amount of child support payable.

#### Information to support application

18.  A decision will be made based on the circumstances of each individual case, with the aim of recovering the child support debt in the shortest possible period. The Commissioner will also consider whether the liable person can reasonably afford to repay their child support debt at the rate detailed in their instalment arrangement application.  
     
19.  Information to support a request for an instalment arrangement may be provided by the liable person with their application. Alternatively they may be asked to complete a _Child Support - repayment of arrears (IR130)_ form. The information provided will assist the Commissioner when considering the application, including whether other options are available to the liable person to settle their child support debt. The IR130 form is available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides.

#### Default with instalments may not undo an instalment arrangement

20.  It is acknowledged that a liable person's circumstances can change for reasons outside their control. For example, an unforeseen household expense or default by debtors can erode their cash flow and their ability to maintain an instalment arrangement.  
     
21.  In these circumstances the liable person should contact Inland Revenue promptly to discuss an adjustment to their instalment arrangement. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the liable person is unable to continue to meet their instalment obligation other options to recover the debt will be considered.  
     
22.  If a liable person does not comply with the terms of an instalment arrangement, the Commissioner may cancel the instalment arrangement and pursue other remedies to collect the debt. However, before doing so, the reasons for the default will be considered and the Commissioner will take into account the liable person's overall compliance behaviour including:
    *   regularity of payments.
    *   current financial circumstances.
    *   the circumstances under which the payments were missed.

#### Write-off of penalty

23.  If child support obligations are not paid in full and on time, an initial 10% late payment penalty will be charged on the unpaid amount and a further 2% incremental penalty will be added each month the debt remains unpaid.  
     
24.  When a liable person enters into an instalment arrangement to clear their child support debt (which may include current child support payment obligations), the Commissioner will write-off appropriate incremental penalties when the liable person has completed the agreed payments.  
     
25.  Instalment arrangements are reviewed every 26 weeks (from the date of commencement) to confirm that the liable person has made the agreed payments. Where that instalment arrangement has been complied with, a proportion of the incremental penalties relative to the overall debt (under the instalment arrangement) paid during that period will be written-off.  
     
26.  Where an instalment arrangement has not been complied with and the Commissioner is satisfied that the default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the liable person the failure to meet their obligations may be disregarded and the incremental penalties may still be remitted.  
     
27.  If the liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations and does not contact Inland Revenue to discuss options it is likely that the instalment arrangement will be cancelled. Should an instalment arrangement be cancelled, incremental penalties will accrue on any unpaid child support debt.  
     
28.  After the instalment arrangement has been completed, so that all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties have been paid, some incremental penalties may still remain. Further relief may be granted in respect of those further penalties. For that further relief to be granted, the Commissioner must be satisfied that:
    *   payment of the remaining incremental penalties would cause serious hardship to the liable person; or
    *   recovery of the penalties would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner's resource when considering the circumstances of each individual case.

### Standard Practice

29.  A liable person should contact the Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they are not going to be able to pay their child support obligations on time and in full. This is to discuss options for payment which may include an instalment arrangement.  
     
30.  Although it is best to contact Inland Revenue before a person gets behind with child support payments, it is never too late to make contact to discuss the options available to resolve child support debt and minimise exposure to related penalties.  
     
31.  Requests for an instalment arrangement may be made in writing, by telephone, or any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. For example, the IR website on-line service.  
     
32.  Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. A liable person will need to be able to show why they will not able to make immediate payments towards their child support obligation. They may be asked to supply further information about their financial circumstances in support of their application.  
     
33.  When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is not able to make immediate payment an instalment arrangement may be agreed to.  
     
34.  Instalment arrangements that include current year child support obligations must include the minimum annual rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the child support debt. Consequently, any instalment arrangement must be for more than the minimum annual amount of child support payable.  
     
35.  An instalment arrangement will be structured so that the child support debt will be paid in the shortest possible time.  
     
36.  When the Commissioner agrees to an instalment arrangement, the terms will be confirmed in writing. That confirmation will set out both the liable person's and the Commissioner's obligations under the instalment arrangement. Confirmation may be made by electronic means if that was the method used by the liable person when making their request.  
     
37.  Liable persons who enter into an instalment arrangement must inform the Commissioner as soon as practicable if there is a change in their circumstances that may impact on an earlier decision to provide financial relief, or their ability to repay their child support debt.  
     
38.  The Commissioner will review instalment arrangements every 26 weeks (from the date of commencement) to confirm that the liable person has made the agreed payments. So long as the agreement has been complied with, incremental penalties relative to the debt paid during that period will be written-off.  
     
39.  Default on payment of an instalment may not undo the overall instalment arrangement. When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt under an instalment arrangement, the terms of the instalment arrangement may be varied following discussion with the liable person.  
     
40.  However, when an instalment arrangement is cancelled because a liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations, the Commissioner will consider whether other options may be available to collect the child support debt. Penalties will accrue on any unpaid amount.
