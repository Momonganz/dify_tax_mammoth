Depreciation Rate for portable fencing (galvanised steel)
=========================================================

General Determination DEP93 (Jul 2015) sets general depreciation rates for 'Portable fencing (galvanised steel)'.

#### Note to Determination DEP93

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue sets general depreciation rates for "Portable fencing (galvanised steel)". New asset classes are added into the “Contractors, builders and quarrying” industry category and “Hire equipment” asset category, as set out below.

Portable fencing that is available for short-term hire (one month or less) will also fall within the asset class of "Contractors, building and quarrying equipment for hire with a general DV rate based on an estimated useful life of 8 years" in the "Hire equipment (short-term hire of one month or less only)" asset category.

Portable fencing is short-term, easily movable fencing consisting of lightweight panels, weighted feet and clamps. It is easy to store, transport, erect and remove.

Portable fencing generally has an estimated useful life of 8 years. However, portable fencing that is hired out to be used by others has an estimated useful life of 5 years.
