If you're an overseas investor, you can either be a

*   notified foreign investor
*   non-resident investor.

Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income is taxed differently depending on your situation.

Notified foreign investors
--------------------------

If you're a non-resident who holds an investment in a foreign investment PIE, you can notify the PIE you want to be a notified foreign investor (NFI).

To be an NFI, you cannot be:

*   resident in New Zealand
*   a controlled foreign company
*   a non-resident trustee of a New Zealand trust
*   a foreign investment fund with a New Zealand resident who has an income interest of 10% or more.

You'll need to provide your full name, date of birth, home country address and your IRD number equivalent.

Prescribed investor rates (PIRs) for non-residents
--------------------------------------------------

If you're an NFI in a foreign investment variable-rate PIE, you must use the [prescribed investor rate (PIR)](/api/glossary/item?id={512D9328-39AB-4FC1-8E40-B4782AD917E5})
 applicable to the income types and sources.

If you're an NFI in a foreign investment zero-rate PIE, you must use the 0% PIR. 

If you tell your [multi-rate PIE (MRP)](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
 that you've either become a notified foreign investor or stopped being one during a year, the PIE income or loss may be included in your income tax assessment for the year. There are a number of potential scenarios the PIE needs to consider. Refer to our ‘Portfolio investment entity guide – IR860’ under the heading 'Investor changes residence'.

If you're a non-resident (individual or entity) and are not a notified foreign investor, then your PIR is 28%. You cannot choose a lower rate.

Multi-rate PIE income and your tax return
-----------------------------------------

Income from an MRP must be included in your tax return if you:

*   used a PIR that's too low
*   have been taxed at 0% (zero-rated) because you exited an MRP during a quarter, except for NFIs of a foreign investment PIE
*   have been incorrectly treated as an NFI.

Dividends or distributions from an MRP are excluded income. This means they’re not included in your end-of-year tax return or assessment.

If you exit an MRP that files quarterly, any remaining interest may be paid to us instead. We'll be paid the interest within a month after the end of the quarter that you exited in. You'll be entitled to a tax credit for this amount in your annual income tax return or assessment.
