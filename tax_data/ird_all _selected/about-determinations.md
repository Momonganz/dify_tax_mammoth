About determinations
====================

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may (or in some cases must) issue determinations about various tax issues such as accrual expenditure, depreciation, financial arrangements, foreign currency, livestock valuations, standard costs for boarding service providers, and childcare providers.

As part of legislation enacted on 21 February 2017, the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017, a new method for calculating provisional tax was introduced – the accounting income method (AIM).

[Common Reporting Standard (CRS)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,CRS])

[Depreciation](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation])

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxpayers must depreciate all depreciable property, other than excluded depreciable property by applying the economic depreciation rate (also known as the general rate) applicable to that item of depreciable property. These rates are set out in Determination DEP1, which was issued in 1993. Since DEP1 was issued, we have issued further general determinations amending DEP1 which set new asset classes and depreciation rates. Find more information including the depreciation rate finder and depreciation claim calculator under [Claiming depreciation](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/claiming-depreciation)
 on the Inland Revenue website.

### [Economic depreciation rates](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation,General])

These rates are determined by the Commissioner and are also known as **general rates**. They are arrived at by calculating the estimated useful life of an item of depreciable property and expressing that as a percentage of its cost.  

### **[Provisional depreciation rates](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/publications#sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25&f:@irscttpublicationtypes=[Determinations,Depreciation,Provisional])
**

Taxpayers may apply to the Commissioner to have a provisional depreciation rate set for an item of depreciable property that has not had an economic rate set for it. Often these will be items that are new to the New Zealand tax base. Once set, the depreciation rate is available to be used by all taxpayers who may acquire that item of property.

### Special depreciation rates

If a general economic or a provisional depreciation rate is not suitable for your asset, you may apply  for your own special depreciation rate – see application form [IR260B](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir200---ir299/ir260b/ir260b-2019.pdf)
. Special depreciation rate determinations are not published.
