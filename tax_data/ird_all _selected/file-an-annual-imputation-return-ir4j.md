What happens next
-----------------

We’ll use your return to update your running balance for your imputation credit account.

It will be updated with the latest return’s income tax payments, transfers in, income tax disbursements and transfers out.  
  
The running balance determines which income tax disbursement limitation rules will apply. 

If you file an imputation return with a credit or nil closing balance we will not post a transaction to your account.  
  
Any imputation liabilities will be managed through your company’s income tax account.
