The Government will consider all feedback and make decisions about future information-sharing. Further information, when available, will be published on Inland Revenue's tax policy website. Home Kia ora, welcome! The Government want to hear your views about a proposal for government agencies to share information that may help tackle serious crime. Currently, Inland Revenue is allowed to provide resources and expertise to certain enforcement agencies to help detect and prevent organised crime. However, taxpayer secrecy rules prevent Inland Revenue from sharing the information it holds with other enforcement agencies. Sharing information between Inland Revenue and other enforcement agencies might be an advantage in dealing with serious crime. All agencies would still need to ensure safeguards are in place to protect people’s privacy. We believe the right kind of information-sharing will improve cross-agency collaboration and contribute to the Government’s goals of reducing crime and reoffending.

The Government will consider all feedback and make decisions about future information-sharing. Further information, when available, will be published on Inland Revenue's tax policy website. Overview Inland Revenue currently provides resources and expertise to certain enforcement agencies to help prevent and detect organised crime. However, taxpayer secrecy rules prevent Inland Revenue from sharing information with other enforcement agencies. One of the aims of the Government’s Better Public Services reforms is to ensure the public sector works better together across agencies to support New Zealanders, and is much more efficient. Last year, the Prime Minister set 10 challenging results for departments to work together to achieve over the next three to five years. Two of these are about reducing crime rates and reducing reoffending. Making better use of information gathered, and sharing information between government agencies, while still protecting people’s privacy, is an important contributor to cross- agency co-operation and the Government’s goals of reducing crime. The Government proposes that Inland Revenue may share information with other enforcement agencies where it might be an advantage in dealing with serious crime. Strict processes would be required to protect taxpayers’ privacy. While Inland Revenue does not often come across serious crimes in its day-to-day business, it may sometimes Join the discussion Latest Comments Beware of frauds people! It Beware of frauds people!

Expanding the information Inland Revenue shares with other government agencies raises several issues. Confidentiality is an important aspect of how comfortable taxpayers feel about providing information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue also needs to focus on its core tax role. The Government is therefore considering information-sharing only if there are clear benefits to society. Under this proposal that means limiting information- sharing to situations that support law enforcement tackling cases of serious crime, such as: when the offence is committed by an individual and is punishable by imprisonment of four years or more; or if a similarly serious offence is committed by a body corporate which would be punishable by imprisonment of four years or more if it had been committed by an individual when there are reasonable grounds for the agency identifying the possible offence to suspect that a serious offence has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed when there are reasonable grounds for Inland Revenue to suspect the information it has is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence of, a serious offence that has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed when Inland Revenue is satisfied that: –the information is readily available within Inland Revenue –it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information –it is in the public interest to communicate the information.

Investors therefore may not have a true idea of the risk level of their investment in the company. Under the current rules, Inland Revenue cannot share this information.

Under the current rules, Inland Revenue cannot share this information.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim. There needs to be a suitable framework or specialist (i.e. trained) area in Inland Revenue to identify the fraud risk. Also, the hit rate should be reviewed by another agency / external auditor.

It Beware of frauds people! It does not only target wealthy individuals but home owners as well. Even elders are victims of scams. Follow the money. Why would you need safeguards? The victims and their families can't be Sign in Register Glossary | Targeting Serious Crime https://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz/glossary\[24/10/2013 10:48:50\] This term refers to sharing the information one government department or agency holds, with other government departments and/or agencies. Cross-government information- sharing might occur between only two government departments, a group of related departments, or between all of them. Information This term describes the material and data that a government department or agency holds about a citizen or taxpayer. This information might be supplied by the citizen or taxpayer or collected or generated by the government department or agency during the course of its duties. This term can also describe the material a government department or agency holds about the operational aspects of its business. Integrity of the tax system The integrity of the tax system is a concept that describes the key qualities of how the tax system operates and is perceived to operate. The integrity of the tax system is described in Section 6 of The Tax Administration Act 1994 as being the equal responsibility of all taxpayers and all government staff and its representatives. Further, Section 6 advises the integrity of the tax system includes: taxpayers’ perceptions of the system’s integrity; taxpayers’ compliance with the tax system; taxpayers’ rights to confidentiality and fairness; and the responsibility of those administering the law to ensure confidentiality and fairness. Non-compliance Term used to describe the actions of a specific taxpayer or business. Non-compliance is when taxpayers do not fulfil their obligations to file returns and pay tax, or wrongly claim refunds or entitlements. Non-compliance can be deliberate – for instance, failing to pay tax - or accidental, for example, filing a GST return late so the response can differ. The term can also be used to describe the proportion of such activities within a given population. For example, New Zealanders have low levels of non-compliance. Serious crime This term refers to the types of crime for which offenders can be punished by four or more years in prison. These types of crimes range from the bribery and corruption of officials, to forging cheques and other documents, to money laundering, to importing and distributing drugs, to interpersonal violence and murder. Tax secrecy This term refers to the way Inland Revenue treats the information it holds. Information that Inland Revenue holds is currently treated as ‘tax secret’ under Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Although there are specific exceptions, this means Inland Revenue does not share the information it holds with any other government department, agency, or other organisations. Taxpayer hurt by publicity - we're talking animals, reptiles and insects here, not humans. Aren't the banks a main source of alerts of suspicion?

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim.

Allowing IRD to share taxpayer information with other agencies is likely to have a long term detrimental effect on society's interests as it will erode public confidence in the integrity of the tax system and cause those businesses already acting illegally to not pay tax, which I believe some currently do.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim. There needs to be a suitable framework or specialist (i.e. trained) area in Inland Revenue to identify the fraud risk. Also, the hit rate should be reviewed by another agency / external auditor.
