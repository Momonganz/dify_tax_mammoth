It will appear in the April 2015 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 27, Number 3). Notice pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA (the Agreement) New Zealand has, pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement, received notification from the United States Government that it has granted more favourable terms to a Partner Jurisdiction. Article 7 provides that more favourable terms apply automatically to the Agreement unless a decision is made to decline them. New Zealand has not declined the application of the terms. The following paragraphs are therefore to be treated as being included in Section VI of Annex I of the Agreement beginning on 3 July 2014. With reference to paragraph G, no written notice was provided to the United States before 3 July 2014. G. Alternative Procedures for New Accounts Opened Prior to Entry Into Force of this Agreement. 1. Applicability. If New Zealand has provided a written notice to the United States prior to entry into force of this Agreement that, as of July 1, 2014, New Zealand lacked the legal authority to require Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions either: (i) to require Account Holders of New Individual Accounts to provide the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I, or (ii) to perform all the due diligence procedures related to New Entity Accounts specified in section V of this Annex I, then Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions may apply the alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section, as applicable, to such New Accounts, in lieu of the procedures otherwise required under this Annex I. The alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section shall be available only for those New Individual Accounts or New Entity Accounts, as applicable, opened prior to the earlier of: (i) the date New Zealand has the ability to compel Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to comply with the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, which date New Zealand shall inform the United States of in writing by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or (ii) the date of entry into force of this Agreement. If the alternative procedures for New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, described in paragraph H of this section are applied with respect to all New Entity Accounts or a clearly identified group of such accounts, the alternative procedures described in this paragraph G may not be applied with respect to such New Entity Accounts. For all other New Accounts, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must apply the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, to determine if the account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. 2. Alternative Procedures. a) Within one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to a New Individual Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, request the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification consistent with the procedures described in section III of this Annex I, and (ii) with respect to a New Entity Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I and request information as necessary to document the account, including any self-certification, required by section V of this Annex I. b) New Zealand must report on any New Account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported with respect to such a New Account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the New Account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. c) By the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must close any New Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section for which it was unable to collect the required self-certification or other documentation pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section. In addition, by the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Individual Accounts (without regard to whether such accounts were High Value Accounts), perform the due diligence procedures specified in paragraph D of section II of this Annex I, or (ii) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Entity Accounts, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section IV of this Annex I. d) New Zealand must report on any closed account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(c) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported for such a closed account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. H. Alternative Procedures for New Entity Accounts Opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015. For New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to treat such accounts as Preexisting Entity Accounts and apply the due diligence procedures related to Preexisting Entity Accounts specified in section IV of this Annex I in lieu of the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I. In this case, the due diligence procedures of section IV of this Annex I must be applied without regard to the account balance or value threshold specified in paragraph A of section IV of this Annex I.      PAGE \\\* MERGEFORMAT 1 <EVWXYtu���������  0 2 3 � /0��^�������һ����҈҈|�l�҈\\M�M�MhRt@hRt@CJOJQJaJhRt@hRt@5�CJOJQJaJhRt@hRt@6�CJOJQJaJh�\]'CJOJQJaJhRt@CJOJQJaJ#jh�R 0JCJOJQJUaJ hrz�h�('0JCJOJQJaJh�R jh�R Uh�('h�\]'CJOJQJaJh�('CJOJQJaJh�\]'h�('5�OJQJh�('h�('5�OJQJh�('5�OJQJWXY1 2 3 � � � � kl\_\`a����������@A���������������������������gdRt@gd�� &dP��gd�\]'^\_\`ae�����������Ʊ���mXC1"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ(hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(hRt@h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��h��CJOJQJaJh�g�h��5�CJOJQJaJ"h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJhRt@5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh�('hRt@CJOJQJaJh�('CJOJQJaJh�('h�('CJOJQJaJ��\] h � � ������Ze����������\[hiv���� ?A�� +�����������������������z�����k��������������hRt@6�CJOJQJ\]�aJhRt@h��5�CJOJQJaJ(hRt@h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��hRt@CJOJQJaJh��h��CJOJQJaJh�('6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ\*A���!�"�"�"�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%&&&&�������������������������$a$gd�(' d��gd�('gd�('gd����� �!�!|"�"�"�"�"�"�" #�#�#$$�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%���������x�������plplplplhlhlhlhtKh�R jh�R U(h��h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��CJOJQJaJh�('6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��h��CJOJQJaJ"�%�%&&&&&&&&&&&���̳ݯ�����h��h��CJOJQJaJhtKh�R 0jh�('h5~DCJOJQJUaJmHnHu!h=m�CJOJQJaJmHnHuh�('h5~DCJOJQJaJ%jh�('h5~DCJOJQJUaJ&&&&&����gd�('21�h:p�\]'��. ��A!��"��#�n$�n%�������j���������666666666vvvvvvvvv666666>666666666666666666666666666�6666666666�666666666666hH66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666�62���� 0@P\`p������2(�� 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p��8X�V~ OJPJQJ\_HmH nH sH tH J\`��JNormald��CJ\_HaJmH sH tH DA ���D Default Paragraph FontRi���R 0Table Normal�4� l4�a�(k ���( 0No List^�o���^��Default7$8$H$)B\*CJOJQJ\_HaJmH phsH tH R�@R $0Balloon Textd��CJOJQJ^JaJN�o��N$0Balloon Text CharCJOJQJ^JaJ6U\`��!6�('0 Hyperlink>\*B\*ph�>@2>�('0Headerd����B#.��A.�('0Header Char> @R>�('0Footerd����B#.��a.�('0Footer CharPK!����\[Content\_Types\].xml���N�0E�H���-J��@%�ǎǢ|�ș$�ز�U��L�TB� l,�3��;�r��Ø��J��B+$�G\]��7O٭V��$���������!)O�^�r�C$�y@�����/�yH\*��񄴽)�޵��߻��UDb�\`}"�qۋ�Jח���X^�)I\`n�E���p)���li�V\[\]�1M<������O�P��6r�=���z�gb�Ig��u��S�eb���O������R�D۫����qu �g��Z����o~ٺlAp�lx�pT0���+\[}\`j�����zA��V�2�F���i�@�q�v�֬5\\|��ʜ̭N��le�X�ds���jcs����7����f���� ��W���+�Ն�7����\`���g�Ș��J���j|��h(�K��D-���� dX��iJ�؇(��x$(��:��;�˹!�I\_�T��S1�������?E��?������?ZBΪm���U/������?�~����xY����'���y5�g&΋/����ɋ�>���G�M�Ge���D�����3Vq%'#q�����$�8��K�����)f�w9:ĵ�� x}r�x����w���r�:\\TZaG�\*�y8I�j�bR��c|XŻ�ǿ�I u3KG�nD1�NIB�s��� ��R��u���K>V�.EL+M2�#'�f��i~�V��vl�{u8��z��H� �\*���:�(W�☕ ~��J��T�e\\O\*�tHG��HY��}KN��P�\*ݾ˦���TѼ�9/#��A7�qZ��$\*c?���qU��n��w�N��%��O��i�4=3��N���)cbJ u�V�4����(Tn��� 7��\_?���m-ٛ�{U����B�w��z���n���ʜ"Z��x��J�Z��p;�������{/�<�P;��,)''K�Q�k5���q���pN��8�K�Gb�e��� �S��d�̛�\\17 �p�a�>��SR!��� 3��K4'+�r�zQ TT��I����Ivt\]K�c⫲�K#�v�5+�|��D������~��O@%\\w���\_�nN\[�L��9K����q��g�V�h��n R!�y+��U�n�;�\*&�/H�r��T�� �>��>\\ �t��=.Tġ ���S; Z�~�!������P��9gi���C�ڧ!�# B��,��;�X=ۻ,I�2UW�V�9$l�k���=A��j���;�{�A�P79�|s\*Y�����;�̠�\[�MC�ۿ�hf��\]o��{oY=1k�yV��V����5E8�Vk+֜���\\8���0X4D)�!!��?\*|f�v� u����"�x��A�@T\_������q��6�4)kڬu�V�7��t�'��%;���i�9s�9�x���,��ڎ-45x�d���8?�ǘ�d�/Y|t��&LIL�J\`�& �-G�t�/��PK!
