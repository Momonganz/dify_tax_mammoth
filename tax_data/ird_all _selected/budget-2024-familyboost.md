Budget 2024: FamilyBoost
========================

FamilyBoost is a new childcare payment available to low-to-middle income families with children aged 5 and under, to help with the costs of early childhood education. Inland revenue will closely monitor and report on the ongoing results of Family Boost.

Parents and caregivers can get back up to 25% of their fees, or a maximum of $975 every 3-months. This maximum payment slowly reduces for families with incomes over $140,000 per annum. Families with incomes over $180,000 per annum are not eligible.

Data is collected throughout the quarter and will be updated a minimum of two months post the end of each quarter. Information will also be included in our annual reports for 2024-25 onwards.
