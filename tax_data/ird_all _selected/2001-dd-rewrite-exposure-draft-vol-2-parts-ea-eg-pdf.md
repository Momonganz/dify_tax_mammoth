Adjustment to income (2) When the closing value of trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements in total for an income year is more than the opening value, the income of a person is adjusted by an amount equal to the total of the amounts calculated separately for trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements using the formula— closing value – opening value. Adjustment to deduction (3) When the opening value of trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements in total for an income year is more than the closing value, the deduction that a person is allowed is adjusted by an amount equal to the total of the amounts calculated separately for trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements using the formula— opening value – closing value.

Comment:This provision adds all the valuations of various forms of stock, including excepted financial arrangements, from subparts EC, ED, and EE. The resulting net change in value is treated as either income or a deduction depending on whether the aggregate closing value exceeds the aggregate opening value, or vice versa. EB 2 Other revenue account property When this section applies (1) This section applies to revenue account property that is not— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EC (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)): (b) livestock valued under subpart ED (Valuation of livestock): (c) an excepted financial arrangement valued under subpart EE (Valuation of excepted financial arrangements): (d) a financial arrangement valued under subpart EH (Financial arrangements rules): Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments 417 (e)a specified lease or a lease to which section EK 17 (Payment by lessee under personal property and operating leases) applies: (f)a film or a right in a film: (g)property that arises as a result of petroleum development expenditure or petroleum exploration expenditure. Allocation (2) A deduction for the cost of revenue account property of a person is allocated to the later of— (a) the income year in which the person disposes of the property; and (b) the income year or years in which the person derives income from disposing of the property. Allocation to more than one year (3)If subsection (2)(b) applies and the person’s income from disposing of the property is derived in 2 or more income years, the proportion of the deduction that the income derived in that year represents as a proportion of the total income from the disposal is allocated to each income year. Reasonable estimate of income (4)If, when making an allocation under subsection (2), a person cannot identify the total income from the disposal of the property, they must allocate an amount that they reasonably expect to derive from the disposal. Origin:(1) EF 2(2). (2) EF 2(1). (3) EF 2(3). (4) EF 2(4). Defined terms:amount, deduction, derived, excepted financial arrangement, film, financial arrangement, income, income year, lease, person, petroleum development expenditure, petroleum exploration expenditure, revenue account property, right in a film, specified lease, trading stock. Comment:Livestock and excepted financial arrangements have been added to the items included in subsection (1) as they have been separated from trading stock. Accordingly, current section EF 2 (1A), relating to excepted financial arrangements, has not been replicated. To clarify the relationship between the current sections EF 1 and EF 2, draft section EB 2 (which is the equivalent of current section EF 2) will take precedence, and draft section EB 3 (the equivalent of current section EF 1) will apply only to goods that are not revenue account property. The draft section makes it explicit that draft section EB 2 does not cover operating leases as they have their own timing rule (current section EO 2A). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 418 EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments It may be necessary to provide that section EB 2 does not apply (and instead section EB 3 applies) to consumable aids. Further work is being undertaken on the definition of ‘revenue account property’. There is currently an element of circularity with the definition of ‘depreciable property’. There may be a need to define ‘revenue account property’ by reference to specific categories of property. EB 3 Prepayments and certain deferred payments When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a) a person has been allowed a deduction for expenditure under this Act or under the Income Tax Act 1976; and (b) the expenditure was not incurred on the items listed in subsection (2), which are each already subject to different deduction timing rules; and (c)part or all of the expenditure is unexpired under the rules in subsections (4) to (9) at the end of the person’s income year. Expenditure not subject to this section (2)This section does not apply to expenditure on— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EC (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)): (b) livestock valued under subpart ED (Valuation of livestock): (c) an excepted financial arrangement valued under subpart EE (Valuation of excepted financial arrangements): (d) a financial arrangement valued under subpart EH (Financial arrangements rules): (e)a specified lease or a lease to which section EK 17 (Payment by lessee under personal property and operating leases) applies: (f)a film or a right in a film: (g) property that arises as a result of petroleum development expenditure or petroleum exploration expenditure. (h)revenue account property to which section EB 2 applies. Adjustment for unexpired portion (3)The unexpired portion of a person’s expenditure at the end of an income year is income of the person in the income year under section CG 11 (Prepayments for services and some goods and deferred payments) and is allowed as a deduction in the following income year under section DB 38 (Adjustment for prepayments and deferred payments). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments 419 Unexpired portion: expenditure on goods (4)An amount of expenditure on goods is unexpired at the end of an income year if the person has not used up the goods by the end of the income year in deriving income. Unexpired portion: expenditure on services (5)An amount of expenditure on services is unexpired at the end of an income year if the services have not been performed by the end of the income year. But the special rule in subsection (7) for expenditure on employment income overrides this subsection. Unexpired portion: expenditure on chose in action (6)An amount of expenditure on a chose in action is unexpired at the end of an income year if the amount relates to a period of enforceability of the chose in action falling after the income year. Unexpired portion: expenditure on employment income (7)An amount of expenditure on employment income under section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment) is unexpired at the end of an income year, even though the services have been performed during the income year, if the amount is still unpaid 63 days after the end of the income year. Extension of payment period: shareholder-employee income (8)In the case of employment income paid to a shareholder-employee, the 63-day payment period for a payment in subsection (7) is extended until the last date by which the person could file a return of income for the income year if the maximum extension of time were allowed under section 37 (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Allowances reimbursing employees: related to anticipated timing (9)In the case of expenditure subject to section CW 13 (Reimbursement of employees and expenditure for their benefit) and section CW 14 (Allowance for additional transport costs), this section applies on the basis that the relevant services were performed in the year in which the employee’s expenditure is expected to occur. Commissioner’s discretionary relief (10)The Commissioner may allow a person not to comply with the rules in this section under section 91AJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 422 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) Origin:EE 1. Defined terms:business, person, trading stock. Comment:Consistently with the current law, a person has to be using the trading stock in their business to be covered by these provisions. Likewise, the link with a purpose of sale or exchange has been retained. The usual tests would apply to establish whether a business was being undertaken. The phrase ‘owns or carries on a business’ has been retained. The words ‘carries on’ were added in 1951 to cover a situation in which a business was on-sold after hours (see S Trustees v Commissioner of Taxes (NZ) (1950) 5 AITR 31 at 43). This instance is not directly relevant in the case of ongoing ownership of a business as envisaged by the trading stock valuation provisions, but can be relevant when a business is being sold. EC 2 ‘Trading stock’ defined Property held in business (1) Trading stock means property that a person who owns or carries on a business holds for the purpose of selling or exchanging in the ordinary course of the business. What is included in ‘trading stock’ (2) Trading stock includes— (a) partly completed work that would, if completed, be trading stock under subsection (1): (b) property that the person holds for use in producing trading stock: (c) property on which the person has incurred expenditure, when the property would, if they held it, be trading stock under subsection (1) or paragraph (a) or paragraph (b): (d)property leased under a hire purchase agreement when the property— (i) is treated as having been acquired by the lessor under section FC 10 (2) (Taxation of hire purchase agreements); and (ii)is an asset of a business that the lessor carries on. What is excluded from ‘trading stock’ (3)Trading stock does not include— (a) land: (b) depreciable property: (c) a financial arrangement: (d) an excepted financial arrangement: (e) livestock not used in dealing operations: (f) a consumable item to be used in the process of producing trading stock: (g)a spare part not held for sale or exchange. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) 423 Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. (2) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. (3) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. Defined terms:business, depreciable property, excepted financial arrangement, financial arrangement, hire purchase agreement, land, lessor, person, trading stock. Comment:The components of the current definition of ‘trading stock’ have been incorporated into the body of draft subsections (1) and (2). The current definition of ‘trading stock’ builds upon the common law notion of trading stock, which in turn draws upon commercial use. As such, the definition is not exhaustive. This inclusive approach to defining trading stock has not been changed in the rewrite process. The equivalent term in Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (FRS 4) is ‘inventories’. But there are differences between ‘inventories’ and ‘trading stock’. Notably, consumable aids (items such as fuel oil that are used in the production process but do not form part of the finished product) are inventories but are excluded from the definition of ‘trading stock’. Instead, consumable aids are dealt with under the accrual expenditure provisions (current section EF 1, draft section EB 3). Similarly, spare parts held for maintaining plant are either dealt with under the accrual expenditure provisions or are depreciated. The other key difference is the inclusion of services in FRS 4. As noted in the general commentary, livestock, including bloodstock, used in a business and excepted financial arrangements have been removed from the definition of ‘trading stock’ but remain revenue account property. This change has no practical effect as livestock on hand at year end will continue to be valued annually (see separate subparts for livestock and excepted financial arrangements). Depreciable property has been explicitly included in the list of exclusions from trading stock to save the reader having to trace through other definitions. Depreciable property cannot be trading stock under the definition of ‘depreciable property’. The exclusion of excepted financial arrangements implicitly subsumes the intent of current section DK 3E, which excludes excepted financial arrangements held by life insurers from being trading stock. As a result, current section DK 3E is no longer needed. EC 3 Valuation of trading stock Taking into account closing values (1)A person who carries on a business must determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year by a method that is available under this subpart for them to use. The value of that closing stock is the closing value to be taken into account in section EB 1 (Stock and excepted financial arrangements). Opening value (2)The opening value of trading stock is the value of the person’s closing stock at the end of the previous income year. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 424 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) Origin:(1) EE 2(1), (3), (4). (2) EE 2(2), (4). Defined terms:business, closing stock, closing value, income year, opening value, person, trading stock. Comment:The draft section makes explicit that these rules are applied at the end of the income year. This is not a change in the law. The other instance when the rules are relevant is when part-year accounts have to be prepared (for part-year loss purposes), in which case section IF 1 (4) requires the rules to be applied as if it were an income year. EC 4 Summary of valuation methods Standard valuation (1) The standard valuation methods for trading stock are— (a) cost, determined using generally accepted accounting principles: (b) discounted selling price, if used for financial reporting purposes: (c) replacement price, if used for financial reporting purposes: (d)market selling value, if this value is lower than cost. Valuation by low-turnover trader (2)A person who is a low-turnover trader may choose to value closing stock using a standard valuation method or a low-turnover valuation method (see section EC 12). Transfers of trading stock within wholly-owned group (3)Special rules apply when trading stock is transferred between companies in a wholly-owned group of companies (see section EC 21). Origin:(1) EE 3(1). (2) EE 3(2). (3) new. Defined terms:closing stock, company, cost, generally accepted accounting principles, low-turnover trader, person, trading stock, wholly-owned group of companies. Comment:The draft brings together the provisions scattered through current subpart EE dealing with small taxpayers. The term ‘small taxpayer’ is replaced by ‘low-turnover trader’, defined in draft section EC 12. A low-turnover trader has the option of applying the rules specific to low- turnover traders or the general rules, regardless of whether financial statements have been prepared. However, should a low-turnover trader decide to comply with generally accepted accounting principles, they must comply with the consistency and disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No 1. Other low-turnover traders are subject to different consistency requirements (see draft section EC 20). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) 425 Standard valuation EC 5 Cost of trading stock Valuation at cost (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at cost. If the person chooses this method, they must include and allocate costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the valuation must be substantially correct. Materially correct valuation (2) In subsection (1), if the value of closing stock is substantially different from the value obtained by applying the reporting standard to that closing stock, then the person has not complied with generally accepted accounting principles. The standard is Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, or an equivalent standard issued in its place. Allocation of costs for manufactured or produced stock (3)This subsection applies to a person (other than a low-turnover trader) who determines the value of closing stock at cost, using a budgeted method or a standard cost method of cost allocation in a business of manufacturing or producing trading stock. If any difference arises between the estimated costs of production that are included in the financial statements of the business for the income year and the actual costs of production, the person must apportion this variance between the cost of trading stock sold during the income year and the closing stock. Origin:(1) EE 5(1). (2) EE 5(2). (3) EE 5(3). Defined terms:business, closing stock, cost, financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, income year, low-turnover trader, person, trading stock. EC 6 Identifying trading stock When items of trading stock are not separately identifiable, a person must use a cost-flow method to identify those items of trading stock that are included in closing stock, and the cost of those items. A person may also use a cost-flow method to calculate the cost of trading stock that can be separately identified. Origin:EE 5(5), (6). Defined terms:closing stock, cost, person, trading stock. Comment:The use of ‘separately’ and ‘specifically’ has been standardised by using ‘separately’. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 426 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) EC 7 Cost-flow methods of assigning costs Cost-flow methods (1)The cost-flow methods of assigning costs are— (a) the first-in first-out (FIFO) method: (b)the weighted average cost method. Consistent use (2)When calculating the value of closing stock at cost, a person must adopt the same cost-flow method of assigning costs as they use in their financial statements for that income year. Origin:(1) EE 6(1). (2) EE 6(2). Defined terms:closing stock, cost, financial statements, income year, person. EC 8 Discounted selling price Valuation by discounted selling price (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its discounted selling price. But they may use this valuation method only if they use discounted selling price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing discounted selling price for retailers (2)If the person is a retailer, the discounted selling price for each department or category of goods is the sum of retail selling prices of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the department or category of goods. For a modification of this valuation method for retailers whose turnover is less than $1,000,000, see section EC 17. Establishing discounted selling price for others (3)If the person is not a retailer, the discounted selling price for each category of goods is the total market selling value of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the category of goods. ‘Normal gross profit margin’ defined (4)In this section, normal gross profit margin means the proportion of the selling price that is the normal gross profit margin of the relevant goods. The person must calculate the normal gross profit margin for each income year for each department or category of goods. In calculating the total cost of the goods, they must comply with generally accepted accounting principles, and must include all costs as required under Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1983, or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

EC 9 Replacement price Valuation by replacement price (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its replacement price. But they may use this valuation method only if they use replacement price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing replacement price (2)The replacement price is the market price of acquiring the equivalent trading stock on the last day of the income year. If there is no such market price, the replacement price is the last price that the person paid during the income year in acquiring equivalent trading stock. Origin:(1) EE 11(1). (2) EE 11(2), (3).

EC 10 Market selling value Valuation by market selling value (1) A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its market selling value. But they may use this valuation method only if the market selling value is less than the cost of the trading stock. Establishing market selling value (2) The market selling value of trading stock is found by taking the amount that the person would normally expect to receive in the ordinary course of business at the end of an income year from the sale of the trading stock, and subtracting the following costs: (a) the usual costs of completing production of the trading stock; and (b)the expected costs of selling the trading stock. Expected costs of selling the trading stock (3) In subsection (2)(b), the expected costs of selling the trading stock are the costs that the person usually incurs for the following: (a) transportation: (b) insurance: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 428 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) (c) sales commissions: (d)discounts to buyers. If the person prepares financial statements, the costs must have been taken into account in the statements in calculating net realisable value. Substantiating market selling value (4)If the person uses market selling value to value closing stock, they must be able to substantiate that value. If they cannot substantiate that value, to value their closing stock they must use— (a) cost (see section EC 5 or section EC 13); or (b) discounted selling price (see section EC 8 or section EC 17); or (c)replacement price (see section EC 9 or section EC 18).

EC 17 Discounted selling price for low-turnover traders Valuation by discounted selling price (1) A low-turnover trader who does not prepare financial statements may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its discounted selling price. A low-turnover trader who prepares financial statements may use this method only if they use discounted selling price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing discounted selling price for retailers (2)If the low-turnover trader is a retailer, the discounted selling price for each department or category of goods is the total of the retail selling prices of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the department or category of goods. For retailers whose turnover is less than $1,000,000, see subsection (5). Establishing discounted selling price for others (3)If the low-turnover trader is not a retailer, the discounted selling price for each category of goods is the total market selling value of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the category of goods. ‘Normal gross profit margin’ defined (4) In subsections (2) and (3), normal gross profit margin means the proportion of the selling price that is the normal gross profit margin for the relevant goods calculated under Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) or an equivalent standard issued in its place. The low-turnover trader must calculate the normal gross profit margin for each income year for each department or category of goods. They must include all costs required under sections EC 5 and EC 6 or sections EC 13 and EC 14, as applicable. Turnover of $1,000,000 or less (5)Despite subsection (2), a low-turnover trader who is a retailer whose turnover is not more than $1,000,000 may determine the discounted selling price of all closing stock valued under this method in an income year by discounting the total of the retail selling prices of the stock by Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 432 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) the average gross profit margin for all trading stock valued under this method in that income year.

A low-turnover trader who prepares financial statements may use this valuation method only if they use replacement price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing replacement price (2)The replacement price is the market price of acquiring the equivalent trading stock on the last day of the income year.

EC 20 Valuing closing stock consistently Valuation under generally accepted accounting principles (1) In calculating the value of closing stock at cost, or by discounted selling price or replacement price, a low-turnover trader who determines the value of closing stock under generally accepted accounting principles must comply with the consistency and disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No 1 (Disclosure of Accounting Policies) approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1983, or an equivalent standard issued in its place. Matters requiring consistency from year to year (2)When subsection (1) does not apply, a low-turnover trader must be consistent from one income year to the next in— (a) their choice of valuation method: (b) the extent to which they include indirect costs in the cost of stock that they manufacture or produce: (c) their use of a cost-flow method of assigning costs under section EC 7: (d)their method of calculating discounted selling price: (e)their use of market selling value if it is greater than cost. When changes allowed (3)Despite the requirement for consistency in subsection (2), a low- turnover trader may make changes in relation to the matters described in subsection (2) if— (a) the change is justified by sound commercial reasons (the advancement, deferral, or reduction of an income tax liability is not a sound commercial reason): (b)the change is required by another provision in this subpart.

Group company transfers EC 21 Transfers of trading stock within wholly-owned groups When this section applies (1) This section applies in an income year to trading stock held by companies that are members of the same wholly-owned group of companies when all the following paragraphs apply: (a) one group company (group company A) originally acquires and holds the trading stock; and (b) from the time it is acquired to the end of the income year, the trading stock is held within the group by a company or companies that are resident in New Zealand; and (c) through transfers within the group, another group company (group company B) holds the trading stock at the end of the income year; and (d) group company A and group company B remain members of the group at the end of the income year; and (e)either— (i) the income years of group company A and group company B end on the same date; or (ii)if they end on different dates, the Commissioner has approved both dates as corresponding to the end of a business cycle and as necessary to avoid material distortion of net income that would occur if the income years ended on the same date. Choice of treatment (2) When subsection (1) applies, group company B may choose to value the closing stock at the value of the trading stock to group company A. When company stops being member of group (3)Despite subsection (2), if group company B stops being a member of the wholly-owned group, the company is treated as disposing of and reacquiring the trading stock at its market value at the time the company stops being a member of the group. If the market value of the trading stock cannot be determined separately from other property, the value of the trading stock is taken to be its market value at the time group company B acquired it.

Comment:This adjustment does not apply if company B chooses to value at market value from the initial transfer. The Commissioner’s approval of different income years has been retained because the requirement is for anti-avoidance reasons. Its retention is consistent with self-assessment. The inclusion in current section EE 15 (2) of a liquidation of the company as a means of the company ceasing to be a member of the group has not been replicated as it was there merely to remove any doubt. Definitions EC 22 Definitions for this subpart In this subpart,— generally accepted accounting principles means the accounting practice that is generally accepted for inventories, as it applies to trading stock turnover — (a)means the total income that a business derives in an income year from the sale or exchange of trading stock; and (b)does not include the value of closing stock. Origin:EE 20(1), (2); OB 1 ‘generally accepted accounting principles’, ‘turnover’. Defined terms:business, closing stock, derived, generally accepted accounting principles, income, income year, trading stock. Comment:The definition of ‘turnover’ has been amended to make it clear that it relates only to the sale of trading stock, so that foreign exchange or depreciation gains or losses are not generally taken into account.

For this purpose, livestock is divided into four groups: listed livestock, other livestock, high-priced livestock, and bloodstock. Dealing operations excluded (2) This subpart applies only to livestock held for use in a business, but not to livestock used in dealing operations. For the valuation of livestock used in dealing operations, see sections EC 1 to EC 4.

Defined terms:bloodstock, business, high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, other livestock. Comment:The provision refers to livestock having to be used in a business to qualify. This is not a change as the test is implicit in the current legislation through the general trading stock rules referring to ‘a taxpayer who carries on or owns a business’. ED 2 General rule for the valuation of livestock A person must determine the value of their livestock at the end of an income year by a method that is available for them to use. The value determined is the livestock’s closing value to be taken into account in section EB 1 (Stock and excepted financial arrangements). Origin:EL 1(1). Defined terms:closing value, income year, livestock, person. ED 3 Summary of valuation methods Listed livestock (1)Listed livestock are sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, deer, goats, and pigs, and any other livestock types listed in schedule 8, column 1. High- priced animals of these livestock types have separate valuation rules (see subsection (3)). Four methods are available to determine the value of listed livestock. The methods are described in sections ED 9 to ED 26. Other livestock (2)Other livestock are livestock other than listed livestock, high-priced livestock, and bloodstock. The methods available to determine the value of other livestock are standard value, cost price, replacement price, or market value, as described in sections ED 28 to ED 30. High-priced livestock (3)High-priced livestock are animals that are listed livestock, that are bought at a premium price, and that are capable (or are expected to be capable) of being used for breeding. The value of high-priced livestock is determined under sections ED 31 to ED 35. Bloodstock (4)Bloodstock is any horse that is a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse, and a reference to bloodstock includes a property interest in a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse. The value of bloodstock is determined under sections ED 36 to ED 43. Movement between valuation methods (5)Restrictions apply to movements between valuation methods for listed livestock (see section ED 25).

Defined terms:bloodstock, cost price, high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, market value, other livestock, price, replacement price, standard value, type. Comment:This section is a summary of the subpart and the subsections are not intended to be definitions of the categories. Two terms have been renamed: ‘specified livestock’ becomes ‘listed livestock’ and ‘non-specified livestock’ becomes ‘other livestock’. Otherwise, terms are the same as in current subpart EL. The reference to current section EE 2 has been deleted as livestock has been separated from the definition of ‘trading stock’. Both livestock and trading stock remain revenue account property and both subparts set out valuation methods that feed into the valuation adjustment rule that is in current section EE 2. ED 4 Interests in livestock Joint election of valuation method (1) When listed livestock is owned jointly by 2 or more persons, those owners must choose a valuation method. For it to be effective, the election must be made jointly by all the owners. When election ineffective (2) If there is not an effective election, listed livestock owned jointly is valued as follows: (a) if the owners bail or lease the livestock to another person during the income year, at market value: (b) if the owners enter into a profit-sharing arrangement for the livestock, at market value: (c)in any other case, under the national standard cost scheme. Partnerships and other interests (3)For the purposes of an election under this section, a person’s interest in a partnership that owns livestock is treated separately from any other interest that the person has in livestock. Separate elections are required for the person’s partnership interest and for their other livestock interests. But the person is not required to choose the same valuation method in both cases. Origin:(1) EL 2(6). (2) EL 2(6). (3) EL 2(6). Defined terms:income year, lease, listed livestock, livestock, market value, national standard cost scheme, person, profit-sharing arrangement. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 440 ED – Valuation of livestock Comment:Draft subsection (3) has been added to clarify that a person’s partnership interest is to be treated separately from other interests for election purposes. The intention has always been that, despite the standard rule that an election applies to all of a person’s livestock, the person could make a separate election for the partnership interest from their individual interests. Therefore, a farmer who owns their own farm and is also a partner in another farming venture does not have to apply the same valuation method chosen for the partnership to livestock on their own farm. Current section EL 2 (6)(c) has not been replicated as it is inconsistent with self-assessment. ED 5 Changes in partnership interests Related interests (1) A new partnership that owns listed livestock is subject to a rule about related interests that applies in the income year in which the change in partnership interests occurs. When the rule applies (2) The rule applies when, at the end of the income year, more than 50% of the property of the new partnership is owned by persons who, during that income year or in the previous income year, owned all the property of another partnership that— (a) was formed before the new partnership; and (b)derived income in either income year from listed livestock of the same type as that owned by the new partnership. Valuation in the income year of change (3) When the rule applies, the value of listed livestock owned by the new partnership must be taken into account in the way the other partnership determines the value of livestock of the particular type at the end of the income year of change. If the other partnership has no listed livestock of the type on hand at the end of that income year, the value is taken into account as that partnership would have determined it, had it owned listed livestock of that type.

ED 6 Value of livestock on death of person Market value (1)On the death of a person who was deriving income from livestock, the value of livestock on hand at the date of death is its market value at that time. This section overrides both the person’s chosen valuation method and the general provisions of section ED 2. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 441 Death of partner (2) On the death of a partner in a partnership that is deriving income from livestock, the partner’s share of the livestock of the partnership is its market value at the date of death. Livestock in herd scheme (3)If a person who is deriving income from herd livestock dies before 1 February in an income year, and their return of income to the date of death is filed before the national average market values for the income year are set, the value of the livestock is its herd value for the previous income year. If the person has elected to use a herd value factor, the value of the livestock is its herd value multiplied by the factor applying in the previous income year. Origin:(1) EL 1(3). (2) EL 1(4).

Comment:Current section EL 5 (6) has been divided into two, with the relevant provisions relating to the disposal of livestock as a result of a person’s ceasing business now being located in draft section ED 15. ED 7 Transfers of livestock within wholly-owned groups When this section applies (1)This section applies in an income year to livestock held by companies that are members of the same wholly-owned group of companies when all the following paragraphs apply: (a)one group company (group company A) originally acquires and holds the livestock; and (b)from the time it is acquired to the end of the income year, the livestock is held within the group by a company or companies that are resident in New Zealand; and (c)through transfers within the group, another group company (group company B) holds the livestock at the end of the income year; and (d)group company A and group company B remain members of the group at the end of the income year; and (e)either— (i)the income years of group company A and group company B end on the same date; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 442 ED – Valuation of livestock (ii)if they end on different dates, the Commissioner has approved both dates as corresponding to the end of a business cycle and as necessary to avoid material distortion of net income that would occur if the income years ended on the same date. Choice of treatment (2)When subsection (1) applies, group company B may choose to value the closing stock at the value of the livestock to group company A. When company stops being member of group (3)Despite subsection (2), if group company B stops being a member of the wholly-owned group, the company is treated as disposing of and reacquiring the livestock at its market value at the time the company stops being a member of the group. If the market value of the livestock cannot be determined separately from other property, the value of the livestock is taken to be its market value at the time group company B acquired it.

Listed livestock are sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, deer, goats, and pigs, and any other livestock of the types listed in schedule 8, column 1 but not high-priced livestock. Origin:EL 1(1)(d). Defined terms:high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, type. ED 9 Valuation methods for listed livestock Election (1)Four methods are available for valuing listed livestock. A person must choose 1 method, making their election by using the method chosen in their return of income for an income year. The methods are: (a) the herd scheme described in sections ED 10 to ED 16: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 443 (b) the national standard cost scheme described in sections ED 17 to ED 19: (c) one of the cost price, market value, or replacement price options described in section ED 20: (d)as applicable, one of the bailment options described in sections ED 21 to ED 24. When the election applies (2)When a person chooses a valuation method, that method continues to apply in following income years unless they choose another method that is available to them. Commissioner’s determination (3)If a person chooses a valuation method that is not available to them and they later make no valid election, the Commissioner must determine the method to be used. In doing so, the Commissioner must consult with the person. Restrictions (4) Restrictions apply to the use of valuation methods and the making of elections (see section ED 25). Origin:(1) EL 2(1).

Comment:Current section EL 2 (3) and (4) have been relocated to a general section on election notice requirements (see draft section ED 26). Herd scheme ED 10 Herd scheme Election to use herd scheme (1) A person may choose to value listed livestock of any type and class under the herd scheme. But, subject to the two restrictions described in subsections (3) and (4), a person who has chosen to value livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme may nevertheless value any or all livestock of that type by another method. The alternative valuation options are national standard cost, cost price, market value, and replacement price. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 444 ED – Valuation of livestock Election to leave herd scheme (2)A person who wishes to stop valuing livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme must give 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner in the way described in section ED 26. However, notice is not required if the person values livestock of that type by another method (being one that is available for use in conjunction with the herd scheme). Restriction: reduced numbers in herd scheme (3)The first restriction on the use of an alternative valuation option occurs when livestock of a particular class are valued under the herd scheme. The numbers of livestock in that class must not be reduced below the number valued in that class under the herd scheme at the end of the previous income year. Restriction: male breeding stock (4)The second restriction on the use of an alternative valuation option occurs when livestock of a particular type are valued both under the herd scheme and under a cost option (being the national standard cost scheme or cost price). All male breeding stock of that type must be valued under the herd scheme in that income year. Former elections (5)A notice of election under former section 85A (3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (as in force before its repeal by section 21 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1993) to value livestock previously valued under the herd scheme is treated as notice of election under this section to cease to value livestock of that type under the herd scheme.

Comment:See the comment on draft section ED 21. ED 11 Valuation under herd scheme Closing value of herd livestock (1)The value of herd livestock to be taken into account at the end of an income year is either its herd value based on the national average Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 445 market values set for each class for that year or, if a herd value factor is adopted, its herd value multiplied by its herd value factor. Opening value of herd livestock (2)Despite section ED 2, the opening value of herd livestock in an income year is taken into account when a person— (a) has livestock on hand at the start of an income year; and (b) has valued the livestock under the herd scheme in the previous income year; and (c)has not chosen for that income year to value the livestock by a different method. Value taken into account (3)The value of herd livestock to be taken into account at the start of the income year is either its herd value for the income year or, if the person has adopted a herd value factor, its herd value for that income year multiplied by its herd value factor for the previous income year.

ED 12 Herd value factor Adoption of herd value factor (1) A herd value factor is available for a person to use in calculating the value of listed livestock in the herd scheme. A person may adopt a herd value factor for herd livestock of a particular type by giving notice in the way described in section ED 26. A person may also adopt a recalculated factor by giving notice in the same way. Chatham Islands livestock (2) Herd value factors calculated under subsection (5) do not apply to livestock on the Chatham Islands. For the Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value factor, see section ED 14. When the herd value factor applies (3) When a person adopts a herd value factor for livestock of a particular type, the factor applies in the income year specified in the notice and in later income years until— (a) the income year in which it is superseded by a recalculation of the factor; or (b) the income year in which the person stops valuing livestock of that type under the herd scheme; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 446 ED – Valuation of livestock (c)the income year following 2 consecutive income years in which the person has not valued livestock of that type under the herd scheme. Assessment of average value (4)For the purpose of calculating a herd value factor, a person must obtain from a recognised livestock valuer an assessment of the value of an average animal of that person in each applicable class of livestock. The value is determined as at the 30 April that is closest to the day on which the national average market values are set. Calculation of herd value factor (5) The herd value factor for livestock of a particular type is calculated using the formula— Σ\[average value x number\] Σ\[herd value x number\]. The result of the calculation is rounded to the nearest of the following figures: 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. Definition of items in formula (6) In the formula,— (a) Σ ΣΣ Σ is the total of the individual calculations for all applicable classes of livestock type valued under the herd scheme: (b) average value is the average value of an animal in a class (see subsection (4)): (c) number is the number of all livestock of that class on hand at the end of the income year (including livestock that are not in the herd scheme, but not including high-priced livestock): (d) herd value is the herd value of livestock for a class.

Under the national standard cost scheme, livestock are grouped by category. The categories are listed in schedule 9. Restriction: bailed or leased livestock (2) The first restriction occurs when a person has bailed or leased listed livestock to another person under a long-term bailment. The national standard cost scheme is not available to the person to value the livestock in that income year. But this restriction does not apply if the person makes the livestock available under a profit-sharing arrangement. For the treatment of livestock under a bailment, lease, or other arrangement, see sections ED 21 to ED 24.

The scheme is not available to a person to value the livestock. Restriction: cost price (4)The third restriction occurs when a person values any listed livestock in an income year at cost price. The option to value livestock under the national standard cost scheme is not available for that income year.

ED 19 Methods for determining costs using national standard cost scheme Determination of methods for calculation of cost (1) The Commissioner must determine the methods for calculating the cost of livestock listed in schedule 9, column 2. The costs determined in this way apply to the calculation of the value of listed livestock under section ED 17. Average cost (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the determination must establish a process for finding an average cost to be applied to all listed livestock valued under the national standard cost scheme. The process must take into account— (a) the number of homebred livestock that a person has on hand at the end of the year, applying to that number the relevant national standard costs determined under section ED 18: (b)in addition to paragraph (a), the number in each category of livestock listed in schedule 9, column 2 that a person has on hand at the end of the year, applying to that number the relevant national standard costs determined under section ED 18: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 451 (c)the number of bought livestock that a person has on hand, applying to that number the purchase costs associated with that livestock.

Restriction: bailed or leased livestock (2) The first restriction on the use of the cost price option occurs when a person has bailed or leased their listed livestock to another person. The first person must not value that livestock in an income year at cost price unless— (a) the livestock is bailed or leased under a short-term bailment (see section ED 22); or (b)the livestock is bailed or leased under a profit-sharing arrangement (see section ED 23). Restriction: national standard cost scheme (3)The second restriction on the use of the cost price option occurs when a person values any listed livestock in an income year under the national standard cost scheme. The option to value livestock at cost price is not available for that income year. Changing to the cost price option (4)If a person chooses in an income year to change to the cost price option from another valuation method, the opening value of the affected livestock is the closing value of that livestock at the end of the previous income year determined under the method used in that previous year.

Defined terms:closing value, cost price, cost price option, income year, lease, listed livestock, market value, national standard cost scheme, opening value, person, profit-sharing arrangement, replacement price, short-term bailment. Comment:No attempt has been made to define what is meant by ‘cost price’, ‘market value’, or ‘replacement price’ beyond the definitions that exist in section OB 1. These terms have been left to general practice and case law. Outside the legislation some guidance on costs is provided in relation to one cost option (the self-assessed cost option). The replacement price option has been retained, given that it was retained for trading stock when the trading stock provisions were reviewed in 1999. Listed livestock under bailment, lease, or other arrangements ED 21 Bailee’s treatment of livestock When this section applies (1)This section applies when a bailment, lease, or agreement to use listed livestock or high-priced livestock exists, and the terms require a person who has the use of the livestock either to return the livestock to the person who made it available, or to pay full compensation for the livestock. Closing value of livestock: formula (2)A person who has the use of livestock under a bailment, lease, or agreement described in subsection (1) must take into account at the end of an income year the total amount for all classes calculated using the formula— total livestock – bailed livestock. Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a) total livestock is all the livestock that the person has on hand in each class at the end of the income year, including the livestock that the person owns, and the livestock that the person has the use of under the bailment, lease, or agreement: (b) bailed livestock is all the livestock in a class that a person has been given the use of under a bailment, lease, or agreement that remains in force at the end of the income year.

Comment:For those using the herd scheme, bailment deficiencies are valued under the herd scheme when the deficiency takes the number of stock in a class below the number valued in the herd scheme in the previous year (see draft section ED 10 (3)). ED 22 Bailor’s treatment of livestock When this section applies (1)This section applies to a bailment, lease, or agreement to use listed livestock or high-priced livestock, when a person who owns livestock makes the livestock available to another person. Restriction on use of national standard cost scheme (2)The national standard cost scheme is not available to the person who makes listed livestock available for use under a long-term bailment. But this restriction does not apply to profit-sharing arrangements (see section ED 23). Restriction on use of cost price option (3)The cost price option is available to the person only when they make listed livestock available for use under a short-term bailment or a profit- sharing arrangement. If the short-term bailment is made between associated persons, the consideration paid by the person to the bailee or lessee must be the market value. Origin:(1) new. (2) EL 7(4). (3) EL 7(4).

Comment:The definitions ‘long-term bailment’ and ‘short-term bailment’ have been developed from current section EL 7 (2) and (3). The current reference in relation to agreements between associated persons being at ‘fair market value’ has been replaced with ‘market value’ on the basis that market values are implicitly fair as they involve willing parties acting at arm’s length.

Single venture (2)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, if the method used to calculate the value of listed livestock in an income year is either the national standard cost scheme or the cost price option, then the venture is treated as one venture, and all the following are treated as the single owner of the livestock: (a) the person who owns the livestock; and (b) the person who has the use of the livestock; and (c)any other person who has made livestock of the same type available to the person referred to in paragraph (b) under a profit-sharing arrangement. Profit-sharing arrangement: national standard cost scheme (3)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, the national standard cost scheme is not available to a person to value the livestock if the person who has the use of the livestock has valued livestock of the same type at cost price. This restriction also applies when another person has made livestock of that type available to the person under a profit-sharing arrangement and values them at cost price. Profit-sharing arrangement: cost price option (4)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, the cost price option is not available to a person to value the livestock if the person who has the use of the livestock has valued livestock of the same type under the national standard cost scheme.

General provisions for listed livestock ED 25 Restrictions and limitations on the use of valuation methods Restrictions and limitations (1)This section sets out the circumstances in which certain valuation methods are either not available to a person for the purpose of valuing listed livestock, or are limited in their application. National standard cost (2)The national standard cost scheme is not available to a person to value listed livestock if— (a) in an income year they value other listed livestock at cost price: (b) in the income year before the year in which the election is to apply, they have valued listed livestock at cost price and have not given at least 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner of their election to value listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme: (c) they have made the livestock available for use under a long- term bailment: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 456 ED – Valuation of livestock (d)they have the use of livestock under a profit-sharing arrangement and, in an income year, they (or another person who has made livestock available to that person under a profit- sharing arrangement) have valued livestock of that type at cost price. Cost price (3)The cost price option is not available to a person to value listed livestock if— (a) in an income year they value other listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme: (b) in the income year before the year in which the election is to apply, they have valued listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme and have not given 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner of their election to value listed livestock at cost price: (c) they have made the livestock available for use under a long- term bailment, but this rule does not apply to a short-term bailment: (d)they have the use of livestock under a profit-sharing arrangement and, in an income year, they (or another person who has made livestock available to that person under a profit- sharing arrangement) have valued livestock of that type under the national standard cost scheme. Reduced numbers under herd scheme (4)A person who values livestock of a particular class under the herd scheme must not use an alternative valuation option for that class if doing so would reduce the number of livestock in that class below the number valued in that class in the herd scheme at the end of the previous income year. Male breeding stock (5)A person who values livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme must value all male breeding stock of that type under the herd scheme if in an income year they also value any livestock of that type under the national standard cost scheme or at cost price. Bailed or leased livestock (6)A person must value listed livestock that is bailed or leased in accordance with sections ED 21 to ED 24.

ED 26 Notices of election Forms of notice (1)This section specifies the 2 forms of notice that a person must give to the Commissioner, and when each must be used. When a person notifies the Commissioner of an election under this section, the election is irrevocable in the first year in which it applies. When notice in same year required (2)For the elections described in this subsection, a person must give notice by the date of filing their return of income for the income year in which the election is first to apply. Notice in the same year is required for an election— (a) to value livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme, as described in section ED 10: (b)to adopt a herd value factor or the Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value factor for livestock of any type when the income year is the first income year in which the particular livestock is valued under the herd scheme, as described in sections ED 12 to ED 14.

ED 29 Enhanced production When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person who derives income from other livestock enhances production in an income year. Enhanced production occurs when the person— (a) starts (or restarts) to derive income from other livestock; or (b)brings land into production (or substantially increased production) for the purpose of deriving income from other livestock, or acquires additional land for that purpose. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 460 ED – Valuation of livestock Adjustment (2) If a person enhances their production and as a result, in an income year or over the following 3 income years, buys more other livestock that is valued at its standard value, the value of the additional livestock is— (a) for the income year in which the livestock was bought, its standard value plus two-thirds of the difference between the cost price of the livestock and that standard value: (b) for the following income year, its standard value plus one-third of the difference between the cost price of the livestock and that standard value: (c)for other years, its standard value.

Valuation of high-priced livestock ED 31 High-priced livestock When sections ED 31 to ED 35 apply (1) Sections ED 31 to ED 35 apply to listed livestock that a person buys at a price above the minimum set out in subsection (2) when, at the time it is bought, the livestock is capable of being used for breeding, or is expected to be so when it reaches maturity. But section ED 32 does not apply to livestock that, under sections ED 33 and ED 34, have ceased to be treated as high-priced livestock. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 461 Minimum price (2) For the purposes of this section, the purchase price must be at least— (a) $500; and (b)five times the national average market value for the applicable class either in the income year of purchase or in the previous income year, whichever is greater. For the valuation of high-priced livestock that is transferred under a matrimonial agreement, see section FF 11 (High-priced livestock). Valuation method (3)To value high-priced livestock, a person may choose to use either the straight-line method or the diminishing value method. If a person chooses to use the diminishing value method, they must give notice to the Commissioner that they are using the method at the time of filing their return of income for the first income year in which the value of the high-priced livestock is calculated under section ED 32. A person cannot then revoke the election to use the diminishing value method for the livestock. Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘high-priced livestock’. (2) OB 1 ‘high-priced livestock’. (3) EL 10(6). Defined terms:class, Commissioner, diminishing value method, high-priced livestock, income year, listed livestock, matrimonial agreement, national average market value, notice, person, price, return of income, straight-line method. Comment:Draft subsection (1) incorporates the contents of the definition of ‘high- priced livestock’ save for one modification. The reference to pre-1992-93 livestock has been deleted as current section EL 10 (7) has been removed on the basis that it is no longer relevant. That subsection set out the methods for valuing livestock that was classified as high-priced livestock before 1992-93. Our expectation is that none of that livestock will still be on hand by the time the rewritten legislation comes into effect. ED 32 Closing value of high-priced livestock Value in year of purchase and later years (1)The closing value of high-priced livestock at the end of the income year in which it is bought is its cost price minus the reduction applying in that year. In a later income year, the value is its opening value minus the reduction applying in that year until the value reaches or falls below the national average market value of the relevant class. Straight-line method (2)Unless a person has chosen to use the diminishing value method, the reduction is calculated using the formula— cost price x depreciation percentage. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 462 ED – Valuation of livestock Diminishing value method (3)When a person has chosen to use the diminishing value method, the reduction is calculated as follows: (a) in the first income year in which the election applies, the cost price multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation percentage for that year: (b)in later income years, the opening value of the livestock multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation percentage for that year. Immature livestock excluded (4)When high-priced livestock is less than 1 year old at the end of the income year in which it is bought, its closing value at the end of that income year is its cost price. Recently bought livestock excluded (5)If high-priced livestock is bought within 6 months of the end of an income year, and during that time is not used for insemination or collection of semen (in the case of male livestock), or does not give birth and does not have ova removed, the closing value of the livestock is its cost price. ‘Diminishing value equivalent’ defined (6)For the purposes of this section, diminishing value equivalent means the amount set out in schedule 11, column 1, that is the diminishing value depreciation rate to which the amount set out in schedule 11, column 2 is equal to the depreciation percentage expressed as the straight-line equivalent. If no such amount is equal to the depreciation percentage, the amount closest rounded down to that percentage is taken. Origin:(1) EL 10(1). (2) OB 1 ‘specified writedown’.

Valuation in later years (2)In later income years, the animal that was high-priced livestock is treated as the person’s listed livestock, and is valued according to the valuation method chosen for that listed livestock. Entry into herd scheme in later years (3)If, in a later income year, the person values the animal under the herd scheme and, in the income year before that income year, has valued any listed livestock of the same type under the herd scheme, the animal is treated as if it were valued under the herd scheme at the end of that previous income year.

In such cases, each person with an interest in the bloodstock is still an owner of the bloodstock. Removing livestock from the definition of ‘trading stock’ also automatically takes bloodstock out of the same definition. Nevertheless, both bloodstock and livestock more generally remain revenue account property. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 465 ED 37 Closing value of bloodstock Valuation of bloodstock (1) This section specifies the methods that a bloodstock owner must use to determine the closing value of bloodstock. First income year in breeding business (2) This subsection applies to bloodstock that is 2 years of age or older at the end of the first income year in which a bloodstock owner— (a) uses the bloodstock for breeding purposes in their stud business; or (b) buys the bloodstock, intending to use it for breeding purposes in their stud business; or (c)owns the bloodstock in their stud business, intending to use it for breeding purposes. The closing value of the bloodstock at the end of the first income year is its cost price minus the reduction applying in that year. To determine the reduction that applies, see section ED 38. Later income years in breeding business (3) In the income years that follow the year specified in subsection (2), the closing value of bloodstock used for breeding purposes is the opening value of the bloodstock minus the reduction applying in that year. If a bloodstock owner has not taken a closing value of the bloodstock into account in the previous income year, the closing value is the cost price of the bloodstock minus the reduction applying in the income year in which they make the calculation. To determine the reduction that applies, see sections ED 38 and ED 39. Other bloodstock (4)If subsections (2) and (3) do not apply, the closing value of the bloodstock is its cost price. But, in cases where section ED 40 applies, the closing value of the bloodstock is its market value. Residual value of bloodstock (5)When, if this subsection did not exist, the closing value of bloodstock would be less than $1, the value to be taken into account is $1. Origin:(1) new. (2) EM 1(1)(a). (3) EM 1(1)(b). (4) EM 1(1)(c). (5) EM 1(3). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, business, closing value, cost price, income year, market value, opening value. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 466 ED – Valuation of livestock ED 38 Reduction: bloodstock not previously used for breeding When this section applies (1)This section applies when bloodstock— (a) has not been used for breeding purposes in New Zealand before 16 December 1991; and (b) before it was acquired by the bloodstock owner, has not been used for breeding purposes in New Zealand by any other person, unless— (i) the other person transferred the bloodstock under a matrimonial agreement to which section FF 12 (Bloodstock) applies; or (ii) the other person and the bloodstock owner were companies in the same wholly-owned group at the time the bloodstock owner acquired the bloodstock from the other person. Stallion (2)The reduction applying to the valuation of a stallion is 25% of the cost price of the bloodstock unless the bloodstock owner chooses to value the stallion by the diminishing value method. Stallion valued by diminishing value method (3)When a bloodstock owner chooses to value the stallion by the diminishing value method, the reduction applying to the valuation of the stallion is 37.5% of its cost price in the first income year, and 37.5% of its opening value in each later income year. The bloodstock owner must give notice to the Commissioner of their election in their return of income for the first income year. Broodmare (4)The reduction applying to the value of a broodmare is calculated using the formula— 1.25 x cost price of the broodmare \[15 – age of broodmare\]. For this purpose, the age of the broodmare is taken as 12 unless, for a broodmare to which section ED 37 (2) applies, the age is 11 or less at the end of the income year, in which case the actual age is used in the formula.

ED 39 Reduction: bloodstock previously used for breeding Stallion (1) The reduction applying to the valuation of a stallion to which section ED 38 (2) does not apply is 20% of its cost price. Broodmare (2)The reduction applying to the value of a broodmare to which section ED 38 (4) does not apply is calculated using the formula— cost price of the broodmare \[15 – age of the broodmare\]. For this purpose, the age of the broodmare is taken as 12 unless, for a broodmare to which section ED 37 (2) applies, the age is 11 or less at the end of the income year, in which case the actual age is used in the formula. Origin:(1) EM 1(4), (5). (2) EM 1(4), (5). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, cost price, income year. Comment:This section is considered still to be relevant even though most of the breeding stock will not have been used for breeding purposes until after 15 December 1991. The provision also covers breeding stock that has been previously used and sold within New Zealand, which falls outside the criteria in draft section ED 38 (1). ED 40 Infertility, birth deformity, or accident If because of infertility, birth deformity, or accident the market value of bloodstock on hand at the end of an income year is less than 50% of what would otherwise be the market value, the bloodstock owner may value the bloodstock at its market value. The value of that bloodstock in later income years is its market value in the applicable income year. Origin:EM 1(2). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, income year, market value. ED 41 Use of bloodstock for racing General treatment (1) If in an income year a bloodstock owner uses bloodstock for racing, and they are in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale, the use of the bloodstock for racing is treated as use in the course of that business. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 468 ED – Valuation of livestock Bloodstock not used in business (2) When bloodstock that is used in an income year for racing is not actually used in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale, the bloodstock owner may apply to the Commissioner to have the use of the bloodstock treated otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1). Non-breeding bloodstock (3) If a bloodstock owner expects that bloodstock is not able to be used for future breeding purposes, the use in an income year of the bloodstock for racing is not treated as use in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale. But if the bloodstock owner uses the bloodstock in the course of their business of breeding bloodstock for sale, they may apply to the Commissioner to have the use of the bloodstock treated as use in the course of that business. Applications to the Commissioner (4)For the purposes of applications made under this section, the bloodstock owner must apply in writing with the supporting information that the Commissioner requires within 1 month after the day on which the horse is first prepared for racing, or the day on which it is first raced, whichever is earlier. Origin:(1) EM 2(3). (2) EM 2(2). (3) EM 2(1), (4). (4) EM 2(3), (5). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, business, Commissioner, income year. Comment:In line with self-assessment, the reference to the Commissioner having to be otherwise satisfied has been removed. However, the requirement to apply to the Commissioner has been retained (see current section EM 2 (3) and (4)). The second sentence in draft subsection (3) covers situations where, even though a horse is not itself used for breeding purposes, it can add value, such as through winning races, thereby increasing the value of related progeny. ED 42 Change of use of bloodstock in course of business Use outside business (1) If a bloodstock owner who is in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale starts to use bloodstock otherwise than in the course of that business, they are treated as having disposed of that bloodstock. The disposal is treated as having occurred at market value on the day on which they changed the use of the bloodstock. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 469 Use in business (2)If a bloodstock owner who is in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale has been using bloodstock for other purposes, and they start to use the bloodstock in the course of the business, the bloodstock is treated as having been bought by the bloodstock owner. The purchase is treated as having occurred at market value on the day on which the bloodstock owner changed the use of the bloodstock. Origin:(1) EM 2(6). (2) EM 2(7). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, business, market value. Comment:A disposal is treated as a disposal of revenue account property (see current section EF 2, draft section EB 2). ED 43 Replacement breeding stock When this section applies (1) This section applies when a bloodstock owner— (a) disposes of bloodstock that they had previously used for breeding purposes in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale; or (b)receives a payment of insurance or other compensation for the loss or death of, or permanent injury to, bloodstock that they had previously used for breeding purposes in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale, or that they had bought for use in that business. In this section, the bloodstock is called breeding stock. Reduction: disposing of breeding stock (2) When subsection (1)(a) applies, a bloodstock owner may request the Commissioner to determine the amount by which their income is reduced to reflect the disposal of the breeding stock. The maximum amount that the Commissioner may determine is the net gain realised on the disposal. Reduction: replacing breeding stock (3) When subsection (1)(b) applies, a bloodstock owner may request the Commissioner to determine the amount by which their income is reduced to reflect the cost of replacing breeding stock. The maximum amount that the Commissioner may determine is the net gain. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 470 ED – Valuation of livestock Application (4) An application under subsection (2) or subsection (3) must be made in writing within 6 months after the end of the income year in which the amount would otherwise be income (or, if the Commissioner approves in a case or in a class of cases, a longer period). The application must relate only to breeding stock bought before the application is made. Delay in replacing breeding stock (5) In the case of lost, dead, or permanently injured breeding stock, the Commissioner may extend the time limit under subsection (4). But valid commercial reasons must exist for the delay in replacing the breeding stock, and the replacement breeding stock must have been acquired before the end of the second income year following the income year in which the loss, death, or permanent injury occurred. Refund (6) When subsection (1)(b) applies and the conditions in subsection (5) are met, the Commissioner may refund an amount equal to the bloodstock owner’s income tax liability on the net gain (that is, the gross proceeds minus the value of the breeding stock) and apply the net gain to reduce the cost of replacing the breeding stock. Definitions for this section (7)In this section,— gross proceeds means, as applicable, the amount of the proceeds of disposing of the breeding stock, or the amount paid by way of insurance or other compensation for the breeding stock net gain means an amount equal to the gross proceeds minus the value of breeding stock value of breeding stock means the closing value of the breeding stock in the income year before the breeding stock, as applicable, was disposed of, or was lost, or died, or was permanently injured.

In line with self-assessment, the reference to the Commissioner having to be satisfied has been removed but an application still has to be made to the Commissioner. Also, the Commissioner’s discretion as to the length of the extension period has been retained as it is not appropriate for this to be self-assessed.

They must value the property at cost using a cost-flow method of assigning costs (for cost-flow methods, see section EC 7 (Cost-flow methods of assigning costs)). The value determined is the closing value to be taken into account in section EB 1 (Stock and excepted financial arrangements).

Equitable ownership can also qualify, depending on whether the item is used or available for use. Other instances are a lessee making an improvement (current section EG 1A) and purchasers who have not settled but have taken possession of the item (current section EG 1B). The concept of shared ownership encompasses current section EG 19 (8) but is not confined to that provision only. The concept applies across all the depreciation provisions.

Buyer treated as owning (2)For the purposes of section EF 1, the buyer is treated as owning, and the seller is treated as not owning, the item from the later of the following times: (a)the time at which the buyer enters into the contract; and (b)the time at which the buyer takes possession of the item. Buyer ceases to be treated as owner (3)Subsection (2) ceases to apply when one of the following occurs: (a)title to the item passes to the buyer; or (b)the seller repossesses the item.

Comment:Current section EG 1B is considered still to be necessary because under the Sale of Goods Act 1908 the timing of transfer of legal ownership depends on the intention of the parties. This issue is discussed further in Rulings Exposure Draft IS3817. EF 4 Ownership of lessee’s improvements: lessee When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a lessee of land incurs expenditure during the term of the lease in erecting a fixture on the land or making an improvement to the land; and (b)the lessor owns the fixture or improvement. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 479 Lessee treated as owner (2)For the purposes of section EF 1, the lessee is treated as owning the fixture or improvement for the term of the lease. Origin:(1) EG 1A(1). (2) EG 1A(1). Defined terms:improvement, lessee, lessor, term of the lease. Comment:Neither current section EG 1A (2) nor current section EG 1A (3) has been replicated, on the basis that they are unnecessary. In the case of current section EG 1A (2), if somebody else incurs the cost, the owner of the land has no cost to depreciate. If the owner of the land incurs a cost, the owner is able to depreciate the cost.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 480 EF – Depreciation What is and is not depreciable property EF 6 What is depreciable property Description (1)For the purposes of section EF 1, depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a)in deriving counted income; or (b)in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving counted income. Subsections (2) and (3) expand on this subsection. Property: tangible (2)An item of tangible property is depreciable property if— (a)it is described by subsection (1); and (b)it is not described by section EF 7. Property: intangible (3)An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a)it is within the definition of ‘depreciable intangible property’; and (b)it is described by subsection (1); and (c)it is not described by section EF 7. Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘depreciable property’. (2) new. (3) new. Defined terms:business, counted income, depreciable intangible property, depreciable property, derived, property. Comment:The current legislation does not require ‘depreciable intangible property’ to be ‘depreciable property’. However, this is the intent, and it is also the intent that the exclusions from ‘depreciable property’ apply, if relevant, to ‘depreciable intangible property’. The rewritten section makes that clear (see draft subsection (3)). Current section DE 1 affects the definition of depreciable property. However, it has not been replicated because its replication would duplicate the employment limitation in draft section DA 2 (4). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 481 EF 7 What is not depreciable property For the purposes of section EF 1, the following property is not depreciable property: (a)land, although buildings, fixtures, and the improvements listed in schedule 16 are depreciable property if they are described by section EF 6 (1): (b)trading stock: (c)livestock to which subpart EE applies: (d)financial arrangements: (e)excepted financial arrangements: (f)property that will not decline in value, as far as its owner is concerned, because, when they dispose of it, they have a right to be compensated for any decline in its value: (g)property that its owner chooses, under section EF 8, to treat as not depreciable: (h)property that its owner chooses, under section EF 31, to deal with under that section: (i)property for whose cost a person other than the property’s owner is allowed a deduction: (j)property for whose cost a person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart or under the Income Tax Act 1976 or under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. Origin: OB 1 ‘depreciable property’. Defined terms:deduction, depreciable property, excepted financial arrangement, financial arrangement, person, property, trading stock. Comment:Draft paragraph (e) makes a separate reference to excepted financial arrangements because draft section EC 2 (‘Trading stock’ defined) takes them out of the definition of ‘trading stock’. For reasons of simplification, draft paragraph (j) differs in presentation from the current subparagraphs (vi) and (viii) of the definition of ‘depreciable property’ in that it does not specifically name the relevant sections. However, the principle remains the same, namely, that costs that have been allowed as a deduction elsewhere are not depreciable. This includes revenue account property that is allowed as a deduction under current section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii) (and then timed under current section EF 2). EF 8 Election that property not be depreciable Item acquired (1)A person may choose that an item of property they acquire not be depreciable property even though, in the absence of the election, it would be depreciable property.

Retrospective election (3)A person who has not deducted all the amounts of depreciation loss for which they were allowed a deduction for an item of property, in the income year in which they acquired it and in each later year, may retrospectively choose that the item not be depreciable property. How elections made (4)An election under this section is made as follows: (a)a person makes an election under subsection (1) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for the income year in which they acquire the item: (b)a person makes an election under subsection (2) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for the income year in which the item’s use changes: (c)a person makes an election under subsection (3) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for any income year after they acquire the item, including an income year after they dispose of the item. Effect of election (5)An election under this section has effect for the person for— (a)the income year for which they make the election; and (b)all later income years until— (i)the item is disposed of, although this reference to disposal does not include the disposal of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind; or (ii)an event described in section EF 39 occurs involving the item.

Amount (2)The amount of depreciation loss is calculated using the formula— rate x starting adjusted tax value + ending adjusted tax value x months 2 12. Definition of items in formula (3)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (4) to (8). Rate (4) Rate is the diminishing value rate. It is one of the following: (a)if the same rate applies to all items depreciated in the pool in the income year, that rate; or (b)if different rates apply to items depreciated in the pool in the income year,— (i)the lower of the rates, if there are 2 items in the pool; or (ii)the lowest of the rates, if there are 3 or more items in the pool.

The definition of ‘months’ in draft subsection (8) removes this possibility. EF 22 Cases affecting pool Acquired item included (1)If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they acquire in the income year, the pool’s adjusted tax value is increased by the item’s cost. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 493 Separately depreciated item included (2)If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they depreciated separately in the previous income year,— (a)the pool’s adjusted tax value is increased by the item’s adjusted tax value on the date it is included in the pool; and (b)the item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the previous income year is included in starting adjusted tax value in section EF 21 (5). Item disposed of (3)If a person disposes of an item included in a pool, any consideration they derive from the disposal is subtracted from the adjusted tax value of the pool in which the item was included on the date of the disposal. All items disposed of (4)If, on the last day of an income year, the adjusted tax value of a person’s pool is positive but the person has disposed of all items that were in the pool,— (a)the pool’s adjusted tax value is the amount of depreciation loss that the person has for the pool for the income year; and (b)on the first day of the following income year, the pool’s adjusted tax value is zero. Negative adjusted tax value (5)If, on the last day of an income year, the adjusted tax value of a person’s pool is negative,— (a)the amount by which the adjusted tax value is negative is depreciation recovery income of the person derived in the income year; and (b)on the first day of the following income year the pool’s adjusted tax value is zero.

Comment: The reference in current section EG 11 (4)(b)(i) to income being ‘as if it were \[...\] income derived by virtue of section EG 19 (2)’ has not been carried over because it appears to be superfluous (see draft subsection (5)(a)). EF 23 Combined pools Combining pools allowed (1)A person using the pool method may at any time combine any number of pools to form a single pool. Consequences (2)When a person combines pools,— (a)the new pool’s adjusted tax value is the same as the sum of the adjusted tax values of the constituent pools; and (b)the adjusted tax value of each of the constituent pools at the end of the income year in which the pools are combined is zero; and (c)each of the constituent pools ceases to exist.

Comment:The draft section no longer deals separately with the depreciation of software. Current law refers to the taxpayer having claimed any deduction for the purchase or creation of software (current section EG 19 (1)(a)(ii)). This means it covers software before and after 1 April 1993 even though the pre-1 April 1993 software is not depreciable property. The draft tries to make this more explicit by separating out disposals of pre-1 April 1993 software and including them as part of recoveries (see draft section CZ 1). This does not result in any change in the law’s effect as, under draft section CZ 1, the disposal of software purchased or created before 1 April 1993 is treated as if it were a disposal of depreciable property covered by draft sections EF 40 to EF 43.

Change of use or location of use (3)The second event is the change of use, or change of location of use, of an item of property, as a result of which a person does not have an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the next income year. The event is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year. Loss or theft (4)The third event is the loss or theft of an item of property, if the item is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Irreparable damage (5)The fourth event is the irreparable damage of an item of property.

Income (2)If the consideration referred to in section EF 36 is less than or equal to the cost of the item to the person, the depreciation recovery amount that is income of the person is calculated using the formula in subsection (4). Depreciation loss (3)If the consideration referred to in section EF 36 is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, an amount calculated using the formula in subsection (4) is the amount of depreciation loss that the person has. This subsection does not apply if the item is a building. Formula (4)The formula is— all deductions (base value – adjusted tax value) x depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss. Definition of items in formula (5)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). All deductions (6) All deductions is all amounts of depreciation loss that the person has had under this Act for the item and all depreciation deductions that the person has been allowed under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for the item, in each of the income years in which the person owns the item.

Cost reduced: input tax (2)The item’s cost is reduced by subtracting the amount (if any) of input tax applying to the supply of the item to the person. This subsection is overridden by subsection (3). Cost reduced: input tax (3)This subsection applies to an item that was not acquired or produced for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but is applied in an income year principally for that purpose. The item’s cost is reduced by subtracting a proportion of the amount (if any) calculated under sections 21F and 21G, and deductible under section 20 (3)(e), of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The proportion is the proportion of the amount that arises from the application of the item in the income year principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Cost increased: output tax (4)This subsection applies to an item that was acquired or produced for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but is applied in an income year other than for that purpose. The item’s cost is increased by adding the amount (if any) of output tax charged in the income year for the supply of the item because section 21 (1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to the supply.

Premium loading formula (active annuities) (2)The premium loading formula (active annuities) is— 0.01 x claim probability x opening actuarial reserves. Definition of items in formulas (3)The items in the formulas are defined in subsections (4) to (6). Claim probability (4) Claim probability is the probability of a claim arising under the policy for the life insured’s death in the income year. It is determined at the start of the income year using the same mortality assumptions as are used to calculate the life insurer’s actuarial reserves for the income year. It is expressed as a decimal. Adjustments to claim probability are in sections EG 16 (2) and EG 17 (2). Opening sum assured (5) Opening sum assured is the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured’s death in the income year, and is payable only for death, or, if no such claim would be payable, the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured’s survival to the relevant date or age specified in the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year. It may be zero. Adjustments to opening sum assured are in sections EG 16 (3), EG 18 (2), EG 19 (3), and EG 20 (2). Opening actuarial reserves (6) Opening actuarial reserves is the amount in the life insurer’s actuarial reserves for the life insured under the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year. An adjustment to opening actuarial reserves is in section EG 16 (4).

Comment:The definition of ‘opening sum assured’ in draft subsection (5) contains the phrase ‘and is payable only for death’ but the definition of ‘opening sum assured’ in draft section EG 25 (4) does not. The difference replicates current law – compare item s0 in current section CM 6 (1), which contains the word ‘only’, with item s0 in current section CM 5 (1), which does not. The question arises as to whether it is necessary to preserve this difference.
