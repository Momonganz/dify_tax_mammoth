Ngā pūkete whare rēti Rental property records
=============================================

You’ll need to keep accurate records for your residential rental property to calculate income and expenses. 

You must keep rental records for at least 7 years, even if you no longer rent the property. Your records include:

*   bank statements, cheque butts and deposit books
*   working papers for all calculations
*   a list of all receipts and payments
*   invoices, transaction listings or statements showing income received where the property is rented through a management company or service provider such as Airbnb or Bookabach
*   invoices and receipts for expenses
*   a list of assets with receipts showing their purchase value and date
*   the rental agreement (if long-term tenancy)
*   any loan mortgage agreement
*   vehicle logbook (if vehicle expenditure is claimed).

It's easier if you use a separate bank account for your rental activity.

Short-term accommodation rental records
---------------------------------------

If you’re providing short-term accommodation (eg through Airbnb) you’ll also need to keep records to show:

*   the market rental per night (including dates of when this changed or increased over time)
*   the number of nights you rent out the room or property and how much income you receive for this
*   the number of nights the room or property is used privately (this includes you, or people [associated with you](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
    )
*   the number of nights you rent out the room or property at ‘mates’ rates’ and how much income you received from this
*   any [excess deductions](/api/glossary/item?id={C3E1928C-9525-4DB5-BBD8-8B5FBF8EC353})
    .
*   evidence of when it was not rented but available to be rented out

Rental records and property that is not rented but available
------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need to keep records showing the time your property is not rented out but still available to be rented.

Your records cannot be:

*   just a statement of its availability
*   sporadic or limited advertising
*   advertising that is not likely to attract many customers.

Your records need to show:

*   evidence of active, regular and effective marketing of the space at market rates
*   that it’s available at times and for periods that demonstrate it’s genuinely available to rent.

Residential rental property deduction records
---------------------------------------------

If the residential rental property deduction rules apply to your property, you'll need to keep records showing:

*   what basis you are electing for each property that you own
*   changes to the elected basis for your rental property, for example from the individual to the portfolio basis, and the year that change takes place 
*   any excess deductions, and which property or portfolio those excess deductions relate to
*   transferred unused excess deductions (that's from one property or portfolio to another), what the amount transferred is, and when the transfer took place 
*   when you disposed of a property, the date it took place, and if a property sale whether the sale taxable or not.

With residential rental property deductions you'll need to calculate what amounts should be included in your tax return. Keep records of the:

*   calculations
*   properties the calculations are for
*   decisions that may change your tax position.
