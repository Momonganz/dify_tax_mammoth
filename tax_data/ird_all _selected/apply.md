=======================================================================

Apply for a [child support review](/api/glossary/item?id={38291B4C-5507-4D0B-813C-213BB36AB3FB})
 if you think the [formula assessment](/api/glossary/item?id={685B102C-017F-44EE-BB14-BF34C28EE726})
 for your child support payments does not take your special circumstances into account. Before applying, make sure you understand how review decisions can affect you.

Before you start
----------------

You'll need:

*   the child support years you want reviewed
*   the names of the children covered in the review
*   to list the grounds, reasons, for your review
*   to tell us why you believe the assessment should be changed, matching your special circumstances with the grounds for review
*   evidence or information that shows how you meet the grounds for review.

If you're applying for a past child support year, you’ll need to explain why you did not apply at the time.

With the future hearing, decide if you want to:

*   attend by phone
*   have a support person
*   have a representative attend in your place.

In myIR, select 'More...' from the child support account panel

You'll need to select each ground you're applying for.

Explain how your special circumstances match the ground(s) you've chosen.

You'll also need to check that you've given us the supporting information needed as proof for each ground.

After you've sent us your application, you'll receive an Alert in myIR.

This Alert will be a 'Financial details for a child support review'

What happens next
-----------------

We'll assess your application and be in touch with you to talk about it. We may also ask you to provide more information to support your application.

If we accept the application, we’ll arrange for a hearing. A hearing takes up to 30 minutes and is:

*   informal compared to court hearings
*   held separately with each person in the review
*   for clarifying the information provided and talking about all parties' circumstances.

Hearings are carried out by a review officer contracted to us. The decision is not made at the hearing.  We'll let you know the outcome in writing, usually within 3 weeks.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

As a child support customer, you'll always need to:

*   tell us about changes
*   check your information
*   tell us if something is wrong.
