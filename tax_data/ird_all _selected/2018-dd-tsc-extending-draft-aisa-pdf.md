Background The Government has set out its commitment to reforms that ensure the public sector takes a more collaborative, cross-agency approach to supporting New Zealanders and gaining efficiencies. A key part of this commitment includes is reducing the rates of crime. It has been identified that sharing information between IR and the NZ Policethe Parties would be one way of supporting these goals. The tax secrecy rules in the TAA prevent IR from sharing information with other agencies other than when a specified exception applies. One exception to tax secrecy is that Information may be shared when in accordance with an approved information sharing agreement pursuant to Part 9A 7 of the Privacy Act 19932018. This Agreement has been put in place under Part 9A 7 to enable IR to share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies, for the purpose of detection, prevention, investigation or providing evidence of Serious Crime. IR may share Information with NZ Policeone or more Requesting Agencies either proactively or in response to a request from NZ Policea Requesting Agency. That Information may relate to Persons that may be involved in or otherwise connected to a Serious Crime as well as Persons with whom they have or have had a relationship (for example, family members or Associates). Terms 1. Objectives and purpose of the Agreement Objectives The objectives of this Agreement are to: (a) Prevent and reduce the level of Serious Crime committed; (b) Gain efficiencies through more collaborative, cross-agency work; and (c) Enable sufficient protection of people’s privacy and ensure a proper level of security and transparency. Objectives (a) and (b) can potentially conflict with objective (c), if robust security systems and processes are not established to protect people’s privacy. To ensure that a potential conflict is IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 11 managed appropriately a balance between providing better public services and ensuring that peoples’ information is adequately protected is required. Purpose The purpose of this Agreement is to enable IR to share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation or providing evidence of a Serious Crime that there are reasonable grounds to suspect has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed. IR may share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies either in response to a request from NZ Policea Requesting Agency or proactively. The Agreement does not cover information sharing as part of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009. Nothing in this Agreement affects that Act. 2. Exemptions and/or modifications to information privacy principles For the purposes of this Agreement information privacy principles 2 and 11 which are set out in section 6 19 of the Privacy Act 1993 2018 are modified (by the Order in Council) as follows: Principle 2: Source of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 2 for IR to collect Personal Information from NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies or NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies to collect Personal Information from IR for the purposes of this Agreement. Principle 11: Limits on disclosure of personal information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 11 for NZ Police the Requesting Agencies to request Personal Information from IR (which itself may entail the disclosure of Personal Information to IR) or for IR to provide Personal Information to NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies for the purposes of this Agreement. 3. The public service or public services the provision of which the Agreement is intended to facilitate The public services that this Agreement is intended to facilitate are maintaining public safety, law enforcement and crime prevention. In particular this Agreement is intended to facilitate the provision of Information for the prevention, detection or investigation of, or as evidence of, Serious Crime. This may result in the prosecution of a Person for a Serious Crime. 4. Type of Information to be shared under the Agreement Test for sharing Information sharing under this Agreement will only occur where the following test is met: NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may request Information from IR and IR may share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency in response to that request, or IR may proactively share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency, where:  NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency (if requesting) or IR (if proactively sharing) has reasonable grounds to suspect that a Serious Crime has been, is being, or will be, committed; and IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 12  NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency (if requesting) or IR (if proactively sharing) has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence of, a Serious Crime; and  IR determines that the Information is readily available within IR and that it is reasonable, practicable and in the public interest to provide the Information to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. As noted above, this Information may relate to Persons that may be involved in or otherwise connected to a Serious Crime as well as Persons with whom they have or have had a relationship (for example, family members or Associates). The Information may relate to such offending as, for example, investor fraud, money laundering or drug manufacturing or distribution. This is an indicative list only for the purposes of illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, a Requesting Agency may proactively share information that it holds in relation to Serious Crime with IR in accordance with relevant provisions of legislation that it administers (such as section 36 of the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990) or the information privacy principles contained in section 19 of the Privacy Act 2018. Any agreed operational arrangements in relation to the sharing of such information will be specified in a separate memorandum of understanding between the Requesting Agency and IR. 5. The parties Parties involved and the lead agency As indicated above, this Agreement is between NZ Police, NZ Customs, SFO and IR. IR is the lead agency. 6. Description of information to be shared between the Parties IR will only share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency where the relevant test for sharing in clause 4 above has been met. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may request that IR share information Information falling within the categories in Row 1 of the table below and IR may share such information Information in response to a request. In making such a request of IR, NZ Policea Requesting Agency may itself need to share certain information Information (such as identifying details and grounds for the request) with IR, to enable IR to process the request and/or for IR to assess whether relevant parts of the test are met. The information that a Requesting Agency may share with IR can include: \[Insert\] IR may proactively share information Information described in Row 2 of the table below. This means that IR may proactively share information Information that could otherwise be requested by NZ Policea Requesting Agency under Row 1, and any other information Information discovered by IR in the course of carrying out its usual functions and duties (however discovered) with NZ Policea Requesting Agency when the test is met. The information that IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency can include:  Information about a Person'’s Associates IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 13 Row 1 Information IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency upon request  Tax Information  Financial Transaction Information  Financial Relationship Information  Domestic Relationship information  Information about Assets  Employment Information  Person Records  Social Assistance Information Row 2 Information IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency proactively  Information falling within the categories in Row 1 above  Any other Information discovered by IR in the course of carrying out its usual functions and duties (however discovered) For the avoidance of doubt, IR may share both current and previous information, as held by IR, with NZ Policea Requesting Agency. 7. How the parties Parties may use the Information IR may use Information received from NZ Policea Requesting Agency under this Agreement to process an NZ PoliceRequesting Agency request and/or to assess whether relevant parts of the test in clause 4 above are met. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may use Information received under this Agreement for the purpose of prevention, detection or investigation of, or to use as evidence of, a Serious Crime. This may involve undertaking the following types of activities (note that this is an indicative list only for the purposes of illustration):  Identifying the commission or potential commission of a Serious Crime.  Identifying individuals involved in a Serious Crime (e.g., victims, offenders, witnesses).  Identifying other lines of inquiry for a Serious Crime.  Using the Information as intelligence for a Serious Crime investigation.  Using the Information as evidence in the investigation and prosecution of any Person for a Serious Crime.  Using the Information as part of an investigation into a Serious Crime to identify roles and relationships within criminal networks to then identify the enablers of financial structures.  Identifying potential victims or offenders of Serious Crimes to enable activation of preventative measures. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 14  Enabling, where the test is met, the sharing of Information for joint NZ PoliceRequesting Agency and IR taskforces. Information used in any of the respects above may also be turned into anonymised data for the purpose of producing strategic intelligence products that detail crime trends. Neither pNo Requesting Agencyarty will use any Information shared under this Agreement for any purpose other than as set out in this Agreement. For example, IR will not use Information received from NZ Police under this Agreement for TAA purposes and NZ Policea Requesting Agency will not use Information received under this Agreement:  As evidence of a non-serious crime that is not a Serious Crime.; or  As general intelligence information.; or  As part of a vetting process. These restrictions do not apply from the point in time (if any) that the Information becomes publicly available as a result of legitimate public disclosure or as a result of court proceedings. IR may use Information obtained under this Agreement as part of a request for Information by a Requesting Agency in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. 8. Adverse actions Section 96Q 152 of the Privacy Act 1993 2018 requires agencies to provide written notice to individuals before any “adverse action” is taken against them on the basis of Personal Information shared under an information sharing agreement, and give those individuals 10 working days to dispute the information received. Section 96R 153 allows agencies to either dispense with the requirements under section 96Q 152 or shorten the 10 working day period. Information (including Personal Information) held by IR will only be shared with NZ Policea Requesting Agency where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a Serious Crime has been committed, is being committed or will be committed and that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection, investigation or the provision of evidence of a Serious Crime. Much of NZ Police’sa Requesting Agency’s early assessment and investigative work is sensitive. Advance notification by NZ Policea Requesting Agency of an adverse action would ‘tip off’ an alleged serious criminal offender. For these reasons NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies will dispense with the notice requirements under section 96Q 152 for this Agreement. To the extent that IR’s use of Personal Information received from NZ Policea Requesting Agency to locate Information (including Personal Information) held by IR for disclosure to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, or IR’s sharing of Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency, could be considered an adverse action, IR will dispense with the notice requirement under section 96Q 152 for this Agreement. Adverse actions NZ Policea Requesting Agency may take The type of adverse action NZ Policea Requesting Agency may take is dependent on:  the nature of the Serious Crime and the immediacy of action required e.g., a homicide versus a financial crime; and IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 15  the nature and value of Information when considered alongside the facts of a case and material held by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. The types of adverse action could include (but are not limited to):  investigation;  arrest; and  prosecution. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may also use its range of statutory powers to support the exercise of these actions. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency’s employees or anyone engaged by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency will comply with all NZ Policeof the Requesting Agency’s policies and guidelines as well as the Solicitor General’s Prosecution Guidelines (Guidelines), before taking any adverse action. The Guidelines assist in determining:  whether criminal proceedings should be commenced;  what charges should be filed; and  whether, if commenced, criminal proceedings should be continued or discontinued. The Guidelines also provide advice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, and establish standards of conduct and practice expected from those whose duties include conducting prosecutions. If Information shared under this Agreement forms part of the prosecution’s evidence in a criminal case, the Information may be disclosed to an individual in accordance with the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008. Any dispute about the provision of such information will be managed by the courts as part of the subject matter of the prosecution. IR and adverse actions Except to the extent that IR’s locating and sharing of Personal Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency could be considered adverse action, IR will take no adverse actions under this Agreement as a result of receiving Personal Information from NZ Policea Requesting Agency under this Agreement. However, this does not prevent IR from using such information in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. 9. Where you can view this document This document is available to the public online at www.ird.govt.nz and www.police.govt.nz or aton the public website of each Party or in person at: Inland Revenue Asteron Centre Level 5 55 Featherston Street Wellington 6011 10. Overview of the operational details Requests for Information by NZ Policea Requesting Agency will be passed to and managed by a designated team in NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. They will decide whether the parts of the test in clause 4 required to be satisfied by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency are met and whether the request should be sent to IR. Requests for Information will be sent to a particular nominated team at IR. Certain staff members will ascertain whether IR holds the Information sought and decide whether that IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 16 Information may be released to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency, having applied the relevant parts of the test. In the case of proactive release of Information by IR to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, IR personnel will pass the Information to be considered for proactive release to the same nominated IR team so that a decision can be made as to whether the Information can be provided to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency in accordance with the test. Senior personnel within each agency Party will be responsible for the relevant decision-making by their agencythat Party. From NZ Police this will be overseen by the Manager: Intelligence Operations (or their nominated Deputy), based in the National Intelligence Centre, or relevant successor personnel. From IR this will be overseen by the Manager: Investigations (or their nominated Deputy), or relevant successor personnel. From NZ Customs this will be overseen by the Manager: Intelligence (or their nominated Deputy). From SFO this will be overseen by the General Counsel. Subject to the commentary below, IR and NZ Policethe Parties will use the SEEMail environmenta Secure Transmission Method to share Information with one another. SEEMail is designed to facilitate the secure exchange of email and attachments between participating agencies in a manner that protects the information against disclosure to anyone outside of the SEEMail environment. If Information is shared by IR via SEEMail, it will be received by NZ Police a Requesting Agency in a designated secure email inbox. Once received, it (rather than the individuals to whom it relates) will be given a unique identifier (for the purposes of file management) and held by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency in a secure registry on a secure floor. Specific security access is required to access that registry and floorenvironment. IR may also, in addition to using SEEMail, share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency by other means, for example, by permitting NZ Policethat Requesting Agency to physically access IR premises to examine and copy and/or remove the Information, e.g., a hard drive, computer file, hard copy files etc. Information will only be distributed within NZ Policea Requesting Agency to Appropriately Authorised Staff, for the purposes set out in this Agreement. Information will be distributed with specific caveats and rules to ensure the Information remains protected. 11. Safeguards to protect privacy and security Test for sharing Information Before any Information is requested or released, the relevant test in clause 4 must be satisfied. As noted above, senior personnel within each agency Party will be responsible for the relevant decision- making by their agencythat Party. In addition, Information will only be accessible by those Appropriately Authorised Staff who need to use it for the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed certificates of confidentiality under the TAA. Secure sharing of Information As noted above, SEEMail a Secure Transmission Method will primarily be used to share Information between IR and NZ Policethe Parties. Both agenciesThe Parties have information technology systems that comply with the applicable government security levels. If SEEMail is used appropriately by participating agenciesthe Parties, users can be highly confident that:  Email marked \[SEEMAIL\] can only be read by the participating agency of the recipient, either IR or NZ Police. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 17  The email does in fact come from the participating agency asParty claimed.  No one outside the sender’s participating agencysending Party can read the email when it is in transit.  No one outside the sender’s participating agencysending Party can alter the message.  Email marked \[SEEMAIL\] cannot be inadvertently sent to non-participating agenciesParties.  All email traffic between participating agenciesParties is secured.  All email traffic between participating agenciesParties authenticates the sending agencyParty. The Parties are investigating greater use of MFT to transfer Information between them. As part of this, they will explore using and may in the future use MFT to transfer Information under this Agreement rather than SEEMail. Reasonable and practicable steps will be taken by the Parties to maintain security during any physical access, examination, copying and removal of Information. For example, where practicable physical media devices will be encrypted and password protected before removal from IR. Onsite access by NZ Policea Requesting Agency will also be closely supervised by IR to ensure that only Information able to be shared under this Agreement is accessed, examined, copied and removed. Verification of Information/confirmation of identity When NZ Policea Requesting Agency requests Information about one or more identifiable Individuals, IR will compare the details about the Individual(s) provided by the NZ PoliceRequesting Agency with the details IR holds so as to have a high degree of confidence that the correct Information is shared. Where NZ Policea Requesting Agency requests Information about an identifiable Individual's family members, for example, without providing identifying details of who they are, IR may need to rely on its own information. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will use standard investigative processes to independently verify that Information received from IR is accurate. The process of further investigation or development of the Information will be aimed at verifying the circumstances and accuracy of the Information through corroboration with information from other sources. Disclosure NZ Police and IRA Requesting Agency will not provide Information obtained under this Agreement to other another agencies Requesting Agency or any other third party, except as required by law or the courts. For example if Information shared under this Agreement is used by NZ Policea Requesting Agency as part of a criminal prosecution it may be required to be disclosed under the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008. Nothing in this Agreement limits the requirements of that Act. IR may use Information obtained under this Agreement as part of a request for Information by a Requesting Agency in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. Under section 17M(2) of the TAA, this includes its use in a “permitted disclosure” as defined in that Act. Storage of Information NZ Police and IRA Requesting Agency will receive and store Information received under this Agreement securely and separately from other information that it holds. via SEEMail in a designated secure email inbox. The information in this email inbox will be segregated from other information that IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 18 NZ Police and IR hold. Information received in physical form will be stored according to NZ Police protocols and will similarly be kept segregated from other information that NZ Police hold. Transfer of Information within NZ Policea Requesting Agency The Information will only be distributed to Appropriately Authorised Staff, for the purposes set out in this Agreement. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will not make such Information generally available to all NZ Policeof its employees or anyone engaged by NZ Policethat it engages. The Information will be distributed to Appropriately Authorised Staff in a manner which ensures that the Information is kept separate from all other information while it is being transferred and is not at risk of being mixed or overheard (as applicable). The Information will be tagged with specific rules and caveats on how the Information may be used to ensure that the Information is not used inappropriately and remains protected. IR Training The authorised staff of IR will be appropriately trained and/or issued with guidelines to ensure that the test is met before Information is shared under this Agreement. Retention and deletion of Information Relevant information NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will make an initial decision as to whether Information shared by IR under this Agreement is required for any of the purposes set out in this Agreement, within 90 days of receipt of that Information. If NZ Policea Requesting Agency decides that it no longer requires the Information, it will inform IR of that decision within 14 days of making the decision. Information that is shared and held by NZ Policea Requesting Agency that is required for any of the purposes set out in this Agreement will be retained by NZ Policethat Requesting Agency for as long as required and in accordance with the Public Records Act 2005 and any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. Given that matters concerning Serious Crimes are usually complex, this retention period may extend over a number of years, both for active cases and in situations involving cold cases.
