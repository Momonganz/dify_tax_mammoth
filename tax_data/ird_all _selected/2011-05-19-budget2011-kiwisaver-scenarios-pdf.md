KiwiSaver – how changes affect New Zealanders 1. 35-year old couple on average household income. Ben and Megan are both 35 years old. Ben works full time and earns $52,000 a year and Megan works part time earning $25,000 a year. Their combined income is equivalent to the average household wage. They join KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and both contribute the new minimum rate – 3 per cent of their gross wages.

He receives the equivalent of $10 a week in government contributions through the annual Member Tax Credit. Megan contributes $14.38 a week and her employer contributes 3 per cent, or $11.87 a week after tax. She receives the equivalent of $7.19 a week from the Member Tax Credit. By age 65 Ben and Megan would have combined savings of about $247,500. This would be enough to provide gross income of about $15,000 a year in retirement over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. 2. 30-year old on average wage Steven is 30 and earns $50,000 – about the average wage.

He receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Steven would have about $190,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of around $11,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 3. 18-year old on the minimum wage Blair is 18 and earns just over $27,000 a year – around the minimum wage.

After three years, if Bechi and Dan decided to buy their first home, they may be eligible for a first home deposit subsidy of $3,000 each, which increases to a maximum of $5,000 after five years. They could also withdraw their own contributions, their employers' contributions and their fund returns to buy their first home. After five years they would have about $36,000 available for withdrawal, and if their combined income remained under $100,000, they would also be eligible for the $5,000 deposit subsidy, pushing their total first-home deposit to about $46,000. Assuming they withdrew the maximum amount to buy their first home, at age 65 Bechi and Dan would have a combined balance of about $345,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of about $21,000 a year in retirement over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. 5. 45-year old couple with household income of $120,000 Tama and Lisa are both 45.

Assumptions used in KiwiSaver examples • Although the Member Tax Credit is paid annually after the government financial year, the estimated annual amount has been averaged on a weekly basis for the purposes of these examples. • All retirement savings figures are in today's dollars, based on funds earning a real return of 4 per cent a year and real wage growth of 1.5 per cent a year, unless otherwise stated. • The Member Tax Credit and tax rates are not indexed for inflation. • Estimated retirement income is based on life expectancy of 25 years in retirement and an annual real return of 4 per cent a year. Payments are inflation adjusted to preserve real value.
