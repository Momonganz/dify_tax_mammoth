Te whakamana i a mātou kia mutu te kohikohi i te tautoko tamariki, te moni oranga ā-whare rānei Authorise us to stop collecting child support or domestic maintenance
=====================================================================================================================================================================

Use this form if you're getting child support or domestic maintenance and you want us to stop collecting payments from the liable parent.

You can ask us not to collect all or part of the money owing. You cannot cancel any penalties owed by the liable parent/person as these are owed to the government.

Only the [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
, the person getting the child support payments, can complete this form.

This form does not cancel child support or domestic maintenance.

What happens next
-----------------

We'll stop collecting the payments you have asked us not to collect on the form.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

You'll need to complete the following forms if you do not want us to collect any future child support or domestic maintenance payments.

[Cancel your child support](/child-support/ending/cancel-child-support)

[Cancel your domestic maintenance](/child-support/ending/cancel-your-domestic-maintenance)

If you're getting the [Unsupported Child's Benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={85E0DDDD-CC2F-447C-AD88-1270C9B4CDCF})
, you cannot ask us to stop collecting child support. But, you can ask us to stop collecting court-ordered lump sums of child support.

Once you have asked us not to collect payments owed to you, you cannot later ask us to collect them. If you change your mind and would like the payments collected, you can collect them by applying through the District Court.
