Repaying the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) loan
=======================================================

You will have 5 years to pay off the loan. You do not have to make repayments in the first 2 years. Generally, we will not charge interest during the first 2 years.Â 

After 2 years from the date of approval of the loan you will need to begin monthly repayments of the outstanding balance. We will send you a repayment schedule in myIR, outlining the repayment dates and amounts needed.

The annual interest rate is 3% once repayments start after 2 years.

If you make voluntary repayments in the first 2 years, your repayment plan will have lower required repayments.

If you want to change a repayment plan or you cannot meet a payment at any stage, please contact us as soon as possible to talk about your situation. Any missed payments are an event of default on the loan, meaning you may have to immediately repay the loan in full , with any interest.

First 2 years interest-free
---------------------------

From 21 March 2022 the first 2 years of the loan will be interest-free. This change will apply to existing borrowers, as long as there has not been any default on your SBCS loan.

For all new borrowers, this change automatically applied from 21 March 2022. If you choose to draw down the loan in up to 4 separate amounts (up to the maximum loan amount), the 2-year interest-free period begins from the date of your first drawdown.

Loans have an annual interest rate of 3% which applies after 2 years from the date of the loan contract.

If there is an [event of default](/api/glossary/item?id={8FA05D28-0FDF-404B-BE77-298CBCAEEEA1})
 on your loan, you may have to repay the loan in full right away with any interest and default interest may be charged.

Interest on top up loans
------------------------

Existing borrowers who apply for a top up loan will have 2 separate loans with 2 separate interest-free periods. For example, for the:

*   existing SBCS loan, the interest free period applies 2 years from the date the loan was made available to you
*   top up loan, the interest free period applies 2 years from the date the first drawdown of the top up loan was made available to you.

If you choose to receive the top up loan in up to 4 separate amounts (up to the maximum loan amount) instead of a single lump sum, the interest-free period starts from your first drawdown of the top up loan. Any further drawdowns do not create a new interest-free period.

Other general rules that apply when you take out the loan
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have a change of circumstances while you still have the loan, you need to contact us as soon as possible after the change.

Examples include:

*   your business ceases or is sold
*   your business is no longer viable
*   you become insolvent
*   you enter bankruptcy, liquidation or other creditor arrangement
*   the nature of your business changes. For example the business changes from real estate agent to selling books.

If you apply for a loan with false or misleading information, or give us false or misleading information later, you may have to immediately repay the loan in full right away, with interest. You could also be investigated for offences under the Crimes Act 1961.

Interest charges if you default on the loan
-------------------------------------------

If there is a default on your loan, you have to immediately repay the loan in full with any interest and default interest may be charged.

If we recall a loan because of a default, we'll charge a higher interest rate.

The balance of the principal loan amount (plus any standard interest) will have default interest calculated on it. The default interest is calculated daily. Default interest is the standard interest rate of 3% rate plus an added amount and is calculated as follows:

Loan balance x \[UOMI (use of money interest)\* + Standard loan interest\]

In this formula:

*   loan balance includes principal and standard loan interest
*   \* UOMI underpayment rate.

Unlike UOMI charged in other taxes, the interest charged on the loan cannot be remitted.

Payment methods
---------------

You can make payments towards your SBCS loan using any of our repayment options, including direct debit. The tax type for Small Business Cashflow Scheme repayments is SBC.

Ways of paying
--------------

You can ask us to pay any tax refund towards your loan balance instead of paying it to you. If you'd like to do this, you'll need to message us in myIR. Refunds may be used to pay off other tax debts first, if you have them.
