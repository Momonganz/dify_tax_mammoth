Depreciation rate for rapid DC car charging stations
====================================================

Determination DEP100 (2017) sets a general depreciation rate for a new asset class 'Rapid DC car charging stations' in the Transportation category.

#### Note to Determination DEP100

The Commissioner has set a general depreciation rate for a new asset class "Rapid DC car charging stations", not currently provided for under the "Transportation" asset category, within the Commissioner's Table of Depreciation Rates.

Electric vehicles have a charger built in that converts the domestic alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) for the car's battery. This onboard charger generally takes around 6-8 hours to fully charge a car. A rapid charger is a much larger, freestanding version than the onboard charger. It bypasses the vehicle's onboard charging device and supplies power directly to the vehicle's battery. It converts high power 3-phase AC into DC and significantly reduces the charging time - usually to less than 30 minutes.
