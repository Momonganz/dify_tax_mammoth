Depreciation Rate for specialised oil and gas industry equipment
================================================================

Determination DEP96 (2015) sets a depreciation rate for specialised oil and gas industry equipment used to evaluate and repair existing wellbores.

#### Note to Determination

The Commissioner has set general depreciation rates for several items of specialised equipment used by oil and gas industry support specialists to evaluate, repair or stimulate the performance of existing wellbores, not currently provided for under the "Oil and Gas Industry" category, within the Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates.

The asset class for "Tools, downhole" includes shifting tools, fishing tools, tungsten stembars, pulling tools, gauge rings, broaches and centering tools.  The asset class does not include perforating guns which are made by several shaped explosives charges within the gun.  As most retrievable perforating guns can be used once only as they distort when fired and are weakened, the Commissioner considers these items are consumable items and be treated as revenue expenditure items.

Mobile steel tanks, usually constructed of welded mild steel to store or distribute water and other liquids, are viewed by the Commissioner to generally have an estimated useful life of 20 years.  However, a new asset class of "Mobile storage tanks (mild steel, welded)" has been added to the "Oil and gas industry" category with an estimated useful life of 15.5 years due to harsh environmental conditions.  In addition, some tanks are used to hold and distribute corrosive acid or alkali and under those circumstances are viewed to have a shorter life of 10 years, as provided for in this determination.
