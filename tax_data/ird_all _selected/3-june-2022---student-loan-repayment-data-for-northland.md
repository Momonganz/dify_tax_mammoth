www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22 OIA1888 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 03 May 2022 Dear T hank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) to the Ministry of Social Development on 3 February 2022. The part of your request relating to student loan repayment data was transferred to Inland Revenue on 11 May 2022. You requested the following: Student loan repayment data per year for Northland with breakdown to district level and tertiary education providers (if available) in the past 10 years 2011-2021. The information you have requested in relation to student loan repayment data broken down by tertiary education providers is considered sensitive revenue information under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), as it relates to the affairs of a specific taxpayer or entity. Sensitive revenue information can only be released in certain circumstances, as set out in sections 18D to 18J and schedule 7 of the TAA. In this case, there are no grounds that permit me to release this information to you. Accordingly, I have decided to refuse this part of your request under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as releasing this information would be contrary to section 18 of the TAA. Although we are unable to release any information relating to specific tertiary education providers, it may be of interest to you that t he Tertiary Education Commission provide data around outcomes by tertiary providers (though not by student loan repayments). This information can be found on the education website https://www.education.govt.nz/ further-education/information-for -tertiary-students/employment-outcomes/. Information being released Attached to this response is a spreadsheet outlining the student loan repayment data for the Northland region, broken down to district level. The table on the left outlines the total number of repayments and the total amount repaid. You can filter the repayments by district by selecting the relevant district on the right, or by simply expanding the cell in the first column. Right of review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. \[IN CONFIDENCE\]# DATE\_POSTEDDistrict Number of repaymentsTotal amount paid 2011 Far North District3,978-$5,134,473 Kaipara District1,087-$1,424,220 Whangarei District5,927-$8,642,670 2012 Far North District4,347-$5,636,286 Kaipara District1,177-$1,659,094 Whangarei District 6,565-$10,046,590 2013 Far North District4,805-$7,442,235 Kaipara District1,325-$2,243,622 Whangarei District7,231-$13,329,188 2014 Far North District5,152-$7,391,559 Kaipara District1,449-$2,128,199 Whangarei District7,583-$12,700,737 2015Far North District5,257-$7,836,830 Kaipara District1,461-$2,204,413 Whangarei District7,686-$12,876,420 2016Far North District5,405-$8,187,927 Kaipara District1,484-$2,364,688 Whangarei District7,941-$14,288,000 2017Far North District5,374-$8,436,605 Kaipara District1,467-$2,710,707 Whangarei District7,939-$15,003,728 2018Far North District5,400-$8,611,355 Kaipara District1,482-$2,714,431 Whangarei District7,930-$15,641,631 2019Far North District5,219-$8,875,443 Kaipara District1,397-$2,563,494 Whangarei District7,681-$15,151,745 2020Far North District8,346-$8,609,347 Kaipara District2,152-$2,527,519 Whangarei District12,671 -$15,482,455 2021Far North District4,984-$10,027,197 Kaipara District1,313-$2,850,901 Whangarei District7,324-$17,584,833 2022Far North District4,050-$4,067,996 Kaipara District1,058-$1,155,213 Whangarei District6,038-$7,034,389 Grand Total171685-$274,586,138 ZIP codes are as at 25/05/2022 as this data is static in our system and as up-to-date as possible.
