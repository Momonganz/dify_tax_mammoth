==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

You must enrol eligible new employees aged between 18 and 65 into KiwiSaver. It's an automatic enrolment. 

Check if your employee is in KiwiSaver already
----------------------------------------------

If your employee is already in KiwiSaver there's no need to auto-enrol them.

Ask them to fill in a KiwiSaver deduction - KS2 form.

The form tells you:

*   the rate to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their pay
*   if they're on a savings suspension (you'll need to see the notice before you stop their deductions).

Keep the KS2 for your records.

Give your employee your product disclosure statement
----------------------------------------------------

If the employee is joining:

*   your employer-chosen scheme, you give them their product disclosure statement
*   a default scheme, they'll get their product disclosure statement from us.

Send us your IR346K
-------------------

Fill in a New employee and KiwiSaver details – IR346K for each employee you're automatically enrolling. 

You can complete it in myIR or post it to the address on the form either:

*   before their first pay day
*   with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay.

Keep a copy for your records.
