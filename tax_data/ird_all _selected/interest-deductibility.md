Interest deductibility
======================

On 23 March, the Government announced that [deductions for interest expenses on rental properties will be restricted](/news/2021/2021-03-23-government-property-announcements)
 from 1 October 2021.

On 10 June, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue [released a public consultation document](/news/2021/2021-06-10-interest-deductibility-consultation-launched)
, _[Design of the interest limitation rule and additional bright-line rules](/publications/2021/2021-dd-interest-limitation-and-bright-line-rules)
,_ seeking feedback on a range of **design issues for implementing that proposal**, including:

*   Interest on a mortgage on a residential investment property (acquired **before 27 March 2021**) will be gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Other interest would immediately cease to be deductible from 1 October 2021.
*   Land outside New Zealand would be excluded from the new rule as would a number of other types of properties.
*   Exemptions are proposed for property developers and for owners of new builds. In addition, initial or early owners of new builds would be subject to a five year bright-line test, rather than the ten year test.

The proposals do not affect a person’s main home.

Summary sheets briefly outlining specific topics covered in the discussion document are available:
