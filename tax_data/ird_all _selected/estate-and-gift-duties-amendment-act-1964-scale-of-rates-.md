### Estate duty reduced - Budget proposals explained

### Budget announcement

In the course of his 1964 Budget Statement the Minister of Finance, the Hon HR Lake, announced reductions in estate duty which, it was hoped, would be an incentive to increase production. These reductions are being put into effect immediately and will be validated by legislation during this session of Parliament.

### The date from which the new scale of rates will apply

The new rates of estate duty will apply to the estates of all persons who die on or alter 25 June 1964.

### The Reductions effected by the new scale of rates

Under the new scale of rates the non liability limit has been raised from £2,000 to £4,000. This will mean that estates of a value not exceeding £4,000 will not be liable for any estate duty at all.

In the range of estates between £4,000 and £48,000 the existing rates have been reduced but estates of £48,000 or more will continue to be charged with duty at the rates which were introduced in 1961.
