Te tono i tētahi tau tāke ina noho ana i tāwāhi Living overseas - IRD number application
========================================================================================

If you'll be coming to New Zealand, you may want to apply for an [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
 as a new arrival when you get here. This way, you can give permission for Immigration New Zealand to share your documents and verification with us. It saves you from sending the same identification documents to us.

Otherwise, use the following steps if you're living overseas and you either:

*   are a non-resident who is not currently in New Zealand
*   are an [offshore person](/api/glossary/item?id={C27574DA-8DD9-4D59-8794-E560E12FE3BB})
    
*   recently left New Zealand and need to sort out your taxes here.

Gather your identification documents
------------------------------------

You'll need each of these:

*   photo identification (ID), such as a passport
*   proof of address, for example, a letter from your utilities company
*   tax identification number from your country or territory
*   proof of reason for applying for IRD number, for example, working here or buying property here
*   a fully functioning New Zealand bank account or [Customer due diligence - IR997](/api/glossary/item?id={AF686B0C-99FC-47C5-ACE7-7DFDBCC9548B})
     form.

We might be able to accept a different list of information proving your identity if you:

*   are an [offshore person](/api/glossary/item?id={C27574DA-8DD9-4D59-8794-E560E12FE3BB})
    
*   cannot get any of the documents proving your New Zealand bank account is fully functional - either IR997 or a bank statement, printout or letter with the information shown in IR984.

[Proof of identity](/topics/proof-of-identity)

  

If you’ve changed your name, you'll need a document proving your name change. This can be either a:

*   marriage or civil union certificate
*   name change certificate.

If applying for your child's IRD number
---------------------------------------

As well as ID documents for yourself, you'll also need:

*   ID for your child - the same documents as listed above
*   proof of your relationship with your child, for example, birth certificate, adoption papers or guardianship order.

Get certified translations for documents not in English
-------------------------------------------------------

If your identification (ID) documents are not in English, you must get them translated into English by an approved translator. Your translations will need to be certified. You can have ID documents translated overseas if using either:

*   a diplomatic representative at a high commission, embassy or consulate
*   the authority that issued your ID document.

Otherwise, Waka Kotahi - New Zealand Transport Agency has a full list of approved translators or you can use the Translation Service.
