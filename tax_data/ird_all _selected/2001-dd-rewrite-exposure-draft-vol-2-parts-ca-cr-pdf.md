Comment:This list alerts readers to other provisions in the legislation that may be of relevance to trading stock. There is currently no such cross reference. These other provisions are part of wider aspects – for example, the tax implications of amalgamation – and are therefore located in other Parts of the Act.

Comment:Payments for non-performance of covenants to maintain or repair under leases of land are identified as income in current section EN 1 (2) (Payments received for non-compliance with covenant to repair). Current section EN 1 also directs that such amounts are recognised as income in the income year of receipt, but allows recipients to spread the income over the subsequent 5 income years. Payments for non-performance with maintenance and repair covenants are now identified as income in this separate section in Part C (Income). This is consistent with the core provisions. The timing rule which allows recipients to allocate the income to subsequent income years is set out in separate timing rules in draft Part E (Timing and quantifying rules). They are draft sections EJ 2 (Payment to lessor for non-compliance with covenant for repair) and EJ 3 (Payment for non-compliance: when lessor ceases to own land).

Comment:This broad conceptual approach reflects the wording in the discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Parts C, D and E. It operates in conjunction with the rules to define a transfer of value, in draft section CD 4, and to define when a transfer is caused by a shareholding relationship, in draft section CD 5. Also, see the expanded definitions of ‘company’, ‘share’, and ‘shareholder’ in section OB 1 (Definitions) dealing with such matters as unit trusts and group investment funds. There is scope for debate about whether the shareholding should be ‘a’ cause or ‘the’ cause. CD 4 What is a transfer of value? General test (1) A transfer of value from a company to a person occurs when— (a)the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and (b)if the person provides any money or money’s worth to the company under the same arrangement, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. Release of debt (2)A transfer of value from a company to a person also occurs if the person is released from an obligation to pay money to the company, either by agreement or by operation of law. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (1A), (3), (10). (2) CF 2(1)(b). Defined terms:company, person, transfer of value. Comment:This broad conceptual approach sets aside a lot of the historical complexity of the Act’s current wording. Particular points to note are— (a)The reference to credits and so on in current section CF 2 (1)(a) is intended to be covered by the term ‘provides’ in draft subsection (1). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 63 (b)The making available by a shareholder of property to a company at an over-value is covered, whereas arguably it was not under current section CF 2 (1) (unless covered by current section CF 2 (1)(a) or (d)). (c) The inclusion of the provision of services under the new concept of transfer of value is also arguably a law change but any other approach would be illogical in policy terms. (Provision by a person of services to the company at an over-value may be covered by current section CF 2 (1)(a), in any event.). CD 5 When is a transfer caused by a shareholding relationship? General test (1)A transfer of value from a company to a person (the recipient) is caused by a shareholding in the company if— (a)the recipient— (i)holds shares in the company; or (ii)is associated with a shareholder; or (iii)is the trustee of a trust, and a beneficiary of the trust is either a shareholder or the spouse of a shareholder; and (b)the company makes the transfer because those shares are held by the relevant shareholder. One indication that test met (2)One indication that a transfer is caused by a shareholding is if the terms of the arrangement that results in the transfer are different from the terms on which the company would enter into a similar arrangement if no shareholding were involved. Past or future shareholding (3)When subsection (1) is applied, it does not matter whether the shares are held before or after the transfer of value occurs. Deductible distributions of producer boards (4)Despite subsection (1), a transfer of value by a statutory producer board to a member is not caused by a shareholding if— (a)the transfer is a cash distribution; and (b)the distribution is a deduction under section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) or another provision of this Act; and (c)the board does not choose to treat the distribution as a dividend under section ME 30 (Statutory producer board may determine to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 64 CD – Income from equity Deductible distributions of cooperative companies (5)Despite subsection (1), a transfer of value by a cooperative company to a shareholder is not caused by a shareholding if— (a)the transfer is a cash distribution; and (b)the distribution is a deduction under section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) or another provision of this Act; and (c)the company does not choose to treat the distribution as a dividend under section ME 35 (Cooperative company may make annual determination to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(k); new. (2) CF 2(2). (3) CF 2(1)(g). (4) CF 2(1)(l). (5) CF 2(1)(l). Defined terms:associated person, company, person, share, shareholder, statutory producer board, transfer of value, trustee. Comment:Draft subsection (1) incorporates the associated person tests in the current section CF 2 (1)(k). Draft subsections (4) and (5) appear to be necessary clarifications, given that both producer boards and cooperative companies are companies for all purposes of the Act, and it is currently only by implication that the section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) deduction overrides current section CF 2. CD 6 Bonus issues in lieu of dividend Bonus issue in lieu (1)A bonus issue in lieu is a dividend. Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is the money or money’s worth offered as an alternative, minus any resident withholding tax payable in relation to the dividend. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(f). (2) CF 2(6)(a). Defined terms:amount, bonus issue in lieu, dividend, pay, resident withholding tax.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 65 Form of election (2)A company chooses to treat a bonus issue as a dividend by— (a)resolving, when it makes the bonus issue, that it is a dividend; and (b)resolving, when it makes the bonus issue, the amount to be treated as a dividend, which must be more than zero; and (c)giving notice to the Commissioner under section 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election and the amount. Amount of dividend (3)The amount of the dividend is the amount chosen by the company. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(f). (2) CF 8. (3) CF 2(6)(b). Defined terms:amount, bonus issue, Commissioner, company, dividend, notice. Comment:Section 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 may need to be reviewed, as it seems unlikely that it applies in practice to all non-taxable bonus issues. CD 8 Notional distributions of producer boards and cooperative companies Notional distribution of producer board (1)A notional distribution of a statutory producer board is a dividend if the board determines to attach an imputation credit to the notional distribution under section ME 30 (Statutory producer board may determine to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated under section ME 33 (Notional distribution deemed to be dividend). Notional distribution of cooperative company (3)A notional distribution of a cooperative company is a dividend if the company determines to attach an imputation credit to the notional distribution under section ME 35 (Cooperative company may make annual determination to attach imputation credit to certain distributions).

Foreign tax credits (3)If a person is entitled to a tax credit under a double tax agreement when they derive a dividend, the amount of the dividend is increased by the tax credit. Notional foreign tax credits (4)If a person derives a dividend and the company fails to deduct from it the tax that must be deducted under the law of a foreign country, the dividend is increased by a notional foreign tax credit amount under section LC 7 (Dividend paid without deduction in full of foreign tax). Foreign tax refunds (5)When a person who has derived a dividend from outside New Zealand also derives a refund of income tax of a foreign country, the dividend is increased by the amount of the refund if— (a)the company paying the dividend was entitled to deduct the tax from the dividend; and (b)the person was not personally liable to pay the tax.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 67 Defined terms:amount, company, dividend, dividend withholding payment credit, double tax agreement, foreign tax, imputation credit, income tax, New Zealand, person, tax. Comment:Generally, current sections CF 6, CF 7, and parts of subpart LC seem to involve repetition, overlap, and anachronistic language. There is a need to revisit a significant part of the existing language. Draft subsection (2) attempts to clarify the places in the Act where the ‘dividend’ does not include the credit. It needs, ideally, to be made more specific. Draft subsection (3) aims to cover current section CF 6 (2) and (3). The reference specifically to the United Kingdom in current section CF 6 (2)(a) is omitted as the United Kingdom double tax agreement now covers the situation. Current section CF 6 (3) is omitted as it duplicates, but in a narrower form, current section CF 6 (2)(b). It is suggested that section LC 6 should also be reviewed for consistency with this section and the general tax credit rules in the Act. There is a query as to whether draft subsection (3) should apply only to credits that are not standard withholding tax credits. The latter would seem already to be included in the taxable dividend under general principles as income dealt with on a person’s behalf. Arguably, in any event, draft subsection (3) should apply only to amounts that are in fact either withholdings or refunds actually received from the foreign country. Draft subsection (4) is an acknowledgment that section LC 7 can apply to increase a dividend amount. However, it is suggested that section LC 7 be repealed as being obsolete and not applied in practice. Does draft subsection (5) overlap with draft subsection (3)? Current section CF 6 (5) is shifted to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see the consequential amendments in volume 3). CD 10 Non-cash benefits of shareholder-employees or directors Election under section CX 22: residual category fringe benefits (1)A non-cash benefit provided by a company to an employee is a dividend if— (a)the benefit is an unclassified benefit under section CX 23 (Unclassified benefits); and (b)the employee is a shareholder in the company; and (c)the company chooses to treat the benefit as a dividend under section CX 22 (2) (Benefits provided to employees who are shareholders or investors). Non-executive directors’ specific fringe benefits (2)A non-cash benefit provided by a company to a non-executive director of the company is a dividend if— (a)the benefit is not an unclassified benefit under section CX 23 (Unclassified benefits) but instead is one of the specified fringe benefits under sections CX 8 to CX 20; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 68 CD – Income from equity (b)the director is a shareholder in the company; and (c)the benefit is provided solely because the director is a non- executive director of the company. Other shareholder-employee benefits not dividends (3)In any other case of a non-cash benefit provided by a company to a person who is both an employee and a shareholder, the benefit is not a dividend if— (a)the application of section CX 22 (1) (Benefits provided to employees who are shareholders or investors) means it is a fringe benefit; and (b)section CD 20 accordingly excludes it from being a dividend. ‘Non-executive director’ defined (4)In this section, non-executive director means a person whose only services to the company as an employee are the formal occupation of the role of director and compliance with the associated statutory obligations. Origin:(1) CI 2A(2). (2) CF 2(1A); CI 2A(1). (3) new. (4) OB 1 ‘non-executive director shareholder’. Defined terms:company, director, dividend, non-executive director, person, shareholder, unclassified benefit. Comment:This section tries to clarify the way in which current sections CF 2 (1A), CF 3 (1)(g), CI 2 (1) to (3), and CI 2A interact to ‘tie-break’ the potential circularity between fringe benefit treatment and dividend treatment. There may need to be a similar ‘tie-break’ for cash benefits. The proposed definition of ‘employee’ (see the amendments to section OB 1 (Definitions) in volume 3) may need amending to specify that draft paragraph (d) applies for this purpose. CD 11 Attributed repatriations from controlled foreign companies Attributed repatriation is a dividend (1)Attributed repatriation of a person who has an income interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC) is a dividend. Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated under sections CD 32 to CD 39. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 69 Allocation of dividend (3)The dividend is treated as having been paid by the CFC to the person, and as having been derived by the person,— (a)six months after the end of the relevant accounting period of the CFC if the person is a company for which the dividend is exempt income under section CW 9 (Dividend derived by company from offshore); and (b) at the end of the accounting period in any other case. Dividend treated as derived while person New Zealand resident (4)The dividend of a person who has ceased to be a New Zealand resident is treated as being derived while the person is a New Zealand resident. Origin:(1) CF 2(16)(a). (2) new. (3) CF 2(16)(b). (4) CG 8(13).

CD 12 Returns of capital: off-market share cancellations When this section applies (1)This section applies if a company pays an amount to a shareholder because of the off-market cancellation of a share in the company (other than on liquidation of the company). Ordering rule if bright line test met (2)The amount is not a dividend to the extent to which it is less than or equal to the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the ordering rule, if— (a)one of the bright line tests in subsection (3) is met; and (b)the company is not an unlisted trust that has chosen the slice rule for the share under subsection (4); and (c)the anti-avoidance rule in subsection (6) does not apply. Bright line tests (3)The bright line tests referred to in subsection (2)(a) are as follows: (a)the cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation that results in a fifteen percent capital reduction for the company: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 70 CD – Income from equity (b)the cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation that involves a ten percent capital reduction and the Commissioner has given a clearance notice under subsection (8): (c)the cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation and results in the shareholder suffering a fifteen percent interest reduction: (d)the company is an unlisted trust and the cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation: (e)the share is a non-participating redeemable share. Unlisted trust choosing slice rule (4)If the company is an unlisted trust, it may issue a share on terms that the ordering rule does not apply and that instead the slice rule applies to the cancellation. If this happens, the amount paid is not a dividend to the extent to which it is less than or equal to the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule (but still subject to the anti- avoidance rule in subsection (6)). Calculation concession for foreign unlisted widely-held trusts (5)If a company is an unlisted widely-held trust not resident in New Zealand and a shareholder cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate the available subscribed capital per share under the ordering rule, the share is treated as if it were issued under subsection (4) on terms that the slice rule applies and the available subscribed capital under the slice rule is equal to the amount paid for the issue of the share. Overriding anti-avoidance rule (6)Neither subsection (2) nor subsection (4) excludes an amount paid by a company on cancellation of a share from being a dividend if any part of the payment is in lieu of the payment of a dividend. Factors relevant in applying anti-avoidance rule (7)For the purposes of applying subsection (6), the following factors must be considered: (a)the nature and amount of dividends paid by the company before or after the cancellation; and (b)the issue of shares in the company after the cancellation; and (c)the expressed purpose or purposes of the cancellation; and (d)any other relevant factor. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 71 Commissioner notifying view (8)If the Commissioner is satisfied that no part of a payment on cancellation of a share is in lieu of the payment of a dividend, the Commissioner may give notice to the company that the Commissioner does not regard subsection (6) as applicable to the cancellation. Definitions for this section (9)In this section,— counted associate means — (a)a person associated with the shareholder other than merely by virtue of being a relative; or (b)a person associated with the shareholder merely by virtue of being a spouse or minor child of the shareholder, or a trustee for a spouse or minor child of the shareholder fifteen percent capital reduction means the circumstance in which the total amount paid by the company on account of the cancellation (or on account of any other pro rata cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time) is at least 15% of the market value of all participating shares in the company at the time the company first gave notice to shareholders of the cancellation fifteen percent interest reduction means the circumstance in which, immediately after and as a result of the cancellation (together with any other cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time),— (a)the total direct voting interests in the company of the shareholder and any counted associates is not more than 85% of their total direct voting interests in the company immediately before the cancellation; and (b)if at the time of the cancellation a market value circumstance exists, the total direct market value interests in the company of the shareholder and any counted associates is not more than 85% of their total direct market value interests immediately before the cancellation non-participating redeemable share means a share that meets the following conditions: (a)the share is issued, under the company’s constitution or establishing legislation, on terms that involve the share being required or allowed to be redeemed or repaid before the company is liquidated; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 72 CD – Income from equity (b)the share is— (i)a redeemable share under section 66 of the Companies Act 1955, section 68 of the Companies Act 1993, or an equivalent provision of foreign law; or (ii)issued under Part 1A of the Dairy Board Act 1961 or one of New Zealand’s Acts relating to cooperative companies; or (iii)subject to section FC 1 (Floating rate of interest on debentures) or section FC 2 (Interest on debentures issued in substitution for shares); or (iv)a unit in a unit trust that is not a widely-held trust; and (c)the share is either a fixed rate share or a share for which the amount payable on cancellation is not more than the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule; and (d)the shareholder does not have shareholder decision-making rights in relation to the share except— (i)a protective right; or (ii)if the company is the New Zealand Dairy Board or is subject to one of New Zealand’s Acts relating to cooperative companies participating share means a share that is not a non-participating redeemable share protective right means a shareholder decision-making right that— (a)arises only if the shareholder’s position may be altered to the shareholder’s detriment or if the company defaults on its obligations under the terms of the share; and (b)is granted to the shareholder only to assist the shareholder to prevent the alteration or to remedy the default; and (c)when the share issued, is not expected to arise ten percent capital reduction means the circumstance in which the total amount paid by the company on account of the cancellation (or paid on account of any other pro rata cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time) is at least 10% of the market value of all participating shares in the company at the time the company first gave notice to shareholders of the cancellation unlisted trust means a unit trust or group investment fund, the units or interests in which are not quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange.

Comment:Including non-participating redeemable shares as one of the bright line tests in draft subsection (3) is done to simplify the drafting. It seems debatable whether the additional requirements in draft subsection (3)(a) to (c) for there to be or not be a pro rata cancellation are necessary. CD 13 Ordering rule and slice rule Ordering rule (1) Under the ordering rule, the available subscribed capital per share is calculated for a share using the formula— available subscribed capital of class shares being cancelled of class.

Reversion to on-market cancellation treatment (3)Subsections (5) to (7) of this section apply in the case of an acquisition of a share to which subsection (1) or subsection (2) has applied if— (a)before the first anniversary of the acquisition, the company cancels the share; or (b)at the first anniversary, the company has failed to transfer a share of the same class in an arm’s length transfer, except if the company is established under New Zealand cooperative company legislation or is the New Zealand Dairy Board; or (c)after the first anniversary, the company cancels the share, and the company is established under New Zealand cooperative company legislation or is the New Zealand Dairy Board.

Defined terms:amount, company, dividend, person, shareholder, transfer of value. CD 26 Calculation of dividend amount of property made available How section applies (1)This section applies to determine the amount of a dividend that arises under section CD 3 because a company makes property available to a person. Amount calculated quarterly (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated for each quarter during which the property is made available. Date when amount is treated as paid (3)The amount of the dividend calculated for a quarter is treated as being paid by the company to the person and as being derived by the person 6 months after the end of the company’s income year. However, if the company gives notice to the shareholder on an earlier date of the amount of the dividend for that quarter, the amount is treated as being paid and derived on that earlier date instead. Using FBT rules (4)Unless the property made available is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the value of the fringe benefit for that quarter calculated under the FBT rules as if— (a)making the property available were the provision of a fringe benefit by the company to an employee in relation to employment, despite anything in sections CX 8 to CX 34; and (b)the company were not to choose to pay fringe benefit tax on an income year basis under section ND 14 (Payment of fringe benefit tax on income year basis for shareholder-employees). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 85 Using difference from benchmark rate (5)If the property made available is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the excess (if any) of interest, calculated for the quarter on the basis of the daily balance of the loan and the benchmark rate specified in subsections (6) to (8), over the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan in the quarter. However, the company may choose instead to calculate the dividend as the excess of the benchmark interest rate amount over the amount of income accruing to the company in the quarter calculated under the yield to maturity method. Benchmark rate: FBT rate for certain loans (6)For the purposes of subsection (5), the benchmark rate of interest is the prescribed rate of interest (the rate generally applicable under the FBT rules) if— (a)all amounts payable to the company for the loan are expressed in New Zealand dollars; and (b)either the borrower is not a company or, if the borrower is another company, the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection is to apply to the loan and the quarter. Setting benchmark rate (7)For the purposes of subsection (5), the benchmark rate is the rate set by the Commissioner if— (a)all amounts payable to the company in relation to the loan are payable in a single currency other than New Zealand dollars; and (b)the Commissioner has set a benchmark rate for that currency; and (c)either the borrower is not a company or, if the borrower is another company, the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection is to apply to the loan and the quarter. Default benchmark rate (8)For the purposes of subsection (5), if neither subsection (6) nor subsection (7) applies, the benchmark rate of interest is a market rate determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms between persons at arm’s length. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 86 CD – Income from equity Daily loan balance: certain repayments backdated (9)For the purposes of subsection (5), in determining the daily balance of a loan during an income year, an amount repaid during the year is treated as having been applied in repayment of the loan at the start of the company’s income year or, if later, the day the loan was made, if— (a)the amount is repaid by applying any salary, wages, extra pay, dividends, or interest payable by the company to the borrower; and (b)the amount payable by the company is income of the borrower for the income year or a previous year; and (c)the amount payable by the company is payable without any tax deduction under the PAYE rules, the RWT rules, or the NRWT rules. Daily loan balance: company nominating amount (10)Subject to subsection (9), for the purposes of subsection (5), the daily balance of the loan for an income year is treated as being equal to the notional balance chosen under subsection (11) by the company making the loan if— (a)the borrower is a company; and (b)the loan is a variable principal debt instrument; and (c)the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection applies for the loan and the income year; and (d)the amount of the dividend calculated as a result for the loan, the borrower, and the income year is not more than 30% greater or less than the amount that would be calculated if this section did not apply. Notional balance options (11)The notional balance referred to in subsection (10) is whichever of the following is chosen by the company making the loan and notified to the Commissioner: (a)the average of the outstanding balances of the loan at the end of each month in the company’s income year: (b)the average of— (i)the outstanding balance of the loan at the start of the income year or the first time during the year at which the loan exists, whichever is later; and (ii)the outstanding balance of the loan at the end of the income year or the last time during the income year at which the loan exists, whichever is earlier.

No double counting of attributed repatriation dividends (13)No amount of dividend arises under section CD 3 as a result of any difference between the interest (if any) payable by a person to a controlled foreign company (CFC) in an accounting period of the CFC under a loan and the benchmark rate of interest specified in subsections (6) to (8) if— (a)the outstanding balance of the loan at the end of the account period is taken into account under sections CD 33 to CD 39 in calculating the New Zealand repatriation amount of the CFC for the accounting period; and (b)as a result, the person derives a dividend under section CD 11. Subsection (13) does not apply if loan disregarded (14)Subsection (13) does not apply to the extent to which the loan is a loan to which: (a)section CD 37 (11) applies, meaning that the loan is disregarded for the accounting period; or (b)section CZ 10 (4) (Transitional relief for calculation of attributed repatriation dividends) applies, meaning that the loan is effectively disregarded for the accounting period.

Comment:Various related definitions from current sections OB 1 and CF 3 (14) are reunited. These provisions include several corrections. In draft subsection (13)(d), the words ‘in addition to issuing shares in the acquiring company’ replace the current section CF 3(14) reference to ‘which is not in the form of shares in the acquired company’. The latter words seem not to make any logical sense and appear to have been an error made in 1994. To rectify another error made in 1994, draft subsection (24) now applies for the purposes of defining available subscribed capital, whereas it does not in current section CF 3 (14). In draft subsection (26), the current reference to crediting the amount in the books of another company has been omitted as it seems unnecessary. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 98 CD – Income from equity CD 31 Available capital distribution amount Rules for calculating available capital distribution amount (1)For a share (the share) on liquidation of the company, the available capital distribution amount per share is calculated using the formula— capital gains + (capital property distributed – cost) – capital losses (receipt – asc per share) x total receipts – total asc per share.

Capital gains amount: when a capital gain amount arises (7)For the purposes of this section, a company derives a capital gain amount if,— (a)after 31 March 1988, it disposes of capital property for an amount of consideration that is more than the cost of the property to the company; the capital gain amount is the excess; or (b)after 31 March 1988, it receives a gift and no part is the income of the company; the capital gain amount is the amount of the gift; or (c)before 1 April 1988, a net profit or gain is derived by the company to which section 4 (5) of the Income Tax Act 1976, and not section 4 (5A) of the Income Tax Act 1976, applied immediately before those provisions were repealed by section 31 (1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988; or (d)an amount is derived by the company from another company on liquidation of the other company that is excluded from being a dividend as a result of section CD 16 (2)(b) and this section; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 100 CD – Income from equity (e)an amount is derived by the company that is attributable to— (i)a deduction allowed in the 1985-86 or 1986-87 income year for livestock under section 86E of the Income Tax Act 1976; or (ii)a revaluation of livestock in any of the 1986-87 to 1991- 92 income years under section 86A of the Income Tax Act 1976; or (iii)a revaluation of livestock in the 1992-93 or a later income year under section 86D of the Income Tax Act 1976 or section ED 11 (Valuation under herd scheme) or section ED 15 (Herd livestock disposed of before values set); or (iv)a deduction allowed in the 1988-89 income year for the revaluation of trading stock of wine, brandy, and whisky under section 87A of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the section EZ 2 that was in this Act immediately before the section was repealed by the Income Tax Amendment Act 2002. Capital gains amount: amalgamated company inheriting gain of amalgamating company (8)An amalgamated company is treated as deriving a capital gain amount at the time of the amalgamation equal to a capital gain amount of an amalgamating company to the extent to which— (a)the amalgamating company ceases to exist on the amalgamation; and (b)the amalgamating company’s capital gain amount was available for distribution at the time and was not distributed to anyone other than the amalgamated company. Capital losses amount: when a capital loss arises (9)For the purposes of this section, a company incurs a capital loss if it disposes of capital property for an amount of consideration less than the cost of the property to the company. The capital loss amount is the deficit. No gains or losses in related party transactions (10)Subject to subsection (11), no capital gain amount is derived or capital loss amount is incurred by a company after 31 March 1988 on disposing of property under an arrangement with a related person.

Reinvested exempt dividends (12)When a capital gain amount, a capital loss amount, or the cost of capital property is determined, the cost of any shares subscribed for by the company in another company does not include any consideration for the subscribed shares that is excluded from the available subscribed capital of the other company under section CD 30 (7)(b) or (8) (which relate to reinvestment of tax exempt dividends). Amounts written up (13)When a capital gain amount, a capital loss amount, or the cost of capital property is determined, the cost of the relevant capital property is increased to the extent to which— (a) the value of the property is written up in the company’s books; and (b) because it was attributed to the write-up— (i)an amount paid before 11 June 1965 has been excluded by section 4 (3) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 from treatment as a dividend; or (ii)an issue of a share before 1 April 1988 has been excluded by section 3 (3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 from treatment as a bonus issue. ‘Related person’ defined (14)For the purposes of subsections (10) and (11), a person is a related person of a company (the first company) if— (a)the person owns, can control (directly or indirectly), or has the right to acquire 20% or more of the first company’s ordinary shares; or (b)the person owns, can control (directly or indirectly), or has the right to acquire 20% or more of the voting rights of shareholders in the first company; or (c)the person is a company and the first company owns, can control (directly or indirectly), or has the right to acquire 20% or more of the ordinary shares in the person; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 102 CD – Income from equity (d)the person is a company and the first company owns, can control (directly or indirectly), or has the right to acquire 20% or more of the voting rights of shareholders in the company; or (e)the person is a company and 20% or more of the shares or voting rights in the person are owned or controlled by persons that also own, control, or have the right to acquire 20% or more of the shares or voting rights in the first company; or (f)the person is a partner or co-venturer of the first company; or (g)the person is the trustee of a trust and the first company, or a person who is a related person of the first company under this subsection, benefits or can benefit under the trust (directly or indirectly); or (h)the person is a partnership and one or more persons, that are related persons of the first company under this subsection, are entitled to 50% or more of the partnership’s assets or profits or are able to control the partnership.

Look-through interposed companies (16)For the purposes of subsection (14)(e), if shares or voting rights in a company are owned or controlled by another company, a look-through approach must be applied, meaning that— (a)the shares or voting rights are treated as if owned or controlled by the shareholders in the other company; and (b)if a shareholder in the other company is a company, that shareholder’s portion of the shares or voting rights are treated as if owned or controlled by the shareholders in the shareholder company. The look-through approach must be applied in the same way to any chain of companies, whatever the length of the chain. ‘Capital property’ defined (17)In this section, capital property means property of the company that is not revenue account property.

Comment:With regard to draft subsection (2)(c), as recognised at the time of the 1994 company law reforms, the concept of ‘available for distribution’ is vague and places reliance on a company’s accounting procedures (if any) for distinguishing capital gain amounts and identifying when they may previously have been distributed. However, the only obvious alternative is to have a detailed set of ordering rules. The formula in the current definition of excess return amount has been made much longer and uses more variables. However, this simply reflects the fact that the current definition includes some necessary calculation steps in the narrative. Draft subsection (3) is intended to prevent a negative amount arising if the available subscribed capital exceeds the amount received. Currently, this is achieved by the opening words of the definition which refer only to the ‘excess’. However, note that it would be possible for (capital asset – cost) to be negative, whereas currently item e of the formula cannot be as it is only the excess of capital asset over cost and losses. Arguably, a negative result is not inappropriate, that is, if there are unrealised undistributed capital losses, these should offset realised capital gains. With regard to draft subsection (5), it would be preferable to have one simple set of rules for offset of capital loss amounts which could fit into the formula, rather than two separate rules in this subsection and in item ‘capital losses’ of the formula. The only reason for separate specialised rules is that both current section CF 3 (10) and item (e)(ii) of the definition of ‘excess return amount’ apply only to certain specified preceding income years. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 104 CD – Income from equity Draft subsection (7) replicates old section 3 (7) and the definition of ‘capital gain amount’ in section OB 1. It links into the ‘capital property’ definition – see draft subsection (17). Arguably, these provisions need to be rewritten fully anyway, ideally adopting a ‘gross-gross’ format. It would be preferable to omit the reference to 31 March 1988 and make draft subsection (7)(a) and (b) generally applicable. The reference in draft subsection (7) to the Income Tax Amendment Act 2002 is a reference to the Act that will implement the rewrite of Parts A to E. Ideally, draft subsection (14), and the following two related subsections, should be repealed. Instead of draft subsection (10) referring to a ‘related person’ of the company, there should just be a reference to ‘associated person’, probably just using the standard definition of associated person in the Act. The current concept of ‘related person’ was introduced in 1982 as an anti-avoidance measure.

CQ 2 When attributed CFC income arises General rule (1)A person has attributed CFC income from a foreign company in an income year if all the following apply: (a)the foreign company is a controlled foreign company (CFC) at any time during one of its accounting periods, under the rules in sections EI 1 to EI 7: (b)the accounting period ends during the income year: (c)the person has an income interest in the foreign company for the accounting period, under the rules in sections EI 8 to EI 13: (d)the person is a New Zealand resident at any time during the accounting period: (e)the person’s income interest is 10% or more for the accounting period, under the rules in sections EI 14 to EI 16: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CQ – Attributed income from foreign equity 139 (f)the CFC has branch equivalent income for the accounting period, under the rules in section EI 21 (Branch equivalent income or loss: calculation rules) (or the special rule in section EI 19 (If CFC derives taxable distribution from non- qualifying trust) applies because the CFC gets a distribution from a non-qualifying trust): (g)the CFC is not an unqualified grey list CFC for the accounting period, under the rules in section EI 22 (Unqualified grey list CFCs).

Comment:Draft subsection (1)(d) is superfluous, technically, as the person’s income interest could never exceed 10% if they were never resident in New Zealand. Arguably, it would be simpler if the additional attributed CFC income under draft section EI 44 (4) (Comparative value method) were FIF income, because it is subject to a separate tax rate anyway.
