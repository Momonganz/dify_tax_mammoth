If we've sent you an IR3 return pack, you must complete the return and send it to us by 7 July 2018, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. If you don't need to file a return but you'd like to talk to someone about your tax situation, you can call us. To help you work out if you need to file an IR3, go to www.ird.govt.nz and complete the questionnaire "Work out my income tax filing options" or call us on 0800 377 774. Note If you received any other income apart from salary, wages, interest, dividends (see further information below), and/or taxable Māori authority distributions, you must file an IR3 return. There are some exceptions. If you received personal service rehabilitation payments and are an ACC client or caregiver (who received payments from the client or ACC), please read page 52. If you had a workplace injury your employer may manage these payments instead of ACC. If you or your caregiver receives these payments, regardless of who makes them, you'll need to read the information on page 52. Note Other income includes: •self-employed income (see children's exempt income below) •over $200 of schedular payments •income derived overseas – calculated taxable income arising from a withdrawal or transfer from foreign superannuation schemes acquired while a non-resident of New Zealand •over $200 in total of: –interest derived overseas (if it's had tax deducted or not) –dividends of certain Australian resident listed companies and other overseas investments that are not treated as part of foreign investment funds (FIF) income - see page 20 –income attributed to you from your portfolio investment entity (PIE) where the income had the 0% rate applied, or where you had tax calculated by your PIE at a rate lower than your correct prescribed investor rate (PIR) during the year. If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR, you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. Note the dividends will need to be acknowledged for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) and/or Student Loan purposes. •FIF income •rental income •estate, trust or partnership income •royalties •cash jobs or "under the table" payments •income from illegal enterprises •income without PAYE deducted, such as shareholder-employee salary or a claim received under a taxable loss of earnings policy. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE6 You'll also need to file an IR3 if you: •have losses to claim or brought forward from the previous year •have excess imputation credits brought forward from the previous year •left or arrived in New Zealand part-way through the year and are required to receive a personal tax summary (PTS) or file a return •are filing a return for a deceased person to the date of death if there is a requirement to file a return for this income year •were declared bankrupt and required to receive a PTS or file a return •changed your balance date part-way through the year. Children's exempt income Read this information if for the tax year you: •were 14 or under, or •were 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or •turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\* \* including a school for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The following income is required to have tax taken out before you receive it: •salary or wages •schedular payments •interest •dividends, and •Māori authority distributions. If you only receive these types of income you will not need to file an IR3. However, if you are required to file an IR3 return this income needs to be included. If you receive income that has not had tax taken out before you receive it eg: •worked as a self-employed person, •worked around the home of a neighbour or family friend, and that work was not part of a business that they carry on, or •beneficiary income from a trust, such as a testamentary trust (a trust set up from an estate of a deceased person), that is not listed above as requiring to have tax taken out and your total income from these sources is less than $2,340 for the tax year, this income is exempt from tax and is not included in your return. You are not required to file a return just because you earn this type of income. If you earn $2,340 or more, the exemption does not apply and you will need to file a return and pay tax on all the income, not just the amount that exceeds the exemption. If you have to file a return but we haven't sent you an IR3, you must request and file it by 7 July 2018, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. Please call 0800 257 773 to request an IR3 return. Remember to have your IRD number with you. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Extension of time If circumstances beyond your control will prevent you from sending in your return on time, call us on 0800 377 774 and we may grant you an extension. If you have a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2019 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. Are there any penalties? You may face penalties and prosecution if you: •are required to put in a return but don't •give false or misleading information (including not showing all your income) •leave out details on purpose so the information is misleading •file your return late. Income year The information in this guide is based on the tax year from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. If your income year is different you can still use this guide, but work out your income and expenses for your income year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE8 Using this guide Did you know you can also file your return online? Go to www.ird.govt.nz and login to myIR secure online services. The form will prepopulate with your personal details and earnings information. Before you start filling in the return make sure you have: •any interest or dividend statements •any taxable Māori authority distribution statements •any other income details, such as overseas, rental property, farming or business income •your 2018 Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) letter, if you applied for WfFTC from Inland Revenue. The questions in this guide are in the same order as the questions on the return. Don't use anyone else's preprinted return because it's precoded with their own IRD number. Questions 1 to 5 Personal information This information helps us to contact you. Please make sure we have your details exactly right. If you've changed your name or address, please update the information in the spaces provided on the return. Postal address If you use your agent's postal address leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know if they've changed their address. If your address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby, please contact New Zealand Post. Date of birth We ask for this so we don't mix up people with the same name. Question 6 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you're unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837 for more help. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. If you don't complete your BIC code, ACC will select one on your behalf. This may mean your ACC levy rate could be incorrect. Note 9 www.ird.govt.nz Question 8 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two boxes. Question 9 Adjustments to your income If you have a student loan or you are eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC), you may be required to include adjustments to your income. This is so that Inland Revenue can correctly assess your student loan repayment obligation and ensure you receive your correct WfFTC entitlement. To notify Inland Revenue about your income adjustments you can: •tick 9A on your IR3 and complete an Adjust your income (IR215) form and attach it to page 3 of your return or •log in to your myIR secure online services account and complete it there or •call us on 0800 227 774 and tell us what your adjustments are. If you don't have an IR215 form you can: •download it from our website www.ird.govt.nz or •call us on 0800 257 773. What do I need to do to receive my entitlement? If you haven't already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, either go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: working for families) and register online, or complete a Working for Families Tax Credits registration form (FS1) and return it to us. When we've received the registration form we'll send you a letter with all your family details for you to check. Please correct and return it to us if the details are incorrect. If you've already registered for WfFTC and you need to file an IR3, we'll send you a letter by the beginning of May with all your family details on it. Please check this information and return the form with your IR3 if the details are incorrect. Question 10 Non-residents and transitional residents Non-residents If you were away from New Zealand for a total of 325 days in any 12-month period and don't have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, you may be a non-resident. Read our guide New Zealand tax residence (IR292) to find out your status. If you weren't present in New Zealand and are a non-resident for a full year, but you received income from New Zealand, you may need to complete an IR3NR return instead. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE10 Transitional residents If you became a New Zealand tax resident during the year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 and you've elected not to be treated as a transitional resident, you have to complete an IR3 declaring your worldwide income from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. Transitional residents don't have to declare their foreign-sourced income except for foreign employment income and foreign services income. If you were a non-resident for part of the year, complete Question 37 on your return. If your return isn't for a full year, we'll calculate your tax and income-related tax credits and let you know the result - see www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2006/2006-81/2006-81-exempt-transitionals/ for further information. 11 www.ird.govt.nz Your income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, salary, wages or schedular payments, the information you need to complete Questions 11, 11A and 12 will be on your Summary of earnings (SOE), which we'll send you in late May 2018. We send this automatically if we send you an IR3 return. Your SOE contains the following information: •all your employers throughout the year •your total gross income with tax deducted and ACC earners' levy paid •any family tax credit paid by Work and Income •your tax credits for payroll donations you've made through payroll giving. Question 11 Family tax credit from Work and Income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, copy the amount from your SOE to Box 11. Don't include any Working for Families Tax Credits from Inland Revenue in Box 11. Question 11A Income with tax deducted Did you receive any of these types of income with tax deducted between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018? •salary or wages •a student allowance •any income-tested benefit - unemployment or sickness, transitional retirement, independent youth, domestic purposes, widow's, invalid's or emergency •accident compensation payments related to earnings •New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super) either income-tested or non-income tested, or a veteran's pension •other pensions, annuities or superannuation (read "Pensions" on page 14) •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme (also known as a share purchase agreement). Note: it is up to your employer whether they deduct tax on these or not •shareholder-employee salary. If you received any of these types of income with tax deducted, you need to copy the totals from your SOE to Question 11A. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you (or an associate) received free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme the taxable value will be included on your SOE as long as your employer has provided us with this information. In most cases your employer will have provided this information but if they haven’t you will need to show the taxable value at Question 24. You will need to check with your employer whether this information has been provided. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE12 What to show on your return Copy the total amounts from your SOE to the corresponding boxes (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E) on your return. Amending your income details If any of the details on your SOE are incorrect (eg, wrong or missing employers), please make the changes on your SOE and attach it to page 3 of your return. You only need to attach your SOE to page 3 of your return if you've made changes to it. Please transfer the amended totals from your SOE to the corresponding boxes on your return and use the worksheet on page 13 to calculate your total tax deducted (11E). ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work related injuries, based on their earnings. We collect this on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The maximum amount of earners' levy is $1,755.37. The earners' levy is set at a rate of 1.39% (1.39 cents in the dollar). If you need to amend your employment details on your SOE, you'll need to recalculate your earners' levy. Using employer-provided information If you received payslips or other earnings information from your employer, you can use this information to complete your return and don't have to wait for your SOE. You don't include schedular payments in this calculation. You'll need to use your total PAYE deducted in your calculations. This is the amount of PAYE shown on your payslips before any tax credits for payroll donations are deducted. If you made donations through payroll giving to an organisation that is not on Inland Revenue's approved donee organisations list, you won't be able to keep the tax credits you received and you won't have paid enough PAYE throughout the year. You'll have either received a letter telling you about these extinguished tax credits or they'll show on your summary of earnings. Put the total PAYE, less the amount of your extinguished tax credits, in Box 11A. If the amount of total PAYE deducted isn't clear from your payslips: •contact your employer, or •refer to your SOE for details, or •refer to "Account information" in myIR, or •call us on 0800 227 774. 13 www.ird.govt.nz You'll need to calculate your ACC earners' levy liability and deduct it from your total PAYE, using the worksheet below. Worksheet for ACC earners' levy Copy your total taxable earnings from salary and wages to Box 1. Copy the amount to Box 11B of your return. 1 Copy your taxable earnings from salary and wages that are not liable for earners' levy to Box 2. See below for a list of income not liable. Copy this amount to Box 11C of your return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print the answer in Box 3. If the answer exceeds the maximum liable earnings of $126,286, print $126,286 in Box 3. 3 This is your liable income for ACC earners' levy Multiply Box 3 by 0.0139 (1.39%). Print your answer in Box 4. This is your ACC earners' levy. Copy this amount to Box 11D of your return. 4 Copy your total PAYE from salary and wages to Box 5. Copy this amount to Box 11A of your return. 5 Copy your total ACC earners' levy from Box 4 (above) to Box 6. 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 and print the answer in Box 7. 7 This is your total tax deducted. Copy this amount to Box 11E of your return. The following income isn't liable for ACC earners' levy -NZ Super-income from a partnership earned by a non-working partner in that partnership -income-tested benefits -non-taxable allowances-pensions from superannuation schemes not registered with the Financial Markets Authority -student allowances -veteran's pension-overseas pensions -living alone payments-rents -redundancy payments-estate and trust income -retiring allowances-royalties -jury and witness fees-income attributed to you from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) -interest and dividends -taxable Māori authority distributions-income arising from a withdrawal from foreign superannuation schemes. -free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE14 Pensions Don't include the following pensions or annuities in your tax return: •non-taxable pensions or annuities from either life insurance funds or superannuation schemes registered with the Financial Markets Authority (eg, Government Superannuation) •pensions that are completely tax-free, such as war pensions (other than a veteran's pension). Any overseas social security pension you receive is taxable. Include it at Question 17 (see the notes on page 23). If you receive a United Kingdom national retirement pension and have joined the special banking option operated by Work and Income, include the income and tax deducted at Question 11A. For more information about overseas pensions read page 23. Question 12 Schedular payments Schedular payments are generally payments made to people who are not employees but are employed on a contract basis. All ACC personal service rehabilitation payments which are paid by ACC or your employer are classified as schedular payments. Different tax rates apply to schedular payments, depending on the work done. A full list is available in the PAYE tables (IR340 and IR341) and on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C). People who receive schedular payments will receive a summary of earnings (SOE) detailing their schedular payments received and the tax deducted. If your SOE shows total schedular income over $200, you must file an IR3 return. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12. Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments Show any expenses you can claim against this income here. Don't include it with other expenses at Question 26. Question 12D Net schedular payments This is the total gross schedular payments shown at Box 12B, less any expenses being claimed at Box 12C. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Include the amount of tax loss in Box 12D. What to show on your return Copy the total tax deducted (Box 12A) and gross payments (Box 12B) from your SOE to the same box numbers of your return. Add up the expenses related to your schedular payments and print the total in Box 12C. Subtract Box 12C from Box 12B and print the result in Box 12D. 15 www.ird.govt.nz If you're registered for GST, your gross schedular payment may include GST. Enter the GST-exclusive amount at Question 12B. Note Shareholder-employee salary If you received a shareholder-employee salary with no PAYE deducted, show the amount at Question 21. ACC levies You'll have to pay ACC levies on schedular payments. ACC will invoice you for these. Question 13 New Zealand interest Did you receive any New Zealand interest between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 from: •banks •Inland Revenue •building and investment societies •credit unions •securities •a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust •loans you've made? If so, show all the New Zealand interest you received at Question 13B. If the interest is from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust please tick Box 13C. If you were charged commission on any of your interest, claim this at Question 26. Read the note about expenses on page 32. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have "negative interest" to account for. This is interest you've repaid on the term deposit. It may reduce the amount of interest you need to declare on your tax return. If you broke the term deposit in full, use the worksheet below to deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on your Deduction certificate for RWT on interest (IR15) or equivalent statement. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your IR15 to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Include this in the amount shown at Box 13B. 3 IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE16 RWT During the year, RWT will have been deducted from some or all of your interest and you can claim a credit for this. The interest payer will usually send you an IR15 or similar statement which shows the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Add up the amounts from each statement or certificate and print the totals in Boxes 13A and 13B. Don't send us your statements or IR15s, but keep them in case we need to see them later. Interest of $50 or less If the interest you received for the year is $50 or less, you may not receive a certificate or statement, but you still need to show the gross interest and RWT. Get the details from your bank statements. Interest on joint accounts If you hold a joint account, you must show your share of the interest in your tax return. Interest from overseas If you received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show it at Question 17. Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Farm vendor mortgage or finance bonds If you received interest from a farm vendor mortgage or farm vendor finance bonds approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand, only half of the interest is taxable. Show the RWT deducted and the taxable amount of interest in Boxes 13A and 13B. Income from financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To determine whether a spreading method must be used, see "Financial arrangements" on page 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. Any RWT will have to be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Interest paid by Inland Revenue If we pay you interest because you overpaid your tax, include the gross interest in Box 13B in the income year you received the interest. Interest paid by a person If you paid us interest because you underpaid your tax, include it as a deduction in the return at Question 26 for the income year the interest is paid. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Question 14 New Zealand dividends Dividends are a part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes and unit trust distributions are treated as dividends. Complete Question 14 if you received any New Zealand dividends between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, including dividends from your local electricity or gas company (but don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax-free). The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Include dividends earned by a partnership or estate, or distributed by a trust. If you were charged commission on any of your dividends, claim this at Question 26. Read the notes about expenses on page 32. If you receive dividends from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate, you can decide whether or not to include the dividends in your return. Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits so the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. If the dividend is from a listed PIE, it should not have RWT deducted. What to show on your return Your dividend statements show the amount: •you received (net dividend) •of any imputation credit •of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your gross dividend. Add up all the imputation credits, RWT credits and gross dividend totals and transfer them to the relevant boxes at Question 14. If the dividends are from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust, please tick Box 14C. Don't send us your dividend statements, but keep them in case we ask for them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE18 Shares and other non-cash dividends If you received shares from a taxable bonus issue or a non-cash dividend , include them as income at Question 14. Dividends from overseas Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Question 15 Māori authority distributions Complete Question 15 if you received taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and includes tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits. What to show on your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: •the distribution made to you, including which portion is taxable and which portion isn't •the Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, to the relevant boxes at Question 15. For more information read our guide Māori authorities (IR487). Question 16 Estate or trust income If you received estate or trust income that relates to the year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, show it at Question 16. There are three types of estates or trusts: •complying •foreign •non-complying. Complying trusts are trusts that have been taxed in New Zealand on all their income since the day they started. Allocations of beneficiary income which the minor beneficiary rule applies to are taxed as trustee income. This means the trust is subject to tax on this income at 33 cents in the dollar, and it's included in the trustee tax calculation in the trust's IR6 return. These distributions shouldn't be included in the minor's individual tax return. All other trusts are non-complying or foreign. Read our guide Trusts' and estates' income tax rules (IR288) for more details. 19 www.ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Add up the tax paid by the trustee/s and print the total in Box 16A. Print your share of the estate or complying trust income in Box 16B. But, if your estate or trust income includes: •interest with RWT deducted, show this at Question 13 and tick 13C. •dividends with imputation credits attached, show this at Question 14 and tick 14C. •overseas income and overseas tax paid, show this at Question 17 •taxable Māori authority distributions, show this at Question 15. Income from foreign and non-complying trusts If you're a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust please complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Copy the amount of taxable distributions from the non-complying trust to Box 16C, and attach the IR307 to the top of page 3 of your return. We separate taxable distributions from non-complying trusts because they're taxed at a different rate. If you have this type of income, your tax calculation at Question 32 may not be correct. We'll do this calculation for you and send you a notice of assessment. Question 17 Overseas income If you received income from, or while you were overseas, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, show it at Box 17B in New Zealand dollars. This includes taxable income from withdrawals and transfers from foreign superannuation schemes while you were a non-resident of New Zealand. Transitional residents must include any foreign employment or service income at Box 17B. You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates tables on our website (search keywords: overseas currencies) •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Portable NZ Super and/or portable veteran's pension paid while residing overseas are tax exempt and won't need to be included on your return. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: Veterans income). Note IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE20 Dividends received from overseas companies that are treated as FIFs (except companies covered by the exclusions listed under foreign rights at Question 36) are not taxable separately. Generally, you would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate), which doesn't tax dividends separately. The foreign tax deducted from the dividend may be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income for that company. Note Foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you've received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, have transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or you have transferred a superannuation interest to another person you are liable for income tax unless you qualify for an exemption. You need to calculate the amount of taxable income from the withdrawal or transfer (refer below) and include this income in Box 17B, and tick Box 17C. Lump sums received or transferred in the first four years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax; see "temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals" on page 23. Lump sums and transfers are taxed using one of two methods: •schedule method (default method) - this means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income, based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident and contributions you've made in that time (certain conditions apply). •formula method (alternative method) - can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and meets certain requirements. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for tax liability on foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme you may have income tax and student loan repayment obligations. You can request a withdrawal of funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay these obligations. Your KiwiSaver provider will deal with your application. For more information about foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) or go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: foreign superannuation). Foreign investment fund (FIF) income If, at any time during the 2018 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. Generally, you'll use the fair dividend rate (FDR) or comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income. 21 www.ird.govt.nz The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: •investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts (a list of these companies is available on our website (search keyword: IR871) •interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) •a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). From 1 April 2014 the FIF rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless acquired when the holder was a New Zealand tax resident or the interest is grandparented. For more information see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). There's also an exemption from the FIF rules where the total cost of all the investment for FIF purposes is below NZ$50,000. What to show on your return After you've converted the amounts to New Zealand dollars, add up the available amounts of overseas tax paid and print the total in Box 17A. Add up the gross amounts of overseas income (before tax was deducted) and print the total in Box 17B. Staple proof of any overseas tax paid to the top of page 3 of your return. If a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) was maintained, complete a Branch equivalent tax account return (IR308) and attach it to your IR3 return. Tax paid overseas If you paid tax overseas on any foreign income derived, you may be able to claim it as a credit against your New Zealand tax payable. The amount of credit you receive may be restricted by any double taxation agreements and is the lesser of the actual amount of tax paid on the overseas income or the amount of tax you would pay in New Zealand on the foreign income. To claim an overseas tax credit you must supply proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. If you need one, you'll have to request it from the overseas government agency concerned. Staple a copy of the certificate to the top of page 3 of your return. Also, if you receive a dividend that isn't taxed separately under the FIF rules, you can offset most overseas tax credit paid on the dividend against your tax payable. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461) pages 25 to 29. Claiming overseas tax paid on overseas dividends FIF income You can claim the tax paid up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you used the FDR method you can use the overseas tax paid to reduce the tax payable on the FDR income associated with that attributing interest. Please note that Australian franking credits and tax on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed as overseas tax paid. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE22 Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Unused overseas tax credits Generally, these are forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused overseas tax credits? You can't carry forward unused overseas credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends You can claim New Zealand tax credits on overseas dividends as follows: •If the credits are RWT, they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. •If they're imputation credits, they are used to reduce tax payable. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. •Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to Australian company or unit trust dividends. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Temporary tax exemption from foreign income If you're currently claiming the four-year temporary tax (transitional resident) exemption for certain types of foreign-sourced income, you don't need to declare this income in Box 17B, unless it's foreign employment or services income. When your tax exemption expires, you must include all your worldwide income when you file your income tax return. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the temporary tax exemption qualifying criteria and types of exempt foreign-sourced income. 23 www.ird.govt.nz Temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals This four-year exemption period is similar to the temporary tax exemption from foreign income and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals during the period. The exemption doesn't require you to be non-resident for a minimum period. This exemption applies if you: •first acquired your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and •haven't previously had this exemption. Foreign superannuation withdrawals during the four-year exemption period do not need to be declared as income in Box 17B. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the foreign superannuation temporary exemption or read our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). Australian dividends from non-FIF companies If you received Australian dividends, your dividend statements may show all or some of the following: •the franked/unfranked amount •Australian withholding tax •imputed credit or franking credits •New Zealand imputation credits. Add up the amounts of Australian withholding tax deducted and print the total in Box 17A. Dividends paid by Australian companies may have a New Zealand imputation credit. To calculate the gross dividend, add together the franked and unfranked amounts, along with the New Zealand imputation credits and print the total in Box 17B. Don't include any Australian imputed or franking credits. Claim New Zealand imputation credits in Box 14. Overseas pensions If you received an overseas social security pension, convert the amount into New Zealand dollars. Print the total in Box 17B. You may also have received other types of overseas pensions, such as foreign private annuities or foreign investment funds. For more information, please read the note about foreign rights disclosure on page 49. Under most of the tax treaties New Zealand has with other jurisdictions, you cannot claim a tax credit for tax deducted overseas on pensions. If you paid tax on the pension overseas, generally you need to claim a refund or tax credit from the overseas tax authority, not from Inland Revenue in New Zealand. For more information, please read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) and Overseas social security pensions (IR258) or go to www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE24 Specific dividends If you received dividends that are treated as interest or that are from an overseas company through an agent or trustee, who has deducted RWT in New Zealand, show the tax credits and overseas income in Boxes 17A and 17B. Show New Zealand RWT deducted in Box 14A. Staple a copy of the dividend statement to the top of page 3 of your return. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Note Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute the net income/loss and tax credits they derive across their investors. Individual investors generally don't include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. You can only claim a loss when it has the zero rate applied. In all other cases you cannot claim a loss from your PIE. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement, setting out the details of the income/loss and the tax it has paid on the income it has attributed to you. Where your PIE has calculated the tax using a prescribed investor rate lower than your correct rate or you have exited a PIE that doesn't calculate tax when an investor exits, you may need to include the income in your return to pay the tax. Where you're required to include attributed PIE income in your return, show the income and tax paid/ credit where the rate lower than your correct rate has been applied. Include any tax credits shown on your PIE's investor statement where you've exited from a PIE that zero-rates exiting investors. You can show the net income or loss (after adjusting for the investor level fees) in Question 17B and the general tax credits shown at 17A. Where any specified tax credits (eg, RWT) are shown, include these in the appropriate question on the return. If you have a student loan or if you're eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits you now have to declare PIE income on an Adjust your income (IR215) form, except if the PIE is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme (eg, KiwiSaver) where the funds are locked in. If you have declared PIE income in your return and it is from a: •non-locked-in PIE it will be taken into account •locked-in PIE you need to show the amount on the IR215 so we can exclude it from your income. If you have non-locked-in PIE income or dividends from a listed PIE that are not included in your return you may need to declare it on the IR215 for either or both student loan and Working for Families Tax Credits. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). 25 www.ird.govt.nz Question 18 Partnership income Show your share of income from the partnership's trade or business from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 in Box 18B, unless it includes: •interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •overseas income and overseas tax paid - show this at Question 17 •rental income - show this at Question 22 •other income and, if your share of this income: –is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (eg, you were a sleeping partner), or –is generated from other investment activity (eg, sale of shares), show this at Question 24. Partnership income earned as a result of "active" involvement is liable for ACC levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Losses from limited partnerships If you're claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to www.ird.govt.nz Expenses You may be able to claim expenses against your share of the partnership income that wasn't claimed in the partnership's IR7 return, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership. Claim these expenses at Question 26. Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) income If you received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 19. Don’t include: •interest and any RWT – show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits – show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •Māori authority distributions and credits – show these at Question 15 •any overseas income – show this at Question 17, along with qualifying tax credits attached •rental income – show this at Question 22. The LTC will normally supply information about non-allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. Note The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner’s “owner’s basis” (equity) in the LTC. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE26 For the 2017-18 and later income years the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. For most LTC owners, you can now claim the full amount of your prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won’t apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. Daniel is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2017-18 income year Daniel has a net loss of $7,000.00 from the LTC. Daniel also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Daniel has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Daniel’s tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: •19A: $0.00 •19B: $7,000.00- •19C: $0.00 •19D: $5,000.00 •19E: $12,000.00- Example What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 19A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 19B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 19C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimed this year and print in Box 19D. You’ll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 19C, add this to Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you have an amount in Box 19D, subtract this from Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you don’t have any amounts in Box 19C or Box 19D, copy the amount from Box 19B to 19E. Box 19E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in our guide Look-through companies (IR879). 27 www.ird.govt.nz Question 21 Shareholder-employee salary If, as a shareholder-employee, you received a salary between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 with PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 11A. If, as a shareholder-employee, your shareholder-employee's salary or director's fees had no PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 21. If you would normally receive a shareholder-employee salary (even if you didn't receive one this year), please tick 21A. If you are not a shareholder employee and you received director's fees with no tax deducted, show the income at Question 23. The company that paid your salary or fees will be able to tell you exactly how much to show in your return. Question 21B In-work tax credit (IWTC) is for families who normally work a minimum number of hours each week, as follows: •a two-parent family where one or both parents between them normally work 30 hours or more a week •a single parent normally working 20 hours or more a week. The eligibility criteria for IWTC changed from 1 April 2011 to include the hours worked without pay by major shareholders 1 in their close companies 2 . To qualify, the company must derive gross income. If you're already registered for WfFTC, and now meet the requirements for IWTC you'll need to tick Box 21B of your IR3. If you're not registered for WfFTC but you think you qualify, please complete a Working for Families Tax Credits registration form (FS1). For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: in-work tax credit). ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employee remuneration or director's fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company should deduct earners' levy from your remuneration or director's fees when declared. ACC will invoice the company for this. Question 22 Rents Show income you received from rents between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 at Question 22. Prepare a summary of the details for each rental property. You can use either: •the Rental income (IR3R) form, which asks for all the information we need, or •your own summary. If you need an IR3R form, you can print a copy off our website www.ird.govt.nz If you prepare your own summary, please refer to the IR3R form or our guide Rental income (IR264) to see what to include. 1 You are a major shareholder if you either own, control or have rights to acquire at least 10% of shares or voting rights in a close company, or have by other means at least 10% control of a close company. 2 A company where there are five or fewer shareholders whose total voting interests in the company are greater than 50%.

You can claim expenses and deductions against many schedular payments at Question 12C - see page 14. Attribution rules The attribution rule may apply where an individual provides services to an associated person (company, trust, partnership). In particular, it can apply where the associated person sells those services on, principally to a third party. To find out how to apply this rule, please read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Prepare a summary of details You can use any of the following: •your financial records •the Farming income (IR3F) form for agricultural businesses •the Business income (IR3B) form for other businesses •the Financial statement summary (IR10) form. Staple one of the above forms to page 3 of your return and print your profit (net income) in Box 23. The Financial statement summary (IR10) is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We don't need a set of accounts if you use the IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with filling out the IR10, see our IR10 guide. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them too. Providing childcare services in a home Based on the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home-Based Education and Care Services 2008, Inland Revenue's Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers sets out the types of expenditure generally incurred (standard cost) by individuals providing childcare services in their home. But, if you're a childcare provider who's registered for GST, this determination doesn't apply to you. 29 www.ird.govt.nz Individuals providing childcare services in their homes may use the standard costs (set out in the determination) or their actual costs and income for calculating their tax. If your childcare activities began part-way through the year, calculate your tax from that date using either the standard costs or actual costs. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005) for details. Show your childcare income at Question 23 if: •the determination applies to you, and your childcare taxable income is greater than nil, after standard costs have been deducted, or •you keep full records of your childcare income and actual expenses, and you make a taxable profit or loss after expenses have been deducted. If you need help deciding whether you need to declare childcare income using standard costs, please call us. You can't offset any loss calculated using standard costs (see the determination) against other income in any income year. Note Childcare services not under the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 These childcare providers can't use the determination. They must keep full records of actual income and expenses and are liable for tax on their total income after actual expenses are deducted for childcare services provided. At Question 23 show any childcare taxable income or loss after expenses have been deducted. ACC levies Income from self-employment is liable for ACC levies which ACC will invoice you for. Question 24 Other income If you received any other income between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, show it at Question 24. This may include: •the sale of land and/or buildings •the sale of non-FIF shares or other property •financial arrangements •cash jobs, payments made “under the table”, tips, bartering or income from an illegal enterprise •any share of partnership income as a result of capital investment •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme if your employer has not provided us with this information. If you’re not sure if your income is taxable, please call us. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE30 Income from the sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If you purchased a property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. The profits may also be taxable if you: •are a builder and improved a property before selling it •developed or subdivided land and sold sections •had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Show the total profit in Box 24. If you’re a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Income from the sale of non-FIF shares or other property The profits are taxable if you bought: •and sold shares or other property as a business •shares or other property for the purpose of resale •shares or property to make a profit. This doesn't apply to shares that are FIFs. Print the total profit in Box 24. Staple the details of your income and expenses from these sales to the top of page 3 of your return. Sale or disposal of assets If you sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, call us or read our guides Depreciation (IR260), General depreciation rates (IR265) or Historic depreciation rates (IR267). Losses from the sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If you made a loss and can show that if you'd made a profit, it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Show the total in Box 24. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can’t be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). 31 www.ird.govt.nz Financial arrangements If you're a party to a financial arrangement, you must account for income from those arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. A cash-basis person doesn't need to use the accrual method to calculate income. You qualify as a cash- basis person if: •on every day in the income year the absolute value of all financial arrangements added together is $1,000,000 or less, or •the absolute value of your income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements is $100,000 or less, and •the deferral of income or acceleration of expenditure using the cash method rather than the accrual method is $40,000 or less. If you held the financial arrangement prior to 20 May 1999 the amounts above may be reduced to $600,000, $70,000 and $20,000 respectively. Please note the "absolute value" is the value of an amount whether it's positive or negative. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading method applies, you must do a "wash-up" calculation in certain circumstances. For example: •a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred •there is an absolute assignment of the financial arrangement •a party to a financial arrangement is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand •you cease to be a resident of New Zealand. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are brought to account. This applies in every case - you don't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or have bought them for the purpose of resale, as you would with shares. When calculating the income or expenditure on sale, use our Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) form. Income from cash jobs, tips, "under the table" payments, bartering or an illegal enterprise If you received any other type of income that didn't have tax deducted from it, show it in Box 24. Staple the details of your income and any expenses to the top of page 3 of your return. Share of partnership income as a result of capital investment If your share of partnership income is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (ie, you were a sleeping partner), show your share of partnership income in Box 24. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE32 Question 24A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an “offshore RLWT person” and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. You should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. You can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Show the name of your withholder(s) in the “name of payer” box. Question 26 Other expenses and deductions If you paid any of these expenses, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, you can claim them in Box 26. •a fee to someone for completing your tax return •commission on interest or dividend income (but not bank fees - they're a private expense) •additional expenses incurred in earning partnership income, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership •interest on money you borrowed to buy shares or to invest - as long as the investment will produce some taxable income •premiums on loss of earnings insurance (income protection), provided the benefit from the insurance policy is taxable •interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, only if the interest is not already included as a deduction in your accounts. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you're an ACC client and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments and have retained some of these, you may claim the payments you've made to your caregiver as a deduction at Question 12C. Read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12C. Schedular income expenses If you incurred expenses while earning income that's had tax from schedular payments deducted, you claim these at Question 12C, not here. Other expenses For other expenses, staple the details to the top of page 3 of your return. Include your name and IRD number. You can't claim expenses against income from: •salary and/or wages •election day services •casual agricultural work •commissions, if you're also paid a salary or retainer from the same employer. 33 www.ird.govt.nz You can still claim expenses for having your tax return completed for you and loss of earnings insurance premiums from these income sources. If you're GST-registered you must deduct any GST included in any expenses. GST-registered people claim the GST portion of their expenses in their GST return, not the IR3. Note ACC levies ACC will take into account all expenses shown in Box 26 when calculating any ACC levies due. Question 28 Net losses brought forward Where to find your net loss to bring forward You can find the amount of net loss you have to bring forward on the loss carried forward letter we sent you after your 2017 return acknowledgement or notice of assessment. What to show on your return Add up all net losses to be brought forward to 2018 and print the total in Box 28A. Print the amount you can claim this year in Box 28B. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE34 Your tax credits Tax credits can reduce the tax you have to pay on your income. Other tax credits Donation tax credits are claimed separately on a Tax credit claim form (IR526). If you claimed this tax credit last year, we'll have sent you a claim form in May. Question 30 Independent earner tax credit (IETC) You can calculate your IETC: •by using the worksheets provided in this section •by calling our self-service line - see page 58. IETC The IETC is a tax credit for individuals whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000. Your annual net income is shown at Box 27 "Income after expenses" in your return. If you're eligible for IETC, but earn over $44,000, your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every dollar earned above $44,000. For the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, you'll be entitled to IETC for any months: •you were a New Zealand tax resident •you or your partner weren't entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits (or received an overseas equivalent) and you didn't receive: –an income-tested benefit –NZ Super –a veteran's pension or –an overseas equivalent of any of the above.

IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE40 Excess imputation credits carried forward Imputation credits are treated differently from RWT. If you received dividends from a New Zealand company that gave you imputation credits or an Australian company that gave you New Zealand imputation credits, you may have excess imputation credits to carry forward. This will only happen if your total imputation credits (including any excess imputation credits brought forward from 2017) are greater than your total tax payable. Use the worksheet below to work out the excess imputation credits that must be carried forward to your 2019 tax return. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount. Worksheet Copy your total imputation credits from Box 9 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 1. 1 Copy your total tax payable from Box 6 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer in Box 3. 3 This is your excess imputation credits amount to carry forward to 2019. Student loan We'll work out how much of your student loan you need to repay, based on your income. If you have an end-of-year repayment obligation we'll send you a notice showing how much is due. If you want to calculate the amount yourself, either use the worksheet provided here or go to "Work it out" on our website. The worksheet is for your information only and will give you an indication of your student loan end-of-year repayment obligation. Interest-free student loan If you've lived in New Zealand for six months (183 days) or more, your student loan is interest-free. Interest will be charged and then written off on a daily basis. Even if you haven't been in New Zealand for six months, you may qualify for an interest-free student loan if you meet the criteria for an exemption. Go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: interest free) for more details. End of year repayment obligation Repayment deductions from salary or wages are generally considered your final obligation on that income and don't form part of your end-of-year repayment obligation. Income from casual agricultural work and election day work doesn't have student loan deductions. This income is excluded as salary and wage income and becomes part of adjusted net income. 41 www.ird.govt.nz If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, any income or deductions are excluded in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, you can offset a loss from one business or investment activity against other like income. For example, Rory has an overall loss from his landscaping business of $7,500. He has also made a profit from his lawnmowing service of $50,000. The activities are carried out in association with each other, so Rory can claim the $7,500 loss against the $50,000 profit. From the 2017 tax year onwards income adjustments are now required to be part of your adjusted net income. For a full list of the adjustments required go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). You'll only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if you: •have adjusted net income of $1,500 or more with a total income (including salary or wages) of $20,584 (annual repayment threshold plus $1,500) or more •had an interim assessment for the year. Adjusted net income is your annual gross income, excluding salary or wages and less annual total deductions you may claim. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, neither the income or the deductions from that activity are included in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, a loss from one business or investment activity can be offset against other like income. Note Annual total deductions are the expenses and deductions you can claim for the tax year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE42 If you're required to file an Adjust your income (IR215) form, you can't use this worksheet to calculate your 2018 repayment obligation. Once we have received your IR3 and your IR215 we will send you your end-of-year repayment obligation for 2018. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2018 repayment. Annual repayment threshold. 1 19,084 00 Copy any gross salary or wage income (excluding casual agricultural or election day income) from Box 11B of your return to Box 2. 2 If Box 2 is more than Box 1 print $0.00 in Box 3, otherwise subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the result in Box 3. 3 This is your unused repayment threshold you can use against your other income. Enter your income after expenses from Box 27 of your return (excluding any losses), less any salary and wage income from Box 2 in Box 4. 4 Subtract Box 3 from Box 4. If the result is less than $1,500.00 print $0.00 in Box 5. Otherwise, print the result in Box 5 (this is your total liable income). 5 Multiply the amount in Box 5 by 0.12 (12%). 6 This is your end-of-year payment obligation for the 2018 tax year. Print any 2017 voluntary repayments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6A. 6A Print any 2018 interim payments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6B. 6B Add Boxes 6A and 6B together and print the result in Box 7. 7 Subtract Box 7 from Box 6 and print your answer in Box 8. 8 If Box 7 is less than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year loan repayment. (Tick one) Loan repayment If Box 7 is larger than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year overpayment. Overpayment 43 www.ird.govt.nz Question 33 Early payment discount An early payment discount is available for people who: •are new in business •haven't begun to pay provisional tax •made payments within the corresponding income year up to their balance date, eg, a standard balance date taxpayer, who has made a payment or payments on or before 31 March 2018 as income tax for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The discount is calculated at the rate of 6.7% of either: •the amount paid during the year, or •105% of your end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser, and is credited against your end-of-year tax bill. To check if you qualify, work through the following flowchart. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE44 Do you qualify for an early payment discount? Terms we use Provisional tax - this is tax paid in instalments during the year, based on what you expect your income to be, or what it was last year.

Assessable income includes undeclared business income you may have earned (eg, cash jobs). Year - as referred to in the diagram on the next page, year means the standard tax year from 1 April to 31 March, unless you have an approved different balance date, in which case your income year will end then. If you have any questions about your entitlement to the discount, please contact us. No Ye s No No No Are you self-employed or in a partnership and you don't use a company or trust to run your business and most of your income is from your business - not interest, dividends, rents or benefits?

If you've made payments towards your 2019 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, we can include the overpayment in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 34A. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct bank account number is printed at Question 8 on the front page of your return. Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 we will carry it forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward please call us. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like your excess tax transferred (the "transfer date"). The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. For more information on the rules for working out the date the transfer is available, please refer to the tables on our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: credit transfers). IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE46 Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out the boxes on page 5 of your return. If you ask for a transfer on your return, we will transfer your refund at one of the following dates: Transfer to your own account or an account of someone associated to you, the later of: •the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March), or •the due date in the destination account. Transfer to an account of someone not associated to you: •the day after your return was filed. If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you'd like the credit transferred at a different date, you can contact us and ask for the transfer date to be changed (including if we've transferred your credit to cover a debt). Associated taxpayers The following are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: •a company you're a shareholder-employee in •a partner in the same partnership •a relative (eg, child, parent) •spouse or partner •a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. Transfers requiring a separate note attached to the return Situations such as requesting a transfer at a future date, transfer to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement and transfers at a different date will require you to attach a separate note to your return advising the following specific details. •The amount you want transferred. •The account you want it transferred to, eg, name, IRD number, tax type and period end date (and if it's another person, whether they're associated). •The date you'd like the credit transferred. •If it is to be transferred to debt covered by an instalment arrangement. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling funds transferred in. 47 www.ird.govt.nz Provisional tax Question 35 Provisional tax Provisional tax is generally payable because you earned income during the year that either: •wasn't taxed, or •was taxed at the wrong rate. It's usually payable in three instalments during the year (28 August 2018, 15 January 2019, 7 May 2019), unless: •you have a non-standard balance date, or •you pay GST on a six-monthly basis, or •you use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. If your 2018 residual income tax (RIT) (Box 32A of your return) is more than $2,500, you'll become a provisional tax payer and will be liable to pay 2019 provisional tax. For more information read our guides Provisional tax (IR289) or Penalties and interest (IR240). Initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. You will have an initial provisional tax liability if: •you begin to derive income from a taxable activity during the tax year, and •your RIT in any of the four preceding tax years didn't exceed $2,500, and •your RIT for the current year is $60,000 or more. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). The date you cease employment determines when interest will be charged from. You are not liable to pay provisional tax in the year you have an initial provisional tax liability. You may make voluntary payments to reduce your interest liability. Interest rules if you have an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply to when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Payment options You have three options for paying provisional tax - the standard option "S", the estimation option "E" or the ratio option "R". Standard option Under this option, your 2019 provisional tax is the same as your 2018 RIT (if it is more than $2,500) plus 5%. Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print “S” in Box 35A. Divide the amount by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment - record this on page 51. If you’re filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE48 If you think your income for 2019 will be more than your 2018 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2019 provisional tax using the standard option "S" Copy your RIT from Box 32A of your return to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.05 (5%). Print your answer in Box 2. 2 Add Box 1 and Box 2. Print your answer in Box 3. Box 3 is your 2018 provisional tax. 3 00 Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print "S" in Box 35A. Divide the amount in Box 3 by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment. Record this on page 51. If you’re filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. Estimation option Anyone can estimate provisional tax. If you expect your 2019 RIT to be lower than your 2018 RIT, estimating will keep you from paying more than you have to. If you choose to estimate, your estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time you make it and at each instalment date. You can be charged a penalty and/or interest if you don't take reasonable care when you estimate your provisional tax. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2019 provisional tax using the estimation option "E" Print your estimated 2019 taxable income in Box 1. 1 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 1.

If you or your caregiver receive these payments, regardless of whether ACC or your employer makes them, you'll need to read this information before you complete your return. Any ACC personal service rehabilitation payments paid by ACC or your employer direct to the client or caregiver, are schedular payments and will have tax deducted before the payments are made. Depending on their circumstances, ACC clients or carers receiving ACC personal service rehabilitation payments may not be required to file an IR3. Do I need to file? Are you a caregiver receiving payments from ACC, or a caregiver paid by a client? If you earn over $14,000 from all sources of income, you're required to file an IR3. If you earn less than $14,000, you're not required to file an IR3 because enough tax will have been deducted during the year from these payments. However, you may have another reason to file an IR3 - see page 5 for more information. If you're not required to file an IR3 please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records. Are you a client who received these payments from ACC and then passed on those payments to your caregiver? Because you've received these personal service rehabilitation payments from ACC to pass on to your caregiver, we've sent you an IR3. You're not required to file an IR3 if: •you have no other income •you're not liable for child support •you don't have a student loan and income over the threshold •your family is not entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits •you have no other reason to file - see page 5. Please note the above rules apply whether or not you've passed these payments on to your caregiver. If you're not required to file, please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records. If you're a client or caregiver who is required to file, please read the information on the following pages before you complete Questions 12 and 26. Question 12 Schedular payments If you're a caregiver paid directly by ACC Use the income from schedular payments information on your summary of earning (SOE) to help you complete your IR3.
