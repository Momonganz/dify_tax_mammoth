Income Tax Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill 30 April 2007 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department CONTENTS Overview 1 Significant policy issues 2 Submissions recommended to be accepted 9 Submissions recommended to be declined 37 Table of officials’ recommended changes 59 1 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The Income Tax Bill rewrites Parts F to Z and the Schedules of the Income Tax Act 2004 and re-enacts the remainder of the Act. It represents the final stage of the progressive rewrite of the Act, which began in the early 1990s. The first stage, completed in 1994, was the reorganisation of the Act to make its structure logical and coherent. The second stage was the rewrite of the Act’s core provisions in 1996. The third stage was the rewrite of Parts C to E in 2004. Most submissions on the bill came from professional associations. Five submissions were received, some of them very substantive. Submissions raised points on a range of issues: transitional, structural, policy, technical and drafting. Of these, drafting issues and assurance that no change in outcome would arise were the most frequently raised. Additional consultation occurred with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society. A major concern arising from further consultation was that any changes in the words used in the rewritten legislation create a risk that unintended changes in existing law may occur in the bill. This risk arises because the courts generally interpret Parliament’s intention on a particular issue through the words expressed in the legislation. The main feature of this additional consultation was that the unintended change process should continue to be managed by an independent committee (currently the Rewrite Advisory Panel). If this process continues, the committee will consider whether issues brought to its attention from the rewritten legislation constituted unintended changes in law. If the committee concludes that such changes have occurred, it will recommend remedial legislation. This process arose from an unequivocal statement of intent from the government before enactment of the 2004 Act that, when unintended changes in law are identified, retrospective legislation reinstating the meaning and effect of the law as set out in the Income Tax Act 1994 will be introduced. The main policy matters raised in submissions relate to the term “permanent home” in the rewritten definition of “residence” and the policy intention of clause FA 3. In addition, some submissions and officials’ own quality control work have noted the need to identify some provisions as intended changes. Each of these policy matters is dealt with in the first section of the report. This is followed by a series of tables setting out officials’ recommendations on submissions on the bill, including submissions from officials arising from their own quality control and updating work. 2 SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES Issue: Definition of residence Clause YD 1(1), (2) Submissions (2 – KPMG) (3 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That “a permanent home” is not the same as a “permanent place of abode”; therefore the change in wording changes the existing law. That a change in the law is not in accordance with the objectives of the rewrite to rewrite the Income Tax Act 2004; alternatively, the change has not been identified as an intended policy change that has been considered through the Generic Tax Policy Process. That the Income Tax Bill should provide more guidance on how the test is to be applied. Comment One of the tests of tax residence for individuals is whether a person has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand. This term is undefined in the Income Tax Act 2004, and was introduced in 1980 in response to a court decision, apparently to copy a phrase used in the Australian income tax legislation. At that time, the policy files indicate that Inland Revenue considered that “permanent place of abode” was in essence a synonym for “permanent home”. Since that time, Inland Revenue has published significant commentary that seeks to explain how “permanent place of abode” is to be interpreted in practice, involving consideration of a range of factors and not merely the existence of permanent accommodation and that commentary is widely cited and relied upon. The Income Tax Bill adopted the wording of “permanent home” to replace “permanent place of abode”, being a more modern expression of the term having the same meaning as a matter of semantics. Officials also felt that “permanent home” was more likely to indicate to readers that the test did not refer merely to accommodation. The leading case in New Zealand on applying the residence test – Geothermal Energy NZ Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue in 1979 – interpreted the meaning of the term “home” (then used in the legislation). The judge gave an extensive summary of how the term should be applied, that involves an approach broadly similar to that in the Inland Revenue commentary on the meaning of “permanent place of abode”, which judicial summary is also commonly still cited as relevant. However two submissions on the bill (KPMG and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) considered that changing the wording in this way would lead to the law no longer including various nuances concerning how the term “permanent place of abode” is applied in practice, that relate to a person’s centre of economic interests. 3 After consideration of the submissions and points made in subsequent consultation, officials agreed that it would be desirable to reinstate the term “permanent place of abode” and defer, for a process allowing wider consultation, any updating of the language and possible insertion of further guidance on its meaning. The Institute noted that it would be helpful to refer for policy consideration the question of whether the residence rule should explicitly refer to a person’s centre of economic interest. Officials agree with the Institute’s suggestion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disposal of shares on revenue account under a dividend stripping arrangement Clause FA 3 Submission (5 – New Zealand Law Society) That clause FA 3 results in an unintended law change as a result of the deletion of the proviso from the current section FC 3 and that the proviso should be reinserted into the clause. Comment Clause FA 3 rewrites section FC 3 of the 2004 Act, with the proviso rewritten in subclause (2), and is listed in Schedule 51 as being an intended change. The policy of the section is directed at a person who acquires shares on revenue account and who, by virtue of their shareholding, strips a dividend from the shares and disposes of the shares in a way that creates a loss for income tax purposes that offsets the taxable income from the dividend or offsets other taxable income. Background This rule was introduced in 1959. The policy concern arose in the early 1950s. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue reported, on 25 March 1958, to the Minster in charge of the Department as follows: Share Dealers Purchasing Shares “Cum Div” and selling “Ex Div” and claiming resulting loss for tax purposes In New Zealand dividends are treated as non-assessable income. A taxpayer who deals in shares is assessable on any profits and likewise may claim any loss as a deduction against assessable income derived from other sources. In one instance, the taxpayer – ostensibly a share dealer – purchased shares in a company with large accumulated profits. This taxpayer then arranged for the company to declare a large dividend. This had the effect of substantially reducing the value of the shares which were then sold. The taxpayer claimed the resulting loss when in point of fact it was balanced by the non-assessable dividends. 4 Speech notes prepared for the Minister to introduce the bill in 1959 state: The object of the amendment is to disallow part or all of any loss on the deal in cases where it is brought about by what is commonly known as “dividend stripping”. ... The clause is aimed at preventing manipulations to distribute the profits of a company in such a way that dividend tax is avoided. Representations have been made that in certain circumstances, the clause may result in part of the dividend being taxed as both a dividend and as a profit on the share sale. That is not the intention and I am having the drafting looked at again to ensure that there will be no double taxing. The Department’s technical policy circular prepared in 1959 following enactment of the legislation notes that: The object of the amendment is to disallow part or all of any loss on the deal in cases where it is brought about by what is commonly known as dividend stripping. ... The position generally is that the dividend received is taken into account as income and no loss is allowed on the share deal. The effect of the proviso is to avoid double taxation where an overall profit arises from the deal. ... The proviso is designed to avoid double taxation. Until the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, the proviso worked by comparing the tax on the dividend to the tax on the overall “profit” on the share trade and, if the tax on the dividends was greater than the tax on the “profit”, there was no further tax to pay. The 1996 rewording, necessary because of the rewriting of the Act’s core provisions, meant the term “profit” could not be used, was intended to achieve the same result. To summarise, the policy of this provision is: • A loss on sale incurred by a person holding shares on revenue account will not be effective for tax purposes if that loss arises from dividend stripping arrangements (as defined in section FC 3). • Denying the loss for tax purposes prevents that loss being offset against the dividend or (if the dividend is exempt) against other income. • The dividend under the dividend stripping arrangement will be subject to the normal tax rules applying to dividends. • Since 21 May 1999, the rule applies to all shares held on revenue account and so is no longer restricted just to persons dealing in shares. The wording of section FC 3 of the 2004 Act Officials agree that the 1996 wording in the proviso in section FC 3 of the 2004 Act (and 1994 Act) needed to be improved. This difficulty in easily ascertaining the meaning of the section was specifically noted in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11 No 3, issued in October 1999: As pointed out by submissions, further work on section FC 3 seems appropriate to simplify and clarify its wording. 5 The wording of clause FA 3 of the Income Tax Bill This lack of clarity in the wording in section FC 3 is addressed in rewriting the provision in the Income Tax Bill as clause FA 3, with the rewritten proviso in subclause (2). As part of preparing that drafting, the draft provision was included in the Exposure Draft on Part F, issued in November 2005. Two submissions were received on clause FA 3. One submission was from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants which stated that “the simplification approach and the removal of the proviso are acceptable”. The second submission was from a legal firm that made essentially the same argument now being put forward by the Law Society. Officials carefully considered the submission from the legal firm and concluded that the analysis contained an interpretation of section FC 3 that would defeat the policy intention of the rule. It would mean that, in a case where dividends are taxable, the loss on the share sale offsets the taxable dividend. It would mean that the rule only operated in the case of exempt dividends. The legislative history makes it clear beyond doubt that the rule was never intended only to apply to exempt dividends. Therefore, officials declined that submission. Overview of how clause FA 3 meets the policy intent Clause FA 3 is drafted to clearly express the policy of denying an artificial loss arising from a dividend stripping arrangement that offsets either a taxable dividend or tax on other income. This is best illustrated using the example given by the Law Society on pages 2–3 of its submission. In the absence of section FC 3 (clause FA 3 of the bill), the shareholder would have a loss on sale of $20 which they could offset against the dividend in calculating their taxable income for the income year. Of the $200 dividend, only $180 would be taxable. The policy of the rule is to deny that loss and ensure the dividend is fully taxed. Clause FA 3 operates by creating a deemed amount of income no less than the stripped dividend but no greater than the artificial loss arising because of the dividend stripping arrangement. In the example, the amount of income created under this rule is equal to the artificial loss ($20) so that the loss cannot reduce tax on the dividend. By adopting this drafting approach, no profit on sale can arise under the provision. This means that the dividend is treated as an additional amount on the sale only to the extent of the loss and not to the extent that a profit would result in taxation on both the dividend and the profit (in other words, double taxation). This means that the effect of the proviso to section FC 3(1) of the 2004 Act is achieved in a clearer way. 6 Intended change Officials consider this same result would arise under current section FC 3, having regard to its clear legislative history. Officials consider the interpretation of the provision offered by the Law Society defeats the policy intention of the rule, reducing it to a provision only operating in the case of exempt dividends. This is contrary to the clear intention that it also applies to taxable dividends. Officials do not consider this outcome is double taxation, as the rule only denies an artificial loss that would otherwise be used to offset tax on the dividend or against other income and does not result in an artificial profit on sale that would be also taxed. Officials do not agree that this drafting change in FA 3 represents an unintended change as clause FA 3 is listed in Schedule 21, being a provision with an intended change. The omission of the proviso is intended. The Rewrite Advisory Panel reviewed and agreed to the drafting for this clause and its listing as an intended change in the bill. Further consultation Subsequent consultation with the Society occurred, detailing the history of the rule, which resulted in the Society acknowledging that officials’ view of the policy intention and application of the rule was correct. However, the Society also noted that the more general anti-dividend streaming rule, now in clause GB 1, overlapped the rule in clause FA 3, and that a policy review of clause FA 3 should occur as a matter of priority. Officials agree this policy review should occur. The Society also suggested some minor rewording of clause FA 3(2) to make the policy intent even clearer, to which officials have agreed. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the relationship of the rule to the structure of the Act and in particular to the anti-avoidance rule relating to dividend stripping is considered for inclusion as a priority matter on the policy work programme. Issue: Intended changes in law Clause: Schedule 51 Submission (5 – New Zealand Law Society) That clause LC 9(2) should be noted as an intended change. (Officials) That clause LC 9(2) and the definitions of land, mortgage and pay in clause YA 1 be listed in Schedule 51 as an intended change. 7 Comment Officials have continued their quality control review of the clauses in the bill, and now list below a number of definitions and clauses that they consider should be included in schedule 51 as intended changes in law. The Rewrite Advisory Panel considers it is appropriate for these provisions to be noted as intended changes in law: Clause in the bill The change in law LC 9(2) apportionment for tax credit for an absentee: housekeeper and low income This rule relates to the housekeeper and low income tax credits (formerly termed rebates). The policy of the rule is to apportion income of an absentee between periods of the person’s absence and presence in New Zealand. The apportionment set out in the bill is on a daily basis. In the interest of simplification, the bill omits from the 2004 Act corresponding rule the formula that apportioned the income on a “weeks” basis for persons with “regular pay periods”. A change in effect is anticipated, but the omission should result at most in a small difference in outcome in favour of taxpayers. The New Zealand Law Society indicated in their submission on the bill that it would be preferable to list this as an intended change. YA 1 definition of “land” The provision is simplified and structured so that the first three paragraphs of the rewritten definition are to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain accessible legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. YA 1 definition of “mortgage” The definition of “mortgage” was introduced at a time when mortgages were subject to tax as a subset of land tax. The drafting in the bill provides for the term to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain, accessible and up-to-date legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. YA 1 definition of “pay” The provision is simplified and structured to apply generally for the Act. This is consistent with the objectives of plain accessible legislation and is thought highly unlikely to result in any material change in law. However, as this change in drafting could conceivably result in a change in outcome in some circumstances, the change should be identified for readers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 9 TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUBMISSIONS ON BILL – RECOMMENDED TO BE ACCEPTED The following table lists technical and drafting issues raised in submissions that officials recommend be accepted. 10 11 Parts C to E – Reco mmend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause CD 50(8), the words “including interest and discount on issue” should be removed from brackets. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That, clause CT 6(1), th e words “petroleum mining permit” should be replaced by “petroleum permit”. Officials agree with the subm ission. The policy intent of section CT 6 is that it applies to all types of petroleum permits, not just a mining permit. However the policy and scope of the rule in the 2004 Act extended to permits in relation to petroleum as well as existing privileges (as defined in the Crown Minerals Act section 106) for mining and exploration licences under Part 1 of the 1937 Act. That the submission be accepted. That as a consequence of this submission the term “petroleum mining permit” in the bill be replaced by “petroleum permit”. That the defined term in clause YA 1 “petroleum permit” be restored and that the term “petroleum mining permit” as indicated in appendix 1 be retained but consideration given to whether it needs to be a defined term or whether the direct reference to the Crown Minerals Act can be made within the relevant section (DT 6(c)). New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the words “the vines or trees” should be replaced by the words “the non-listed horticultural plants” in paragraph (b) and (c) of clause DO 4(6). Officials agree that the concep t of non-listed horticultural plants provides scope for the CIR to list types of plants that are other than vines and trees. This was a policy extension introduced in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. The TIB item on the Act noted “It retains the same treatment that was previously provided for vines and trees and operates as a kind of default rule for horticultural plants not listed by the Commissioner.” That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause DV 16, that th e words “to the extent to which the expenditure or losses arises” should be replaced by the words “except to the extent to which the expenditure or loss arises”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society That, in clause DV 19(2), paragraph (a) should cross-refer to subsection (4) rather than subsection (3). That paragraph (b) of clause DV 19(2) should cross-refer to subsection (5) rather than subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submissions. That the submissions be accepted. 12 Parts C to E – Reco mmend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society Clause DV 19(7) has been oversimplified. Currently, statutory producer boards are exempt from section HF 1(2)(b) and this is not reproduced. If the intent is that a SPB is able to deduct the full amount of an association rebate without reference to mutual transaction entered into, then that is a change in policy. Officials consider the rule is in tended to address the timing of the deduction rather than the criteria for having the deduction. Officials agree this should be clarified to overcome the ambiguity identified. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants The heading to subclause EA 3(4) “Determination of values” should be “unexpired portion: expenditure on goods”. This is an issue of drafting cons istency. No policy issue arises otherwise. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the heading to subclause EB 24(4) should refer to “Disposals of timber” rather than “Disposals of trading stock”. Agree that the subject matter of the subclause is to do with rights to take timber as well as standing timber (with exceptions). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That, in clause EJ 23(3), the wording “ofdeductions” be replaced by “of deductions.” Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 13 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the subh eading to subclause FA 8(2) is grammatically incorrect. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the subh eadings to subclause FA 14(2) is grammatically incorrect. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the terms “carrying on” and “carrying out” should be used consistently between sections FB 4(2) and FB 4(3). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clauses FB 6(2) and FB 7(2), the clarity of current section FF 7 is lost and that the transferee should be mentioned. The subject matter of these provisions is the transfer of the relationship property and the value placed on that transfer. While officials consider it is unnecessary to refer to the transferee giving consideration, officials agree that separating the acquisition and the value into two or three paragraphs in subclause (2) would improve clarity. That the submission be accepted in relation to improving the clarity. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That paragraph (b) of the definition of “close relative” in clause FC 1(2) should be removed. The policy intention of the close relative restriction is that the roll-over relief applies so long as all assets in the tax base of the deceased being transferred pass to the spouse or de facto partner or another person who is a relative within the second degree of relationship of the deceased person. The intention behind the drafting of (b) appears to be to ensure that the 2nd degree of relationship test is not applied to a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner. However, NZICA’s submission identifies that the paragraph could have a different outcome from that intention. The wording could be restructured into the opening words. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clau se FC 2, the timing of determining market value for the transfers other than on death should be clarified. Although it should not be necessary in a plain language environment, the timing is clarif ied as a matter of consistency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That subclause FC 8(3) should be renumbered FC 8(2). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause FE 6(3), the words “the amount is calculated using the formula-” should be inserted before the formula in section FE 6. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the subheading for section FE 30(3) should be “When company A cannot be part of group”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 14 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the formula in section FF 6(4) should use the term “tax rate” rather than “rate” to be consistent with the defined term “tax rate” in subsection FF 6(5) Officials agree that the parameters should be consistent. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section FF 7(2)(b) sh ould be split so that each paragraph deals with a separate item. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section FF 7(6)(b) should refer to subsection (3) rather than subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se FL 1(2), the meaning of “just before” is unclear. This term is an alternative term to “immediately before,” as used in other provisions in the bill. While officials consider the meaning is clear, officials consider that the submission raises a point of drafting consistency, and agree that one phrasing should be adopted for this purpose and suggest the term “just before” be replaced by “immediately before”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the heading to subsection FM 3(1) should be “Taxable income of consolidated group” rather than “Taxable income of group” to be consistent with the terms used in subpart FM. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That subsection FM 10(2) should state what the exceptions to the section are. A rule setting out whether an expenditure or loss is a deduction must be listed in Part D. Clause FM 10(2) refers to the rule in clause DV 16(2)(a) and (b) which refers to the exceptions. However, it could improve access to the exceptions if subclause FM 10(2) were extended along the lines “unless the exceptions in section DV 16(2)(a) or (b) apply”. That the submission be accepted, but that the drafting identify the location of the exceptions to the denial of the deduction in clause DV 16. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se FM 30, the compare note should include section NH 4(9). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause FN 5 clarifies that a resident imputation subgroup can be formed with one company. Officials agree with the submissi on, but that the clarification is better placed in clause FN 8. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause FN 9 should contain a reference to the effective date for becoming a member of an imputation group. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 15 Part F – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 3(1)(c) should state that a company that derives only exempt income includes a local authority that is not a council-controlled organisation. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in clause FO 4, a reference to “privileges” should be reinstated as it is different from the concepts of “rights and powers”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 15(4) is unnecessary as it repeats subclause FO 15(2). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That subcla use FO 18(4) should clarify that it applies to the amalgamating company as the borrowing company and that it overrides subclause FO 18(2)(b). Officials agree that subclaus e FO 18(4) should override subclause FO 18(2)(b), as FO 18(1) to (3) are intended to apply only if the amalgamating company is solvent. Officials agree that this should be clarified. Subclause FO 18(4) states that the “amalgamating company that is the borrower ...”. Officials consider this is sufficiently clear that the amalgamating company is the borrowing company. That the submission be accepted in relation to clarifying that subclauses FO 18(1)-(3) apply only when the amalgamating company that is the borrower is solvent. 16 Part G – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subclause GA 1(6) should have a reference to subsection (2) to prevent any potential misapplication of this provision. Officials consider that the linkage is sufficiently clear in a plain English drafting context, but agree that this could improve the clarity of the relationship given other subclauses contain appropriate cross-referencing. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se GA 2, the words “but for the arrangement” have a potentially wider meaning than the words “if the a rrangement had not been made or entered into”. This would be a law change. The words “but for the arrangement” should be replaced by “had the arrangement not occurred”. The use of “but for the arrangement” is intended to be a plainer phrasing of the corresponding phrase in the 2004 Act. While officials consider that there is no material risk of the wording being read more widely, in clause GA 2 should be worded in the same was as clause GA 1. Therefore the phrase “but for the arrangement” should be replaced by “had the arrangement not occurred” in clauses GA 2, GB 31 and GB 44 for consistency with clause GA 1. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the refe rence in subclause GB 8(1)(c) to “a purpose or effect” does not reflect section GC 8 of the 2004 Act, which clearly requires that the arrangement has “the purpose or effect”. Officials agree that the wording “a purpose or effect” should be replaced by “the purpose or effect”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 9, the test of whether the disposal is to a NZ resident who has a 10% or more income interest should be determined immediately after disposition. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 10, the test of whether the acquisition is from a NZ resident who has a 10% or more income interest should to be determined immediately before the acquisition. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That, in subclause GB 13(1)(b), the words “immediately after the disposition” should be inserted after “the disposal is not to a New Zealand resident who”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That for clarity , in clause GB 14(1)(b), the words “immediately prior to the disposition” should be inserted after “the acquisition is not from a New Zealand resident who”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. 17 Part G – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That paragra phs (b) and (c) of clause GB 19(1) could potentially be narrower in scope because the requirement that the payment is contingent in (1)(c) is in addition to an agreement to defer payment in (1)(b). Officials agree that the contingent payment test should not apply to paragraph (b). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in subc lause GB 24 (2)(g)(ii) the phrase “shares or losses” should be replaced by “shares of losses”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 36 (2), that the words “to the extent to which this subsection applies to the arrangement” should be inserted after “Subsection (1) does not apply”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the words “or effect” should be deleted from clause GB 39(1)(b). Section GC 25 of the 2004 Act does not refer to an effect of the arrangement. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In GB 43, that the words “to the extent to which this subsection applies to the arrangement” should be inserted at the end of subsection (2). Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the words “u nless the land is subject to a right in favour of the seller to take timber” should be inserted at the end of cl ause GC 2 (1)(b). The omission of those words could unintentionally widen the application of clause GC 1. Officials consider that the rewording to refer only to “a disposal of standing timber” helps to clarify the application of the rule, but agree that equivalent qualifying words should be reinserted to avoid the residual possibility of a change in law. Officials consider the wording in clause GC 2(3) adequately addresses the matter raised in the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in subc lause GC 6 (3)(b): “if” should be replaced by “and”. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. 18 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the terms “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company” be retained. Before the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1976, the term “qualifying” was used a number of times in defined terms. An objective in the rewrite has been to refine the defined terms to give the reader a clearer se nse of the underlying policy. It has been difficult to find an appropriate wording that best provides insight into the underlying policy for both a loss attributing qualifying company and a qualifying company. The word “attributing” was chosen because of its dictionary meaning of treating something as belonging to something else. The term “attributing” in “loss attributing qualifying company” effectively means “transferring to”. Relevant aspects of the definition of the word “attribute” from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 1 are: “To assign, give or concede to a person as a right ”; “Ascribe as belonging or appropriate to”; “Ascribe to as an inherent quality or characteristic”; “Ascribe to as an effect or consequence”. The wo rd “ascribe” is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as “assign or impute to someone or something as an action, effect, product, etc, or as a quality, characteristic or property (rarel y in a material sense”; or “reckon up, count up”. However, it is agreed that the term “attributing company” may be misleading. On balance, offi cials consider that replacing the terms “qualifying company” and “loss attributing qualifying company” with the terms “a ttributing company” and “loss attributing company” will not provide sufficient benefit to justify the change in term. Howe ver, generally, the aim of this completion of the rewrite exercise will be to avoid using labels of limited meaning, such as “qua lifying” or “speci al”, in favour of terms that give more information to a reader. The government has also signalled the possibility that the qualifying company rules are to be reviewed. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 1(1)(a) be reworded and that the word “treated” should be removed from section HA 1(1)(b). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 1 Oxford University Press, 5 th Ed., 2002. 19 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the referen ce in clause HA 6(1)(b) to a “flat- owning company” should be included in the definition of “flat-owning company” in clause YA 1. Officials consider that the term “flat-owning company,” is at present an undefined term. However, the policy is that for the purposes of entry to the qualifying company rules, this type of company must be a “body corporate” through which shareholders obtain use of residential property. Therefore, it would be appropriate to have the definition in clause YA 1 that relates to clau se CD 31 also apply to clause HA 6. Officials consider that this is consistent with the criteria set out in section OB 3(1)(b)( ii) (Definition of qualifying company). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HA 7(3) should include civil unions and de facto relationships. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HA 8(5) should only apply to situations where a group of shareholders assume the income tax liability for the minority shareholders in an attributing company, as described in subsection (3). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 10 should use the term “shareholder decision-making rights”, as defined in clause YA 1. Officials agree that the define d term “shareholder decision making-rights” seems to duplicate the outcome under clause HA 10. This would be a sensible rationalisation. That the submission be accepted New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 1, that the compare note should include section GC 14 and that clause HH 7 should be omitted from the compare note. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 6, that the compare note should omit section OF 2(2). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HC 15(5)(a)(ii), the reference to 1988 version provisions should be omitted. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted, but that the words ”, or the 1988 version provisions” be added at the end of the subparagraph. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HC 36, the references to sections OC 9 to OC 11 of the 2004 Act should be amended to refer to clauses YB 9 to YB 11. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the agency provisions in the bill in subpart HD create uncertainty about which income the agency obligation relates – in particular, clauses HD 10, HD 19, HD 20) and HD 27. Officials agree that the drafting could clarify the nature of the obligations. That the submission be accepted. 20 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the formula in clause HD 7(1) results in an amount of tax payable rather than a rate of tax. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That the parameters of the formula in clause HD 7(1) are confusing and should be clarified. Officials agree that this rule can be simplified further. The calculation effectively results in the effective tax rate on the taxable income of the principal is then used to calculate the tax payable on the taxable income under the agency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 7(2)(B) should reflect that a rate scale may apply and a single rate will not produce the correct outcome. Officials agree that the formula is intended to calculate the effective tax rate that takes into account marginal tax rates. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 7(2)(c) should define proportion of agency taxable income as the proportion of a principal’s taxable income that relates to the agency. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 15 (3)(a) should state that a director record their dissent with both the company and the CIR. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HD 19 omits a reference to “principal”, and this may extend the scope of the rule. Officials agree with this submission for reasons of consistency. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HD 20, the change in drafting in relation to apportionment may give rise to an unintended change in outcome from that under section HK 17 of the 2004 Act. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HD 26, the reference to “gross income” should be replaced by a reference to “income”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HE 2, the provision uses an undefined term “trading transaction” and that subclause (2) requires a transaction to be both a trading transaction and one or more of the transactions referred to in (a) to (c). Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials agree that the phrase “is a trading transaction” is unnecessary and can be omitted and the word “is” on line 2 of the clause HE 2(2) should be replaced by the word “includes”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause HF 11 (3) refers to “time notice is given” but does not specify which notice. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 21 Part H – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause HR 2(3) treats Category A Income derived by a GIF as income of a notional company and that this is a more realistic reflection. Officials agree with the submission (assuming that the “notional company” treatment is the “mor e realistic” treatment) and note that the definition of “company” also recognises this notional company treatment in paragraph (c) of that definition. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HR 5(6), the placement of the word “not” after “mutual association” should be reconsidered. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted 22 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the compare note for clause LB 3 should include section NF 8B(b). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LC 9 omits one of the tests in current section KF 3: the number of weeks test. It should be noted as an intended change. Officials agree that the calculation methods have been rationalised to a single basis and also agree that this change is intended. This is a rationalisation that should be noted in Schedule 51. That the submission be accepted, and that the change is noted as an intended change in Schedule 51. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause LC 9 is narrower than section KF 3 of the 2004 Act. Section KF 3 of the 2004 Act applies when a person: 1. is not resident in New Zealand for part of a tax year (an absentee); and 2. is entitled to any or a combination of the child rebate, the transitional tax allowance or the housekeeper rebate (sections KC 1 to KC 4 of the 2004 Act). Section KF 3 apportions these rebates based on the period the person derives remuneration for personal services that is assessable income. For an absentee who had regular pay cycles the apportionment was based on \[complete\] weeks, and in all other situations the apportionment was performed on a daily basis. There appears to be no policy reason why a single calculation should not produce a correct apportionment of the relevant rebate. Consequently the apportionment calculation was rationalised to a single daily basis, which would provide a small benefit for absentees with regular pay cycles. However, the words “for regular pay periods” should be omitted from clause LC 9(3)(b). We do not agree with the Institute’s comments that section KC 1(3) of the 2004 Act would apply to an absentee. The policy is that an absentee is not permitted this rebate. Also, the policy of section KC 3 is that it does not apply to a person who is a non-resident of New Zealand throughout the year. It was unnecessary to consider these distinctions in policy in rewriting these provisions. That the submission be declined but that the correction be made to clause LC 9(3)(b). New Zealand Law Society That in clause LC 11(2), reference to subsection (5) should be to subsection (4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 23 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That in clause LC 11(2)(c) there would be better clarity if the word “reducing” were replaced by “calculating”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LD 1( 2), “33%” should be replaced by “33 and one third %”. Officials agree with the submi ssion. However, the wording of the provision requires some reco nsideration to reflect more clearly that the policy extends beyond a charitable purpose. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 5(2) , the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. In addition, the layout could be better to show subtraction of person’s supplementary dividend was separate from the rest of the formula. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. However, the layout is subject to printing constraints. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 6, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 1, the cross-reference in subsection (5) should be to section LF 8 rather than section LF 7. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 3, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 4 the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LF 8(3)(a) should end in “and/or”, and not end in “or”. Officials agree that the policy is that the two limitations are not alternatives in the corresponding provision (section LD 9(2) of the 2004 Act). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause LJ 1(5) does not make sense. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be acc epted. New Zealand Law Society That the referen ce in clause LK 1(3) should be to subpart LQ (Tax credits for CTR companies). Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause LK 5, in the compare note: add section LC 4(6). Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. 24 Part L – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That in clause LL 3, the formula in subsection (1) does not replicate existing formula. The “1” should be outside the division. Officials agree with the submi ssion. The formula calculating the amount of the “grey list dividend” should be corrected. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LL 6, the formula in subsection (3) does not replicate existing formula. ((relevant standard dividend + q + q) x company tax rate) – tax withheld. Officials agree with the submission. The bracket before “company rate” should be omitted and a “)” bracket inserted after “company rate”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LO 2, the formula does not replicate the existing formula: item (c) total beneficiary credits should be increased by supplementary dividends paid to beneficiaries. Officials agree that item (c) should include the amount of supplementary dividends paid to the beneficiaries. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LP 6( 1)(b) the words “unless the provision expressly refers to this subsection” should be added. Officials agree with the submissi on. The effect of the words in brackets from subsection LE 2(11)(b) of the 2004 Act should be included in the rewritten provision. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LQ 5( 5)(b) the words “unless the provision expressly refers to this subsection” should be added. Officials agree that the eff ect of the words following “constitution” in section LG 1(4)(b ) of the 2004 Act should be included in the rewritten provision in subparts LP and LQ. That the submission be accepted. 25 Part M – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause MB 4(4) repeats the formula expressed in subsection (2). If the subsections are to perform separate functions, this should be made clearer. Officials agree that the two subsections should identify their relationship. However an amendment to the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act by section 103(2) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 needs to be incorporated. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause MB 5 (3) should exclude amounts attributable to a contribution by the person as a member of the scheme, rather than simply an amount of a contribution. The word s “attributable to” are necessary. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause MB 5, it should also be made clear that the inclusion of distributions from super schemes in assessable income is for the purpose of calculating family scheme income only. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 9(4)(a) should be omitted or alternatively the relationship with clause MD 9(4)(d) be clarified. Clause MD 9(4) contains th e provisions from section KD 2AAA(8) of the 2004 Act as they were at the time of introduction of the bill. However section 105 (1)(c) of the Taxation (Savings investment and Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 2006, which was assented to after the bill was introduced, amends this rule. The amendment clarifies that recipients of ea rnings-related compensation for incapacity arising from an accident under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 may be eligible for the in-work payment. Officials agree with the comment that paragraph (d) could be clarified by indicating more clearly that it is referring to the full-time earner tests in subclause MD 9(1)(a). That the submission be accepted. 26 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause OA 8(7), the paragraphs should be linked by “and” not “or”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OA 9( 2) reflects the general rule that credit/debit transferred, but does not reflect the specific rule for assessing continuity for transferred credits for all times before amalgamation (tested by reference to interests formerly held in an amalgamating company). See current section ME 29(1)(a). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OA 14(4) reflects the general rule that credit/debit transferred, but does not reflect the specific rule for assessing continuity for transferred credits for all times before amalgamation (tested by reference to interests formerly held in an amalgamating company). See current section ME 29(1)(a). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OB 1( 2)(a)(ii) should exclude a company acting only in capacity of trustee from being required to maintain ICA, and GIFs that derive only category B income. Officials agree that sub-paragr aph (ii) should contain an exclusion for a company acting in a trustee capacity, other than a company that is a GIF. There appears to be an inadvertent omission of the phrase “not bei ng a company that is a trustee” which should have appeared before “of a group investment fund to which paragraph (c) of the definition of company ...”. That the submission be accepted but that the provision not refer to category B income. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 1 (3) should be amended to allow Australian-resident companies excluded under subsection (2)(a)(i) and (v) to maintain an ICA. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(3)(b) should apply only for purposes of section OB 60. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(3) omits reference to the CIR’s discretion to allow the notice to take effect from the beginning of the tax year for the purpose of section OB 60. Officials agree with the submissi on. Officials consider that the drafting should be aligned with that set out in section OB 3(8)(c), and this would ensure that the Commissioner’s discretion can be exercised. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 2(7) should provid e that a company ends its status as an Australian ICA if it is ineligible to maintain an ICA. Subsection (8) currently makes no sense (for the purposes of subsection (7)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 27 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 19 (4) is incorrect: th e credit arises on 31 March of the income year in which the expenditure is deducted. It should also be made consistent with the debit date in clause OB 46(4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 27(1) needs amending: an Australian ICA company is intended to be allowed a credit for all NZ taxes paid by the company, including where the tax is withheld by others (as is usually the case with NRWT). Officials agree that the phrase “amount withheld by the company” should refer to the payer of the non-resident passive income. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 38(1) should only apply to companies at a time when they are not FDPA companies (see current section ME 5(1)(m)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 39 (5) should ensure that for method 2 to apply the company must be an FDPA company for the whole of the tax year (see current section ME 5(7)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 46 (4) is incorrect: th e credit arises on 31 March of the income year in which the expenditure is deducted. It should also be made consistent with debit date in clause OB 19(4). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 61(6) should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 66(2) provides that an ICA company must pay further income tax on the day it stops being an ICA company. It should be “by the day”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 67(1)(b) should refer to credits arising in the account in the following tax year, rather than to a single credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 28 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 4(3)(b) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may have not FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 28 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ration change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OC 31 provides that an ICA company must pay further income tax on the day it stops being an ICA company. It should be “by the day”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 4(3)(b) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may have not FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 15 should refer to a CTR company that is part of a wholly-owned group rather than a consolidated group (see cu rrent MI 5(1)(f)(iii) and OE 7(3)(c)). Officials agree with the submission but note that the same question arises in clause OD 14. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 18 should make explicit that clauses GB 35 and GB 36 apply to CTR credits as if they were an FDP credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OD 21 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. 29 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OE 4 should provide that a company/person that beco mes a non-resident of New Zealand stops being a BETA company. Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials consider that providing for the consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and will do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 7 (6) is confusing as the two references to income tax liability are to two different concepts. The first is to the company’s income tax liability for attributed CFC income ( calculated under subsection (8)), the second is to the company’s overall income tax liability calculated under core provisions. This should be clarified. Officials agree that the attributed CFC liability should be calculated on the basis it was the only income derived by the company. A standard drafting approach exists for this situation. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 11 provides a credit date for when a BETA company with debit balance ceases to a BETA company. But in current section MF 4(2)(e) it is when the company ceases to be resident in New Zealand. If it is clear in clauses OE 4 and OE 18 that the date a company stops being a BETA company is the same date that it becomes not resident in NZ, that would be acceptable. Officials agree that the matter needs clarification. Officials consider that providing for th e consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and w ill do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society Clause OE 12(1)( c) refers to BETA debits for an amount of a payment of FDP that “may have been paid to reduce a tax loss”. The words should be “may have been paid by an election to reduce a tax loss”. The same problem is in clause OP 105. It may not be correct to refer to FDP being “paid” as no payment is ever made. What date is “day of payment”? However the same problem exists in current section MF 4(4)(a). Clauses OE 12(3) and OP 105(3) should be consistent. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 30 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause OE 18 should provide that a company/person that beco mes a non-resident of New Zealand stops being a BETA company. Officials agree with the submi ssion. Officials consider that providing for the consequence of the loss of eligibility to maintain a memorandum account should ideally be consistent across all memorandum accounts, and will do further work on the feasibility of a generic rule. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society The clause OF 6 definition of “credit balance” in the formula in subsection (5) should take account of the fact that transfers of pa rt of a credit balance are permitted under this section. Officials agree that the amount of “credit balance” used in the formula in section OF 6(4) is at the discretion of the taxpayer, but may not exceed the credit balance. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society In clause OJ 16, subclause (5) should reflect the same debit date provided for in current section ME 23(5)(a). Officials agree that the date of the debit should the date of the election referred to in subclauses (1) to (3) That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OK 20 should provide that subsections (4) and (5) do not apply if an ICA company files a ratio change declaration. Under current section ME 8(3) it is clear that no breach occurs, not that the consequences of a breach are prevented. Officials agree that the words “t he consequences of” a breach are inappropriate and should be replaced by an override of subsection (5). That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 22(1)(c), the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OP 52(3) provides that a company may only end its existence as an FDPA company if it “pays further FDP under sections OC 30 or 31”, but the company may not have FDP to pay under these sections: it should refer to “any further FDP payable under sections OC 30 or OC 31”. Officials agree that a clarifi cation would improve the linkage and readability, but the standard drafting style is “if any”. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 59, the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current section ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That clause OP 93 should make explicit that clauses GB 35 and GB 36 apply to CTR credits as if they were an FDP credit. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 31 Part O – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society Clause OP 105( 3) refers to BETA debits for an amount of a payment of FDP that “may have been paid to reduce a tax loss”. The words should be “may have been paid by an election to reduce a tax loss”. It may not be correct to refer to FDP being “paid” as no payment is ever made. What date is “day of payment”? However, the same problem exists in current section MF 4(4)(a). Clauses OE 12(3) and OP 105(3) should be consistent. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Law Society That in clause OP 112, the words “before or after” should be replaced by “before or on the same date” (see current section ME 13(3)). Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 32 Part R – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause RC 7(6) there is a drafting error in line 1 where “they” should be “the”. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the reference to clau se RC 11(3) under use of GST ratio for two-month payers should refer just to clause RC 11. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RD 50(4) should refer to “setting out the tax year in which the threshold is to start to apply” rather than “the tax year in which the threshold is to apply”. Clause RD 50(4) authorises an Order in Council to set thresholds for the purpose of section RD 48. The policy intention is that the regulation should state the first year in which the threshold is to apply. That the submission be accepted and the drafting clarified. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RG 6(7) should refer to section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 instead of section 150 of the Tax Administration Act. Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause RM 21(6) should refer to subsection (2)(c) rather than subsection (3)(c). Officials agree with the submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in Table R1, the reference to clause RC 11(3) under use of GST ratio for two month payers should refer just to clause RC 11. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. 33 Part Y – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YA 1 “designated source investments”: That the reference should be “sec tion HR 3(7)” rather than “section HR 3(8)”. An opening bracket is required before the word definitions. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YA 1 “employer’s premises”: That the defined term “employer’s premises” refers to a definition in subclause CX 23(2) and that term should be used in that subclause instead of the phrase “premises of a person”. Officials agree that there is a disconnection to be corrected. However, officials believe that the correction should be to replace “employer’s premises”, as the defined term, with “premises”. That the submission be accepted but the correction made to replace the defined term with “premises”. Antony Lipscombe New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That there is an inconsistency between section YB 14 and Table Y1 whereby sectio n YB 14(2) states that it applies to the 1988 and 1990 version provisions and Table Y1 provides that YB 14(2) applies to the 1973 and 1988 version provisions. Officials agree with the submission. That the su bmission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the headings for subclauses YB 13(1) and (4) should be clarified. That the headings for subclauses YB 13(1) and (4) should be clarified. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause YB 15(5) s hould refer to the term “associated person” rather than “associated” to be consistent with the heading to the subclause and the rest of the clause. Officials agree with th e submission. That the submission be accepted. KPMG New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Clause YD 1(2) permanen t home (1): A permanent home is not the same as a permanent place of abode; therefore the change in wo rding changes the existing law. Officials consider that that no change is intended and that the change in wording from “abode” to “home” substitutes an older term that effectively meant “home”. However, it is also agreed that the use of “permanent home” could lead to an argument that the nuanced meaning accorded to “permanent place of abode” is no t carried over into the rewritten Act. Officials also acknowledge that the meaning of “permanent place of abode” is difficult to a pply and uncertainty exists about its application. Officials also agree that determining the extent to which the nuanced meaning can be drafted into the rewritten Act is a policy issue beyond the scope of the rewrite project. That the submission be accepted but that the relationship of the concept of permanent home to a person’s centre of economic interest be referred to Policy Advice Division for consideration of inclusion in to the tax policy work programme. 34 Part Y – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause YD 4(16), that the reference to “section YD 7” which deals with the apportionment of film rental income is incorrect. The reference to “section YD 7” should be replaced by a reference to “section YD 8(2)”. That the submission be accepted. 35 Schedules – Recommend to be accepted Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Accountants In Schedule 50, in section 32L(4) of the TAA, the reference to “subsection (3)” should be replaced by a reference to “subsection (2)”. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. New Zealand Institute of Accountants In Schedule 51, that th e typographical error in relation to clauses LA 1 to LA 10 be corrected. Officials agree with this submission. That the submission be accepted. 36 37 REVISED TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDATIONS ON SUBMISSIONS ON BILL – RECOMMENDED TO BE DECLINED The following table lists technical and drafting issues raised in submissions that officials recommend be declined. 38 39 Parts C to E – Recomme nd to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That subclaus e CB 30(2) is in error as it does not restrict its application to association rebates determined by reference to payments that would be taken into account in determining the member’s gross income. Officials note that this submission appears to be in relation to clause CB 33(2) rather than cl ause CB 30. Officials consider that the concluding wording of clause CB 33(1) deals with this issue. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That for great er clarity, clause DV 19(2)(a) could be substituted with the words “the total amount of association rebates paid to members during the income year”. Subsection (4) could then be deleted. The effect of the section is that the association could never achieve a deduction for more than the profits made through the transactions, so there is no harm in allowing a deduction for the full amount of the association rebate, if less than the formula amount, regardless of whether the rebate can be linked to a mutual transaction or not. Officials consider this is a matter of drafting preference. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause DV 19(4) does not clarify the meaning of current section HF 1(2). Officials consider that subclaus e DV 19(4) accurately rewrites section HF 1(2)(a) of the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause DV 19(4) should emphasise more that the deduction is for the amount of association rebates paid to a member in relation to a mutual transaction. Officials consider the section alr eady achieves this objective. Th at the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause DV 19, the reference to BC 4 is circular. This submission appears to be a reference to the Exposure Draft provision, rather than the b ill, as there is no reference to section BC 4 in clause DV 19 of the bill. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause DV 19(6) the words “in subsection (5)” should be added to clarify which formula is being referred to. This appears to be a reference to the Exposure Draft provision, rather than the bill, as there is only one formula in clause DV 19. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society The term “reb ate” should be removed from clause DV 19(7) unless it is intended to refer to an association rebate, in which case the full term should be used. The term “the rebate” used in the provision drafting style is considered to be a clear refe rence to the term “association rebate” appearing earlier in the provision. That the submission be declined. 40 Part F – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause FA 3 results in an unintended law change as a result of the deletion of the proviso from the current section FC 3 and that the proviso should be reinserted into the clause. See main body of report. That the submission be declined, but that the relationship of this rule to the current legislative structure and, in particular, the anti-avoidance rule relating to dividend stripping be a priority matter on the tax policy work programme. New Zealand Law Society That in Part F, the alphanumeric system should be followed and no gaps left between subparts. The gaps in the subparts (and the parts) have been left to cater for possible future policy initiatives. This approach will permit more subject matter to be grouped using the two letter alphanumeric style so that the use of three character alphanumeric labels can be avoided. (For example, in the 2004 Act, subparts inserted with similar subject matter include subparts NBA, NBB, and NEA.) That the submission be declined New Zealand Law Society That clause FM 31 should specifically exclude local authorities from the consolidated group rules. Officials note that the wording adopted for clause FM 31(1)(c) follows the wording containe d in the amendment to the definition of “eligible company” in section 155(1) of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. This new definition in that Act does not state that a company that derives only exempt income includes a local authority that is not a council-controlled organisation. That the submission be declined 41 Part G – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the refe rence in clause GB 6(2) to the “relevant company” is unc lear since there are two companies referred to in subsection (1). Officials consider that subclaus e (2) sufficiently clearly (in a plain English drafting context) applies to whichever company has become an attributing/qualifying company as a result of the arrangements. Clause GB 6( 1)(b) is clear that either company may be a qualifying company. The policy of this anti-avoidance rule is to disallow entry into the rules for any company if the shares have been subject to an arrangement for the purposes of making them an attributing/qualifying company to defeat the intention and purpose of the rules. That the submission be declined. However, the words “(the relevant company)” should be inserted in clause GB 6(1)(b) after “another company”. New Zealand Law Society That for the sa ke of clarity, “to the extent” should be inserted after “this section applies when” in clause GB 8(1). Officials consider that introdu cing the words “to the extent” are unnecessary as the section identifies the scope adequately without those words. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That a rule dealing with negative amounts should be included in clause GB 29. Current section GC 14C(6) provides that if a reduction results in a negative amount, the amount is not attributable to the working person (person C). Officials consider that the comb ined operation of the rules in this provision mean that a negative amount should not arise. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In section cl ause GB 47, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be desirable to insert the words “For the purposes of sections GB 45 and GB 46 at the start of both subsections. Section 5 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1999 states that headings to a section are part of the legislation, and the courts have interpreted that provision as applying unless the heading would be inconsistent with the text of the section. The words in this heading are consistent with the text of the section, and so no change is required. In addition, officials consider that it is undesirable to adopt an “avoidance of doubt” drafting style in a plain language approach. A section plainly and clearly expressed is intended to address those boundaries. In addition, the heading to the section indicates that the rule is for the purpose of clauses GB 45 and GB 46. That the submission be declined. 42 Part G – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause GB 48, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be desirable to insert the words “For the purposes of sections GB 45 and GB 46 at the start of both subsections. Section 5 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1999 states that headings to a section are part of the legislation, and the courts have interpreted that provision as applying unless the heading would be inconsistent with the text of the section. The words in this heading are consistent with the text of the section, and so no change is required. In addition, officials consider that it is undesirable to adopt an “avoidance of doubt” drafting style in a plain language approach. A section plainly and clearly expressed is intended to address those boundaries. In addition, the heading to the section indicates that the rule is for the purpose of clauses GB 45 and GB 46. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That subclauses GB 49(1)(b) and (c) should be returned to one subsection to read “the arrangement has an effect that means that a requirement of the definition of returning share transfer is not met so as to defeat the intent and application of this Act”. Officials consider that br eaking the sentence into subparagraphs aids readers in this case as in others. However officials propose that “a purp ose” in subparagraph (c) be replaced by “the effect”. That the submission be declined, but a modification be made to subparagraph (c). New Zealand Law Society Clause GC 2(3) should be clarified to read “section GC 1(3) does not apply to land with standing timber that is subject to a right to take timber”. Officials consider the wording in clause GC 2(3) adequately addresses the matter raised in the submission. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in clauses GC 7 to GC 11, the proposed definition of a person as a taxpayer is unusual. Taxpayer is already defi ned in clause YA 1. The word is not used as a defined term, but as a shorthand reference for the purposes of a short series of sections. Use of “taxpayer” is intended to help the reader distinguish between the various parties and is pref erable to, say, “Person A”. That the submission be declined. 43 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That clause HC 1(1)(a) should state that the subpart provides for the taxation of the income derived from trusts. Officials consider that this wordin g is inaccurate, as the trust rules include taxable distributions. The term “taxable distributions” will, in relation to a non-complying trust, include distributions of capital gains of the trust. Offici als are of the view that using the term “distributions” is the most appropriate term for income tax purposes. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That clause HA 7(2) should contain a capacity test. An additional test of capacity is unnecessary. The capacity of the trustee acting in their personal capacity is distinguished from their capacity as a trustee under the defi nition of “trustee” in clause YA 1 (section OB 1 of the 2004 Act). That definition provides: th at “Trustee for a trust,— (i) means the trustee only in the capacity of trustee of the trust; and (ii) includes all trustees, for the time being, of the trust Therefore, it is clear that HA 7(2) cannot apply to a trustee acting in a capacity other than as trustee of the trust. That the submission be declined. 44 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause HC 14, the transfer of value concept in relation to distributions should be replaced with a list contained in a definition of “distribution”. The drafting approach adopted reflects the style of having a general rule with specific exclusions, rather than a list of inclusions that extend a general term to help a re ader get a clear understanding of the meaning of the definition. The 2004 Act definition of “distribution” is very extensive, with paragraph (a) applying to every vesting of interest in a beneficiary of property of a trust, any payment of property to a beneficiary of a trust, or the application for the benefit of a beneficiary of any property of a trust. In addition, this general conc ept is extended in paragraph (b) of the definition of distribution (2004 Act) to include transfers of property and service transactions between a trustee and beneficiary where the transfer value adopted benefits the beneficiary. The extended meaning includes settlements made by the trustee of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary if the amount settled would have been either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution or from debts forgiven out of natural love and affection. While subsection (2) of clause HC 14 includes settlements, it is possible that they are already caught by section HC 14(1). This might be one example where the submission has merit. However, that could be drafted around by amending section HC 14(2) to begin: “Despite subsection (1), a settlement for the benefit of a beneficiary is treated as a transfer of value only – ” Neither the submission nor officials have been able to identify any particular situation that would fall outside the current definition that falls within the meaning of transfer of value. In subsection (12), the drafting could be improved by replacing the words after “because” with the words “the person is a beneficiary of the trust”. That the submission be declined, but the drafting in clause HC 14 be clarified New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 15, that the reference to the election under section HZ 2 needs to be included (current HH 4(6)(a)(ii)). Officials consider that this submission is incorrect as the reference to section HH 4(6)(a)(ii) of the 2004 Act is set out in clause HC 25(3), which rewrites section HH 4(6) of the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined. 45 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That, in clauses HC 16, HC 20 and CW 52, a distribution from a complying trust is not exempt income. It is not income at all but a distribution of corpus, capital gain, or accumulated income which has already been taxed to the trustee. In the bill, to “carve out” distributions from a trust that would otherwise be income in the hands of the beneficiary, it is necessary to treat the distribution as either ex cluded, exempt or non-resident’s foreign-sourced income. This ensu res consistency with the meaning of income and assessable income in the core provisions. At present, the rule in section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act states distributions of this nature from accumulated income of a complying trust (qualifying trust) are excluded from being income of the beneficiary. This provision exists because a distribution from a trust (not being beneficiary income) could otherwise be income for income tax purposes. Officials consider that a distribution of accumulated income from a complying trust can be income in the hands of the beneficiary in some circumstances, irrespective of the treatment under trust law. An example where this can occur is the payment of a pension from a superannuation fund, which is a complying trust. The provision in section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act is to ensure that a distribution of this nature is not included in the annual calculation of taxable income of the beneficiary. The policy of section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act is to ensure that double taxation does not occur. Double taxation would occur as income tax is paid on the trustee income retained , and then again by the beneficiary if the distribution is income. Officials consider that the most appropriate category is exempt income as the policy is that the beneficiary may not have a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving a distribution from a superannuation fund. No change in outcome is intended. That the submission be declined. 46 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause HC 27, the transfer of value concept should be removed from the definition of “settlor”. The drafting style adopted is agai n the generalised approach with specific exclusions. If specific exampl es of transfers of property or services are identified, they will be incorporated as an exclusion from the rule. The definition of “settlor” in the 2004 Act is extensive and covers all dispositions by a person to or for the benefit of a trust (in terms of the trust) of property, making available of property at less than market value, services at less than market value. It also extends to a person who uses property or services of a trust for consideration greater than market value, and includes the abstai ning of entering into transactions and also is extended further in specific situations set out in section HH 1. Neither the submission nor officials have been able to identify any particular situation that would fall outside the current definition that falls within the meaning of “transfer of value”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HC 29(3), that the word “is” should be changed to “has been” for consistency with current legislation. Also “an income year” should be “the income year”. The corresponding provision in the 2004 Act is section HH 4(5)(a). The relevant wording in that section is “... a settlement is first made ... on the terms of the trust...”. This is the same wording contained in clause HC 29, and therefore offi cials consider the drafting has accurately reflected the existing la w. But officials agree with the submission on the income year. That the submission be declined, but that “an income year” be changed to “the income year”. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se HC 35, the effect of section HH 3A(2) of the 2004 Act has not been included (income tax paid on behalf of a beneficiary) and this should be corrected. Also, the effect of section HH 3F(2A) of the 2004 Act has not been included (balance date of trust) and this should be corrected. Section HH 3A(2) has been rewritten as clause HD 12, and contains the agency rules for trusts. The compare note for clause HD 12 indicates that clause HD 12 relates to section HH 3A(2) of the 2004 Act. Section HH 3F(2A) of the 2004 Act has been rewritten into clause HC 35(3), in the meaning of “minor”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That the re written clauses HD 15((3) and (4) contain an unintended broadening of the scope of the rule by rendering directors liable for all income tax liabilities the company is unable to meet after the arrangement is entered into, not mattering whether it was an effect of the arrangement that the tax liability was unable to be satisfied. Officials consider that under the plain English drafting style adopted throughout the rewrite of the Act, a first reference to a term is generally preceded by the indefinite article. Subsequent references to that term after the section are normally preceded by a definite article (for example, “the”) indicating a reference back to the original expression of that term. In this context, the term “the tax liability” identified in subclauses (3) and (4) is intended to refer to the term “a tax liability” set out in clause HD 15(1)(b) (and (c)(ii). That the submission be declined. 47 Part H – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society That the de finition of “mutual transaction” in clause HE 2 does not need to refer to clause DV 19. Officials consider that the term “mutual transaction” applies for the purpose of clause DV 19 (which rewrites aspects of section HF 1) and that this cross-reference helps the reader link the two sections. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in subp art HF, there is an inconsistency of terminology: “elect ”, “election” and “electing” should be used throughout. Not “choose”. Officials consider this is a matter of drafting style. For example, the verb “choose” is used to distinguish between the act of making an election from the outcome of the actio n, that is the noun “election”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HF 2, it is noted that the provision refers to sections HF 2(2)(c), (3)(c), and (7) of the 2004 Act, which were removed by amendment effective September 2004. Officials note that the provisions referred to were not only repealed, but they were replaced by section 214 of the M ā ori Fisheries Act 2004 with provisions that refer to the entities referred to in the clause. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause HF 4, that the reference to “genuine investment” could cause definitional issues, not guidance. The term “genuine investment” re places the concept of “bona fide investment” used in section HI 4 of the 2004 Act. Officials note that the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines “bona fide” as meaning “acting or done in good faith; sincere(ly); genuine(ly)”. No change in meaning is intended. Officials note that this term is used elsewhere in the bill without definition as, for example, in clauses DB 56, DC 2 and GB 24. However officials propose a change to remove the tautologous words “carried out in good faith”. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause HF 11(2) requir es an acceptance date. Currently no requirement is set out in the drafting. Officials agree that s ection HI 3 of the 2004 Act does not provide a time at which acceptance is required. This outcome results from the amendment to section HI 3 in section 209 of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 which changed the policy from the date of acceptance to the dates referred to in clause HF 11(2). That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That in clause HR 1, there is no reference to co-trustees; current section HD 1(1)(a) appears to be omitted. The rule in section HD 1(1)(a) of the 2004 Act has been incorporated in the trust rules in section HC 2 (Obligations for joint trustees for calculating income and providing returns). In addition, the definition of “trustee” includes co-trustees. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause HR 1 no longer refers to co- trustees. The definition of “trustee” in clau se YA 1 states that the term “trustee” includes all trustees fo r the time being of the trust. Therefore, officials consider it is u nnecessary to refer to co-trustees in this provision. That the submission be declined. 48 Part I – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section IC 5 should contain an extension of time for an offset election as currently provided by section IG 2(3) of the 2004 Act. The intention is that section IC 5(2)(a) provides for the offset election and IC 5(2)(b) provides for the s ubvention payment election. The time by which the election is to be made is given by section IC 9. IC 9(2) states that the notice of election or payment under IC 5(2) must be given to the Commissioner by ... “the extended return date ... or the later date allowed by the Commissioner.” As a minor drafting correction, the word “either” should be omitted from section IC 5(2). That the submission be declined. 49 Part L – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That section LB 1(2) should only refer to the situation when the particulars of an employer monthly schedule are incorrect and not include when the Commissioner does not receive the employer monthly schedule. The opening words of sec tion LD 1(2) of the 2004 Act require that the Commissioner must have received a monthly schedule before he is able to credit PAYE in the manner set out in section LD 1(2). This wording was inserted by section 126 of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. It is clear that the monthly schedule is necessary in order for the CIR to correctly apportion PAYE received from employers between the different employees and give the appropriate tax credit to each employee. That the submission be declined, but that the wording be reviewed to ensure that the credit is not permanently denied. New Zealand Law Society That in clau se LB 5, in the list of defined terms: add “replacement payment”. In reviewing this submission, officials have identified that there is no equivalent rule for subclause (2) in the 2004 Act and that subclause (2) should be omitted. That the submission be declined but that subclause (2) be omitted. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 2, the last item of section LB 2(2B) of the 2004 Act has been omitted (taxpayer whose imputation credit giving rise to the tax credit is category A income of the trustee of a group investment fund). Section LB 2(2B)(d) is referring to a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. Paragraph (c) of the definition of “company” in clause YA 1 includes a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. Officials consider that it is unnecessa ry to refer to a group investment fund in this clause as paragraph (a ) of clause LE 2 requires the person to be a company, which includes a group investment fund to the extent of its category A income. This outcome is consistent with the Society’s observations on clause HR 2 that it is desirable to more clearly identify that a gr oup investment fund is treated as a company to the extent of its category A income. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause LE 5, the exception from section LB 1(2) of the 2004 Act is omitted. A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the purpose of the Act. As indicated previously, the fund is treated as a company. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to a beneficiary deriving a distribution from a trust. This approach is also consistent with the Society’s observation made in submissions on clause HR 2 and with the approach for unit trusts. That the submission be declined. 50 Part L – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Law Society In clause LF 3, there is an omission of the exception in current section LB 1(2). A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the purpose of the Act. As indicated previously, the fund is treated as a company. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to a beneficiary deriving a distribution from a trust. This approach is also consistent with the Society’s observation made in submissions on clause HR 2 and with the approach for unit trusts. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society In clause LO 2, there is an omission of the exception in current section LB 1(2). A beneficiary of a group investment fund in relation to the fund’s category A income is a shareholder. This arises from paragraph (d) of the definition of “share” which treats the beneficiary’s interest in the category A income as a share for the pur pose of the Act. It is therefore unnecessary to identify that this rule not apply to this beneficiary. That the submission be declined. 51 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group That the legislation in Part M should be redrafted to give effect to the stated purpose of clarifying and simplifying the legislation. The policy underlying the Working For Families Tax Credits is complex. While the drafting for complex policy can be expressed in plain language, experience in drafting rewrite legislation indicates that complex policy inevitably results in complex legislation. This can be illustrated by refere nce to Part O which sets out the rules for memorandum accounts where comple x policy is also addressed. The target audience of the rewrite was identif ied in the discussion document, paragraph 3.3 of Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, process, guidelines , issued in December 1994: “Regardless of how readable or user-frie ndly the rewritten Act becomes, taxpayers will usually find it easier to obtain elsewhere the tax-related information they need. Such taxpayers will still benefit, however, from the rewrite. A rewritten Act that better communicates the law will assist the producer s of secondary sources to better explain the laws.” The discussion document then identified, in paragraph 3.4, that “the primary audience for the Act itself will comprise groups such as: • the courts; • lawyers and accountants (p articularly tax specialists); • authors of secondary sources that explain the application of tax laws; • Members of Parliament; • tax policy analysts and people who want to make submissions on proposed legislation.” This policy remains the basis on which the drafting of the Income Tax Bill has been prepared. We note that Inland Revenue has on its website a series of pages dedicated to explaining entitlements and obligations in relation to the Working for Families Tax Credits that fulfils the objective of having secondary sources explain the application of tax laws to “the disadvantaged members of th e community”. This site is also supported by a dedicated website “Working For Famili es Tax Credit,” a jo int project between Inland Revenue and Work and Income. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MA 7(1)(c) be omitted from the bill. This clause defines “full-time earner” which is relevant to eligibility for the in-work payment and the family tax credit. Both of these assistance measures are based on household income. Subclause MA 7(1)(c) accu rately rewrites paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of “full-time earner” in the 2004 Act. That the submission be declined but officials should review the draft to improve readability. 52 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group That paragraphs (ii) and (iii) should be removed from clause MC 6(b). The submitter offers no reason why these paragraphs should be removed. The context of the submission suggests that the submitter disagrees with the policy. The rewrite of the Act is not intended to be a forum where po licy matters such as this are considered. Clause MC 6(b) rewrites the proviso to the definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3(1) of the 2004 Ac t. That proviso states that a pe rson is not entitled to receive the Family Tax Credit if the person is in receipt of any income-tested benefit, a veterans pension or a war widows mothers’ allowance (now termed parent’s allowance under section 32(2)) of the War Pensions Act). The change in terminology from war widows mothers’ allowance reflects the amendments to the War Pensions le gislation in the War Pensions Amendment Act 1988. The cross- reference in the Income Tax Act was not picked up at that time. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 2(2)(c) should reverse the order of subparagraphs (i) and (ii); (i) first reduces the amount of the in-work payment before the reduction of the amount of the family support. Officials consider that the or der of the calculation in subp aragraph (c) of clause MD 2(2) replicates the equivalent provision (section KD 2A of the 2004 Act). Officials consider that this matter is not an issue that is able to be addressed in the rewrite project. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That in clause MD 9(4), the denial of the in-work payment to any family where the accident occurred before January 2006 is agai nst the spirit of the ACC Act, highly discriminatory and unjust. The exclusion from in-work payment of recipients of earnings-related compensation paid as a result of incapacity that arose be fore 1 January 2006 follows the provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. They had been eligible for the Child Tax Credit only for the first three months of eligibility for compensation. Officials consider that the reve rsal of that policy is not an issue that is able to be addressed in the rewrite project. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That clause MD 11(1)(b)(i) be amended to replace “social assistance payment” with “income-tested benefit” and not include ACC or non-income tested benefits. The subparagraph rewrites section KD 2AB(1 )(a) of the 2004 Act. The term “social assistance payment” replaces the term “specifi ed payment”. The new term is intended to provide the reader with a better indication of the nature of the payments termed “specified payments” in the 2004 Act. The types of payments included within th e meaning of the term “social assistance payment” are set out in clause MA 8. This list of payments accurately replicates the list of payments included in the meaning of “specified payment” in the 2004 Act. One of the types of payments listed is “i ncome-tested benefit”. To replace “social assistance payment” with the term “income- tested benefit” would narrow the meaning and so result in an unintended change in policy. That the submission be declined. 53 Part M – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation Child Poverty Action Group In clause MF 7, that family plus components should not be able to be adjusted beyond the increase in the Consumer Price Index as allowed for family support. This submission is concerned with the policy intention of the family plus rules. Officials consider this is a policy matter not able to be considered in rewriting the provisions. That the submission be declined. Child Poverty Action Group That the clauses in Part M relating to the in-work payment be rewritten to be consistent with principle of the Child Support Act relating to material standards of living following parental separation. This submission is concerned with the policy intention of the in-work payment rules. Officials consider this is a policy matter not able to be considered in rewriting the provisions. That the submission be declined. 54 Part O – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the use of tables in Part O is a different style from the rest of the Income Tax Bill and is a departure from the drafting guidelines. The submitter notes that the use of tables is supported where the subject matter is complicated or repetitious and would be better presented in tabular form. Officials consider that Part O contains legislation that is complex and repetitious, and that tables assist the reader to access the text of the legislation. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Law Society That clause OB 1 omits a reference to the trustee company rule fr om current ME 1(3). Officials consider this is unnecessa ry as the definition of “trustee” in clause YA 1 makes clear that a trustee acting in their personal capacity is distinct from the trustee capacity. That the submission be declined. 55 Part R – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Subpart RC – That sections MB 26, MB 28 and MB 36 of the 2004 Act be inserted into the bill. Officials noted that section MB 26 duplicates provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act and sections MB 28 and MB 36 replicate provisions in the Tax Administration Act. These provisions are therefore unnecessary in the cont ext of the Income Tax Act. That the submission be declined. 56 Part Y – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That a definition from other legislation should be replicated in the Income Tax Act instead of defining the term by cross-reference to the primary (other) legislation. The drafting practice of adopting a specialised definition from other Acts of Parliament is addressed in the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s Drafting Manual . Paragraphs 5.257 to 5.258 of the manual states that “it is important to be aware of not redefining terms that should have a consistent meaning across the statut e book. The correct approach is to adopt the specialised definition – for example, “medical practitioner” as defined in section 5 of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 ... A definition contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 should not be repeated in other enactments.” The main purpose of this drafting practice is to ensure that when a specialised definition in its primary legislation is amended, that revised meaning applies immediatel y across the statute book. This overcomes the very real risk of error that can occur when an Act of Parliament replicates instead of cross-referring to specialised definitions in other legislation. Officials consider that this practice assists the reader by ensuring that the correct meaning of a specialised term is always contained in the Income Tax Act. Therefore, in draftin g income tax legislation, there is no reason to depart from the drafting practice mandated by the Parliamentary Counsel Office. That the submission be declined, although a reference to the Interpretation Act and, in particular, the definition of “person” in that Act could be inserted in Part A to assist the reader. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That the use of acronyms is not recommended for income tax legislation. A definition is used to give a standard meaning to words or phrases that occur frequently throughout the bill. Officials consider the use of acronyms is a common feature in everyday income tax practice. The use of acronyms assists the reader by avoiding repetition of long phrases in the text of the legislation, and is easier to read. For example, a PCA company stands for the phrase “a policyholder credit account company”. Similarly, when the fringe benefit tax rules were introduced in 1985, the term FBT was quickly adopted in everyday language. Resident with holding tax very quickly became known as RWT. That the submission be declined. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants In clause YA 1, in the definition of “adjusted tax value”, the reference to paragraphs (a) and (b) in clause FO 16 is confusing and should be more specific and refer to paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause FO 16(3). Officials agree that a reference shou ld be specific and clear. However, in this case, which relates to the adjusted tax value of a pool of depreciable property, the reference is to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition. However, some redrafting can make that clearer. That the submission be declined, but some redrafting will clarify the linkage. 57 Part Y – Recommend to be declined Name Submission Comment Recommendation New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants That in clause YA 1 the defined term “person” should be defined fully in the Income Tax Bill or, alternatively, the definition in section 29 of the Interpretation Act 1999 should be referred to in a definition of “person” in the bill. Paragraph 5.258 of the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s Drafting Manual states: “... A definition contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 should not be repeated in other enactments.” The reason for this drafting style is that the Interpretation Act 1999 is intended to apply to every Act of Parliament and so collects together terms that are intended to have a common meaning across the entire statute book. An underlying presumption of the Interpretation Act 1999 is that the users of any legi slation are expected to know the existence and content of this Act. Officials consider that defining te rms in other legislation that are defined within the Interpretation Act 1999 undermines the purpose of the Interpretation Act. Officials consider it is inappropriate generally for income tax legislation to depart from this statute-wide drafting practice unless there is a compelling reason. “Per son” was not defined (except for limited purposes) in the Income Tax Act 2004. However, officials propose a reference in Part A to the Interpretation Act and its definition of “person”. That the submission be declined, but that a reference be made in Part AA to the Interpretation Act and, in particular, to that Act’s definition of “person” 58 59 TABLE OF OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDED CHANGES Officials recommend that the submissions listed in the following table be accepted. The submissions fall into four types, as explained below. 1. Drafting changes required as a result of enactments passed since the bill was introduced. Examples include: • KiwiSaver Act 2006. • Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. 2. Drafting changes to increase the consistency of the language and layout. Examples include: • Putting blocks of text into subclauses or paragraphs to improve readability. • Using a single expression instead of two or more expressions of the same meaning. 3. Correcting drafting problems identified by officials. Examples include: • In clause HD 26(1), omitting “gross” from the term “gross income”. • In clause RA 22, omitting subclause (1) as being unnecessary and, in the list of defined terms to clause RA 22, omit “income tax”. 4. Drafting changes arising as a result of officials consulting with advisors to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 60 61 Changes from 2006 amending legislation Submission Comment Recommendation Insert clause CB 25B.
