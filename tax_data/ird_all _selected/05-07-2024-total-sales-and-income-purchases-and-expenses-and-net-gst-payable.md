24OIA2324 Page 1 of 8 5 July 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 11 June 2024. You requested the following: Can we please request the following information in relation to Goods and Services Tax (GST): Separated into the GST periods ending in the years 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022; 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 and 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024; 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024: 1. Broken down by Industry (using BIC code or other industry identifier used by Inland Revenue): a. The total Sales and Income (GST taxable supplies) – Box 5; b. The total Purchases and Expenses (GST purchases) – Box 11; c. The total net GST payable or refundable per GST return period – Box 15 (showing GST payable as a positive number and GST refundable as a negative number, or other indicator you choose to differentiate between GST payable and refundable). Industry classification Classification of taxpayer into industries has been done using the Australian New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) data held by Inland Revenue. Please note, this data does not have full coverage and may not reflect the current industry for taxpayers that have not updated their information with Inland Revenue. Taxpayers for whom Inland Revenue does not hold an ANZSIC code have been included in the “unknown” industry category. Information being released I have provided, enclosed as Tables 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, a breakdown of total sales and income, total purchases and expenses and total net (Inland Revenue) GST payable broken down by industry for the years ended 31 March 2022, 2023, and 2024 as at 3 July 2024, and rounded to the nearest $10 million. Table 3 has been further broken down by splitting apart taxpayers with net GST to pay for their full year from those with a net refund. The released information does not include gross GST collected by the New Zealand Customs Service. Collections from Customs often result in refunds of input credits in the Inland Revenue data. Exports are also included in box 5 but are zero rated for GST, resulting in refunds of any input credits. 24OIA2324 Page 2 of 8 Returns for the June 2024 return period are not yet available; the year to 31 March 2024 has been provided and is comparable to the other requested years. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz ) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. Thank you for your request.
