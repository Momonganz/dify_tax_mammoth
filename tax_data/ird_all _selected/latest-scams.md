Fake IRD number application websites

11 October 2024

We've seen an increase in websites doing fake Inland Revenue (IRD) Number applications.

These websites offer to help you get a IRD number for money. Instead of giving you an IRD number, these websites steal your payment and your personal information.

These scams often advertise on Google and social media platforms like X (Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

We will never make you pay to apply for an IRD number. You can find out how to apply on our website.

Remember to never give out your personal information unless you're sure of who you're dealing with. Run it past someone you trust to help you check, or if you are still unsure, please contact us/

Scammers cold-calling businesses to offer savings and discounts on tax bills

11 November 2022

We have seen an increase in scammers cold-calling business customers. The scammers pretend to be from real businesses and offer savings of up to 50% on tax bills (including small business loans). They may say they are offering discounts because they have vouchers which are about to expire.

The scammer pays the tax bill to us in full and the victim pays the discounted amount to the scammer.  Meanwhile, the scammer cancels the payment to us, leaving the victims out of pocket and with a tax bill to pay.

The scammers are using several names including Discount Club/Wel Network/Wel Network Marketing. We will never contact businesses to offer ‘discounts’ on your tax debt. If you cannot pay your tax debt, get in touch with us to talk about your options.
