You pay it in instalments during the year instead of a lump sum at the end of the year. You’ll have to pay provisional tax if you had to pay more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return. This guide tells you how to manage your provisional tax instalments. This guide covers: how provisional tax works who has to pay it how to calculate it when to pay it what happens if you do not pay budgeting for provisional tax a glossary to help you understand the tax terms we use. We explain all the tax terms we use in this guide on pages 33-35. Provisional tax 4 How provisional tax works Provisional tax is not a separate tax. It's income tax you pay during the year and helps you ‘spread the load’ and avoid a big end-of-year tax bill. You must pay provisional tax if, at the end of the previous year, you're left with tax to pay of more than $5,000. We call this amount your ‘residual income tax’ (RIT). Specifically, RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families). Your RIT may exceed $5,000 if you earn untaxed income, or not enough tax has been deducted to cover your income tax for the year. Examples are: self-employed or rental income schedular payments or salaries and wages with a low PAYE rate income from a partnership or look-through company income from an estate or trust overseas income. In most cases, you pay provisional tax in three instalments during the year, based on what provisional tax option you choose. When you complete your income tax return and calculate your tax for the year, you deduct the provisional tax you paid earlier. Any taxpayer who pays income tax may have to pay provisional tax. This includes individuals, companies and trusts. Provisional tax is income tax you pay during the year. Provisional tax helps you spread the load. RIT is the amount of tax to pay on your taxable income, less any PAYE deducted and any other tax credits you may be entitled to (except Working for Families). 5 When to pay your instalments When you pay your provisional tax instalments depends on your balance date - the last day of your tax year. This guide assumes you have the standard balance date of 31 March. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/provpaymentdates Note – Where the instalment date is a weekend or public holiday, payments made on the next working day will be treated as being paid on the instalment day. Transitional year If you change your balance date, you may need to calculate the provisional tax for your ‘transitional year’ a bit differently. That's because your transitional year - the first year with the new balance date - will be for a period of more or less than 12 months. You must get approval from us to change your balance date. If we approve your new balance date, we'll tell you when your instalments are due. Example Last year Matt earned a salary and had self-employed income. Salary $ 14,800 Plus self-employed income (net profit) $ 47,600 Taxable income $ 62,400 Tax on taxable income $ 11,740 Less tax deducted from the salary $ 1,610 Residual income tax (RIT) $ 10,130 Matt’s RIT is more than $5,000 so they will have to pay provisional tax for the following income year. Provisional tax 6 Your options for calculating provisional tax The idea behind provisional tax is simple. You're trying to calculate an amount that will closely match the RIT you expect for the year. That way, when you complete your tax return and deduct your provisional tax, you should only have a small amount of end-of-year tax left to pay. You may even receive a refund. There are 4 ways to calculate provisional tax: the Accounting Income Method (AIM) the standard option the estimation option the ratio option. Because most people do not know how much tax they'll need to pay next year, calculating provisional tax usually involves a certain amount of judgement. You'll need to decide which provisional tax option works best for you. If you do not make a choice, the standard option will apply. You can choose any option for the year ahead (except the Accounting Income Method) by completing a box in your current income tax return, sending us a message in myIR, or calling us on 0800 377 774 If you want to use AIM to calculate your provisional tax for the year, you need to send us a statement of activity using your AIM-capable software. The Accounting Income Method (AIM) option The Accounting Income Method (AIM) aligns your provisional tax payments with the periods in which you have income to work out your instalments. You will pay provisional tax under the AIM option while you’re making a profit. If you’re not making a profit, payments will not be required. Choose the option that works best for you. Your provisional tax payments are based on your profits for the period. 7 If you’re currently using the estimation option, you must submit your first statement of activity by your first provisional tax instalment date for the year. If you’re using the standard or ratio option, you can choose to use the AIM option at any time, provided that: you submit your first statement of activity before your final provisional tax instalment date for the year, and you have made all payments due under your current option up to the date you switch. Once you choose to use AIM for the year you cannot choose another option until next year. When your provisional tax is due Your due dates for AIM are generally the same as your GST due dates: monthly (if you're registered for monthly GST filing) or 2-monthly (if you're registered for 2 or 6-monthly GST filing) If you're not registered for GST, your dates would be the 2-monthly GST due dates that align to your balance date. Qualifying for the AIM option Aim is available to individuals and companies with a turnover under $5m. If your turnover goes over $5m during the year you can request to continue to use AIM. You cannot use AIM in a year that you change your balance date. AIM-capable accounting software To use the AIM option, you must have AIM-capable accounting software provided by an approved AIM provider. Calculating your provisional tax At each due date your AIM-capable accounting software will work out your provisional tax payments and let you know how much to pay (if any). Payments align with your GST due dates. You'll need AIM-capable accounting software Provisional tax 8 Statement of activity As well as working out your provisional tax, your software will also collate your income and expense information and send it to us in a Statement of Activity. Overpayments If you have a drop in profit that means you may have overpaid your provisional tax during the year. Under the AIM option you can get a refund straight away. You can include instructions on what you would like done with the overpayment on your statement of activity. If you do not provide any instructions we will refund the overpaid amount. A Statement of Activity is not an income tax return. The standard option The standard option assumes your income will increase from year to year. When your provisional tax is due Generally, you’ll pay 3 instalments on: 28 August 15 January 7 May If you’re registered for GST and you file 6-monthly GST returns, you’ll only pay 2 instalments on: 28 October 7 May You can get overpaid provisional tax refunded straight away. The standard option assumes your income will increase from year to year. 9 Filing your tax returns When you use the standard option, your provisional tax is calculated from your previous year's RIT. You need to file your tax return on time, so you'll know your RIT before your instalments are due. If you do not have an extension of time to file your return, you'll need to file it by 7 July every year. That gives you time to work out how much provisional tax you need to pay, and prepare for your first instalment on 28 August. If you file your returns late, you still need to pay your provisional tax instalments on time. Complete your return so you can work out how much you need to pay. Penalties and charges can apply if you pay an instalment after the due date. Filing your return if you have an extension-of- time arrangement If you have an extension of time to file your tax return, you could have to pay an instalment of provisional tax before you know what your RIT is. In this situation, you'll calculate your provisional tax instalments using the RIT from 2 years ago, plus 10%. When you file your return, you'll do a special ‘catch- up’ calculation to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. Remember to file your returns on time. If you're using a tax agent, they'll usually have an extension of time. Provisional tax 10 The standard option Your provisional tax equals your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. For example, if your RIT was $10,130, your next year’s provisional tax will be $10,636. If you have an extension of time to file your income tax return and have not filed on or before your first or second instalment date, your provisional tax will be based on your RIT from 2 years ago. If your RIT from 2 years ago was: over $5,000, add 10% to the total under $5,000, you do not have to pay provisional tax. Once you file your tax return for the previous year, your provisional tax will be recalculated based on that year’s RIT plus 5% less provisional payments made. The following table shows how you would do the calculation for provisional tax instalments. if return filedInstalment 1 (P1)Instalment 2 (P2)Instalment 3 (P3) Due date 28 AugustDue Date 15 January Due Date 7 May On or before 28 AugustPrevious year’s RIT plus 5% ÷ by 3 = amount to pay for each instalment. After 28 August and on or before 15 January the next year (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay After 15 January the next year but on or before 7 May (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay (Previous year’s RIT + 5%) less (P1 + P2) = amount to pay Next year after 7 May(RIT 2 years ago + 10%) ÷ 3 = amount to pay (RIT 2 years ago + 10%) × 2 ÷ 3 less P1 = amount to pay Expected RIT from previous year + 5% less P1 + P2 Even if you filed your return after 7 May, your provisional tax will still be based on your previous year’s RIT. 11 Example Ned’s company, EJ Auto Services, has an extension-of time arrangement. Its 2023 return does not have to be filed until 23 January 2024, so Ned will have to pay the company’s first 2 instalments of 2024 provisional tax (due 28 August 2023 and 15 January 2024) before he knows how much the RIT will be. He goes back 2 years and looks at the company’s 2021 RIT: EJ Auto Services 2021 RIT $ 24,000 Add 10% $ 2,400 $ 26,400 Using the ‘catch-up’ method, Ned pays the following instalments of provisional tax: 28 August 2023 $8,800 ($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 15 January 2024 $8,800 (($24,000 + $2,400) ÷ 3 × 2) − $8,800 The company files its 2023 return on 23 January 2024 showing an RIT of $23,740. The final catch-up instalment is: 7 May 2024 $7,327 ($23,740 + 5% \[$1,187\] − $8,800 − $8,800) Note – Where the instalment date is a weekend or public holiday, payments or returns filed on the next working day will be treated as being filed on the instalment day. This will have implications for the uplift that should be used. If your return for the previous year is assessed/ amended within 30 days of an instalment date If the return for the previous year is either assessed (Inland Revenue changes the assessment amount) or amended within 30 days of a provisional tax instalment date, that provisional instalment will not change. But if you file your return within 30 days before an instalment date then that instalment amount will be as calculated in the return you filed. Provisional tax 12 Example John has filed his 2023 IR3 return on 7 July 2023. His provisional instalments for 2024 are: 28 August:$3,000 15 January:$3,000 7 May:$3,000 His return is then reassessed on 20 December 2023, creating an increase in his 2023 RIT. As there are less than 30 days between the reassessment his second provisional tax instalment date, the increase in the amount of provisional tax payable will be included in the third instalment as follows: 28 August:$3,000 15 January:$3,000 7 May:$5,500 If the RIT from 2 years prior was $5,000 or under, provisional tax will only need to be paid in 1 or 2 instalments, depending on when the tax return is filed. In this case, the provisional tax will be evenly split between the required number of instalments. If your income changes When you are on the standard option, expect your RIT to be $60,000 or more and have paid all but your final instalment in full and on time you can make a payment for your final instalment that better reflects your income situation and remain on the standard option. You can change from the standard option to the estimation option at any time up until the date your final instalment is due. After you've made the change, you cannot then change back to the standard option for the same tax year. 13 The estimation option The estimation option could be right for you when your income is dropping. Using the standard option might mean you overpay your provisional tax. Your provisional tax equals your estimated RIT for the year. It works like this. Add up all the taxable income you expect to receive next year. Calculate the tax on this figure. Deduct any PAYE and other tax credits (except Working for Families) you'll be entitled to. The result is your estimated RIT, and this is your provisional tax for the year. When your provisional tax is due Generally, you'll pay 3 instalments, due 28 August, 15 January, and 7 May. But if you're registered for GST and you file 6-monthly GST returns, you'll only pay 2 instalments, due 28 October and 7 May. The estimation option may be a good choice if your income is dropping. Provisional tax 14 Example Hiwi is a property developer and a polytech lecturer. The property market is in a slump and Hiwi expects his net profit to decrease in the coming year. His tax agent advises him to switch to the estimation option to work out his provisional tax. Hiwi’s calculations: Net profit from property sales $ 170,600 Plus polytech salary $ 78,000 Expected taxable income $ 248,600 Tax on taxable income $ 72,958 Less PAYE deducted from the salary (not including ACC earners’ levy) $ 16,660 Estimated RIT $ 56,298 Hiwi’s provisional tax is $56,298 to be paid in 3 instalments on: 28 August $ 18,766 15 January $ 18,766 7 May $ 18,766 $ 56,298 Underestimating your provisional tax It pays to keep a close watch on your profits because you could be charged a penalty if your provisional tax estimation is unreasonably low, compared with your actual RIT once you file your return. You’ll need to tell us how much residual income tax you expect to pay. You can estimate: using the Estimate provisional tax service in myIR sending us a message in myIR by calling us by writing to us. You may have to pay a penalty if you underestimate your provisional tax. 15 You can estimate your residual income tax as many times as you like up until your final instalment due date. If you do re-estimate, you'll need to adjust later instalments to take into account any earlier under or overpayments. Example In February, Hiwi realises his year is going better than he first thought. He re-estimates his provisional tax to $65,000. So far, he’s paid 2 instalments: 28 August $18,766 15 January $18,766 His new estimate means these instalments are now too low. Hiwi’s final instalment must cover this underpayment. His new calculation is: Re-estimated provisional tax $65,000 Less instalments already paid $18,766 $18,766 $37,532 $27,468 Hiwi’s final instalment, due 7 May, is $27,468. The ratio option This option can suit people whose income tends to go up and down during the year. You calculate your provisional tax by applying a ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in your GST returns so your provisional tax instalments align with your business cashflow. We calculate your ratio percentage by dividing your RIT for the last tax year by your total GST taxable supplies for the same year. If your last year's figures are not available, we base the ratio on the RIT and total GST taxable figures from the previous year. Changing options Once you've selected the estimation option, you cannot change to the standard option during the same year. The ratio option may be helpful if you have seasonal income. Provisional tax 16 When your provisional tax is due Using the ratio option, you pay 6 instalments of provisional tax a year. If you have a 31 March balance date, your due dates are 28 June, 28 August, 28 October, 15 January, 28 February, and 7 May. Qualifying for the ratio option The ratio option is useful if your income varies or you have seasonal income. You must meet all these criteria to use it: You’ve been in business and registered for GST, for the whole of the previous tax year, and part of the tax year before that. Your residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year is greater than $5,000 You file your GST returns monthly or 2-monthly. You’re not a partnership. Your ratio percentage that we calculate for you is between 0 and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not). The ratio percentage You must let us know before the start of the tax year if you decide to use the ratio option. We'll calculate the ratio percentage for you, using information from your income tax and GST returns. GST ratio percentage = RIT from your latest income tax return × 100 total GST taxable supplies from the same tax year (less ratio percentage adjustments - see page 18) 1 Only provisional tax payers registered for GST who file one- monthly or 2-monthly returns can use the ratio option. The ratio percentage will only work if your returns are up to date. We cannot calculate a ratio percentage using returns from a tax year more than 2 years earlier than the provisional tax year. 17 Example Leonie is a kiwifruit grower in Te Puke. She files 2 monthly GST returns. On 20 February, she applies to use the ratio option to work out her provisional tax. We approve this and review her latest returns. Her RIT is $51,000, and her taxable supplies are $2,114,723, broken down as follows: GST return periodTaxable supplies ($) April - May690,025 June - July580,121 August - September145,859 October - November90,412 December - January152,681 February - March455,625 Total taxable supplies$2,114,723 Leonie's ratio percentage is: $51,000 × 100 =2.4%\* $2,114,7231 \*Your ratio percentage is rounded down to 1 decimal place. Calculating your provisional tax We'll tell you your ratio percentage. Calculate your provisional tax instalments, following the steps on the back of your GST return. You work out each instalment by applying the ratio percentage to the taxable supplies in each GST return (2-monthly filers) or every second GST return (one- monthly filers). Provisional tax 18 Leonie has approval to work out her 2019 provisional tax using a ratio percentage of 2.4%. She can now do the calculations.

You can start using your new ratio percentage 30 days from the date of our letter. Adjusting your ratio percentage If you sell a fixed asset, you can ask us to adjust your ratio percentage. Enter your details under ‘Provisional tax’ on the back of your GST return. Because we treat sales of fixed assets differently in income tax and GST returns, you may pay too much provisional tax if your ratio percentage is not adjusted. The value of the fixed asset you're selling must be the same or more than: $1,000, or 5% of your total taxable supplies for the previous 12 months. We'll use the larger amount. A fixed asset is an item owned by the business that will generally be used in the business for more than a year, and is not for sale to customers, eg, buildings, vans, equipment. 19 Ceasing the ratio option You can stop using the ratio option at any time. You just need to let us know by phone or email. If you stop using it before the first payment due date, you can choose to use the standard or estimation option to calculate. The usual use of money interest rules will apply from this time. If you stop using it after the first payment date, you must use the estimation option to calculate for the rest of the year. You must stop using the ratio option if: you cease your GST registration any of your GST returns are overdue by 60 days or more your ratio percentage change is no longer between 0% and 100% (we’ll let you know if it’s not) you change your GST filing frequency to 6-monthly a return of income is filed or amended where the residual income tax is calculated at below $5,000 or above $150,000. Provisional tax 20 Penalties We charge penalties on late or underpaid instalments of provisional tax. When you make a payment, it will be applied to the earliest unpaid provisional tax instalments. Provisional tax amounts include any late payment penalties charged. Late payment penalties We charge late payment penalties (LPPs) on all overdue payments. We charge the penalties in 2 stages. This means that the longer a payment remains overdue, the more penalties we’ll add. The stages are: 1% the day after the due date, and 4% 7 days later. We can stop some late payment penalties being added to your account if you set up a plan with us to pay your tax. Example Anthony had to pay provisional tax of $7,600 on 7 May for the 2022 income year. He paid it on 10 July, over 2 months late. LPPs were added as follows: DateAmount owing ($) LPPLPP added ($)New amount owing ($) 8 May 20227,600.001%76.007,676.00 14 May 20227,676.004%307.047,983.04 Total383.04 We charge penalties on late payments. 21 Shortfall penalties We may charge a shortfall penalty if you use the AIM or estimation options to calculate your provisional tax and your provisional tax is unreasonably low. We compare the provisional tax you paid to the RIT you calculate when you file your tax return, and apply the penalty to the underpaid amount. The amount of the shortfall penalty depends on the seriousness of the mistake. MistakeShortfall penalty Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable tax position20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion150% When you need to pay your penalties You must pay any penalties as soon as you get them. You must also pay any overdue provisional tax at the same time. You cannot claim a deduction in your income tax or GST returns for any penalties you pay Inland Revenue. Provisional tax 22 Interest on provisional tax We may charge interest for end-of-year tax paid late or unpaid end-of-year tax and provisional tax (see ‘Paying and receiving interest’ below). Interest is a charge for the use of money and is sometimes referred to as UOMI. This means we may pay you interest if you overpay your provisional tax. We calculate interest when you file your income tax return. We compare your RIT to the provisional tax you've paid. You may have to pay interest even if you've paid your instalments in full and on time, or if you did not have to pay provisional tax. Paying and receiving interest Not everyone will pay interest on underpaid provisional tax. And not everyone will receive interest if they've overpaid their provisional tax. We'll calculate interest for: individuals and non-individuals who used the standard option, with RIT: –$60,000 or more (see explanation below). –less than $60,000, if payment not made by the terminal tax due date for the 2022-23 year or later. Prior to 2023 UOMI was charged if provisional tax payments were paid late/not paid in full. anyone who used the estimation option, with RIT over $5,000 anyone who chooses to use the AIM option but does not pay the provisional tax instalments their AIM- capable accounting software tells them to pay by the instalment date anyone whose RIT is $5,000 or less who chose to be a provisional taxpayer (individuals also need to have used the estimation option) - see ‘Choosing to be a provisional taxpayer’ on page 28. IRD number on the online RWT exemption register. Interest is not a penalty - it's a charge for the use of money. 23 Anyone choosing to be a provisional taxpayer has to use the estimation option. We will not charge interest if the underpaid or overpaid tax is $100 or less. When using the standard option the start date of UOMI depends on your RIT (when all required payments are made in full and on time). Provisional tax amount End of year residual income tax (RIT) Credit or debit UOMI Calculated from More/less than RIT amount Less than $60,000Debit/Credit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Terminal tax due date More than RIT $60,000 or moreCredit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date Less than RIT $60,000 or moreDebit UOMI calculated on the difference between the provisional tax amount paid and the RIT Last instalment date, or earlier if underpaid/paid late RIT under $60,000 (standard option) from the 2022-23 year You will have UOMI applied from the Terminal tax due date even if the provisional tax payments are not made in full and/or on time. Late payment penalties will still be charged on late payments. RIT $60,000 or more (standard option) If you’ve paid all but your final instalment in full and on time then UOMI will apply from the last instalment due date. Note: Even if your final instalment is paid in full and on time, we will calculate UOMI from the final instalment date based on the difference between your RIT and the total provisional tax paid. Provisional tax 24 If you pay an instalment (other than the last 1) late or do not pay in full, UOMI will be charged from the due date of that and subsequent instalments (other than the last 1) on the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that you should have paid less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year less the amount paid. If the previous year’s return was not filed on or before a provisional tax due date, and you have an extension of time, the amount that should have been paid for that instalment will be the lesser of the 10% uplift amount (based on 2 years prior) or the 5% uplift amount (based on the previous year). This does not apply to the final instalment. The above changes may not apply if: you're associated to specific persons or entities with 1 of you being a company and they are not covered by the above standard option rules or they do not use the GST ratio option, or you've entered an avoidance arrangement. For interest under the AIM option refer to page 27. How we calculate interest We use this formula to calculate interest on provisional tax: t × r ×d 365 Where: t = the underpaid or overpaid tax (including LPPs) r = the current interest rate d = the number of days where interest applies. Different rates of interest apply to underpaid and overpaid tax. Interest rates change frequently. See our website for the current and previous interest rates ird.govt.nz/penalties 25 We count both the first day that interest starts and the last day interest is payable when we calculate the number of days interest applies. When you need to pay your interest If we charge interest, you need to pay it by 7 February (or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Because interest is charged daily, you may want to pay it before the due date. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay. You can claim a deduction in your income tax return for the interest you paid. If we pay you interest, you need to include it as income. Interest is GST exempt, so you do not include interest (paid or received) in your GST returns. Example ABC Ltd is a construction firm. Karen, the finance manager, used the standard option to calculate provisional tax of $24,000. Instalments were due on: 28 August $8,000 15 January $8,000 7 May $8,000 $24,000 The company only paid the first instalment on time. When Karen filed the company’s tax return on 7 July, she calculated RIT of $66,000. The company had a total of $58,000 still to pay. Because the RIT was more than $60,000 and the company did not pay all the provisional tax instalments in full and on time, the company had to pay interest. To find the amount that we charge interest on for all instalments except the final 1, we firstly identify the shortfall, which is the lesser of: the amount of the instalment that was payable ($8,000) less the amount that was paid, or your RIT divided by the number of instalments for the tax year ($66,000 ÷3 = $22,000) less the amount paid. The longer you leave it, the more you’ll pay. The longer you leave it, the more you'll pay.

Interest and the AIM option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the AIM option as long as your make your payments in full and on time. If the amount of a provisional tax instalment calculated by your AIM-capable accounting software is not paid on time, penalties and interest will apply to the underpayment. These will continue to apply until you make a payment. Interest and the ratio option You will not pay (or receive) interest on any of your provisional tax instalments if you use the ratio option for the full year. But, we'll charge interest if you owe more than $100 after your end-of-year tax due date (7 February, or 7 April if you have a tax agent with an extension of time). Late payment penalties will apply to instalments paid late or not paid in full. Provisional tax 28 Choosing to be a provisional taxpayer You can choose to be a provisional taxpayer if you're in this situation: your RIT works out to be $5,000 or less you've made provisional payments of more than $5,000 you had a reasonable expectation, on the day you made your first payment, that you would have to pay provisional tax. Talk to your tax agent first. Then let us know when you file your tax return if you want to be treated as a provisional taxpayer for the year. We may calculate interest on your voluntary payments. Individuals will need to estimate their provisional tax on or before their third instalment date to have interest calculated. We can help if you're finding it hard to pay Penalty and interest charges can increase your provisional tax payments quite quickly, so you'll save money if you pay your instalments in full and on time. If you cannot pay, call us as soon as you can - before the due date, if possible. We'll work with you to develop a solution that takes into account your personal circumstances. Do not let your debt get out of hand. Talk to us straight away. You can pay your instalments electronically, by credit or debit card. Find all the details of our payment options at ird.govt.nz/pay 29 Your first year in business Your first year in business is not tax-free. You'll need to file an income tax return at the end of your first year and pay tax on your net profit. You will not have to pay provisional tax during your first year in business unless your previous year's RIT was $5,000. But, you can make voluntary payments of provisional tax. In your second year you may have to pay end-of-year tax for your first year, on top of provisional tax instalments for your second year. Your end-of-year tax could be a significant amount if you do not have any voluntary payments to deduct. Voluntary payments will help if you need to pay interest, and may entitle you to an early payment discount. ird.govt.nz/early-payment-discount Example Isobel started her own business in October 2018. In June 2019, she sent in her first income tax return, for the year ended 31 March 2019. Her RIT (which is also her end-of- year tax) was $75,000. Isobel used the standard option to work out her 2020 provisional tax of $78,750. RIT $ 75,000 Plus 5% $ 3,750 2020 provisional tax $ 78,750 Isobel's due dates and payments are: Due dateTax to payAmount 28 August 20192020 provisional tax$26,250 15 January 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 7 February 20202019 end-of-year tax$75,000 7 May 20202020 provisional tax$26,250 Because she made no voluntary payments for 2019 income tax, Isobel must pay her $75,000 end-of-year tax as well as her $78,750 2020 provisional tax during her second year in business. Voluntary payments can help your cash flow. You can opt into the Accounting Income Method (AIM) in your first year of business by sending us your first Statement of activity with your AIM capable software. By using AIM, you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit and your end-of year-tax will be closer aligned. Find out more about AIM on page 6. Provisional tax 30 Early payment discount In your first year in business you can qualify for the early payment discount, if you make voluntary tax payments during the tax year before you need to pay provisional tax. Individuals, partners in a partnership or owners of a look- through company can claim the early payment discount, but companies, trusts and other forms of business organisations do not qualify. You can get the early payment discount if you meet the following criteria: Your income comes mainly from a business (not interest, dividends, royalties, rents or beneficiary income). You're not required to pay provisional tax during the year you make the voluntary payments, or for any of the prior four years. You make the voluntary payments on or before the end of your tax year. You apply for the discount on or before the date your tax return must be filed (tick the box in the return). The discount is a percentage of either: the total amount of your voluntary payments 105% of your RIT for that year. We'll use the lesser amount. The early payment discount is treated as a payment towards your RIT. Further early payment discounts You can receive another early payment discount in another year if: you have not had to pay provisional tax in any of the previous 4 tax years, and you have not had any business income in the 4-year period since you last paid provisional tax or claimed the discount. You may get a discount if you make voluntary payments. 31 For more information on the early payment discount, please refer to ird.govt.nz/first-year-tax New provisional taxpayers The rules may apply differently if you’re a ‘new provisional taxpayer’. We may charge interest on a reduced number of instalments. If you’re an individual, we consider you’re a new provisional taxpayer if: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more your RIT was $5,000 or less in each of the 4 previous years, and during the current year, you stopped receiving income from employment and you then started to receive income from a taxable activity. If you’re a non-individual (eg, a company or a trust), the conditions are as follows: your RIT for the current tax year is $60,000 or more you did not receive income from a taxable activity in any of the 4 previous years, and you started receiving income from a taxable activity during the current year. Number of instalments As a new provisional taxpayer, you'll pay or receive interest on 1 to 3 provisional tax instalments, based on the date you started your taxable activity. Taxable activity startsNumber of instalments Before 29 July3 On or after 29 July but before 16 December2 On 16 December, or any time after that1 You'll have different dates if you have a balance date other than 31 March, or you file six-monthly GST returns. Talk to us or your tax agent if you need more information. Provisional tax 32 Budgeting for your provisional tax You need to know how much your provisional tax instalments are, and when you need to pay them. A basic budgeting principle is to put aside some money each month so you can be ready when the due date rolls around. It's important to budget for your provisional tax when you first start out in business because you may have to pay your first year's end-of-year tax bill during your second year, when you'll also have provisional instalments to pay. See page 29 for more information. Budgeting will help you meet your deadlines - especially when you start out in business. 33 Terms we use AIM capable accounting tax software.
