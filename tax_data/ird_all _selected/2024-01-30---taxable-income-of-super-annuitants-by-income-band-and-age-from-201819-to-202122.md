\[24OIA1693\] Page 1 of 4 30 January 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 January 2024. You referred to tables produced for an earlier OIA response in 2020, and requested an update in a similar format to cover the 2018-19 to 2021-22 income years as follows: The first request is for the following information: taxable income of superannuitants by income band. \[...\] Two tables, one showing income bands for superannuitants, and another showing the number of superannuitants with incomes above each threshold. Relevant years: 2018/19 to 2021/22 Income bands: - Up to 30,000 - Between 30,001 and 50,000 - Between 50,001 and 100,000 - Between 100,001 and 150,000 - Between 150,001 and 200,000 - Between 200,001 and 300,000 - Over 300,001 Using the same income bands, y ou additionally requested the following for the same income tax years 2018-19 to 2021-22 inclusive: Taxable income of superannuitants by age. The output I am looking for is a table that shows the number of superannuitants in each age band with taxable income in each income band. Relevant years: 2018/19 to 2021/22 Age bands: - Aged between 65 and 69 - Aged between 70 and 74 - Aged between 75 and 79 - Aged between 80 and 84 - Aged 85 and over Income bands: - Up to 30,000 - Between 30,001 and 50,000 \[24OIA1693\] Page 2 of 4 - Between 50,001 and 100,000 - Between 100,001 and 150,000 - Between 150,001 and 200,000 - Between 200,001 and 300,000 - Over 300,001 Tables 1 and 2 below respond to your first request and show the number of New Zealand superannuation recipients broken down by income band for the income years 2018-1 9 to 2021- 22 inclusive, with 2021-22 being the most recent complete year. The first table provides the number of people with taxable income within income ranges, and the second table presents the same data as reverse-cumulative sums, thereby displaying the number of people with incomes above each threshold. The income bands are based on taxable income, which includes New Zealand superannuation itself (as this is a taxable transfer). It also includes other income declared on personal tax returns or used in the annual tax square-up such as PAYE-related earnings, rent, dividends, interest, overseas income and self-employment. Taxable income does not include portfolio-investment entity income (for example, income earned in KiwiSaver schemes), or tax-paid income received via other entitles, for example distributions of tax-paid trustee income. The data was extracted from Inland Revenue’s systems on 23 January 2024.

People with invalid dates of birth on Inland Revenue databases are included in the under-65 subtotals, the age data is improved in 2021-22 and there were fewer invalid cases. \[24OIA1693\] Page 3 of 4 Table 3: 2018-19 NZ super recipients by taxable income and age Taxable income band Age not available or under 65 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85 and over Total Up to 30,000 24,319 107,671 121,886 97,470 68,987 73,968 494,301 30,001 to 50,000 4,818 37,540 32,346 19,521 11,067 13,057 118,349 50,001 to 100,000 4,392 54,020 26,026 11,229 5,419 5,432 106,518 100,001 to 150,000 895 13,117 4,773 1,764 870 876 22,295 150,001 to 200,000 307 3,680 1,543 598 282 278 6,688 200,001 to 300,000 216 2,228 954 410 191 187 4,186 More than 300,000 214 1,605 676 333 140 140 3,108 Total 35,161 219,861 188,204 131,325 86,956 93,938 755,445 Table 4: 2019-20 NZ super recipients by taxable income and age Taxable income band Age not available or under 65 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85 and over Total Up to 30,000 23,673 106,518 123,428 97,831 70,183 72,658 494,291 30,001 to 50,000 5,040 38,655 36,431 22,606 13,433 15,494 131,659 50,001 to 100,000 4,471 56,793 28,712 12,531 6,091 5,784 114,382 100,001 to 150,000 908 15,098 5,582 1,885 984 930 25,387 150,001 to 200,000 318 4,123 1,737 621 291 291 7,381 200,001 to 300,000 247 2,536 1,077 431 227 172 4,690 More than 300,000 201 1,704 753 368 145 138 3,309 Total 34,858 225,427 197,720 136,273 91,354 95,467 781,099 Table 5: 2020-21 NZ super recipients by taxable income and age Taxable income band Age not available or under 65 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85 and over Total Up to 30,000 23,127 111,029 132,917 104,931 77,810 77,258 527,072 30,001 to 50,000 4,714 37,436 34,404 20,993 12,382 12,901 122,830 50,001 to 100,000 3,968 56,307 27,611 11,557 5,725 4,787 109,955 100,001 to 150,000 758 16,335 5,633 1,891 883 687 26,187 150,001 to 200,000 321 4,628 1,849 656 328 229 8,011 200,001 to 300,000 220 2,835 1,184 452 215 121 5,027 More than 300,000 333 2,492 1,241 553 246 184 5,049 Total 33,441 231,062 204,839 141,033 97,589 96,167 804,131 \[24OIA1693\] Page 4 of 4 Table 6: 2021-22 NZ super recipients by taxable income and age Taxable income band Age not available or under 65 65-69 70-74 75-79 80-84 85 and over Total Up to 30,000 10,798 116,291 139,795 117,495 87,929 85,017 557,325 30,001 to 50,000 1,107 34,852 30,969 19,992 12,295 10,777 109,992 50,001 to 100,000 971 57,840 28,755 12,779 6,345 4,514 111,204 100,001 to 150,000 224 18,741 6,728 2,431 1,154 734 30,012 150,001 to 200,000 122 6,063 2,519 989 515 277 10,485 200,001 to 300,000 103 3,001 1,310 520 263 150 5,347 More than 300,000 59 1,887 870 361 195 152 3,524 Total 13,384 238,675 210,946 154,567 108,696 101,621 827,889 Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public.
