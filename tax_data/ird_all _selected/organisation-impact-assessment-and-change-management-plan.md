\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Organisation Impact Assessment & Change Management Plan Core Tax & Policy Release 2.0 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Identifies the changes and impacts for our people and our organisation as a result of the implementation of Release 2.0, and in relation to the new organisation design. Outlines the change approach and plans for getting our people ready , mostly through communications, training and support Our approach to measuring and monitoring change readiness for our leaders and our people via change readiness assessments. The changes being introduced in Release 2.0 are: Legislative changes effective 1 April 2018 (including payday filing of employer information and the Accounting Income Method for provisional tax) Budget 2017 changes (including Income tax and Working for Families tax Credit rates and thresholds ) Collecting employer Information in START, and processing it in FIRST Automatic Exchange of Information (AEIO) in START Collections and Community Compliance campaign leads in START New work being managed as a CASE in START Imagingof returns, structured forms, unstructured correspondence Keying (batch data entry) in START instead of \[Information redacted\] for Release 2.0 returns and structured forms New payment and disbursement channels and processes New eServicesfor customers Moving three tax product groupings to START : Withholding tax – 8 products Gaming Machine Duty –3 products Fringe Benefit Tax – 3 products The changes being introduced in Release 3.0 are: Income Tax Working for Families Tax Credits Customer master in to START Context and Introduction We are seeking approval for the Core Tax and Policy Release 2.0 Organisation Impact Assessment and Change Implementation Plan (D2117). This deliverable provides the detail for the people readiness component of the Business Readiness Framework, specifically: 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] A total of 4,700 people are impacted to varying degrees by Release 2.0. This impact has factored in the new groups, teams and roles in CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS. A large portion of employer information work (EMS) will move into START. EMS is a core information source for most of our tax types and is a part of most roles in Service Delivery with amendments and error resolution requiring work to be done across two systems. Our people will need to be ready to support our customers t hrough the transition period, with a focus on education through Community Compliance, LE Services and Contact Centres. More than 700 of our people will use START for the first time and will b e required to work in both FIRST and START; Transactional mostly for EMS, Litigation Management, Community Compliance, International Revenue Strategy and Corporate Legal for case management. The look and feel and navigation for employer information in S TART is very different to FIRST and will take time to learn. Many of our people will need to work across both systems Broad awareness of higher volumes of credit transfers between s ystems and the potential impacts should failure occur is required. The high impact is due to cross account transfer and number of co-existence interface files. Changes to imaging, case management and the introduction of o ther tax types (e.g. FBT, Withholding Taxes) Legislative changes across AIM/PAYE/AEOI. Increasing numbers of people will be required to do co-ex istence work across Service Delivery and PF&F (reporting and revenue accounting). New workflow and security permissions will be active in START b ased on new roles and delegations in the new business groups – CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS. More detailed impacts by business group are provided in Appendix B.

More detail is provided in Appendix A. 2.User Support - t h e IRKB and START on- line help are a key component of ensuring our people have the procedural information they need in both FIRST and START, and are kept informed of changes during Early Life Support. 3.Introduction of ‘Key Users’, mad e up of people from across business units and locations, to work on a variety of Release 2.0 programme activities and, at the same time, build their capability so they can assist with embedding and sustaining the solution. 4.Tailored Communications f or each of the four change groups. 5.The people change readiness asse ssments provide assurance to decision-makers that IR’s people in highly impacted areas are ready for each release. 6.The Early Life Support (ELS)ap proach and plans will be developed later this year and will be developed with many people across the Release 2 teams. Business groups impacted by Tax and Policy Release 2.0 have been segmented into four change groups based on degree and type of impact. The change group determines the level and type of change activity required to ensure our people are ready for go-live, with a focus on training, on-the-job support tools, communications and people readiness. 4 Change groups and alignment to the new organisation from February 2018 We are confident that our change groups will map to the segments and teams in the new CCS-I, CCS-B and IIS organisations . This has been done by mapping where the work will actually be done in the future state . Detailed work continues on workflow mapping specific to the new roles. Note - More detail on the role mapping for each business group in relation to Core Tax and Policy impacts is available on request.

For Release 2 it has been identified that: For most people at IR for Release 2, a larger portion of their work will be either in START, or require co-existence with START. Revised planning based on the two release strategy indicates that there will be an anticipated reduction in training duration/effort because the extent of training our people require will reduce, although this cannot be quantified reliably until the detailed Training Needs Analysis is complete and decisions about workflow are made. It will impact 4000+ people. To manage the complexity, the business groups impacted have been segmented into four change groups based on degree and type of impact – from high touch to low touch. The T raining Needs Analysis for Release 2 for Tax and Policy will be initially based on current state then mapped to future statenow the new Organisational Design is finalised. Business units and team leaders will play a larger role in determining the training needs of their people based on their skill sets and the work they will do. Training will be planned over a 4 - 6 month window – pre learning, on-line learning, classroom training and on the job learning (supported by Key Users) a key component of the overall approach. Classroom training will be delivered close to go live. We will build on the training branding, media and methods of Stage 1 and continue to use L earnIRfor access to learning pathways and materials. We will do some things differently based on lessons from Stage 1: Introduce ‘Key Users’, made up of people from across business units and locations, to work on a variety of Release 2.0 programme activities and, at the same time, build their capability so that they can assist with embedding and sustaining the solution Focus on the big things IR people need to know well for Day 1/Week 1 v ersus other information they can learn more slowly (just in time training); including targeted training sessions for leaders Train our people to support customers through the Release 2 customer change (aligning to our customer approach) which will besig nificant both in customer numbers and complexity Align to the integrated approach to learning by providing opportunities for our people to have more time for informal and on th e job learning (being the 70% experiential learning (10%/20%/70%)) alone and/or with their peers,supported by learning delivered formally, online and in the classroom; A START training environment to provide learners with more tailored practice pre go-liv e; Smaller class size, from 16 to 12 and supported by Key Users in the classroom. Engage leaders more actively throughout the training life cycle and potentially train a wider group of managers and team leade rs where their teams will be most impacted 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] For Release 2: A team of 8 people will start in July to make all required updates for Release 2. The team will work closely with the Training team to ensure alignment and integration. Changes to what we build will be required after go-liv e and this will be managed as part of Early Life Support. Online Help will provide high level guidance, rather than step-b y-step instructions. This is in line with our new way of working – users will decide the best way to complete tasks. What we’ll be doing: Documenting Release 2 operational policy and procedure content for internal use only in START Online Help and START Contextual Help. Updating Contextual Help for difficult operational tasks within START where r equired. Updating (merging) or overriding START Core Help with IR-s pecific content as required. Aligning the Release 2 START Online Help content under the relevant Help Table o f Contents category. Archiving IRKB pages no longer relevant post Release 2 go-liv e. Reviewing and updating IRKB pages and calculators impacted by Release 2 Removing/updating Stage 1 Co-E xistence procedures in START Online Help and the IRKB that are no longer relevant or need changing. Updating new Release 2 Co-E xistence procedures in START Online Help and the IRKB. Online Help •Online Help will be more high level than the IRKB, in line with our new ways of working. •Approach will change as START Online Help will be developed earlier to support training pilot requirements. •Review and testing approach changing to help maintain balance between procedural support for our people and embedding the new ways of working. Contextual Help •This form of help will be used more in Release 20.0 with the aim of helping support people with a further reduction of step-by -step instructions in START Online Help. •Contextual help will be added in START when certain criteria is met. Core Help •Will continue to be built and developed by FAST as needed. •Can be found in same search and index as START Online Help pages. •Will continue to be hidden or customised if they do not fit in a New Zealand context for Release 2.0. The IRKB and START On-Line Help are a key component of ensuring our people have the procedural information they need to work in both FIRST and START, and are kept informed of changes during Early Life Support. Change approach snapshot –User Support 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Key features of the tailored communications approach are: Support impacted teams and their leaders with targeted information, predominantly via face-to-face engagement. Continue to build awareness and understanding by regularly updating IR people on progress towards go-live and key milestones through existing channels. A targeted approach will be used for staff and leaders aligned with the change management groupings. Emphasis on face-to-face engagement and discussion using existing channels, and some new ones. Leaders will be supported with regularly updated key messages and resources which they can use to continue to consistently lead and inform their teams and incorporate into their own communications to their business areas. Communications activity will be aligned with other BT communications (Our New Organisation and Intelligent Workplace) and with broader IR internal communication, to ensure consistency and to avoid ‘information overload’. Business Transformation Managers will be a key conduit for information, and will be supported with a structured communications and engagement programme. Change approach snapshot –Tailored Communications 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Change approach snapshot –People Change Readiness Assessment Key features of the people change readiness assessment are: To provides assurance to decision-m akers that IR’s people in the highly impacted areas are ready for Release 2 in April 2018. Create a key check in that will confirm that “we are where we expect to be” at key po ints and as an input to the Business Readiness Checkpoints beginning in October. Method will be via a survey sent to Team Leaders to completed following a discussion with their team members. Thresholds will be set to indicate acceptable levels of readiness. The results will also hel p us to identify any gaps and issues early, so we can re-plan accordingly. Training metrics (for example enrolment and completions) will be tracked to ensure t hose that must be ready for go-live have completed the relevant training on schedule. Key people metrics will be monitored throughout implementation for those teams in Gr oups A & B. This will serve three purposes: to identify any ‘red flags’ that might affect the success of the implementation, provide data for post-implementation review and a comparison as we move through successive stages of BT. Group A: Population Samplefor survey, in-depth interviews with key teams and monitoring of training and people metrics. GroupB: Population Sample for survey and monitoring of training and people metrics. Group C: Population Samplefor survey and monitoring of training and people metrics.

For example, Financials grace periods/credit transfers/manual actions Appendix A : Updated Assessment of Training Impact 13 August, 2017WIP \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Collections BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Returns & Forms Employer information will be collected in START (both monthly and for payday reporting) and sentto FIRST for processing assessments as a monthly file. EMS amendments and some error resolution actions must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to work across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and because of the delay in processing information across the two systems. Returns & Forms Conversion will create some “ghost” returns like it did in Stage 1 to manage the conversion of transactions in FIRST that do not have a return associated to them. Our people will need clear guidelines for working with converted transactionsand data. Tasks that involve working with converted data may take longer initially as our people adapt. eServices/myIR Functionality introduced for stage 1 becomes available for products as they are migrated and mastered in START in Release 2 e.g., file and pay (direct debit), instalment arrangements and managing account access. Note: START will not include PAYE payment functionality during co- existence. Our people will need to be aware of this and understand the options they have to educate and assist customers in real time, e.g. viewing customer sessions. Payments One-offdirect debit payment option from Australian Bank Accounts when customers want to file and pay will be available for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. In future stages this option may expand to other countries and regular payment options. Future stages of BT will see this option expand to other countries and regular payment options. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of this option so they can inform and assistcustomers to access this expanding payment channel. Compliance Child Support teams managing amendments to employer deductions will need to update information twice – in START and FIRST. Design still TBC in regard to processes involved when converting EMS to correspondence. Amending child supportdeductions on the EMS will take longer as our people will need to update two systems. Compliance Insolvencies will be managed as a case within START. This case type will manage the entire process from IR commencing liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings to the completion of liquation or bankruptcy. This case type will include insolvencies where IR is notified of an insolvency even if the customer has no debt with IR. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. Compliance Adjustment cases for write-offs and remissions will be updated to accommodate more than one entity per case. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Collections BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Adjustment cases for write-offs and remissions will be updated to accommodate more than one entity per case. Our people will need to knowhow to use new cases and additional case functionality. Initially this may reduce productivity as the way these types of work are handled changes. These cases will mean cases and associated information (including documents) will be accessible from START. ​Analytics Campaign design will continue to be managed outside of START before the data is loaded into START where scoring and prioritisation can be applied using Discovery Manager before leads are created. Our people who manage workflow for those business areas that are actioningleads will need to be aware of the process however this should have minimal impact on their day to day activities. Financials There will be some conversionimpacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Credit Transfers between START and FIRST (auto and manual) have added complexity. Our people will need to apply care when transferring credits between systems to avoid errors. Financials Incremental late payment penalties are removed from the 2017/18 year (legislative change). Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Increases to assessments (e.g., as a result of an audit) will result in additional bill items being added to a period for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. There may be multiple bill items on a period which will give more flexibility to manage penalties & interest particularly when there are different due dates for increases in the assessment. Our people will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Audit & Case Existing LTS prosecution cases expanding to include work done by Collections and Audit before it reaches LTS. Our people in Audit, Collections and LTS that deal with these cases will need to know how to use the added functionality. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Investigations& Advice BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Returns & Forms EMS information will be collected in START and sentto FIRST for processing assessments. Amendments must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to work across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and may need to incorporate additional time for the delay in processing information across the two systems. eServices/myIR New online filing options (generally an upload or onscreen entry option) introduced for Financial Institutions to replace existing options, e.g. emailed spread sheet, iron key or CD/DVD. Our people will need to be aware of the new options for tax poolers and Financial Institutions in order to be able to assist any customer queries. There may be some initial increase in contact from these entities as they adjust to the new options. Disbursements Domestic bank accounts will be updated in IVR or eServices with an exception option available (actioned by a small group of our people). All ofour peoplewill need to transfer customers to the IVR to update their domestic bank account details. Disbursements International disbursements will be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Customers will be able to add their overseas bank account number in eServices. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of howto manage international disbursements so they can inform and assistcustomers. Audit and Case Pre-audit case will become a stage in a standard audit group rather than a separate case. Audit indicators will be applied differently and adjustments will be made to reporting so reporting still separates Pre-Audit and Audit cases Our people will need to know that Pre-auditis now a stage in the audit group. The functionality of this stage isn’t different from the current Pre-Audit case. Audit and Case Working papers for reassessment of returns will look different and become more complex for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 2, release 3 and future stages. Ourpeoplewill need to know how touse the new working papers to reassess returns. Initially this may reduce productivity as our people learn how to use these new working papers. Until release 3, Income tax, donations and ICA reassessments will need to continue to be done in FIRST with the continued use of the Heritage Paper and FIRST interface. Management of voluntary disclosures is TBC. Audit and Case More cases and case types will be added to START including AEOI cases, Film Grants cases, Wine Equalisation Tax cases, Compliance Manager Reviews, Specialist Audits including Transfer Pricing, International cases, and Digital Forensic/Computer Tax Audit cases. Still TBC for cases relating to SE/LE risk review, HWI risk review and tax pooling, likely release 3. There will also be changes to Prosecution cases which will be opened by Collections or Audit before referral to LTS. Someof our people may be new to START and there will be new START case functionality to learn. This may lead to an increase in task time as our people adapt to new processes and functionality. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Investigations& Advice BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Audit and Case There will be new working papers for return amendments and our people will need to know how to manage PAYE discrepancies as a result of an audit when the Return is in START and the financials are in FIRST. Our people will need to check both systems to ensure they access information that reflects any co-existence related timing impacts. This may increase task times especially if EMS changes are also involved. Audit/Case Investigators will be working with converted returns and data from day one, noting it will take up to four years from the day each tax type is converted before there will be converted periods within the statutory time bar. While it is possible for investigators to work on periods with only START native data it maybe 2 years or more before some investigators do audits on periods with only START native data Investigators will need a thorough understanding of the converted data rules and how to work with converted data including auditing converted periods. Investigators will also need to know how to convert unconverted periods for new START tax types. This may add time to existing tasks as they incorporate working with converted /unconverted data into processes, this will be similar to stage 1. Analytics Risk review and screening of returns including all amendments will be automated via START Integrity manager for products in START from April 2018and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases (note design may evolve in future releases). There will be new tasks and workflow to manage integrity holds and integrity-related work items. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Customer New case types will be introduced to capture Voice of the Customer information. Ourpeoplewill needto be trained in the new case types to collect this information. Our people will also need to be aware how to access and report on information collected by these cases. Returns & Forms EMS information will be collected in START and sentto FIRST for processing assessments. Amendments and error resolution actions must be completed in START. Information sent to FIRST will not be in real time. Ourpeoplewill need to be working across two systems whencompleting tasks that depend on EMS information which may increase time spent on a task and may need to incorporate additional time for the delay in processing information across the two systems. Returns & Forms A new START work item will be created for EMS amendments that result in a credit to manage the credit in FIRST. Our people will need clear instructions and training on any new work items to manage co- existence of EMS information. Returns & Forms There will be new manual sorts for returns and correspondence.These will all be imaged as unstructured correspondence for processing in START. Sorting, keying and imaging paper returns, forms and correspondence may take longer. Returns & Forms Paper returns and forms currently keyed through Halex will be imaged (not OCR) and manually keyed directly into START from the image for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Imaging and keying paper returns and forms will take longer. Returns & Forms Return conversion will create some “ghost” returns like it did in Stage 1 to manage the conversion of transactions in FIRST that do not have a return associated to them. Ourpeoplewill need clear guidelines for working with converted returns, transactionsand data, including co-existence considerations so they assist customers and do account maintenance. eServices/myIR Functionality introduced for stage 1 becomes available for products as they are migrated and mastered in START in Release 2 e.g., file and pay (direct debit), instalment arrangements and managing account access. Note: START will not include PAYE payment functionality during co- existence. Our people will need to be aware of this and understand the options they have to educate and assist customers in real time, e.g. viewing customer sessions. There may be an initial increase in customer contact as they encounter new functionality for the first time, e.g., the direct debit option. Payments One-offdirect debit payment option from Australian Bank Accounts when customers want to file and pay will be available for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. In future stages of BT this option may expand to other countries and regular payment options. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of this option so they can inform and assistcustomers to access this expanding payment channel. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Payments A new account type will improve processing bulk payments (from customers who make single payments on behalf of multiple customers) within START. Payments teams will have a number of new processes which may increase some task time initially as these are embedded. Managementof bulk payments should improve and remove workarounds introduced for stage 1. Disbursements Domestic bank accounts for products in START from April 2018 and all other products from April 2019 (including Social Policy) must be updated in the IVR; there will be an exception process. There may be an increase to AHT for bank account updates ifour peopleare required to stay onthe line as the customer completes the update. Disbursements International disbursements will be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future releases. Customers will be able to add their overseas bank account number in eServices. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of howto manage international disbursements so they can inform and assistcustomers. Disbursements There will be new work items to manually review failed disbursements from START if the disbursement remains failed after 15 days of the automated ‘failed disbursement’ process. Ourpeoplewill need to know howto how to action this new work item. Financials The Payment Priority order has been operating within each system independently of each other during stage 1, with all FIRST tax types prioritised over all START Tax types. However as there will be more tax type in START in release 2 and 3 this will become more evident. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of the implications of this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials There will be some conversion impacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Ourpeoplewill need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Financials Transfers between START and FIRST (auto and manual, and for both payment transfers/reversals and credit transfers) have added complexity and volumes will increase. Our people will need clear instructions and will also need to apply extra care when transferring payments/reversals or transferring credits between systems to avoid errors. Compliance Billing will be consolidated to minimise the output to customers whilst still providing the same level of detail to the customer, this is particularly beneficial to customers with multiple related actions to complete. Ourpeoplewillneed to understand the consolidation of information so they are able to effectively support customers. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery > Customer Services BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Community Compliance will be managing campaign work through leads in START. The entire lead can be assigned to one of our people, who will then complete the actions within the lead (actions could include things such as Face to Face meeting with customer). Community Compliance Officers will need to understand how to use the lead functionality within START. This may impact upon productivity as our people adapt to the new functionality. Compliance Child Support teams managing amendments to employer deductions on the EMS will need to update information twice – in START and FIRST. Design still TBC in regard to processes involved when converting EMS to correspondence. ​Handling amendments for Child Support deductions on the EMS will take longer as our peoplewill need to update both START and FIRST with the changes. There is some risk that the systems will get out of sync although messaging in both FIRST and START to remember to update the other system may help reduce the risk. Audit and Case Community Compliance will use START Case Manager for case work. Community Compliance Officers will need to understand how to use START Case Manager and may need a to agree a transition approach for moving their case work into START. Financials There will be some conversionimpacts in relation to grace periods as START and FIRST apply them independently of each other. Our People will need to be aware of the implicationsof this in order to support customer queries and account maintenance activities. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery >Telephony BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Creditcard payments via the IVR channel and eServices will be enabled for Release 2 and 3 products. This may shift some calls from Collections to Interactional as anyone can pass the customer through to the IVR option. For Collections this option will be significantly faster and will reduce call handling time. Domestic bank accounts for START products must be updated in the IVR; there will be an exception process. Our leaders will no longer need to verify bank accounts for START products. SPK2IRcall flows will be modified to retrieve Release 2 and 3 product information from START.This should ensure customers are able to remain in a self-service channel to receive information about Release 2 and 3 products in SPK2IR. NewSIP-enabled WDE softphone will be rolled out to enable easier and improved call routing along with a new call recording solution. Our people who use a WDE softphone will use it for all their inbound and outbound calls with all calls recorded. It will replace their \[Information redacted\] desk-phone. People who listen to calls will use a new portal. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts Service Delivery >Litigation Management BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Audit and Case ​Litigation Management cases will be in START. ​Litigation Management people will be accessing START for the first time, will need training in START Case Manager.Litigation Management may need to agree a transition approach to move their cases into START. There may be an initial increase in time spent on managing cases during any transition period. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Service Delivery >Performance& Optimisation BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement START cannot completely replace all macros currently used for release 2 and 3 products.There will be some capacity loss across the business as some tasks previously managed by macros may require manual actions instead until Release 4. This will need to be understood and may require evaluation of impacts post go-live. There will be new workflow design, delegations and process changes reflected in online help and content hub material that will need to be supportedand maintained as part of deployment and transitioning to the business. There may be an increase in time spent in managing both deployment activities and transitioning work to business areas beyond go-live. There will be changes in the volumes of work items and task times across the business, due to but not limited to: •Release 2 and 3 design resulting in changes to volumes of output (e.g. timing and/or consolidation of billing items) •Reduction in stage 1 co-existence tasks as Release 2 and 3 products come into START •Introduction of new co-existence tasks for Release 2 and 3 products There may be an increase in profiling and forecasting activities as the business prepares and adapts to these changes leading up to and post Release 2 and 3 go-live. There will be some customer experience change for products that are affected by co-existence processes. There may be a need to analyse the impact of the experience change at a product level to inform business decisions and/or influence opportunities for continuous improvement actions. With the introduction of more case types there will be more time recording in START e.g. Community Compliance, Digital Forensics Unit. There may be an increase in need for support to our people as they adapt to time recording in START and how this interacts with other workforce management tools. Thereis greater degrees of impact to our service providers which will require relationship management effort. This includes changes for intermediaries (both design changes and the effects of co-existence) along with managing options for software developers as ‘gateway services’ deploys AIM etc. Theremay be a need for additional support to our service providers that complements activities delivered by BT. This could increase the level and amount of relationship management efforts. In particular there is a need to determine who will be responsible for on- boarding software developers in the new organisation . This is to be confirmed. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Performance, Facilities & Finance BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Customer There will be new account types to manage items such as bulk payments and payroll subsidy. There may be some initial analysis to determine the requirements for any new or different reporting needs due to the introduction of these account types. eServices/myIR New filing options have been designed to collect information from Financial Institutions (for RWT) and those who make bulk payments on behalf of customers. Analysts may need to be aware of the design and theremay be different report requirements to reflect the introduction of new filing options. Payments Newpayment options become available for release 2 and 3 products in addition to the introduction of \[Information redacted\] for international direct debit payments from Australian bank accounts. There may be some new reporting requirementsin relation to these new options. Crown Accounting may have an increase in effort initially as new payment processes are embedded by the business and any flow on outcomes are monitored. Disbursements Urgent & most international disbursements can be managed in START for products in START from April 2018 and other products as they are migrated from FIRST in Release 3 and future stages. Any international disbursements for products in START that can’t be processed in START will be referred to FM Operations via a START work-item to be processed via the \[Information redacted\] portal. Therewill be a reduction in manual effort by the FM team in managing urgent and international disbursements. Disbursements Disbursement files between IR and \[Information redacted\] will auto-reconcile. This automation removes the need for two signature sign off for the disbursements file. Work items will be generated if it does not reconcile. Accounting The expected volume and complexity of financial transfers across START and FIRST will result in additional reconciliation effort and complexity. There will be an increase in the volume, complexity and effort in relation to reconciliation activities. Our front-line people will need clear instructions and training in financial transfers as errors have a significant knock-on effect to Revenue Accounting. Accounting Combining data from two systems for financial and performance reporting, including Revenue Estimation Reports for \[Information redacted\], will be complex. There willbean increase in time and complexity for validating, analysing and the manual collation of information across two systems to ensure the integrity of the information being reported upon. Our people will need an in-depth understanding of the way START collects data and the differences in reporting methodologies between START and FIRST. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts In Confidence \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Information, Intelligence & Communications BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Compliance Campaign design and select will continue to be managed outside of START with additional effort required during co-existence, including working with the new TDW.Campaign select data will then be loaded into START where some scoring and prioritisation can be applied using Discovery Manager before leads are created. This includes additional campaigns for Hidden Economy and Community Compliance specific work. Tailored training will be needed to manage all campaign types and to incorporate working with data from FIRST and START in the new TDW. There may be additional time spent on creating selects for campaigns during co-existence with the added complexity of joining up data from FIRST and START.This will include working with the START Discovery Manager once campaigns are loaded in START. Analytics Anonymous Information and InfoRep items will be lodged in START by our people. START will perform some automated checks to attempt customer identification, where relevant, as part of populating a work item for the iHub team to manage. Existing business processes and actions taken remain the same, however where there is a START work item, this will be where summary information is captured.Based on security, this summary information will be visible to the appropriate roles. All of our people will need to be aware of how to lodge anonymous information and InfoRep items. Our people managing these work items will need to know how to add or complete these tasks in START and although their approach to the work will not change, this may lead to an increase in task time initially as they adapt to the new system. Security settings will allow appropriate people to view the summary detail in the work item on the customer which will remove the need for our iHubteam to extract a PDF version of their summary information upon request. Analytics START’s Integrity manager will run across more than just returns, e.g. bank accounts changes will be included when the change is to an international account number. Additional items are still under consideration. As more data buildsthere may be a need for analysts to spend additional time considering the impacts of new integrity plans in START. Across areas A number of release 2 design options will require significant updates to content for customer outputs (including online materials) and new functionality will need to be well communicated and marketed. This may involve additional effort during early life support (ELS). Thismay lead to an increase in workload and some reactive work efforts. Information Sharing Changes to information sharing interfaces. Informationsharing hub need awareness of changes to interfaces. Note impact assessments in relation to information sharing are being carried out by the TAD team. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Corporate Integrity & Assurance BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Auditand Case Corporate Legal maybeginto use START’s case management functionality for their case work including employment file, commercial file and general file types. In addition to training, Corporate Legal may need to agree a transition approach to move their cases into START. This may increase time spent on case management if there is a need to co- exist for a period of time. Our people may need dedicated time available to adapt to START functionality and navigation. Security Changesto the START security matrix as a result of more work in START and the proposed organisation design based on broad new roles and delegations. Potential differences in how START security and Business Risk Control checks and Business Management Controls operate from current, to be determined by work currently underway on security matrix/delegations/workflow. New/different reporting requirements in relation to security from START. Oversight of security and delegations in the new system to enable risk and integrity monitoring , internal audit and understanding of reporting. Will require continued involvement in design and some training. Appendix B: Release 2 Detailed Impacts Office of the Chief Tax Counsel BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Audit and Case Potential for impacts as a result of changes to workflow for legal cases (TBC) Requirement for information and awareness of the changes. Returns and Forms Potential for impacts pending decisions on whether all unstructured correspondence is imaged in START. Requirement for information and awareness of the changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Policy & Strategy BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement Accounting& Reporting Combining data from two systems for revenue forecasting and economic analysis, including Revenue Estimation Reports for \[Information redacted\] will be complex. There willbean increase in time and complexity for validating, analysing and the manual collation of information across two systems to ensure the integrity of the information being reported upon. Our people will need an in-depth understanding of the way START collects data and the differences in reporting methodologies between START and FIRST. Information Technology & Change BusinessChange Description (examples)Impact Statement TBC- Early Life Support(ELS) and Production SupporttasksThere should be some overview training for the Help Desk/ELS teams. NB/Direct technology related impacts are being assessed by the TAD team. 24” Monitors and Thick Client Additionalmonitors and thick clients may be required for new users to START (700+) in SD Transactional, Corporate Legal, Lit.
