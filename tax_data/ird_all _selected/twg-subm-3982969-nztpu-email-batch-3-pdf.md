Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 2 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. As some background, I am a Kiwi forced to work in Australia due to the lack of job opportunities for my technical skills in NZ, but NZ is still by base. As a result, I pay tax in both NZ & Australia. 3 In Australia I have withnessed a surge in property pricing exactly the same as seen in NZ, and Australia has a capital gains tax. I have had a rental property in Australia for more than 15 years yet I am loathe to sell it due to the capital gains tax it attracts upon sale. If i want to sell it in order to buy a better performing asset, i get taxed twice, CGT on sale and Stamp duty on purchase of the new asset. Thus I have no incentive to support "more productive assets" such as business, and also little incentive to find a better performing property. I have lots of incentive to continually push for higher rents to offset the increasing costs. I note with concern that the NZ Labour government stated that its intention would be to charge CGT on increases in "value" of property, but not provide compensation upon losses in "value". This is not a level playing field and inconsistent with any other business tax rule. Such an attitude clearly demonstrates how the Government simply thinks it can charge what it likes in the form of tax, in order to fund its pet projects or current MP perks or past MP pensions. A "Fair" tax system is not subject to political whim, applies equally to all forms of "income" and equally to all people and business, and applies only to actual income, not to manipulated "increases in value" I also have rental properties in NZ, and in recent months have been seriously considering selling up due to the interference signalled by the Government. This interference and the already implemented requirements for new facilities that must be provided in rental properties, directly increase my costs, but as they are capital expenses, they are unable to be claimed as a tax offset due to the removal of capital depreciation some years ago. Australia still provides for capital depreciation of both the building and any improvements, such as those required by NZ Government. Inability to claim the costs of the forced improvements simply adds collective pressure on all landlords to continue to push up rents for as long as possible to be able to offset the increased costs. In the current rental situation, with massive shortages, this is seeing tenants having to pay very high proportions of their income as rent, leaving little left over for general expenses, and thus economic activity slows down. ie poor tax policy directly affects GDP. A CGT on the sale of these rental properties will simply encourage me to hold onto them forever (should i decide not to sell up before CGT is implemented), thus reducing property turnover and depriviing would-be home owners the opportunity to buy their own place. An annual CGT / wealth tax based on an arbitrary increase in "value" will simply encourage the Government to implement policies that drive the "values" higher, in order that they grab more tax on "an increasing value". The "increasing value" is a flat out lie. It is predominently inflation and compliance costs, generated by the Government, and under reported as CPI, which is based upon a select few items that dont show up the true inflation. Ask anyone in NZ right now if they beleive that inflation is only 2% when they see the price of their food increasing on a weekly basis, fuel constantly increasing, and power and water constantly increasing, all more in the regoin of 10% than 2%. Even rates have been increasing at around 5%, so how can inflation only be 2%, It is simply number manipulation to make the Government look better and lower the cost of any index linked benefits. A wise property investor I know likes to demonstrate what a lie the "increase in value" really is: If you bought 1 house 10 years ago for $300k, and today it is "worth" $600k, ie double, can you now sell it and buy 2 houses ? Of course you cant, because inflation has devalued the $ in that time so that now 300k buys half as much as it did 10 years ago, and you must now pay $600k to get the equivalent "value" of house. Yet a CGT / wealth tax applied each year on the inflation caused "increase in value" would actually be attacking the capital invested, not the "precieved income / value increase above inflation". 4 Any such tax would have to be calculated only on the true realisable increase after costs (likely to be far above CPI) and relevant to each asset class, ie a "real inflation" calculation based upon similar types of assets. Thus residential property "true inflation rate" may be quite different to that of commercial property, or agricultural property or artwork or gold or shares or cars or coins or wine or boats - yes CGT must be applied across all asset classes, not just property. Government policies / regulations (eg health & safety) as well as supply and demand for such things as building materials have dramatically increased new building costs, thus pushing up prices of new builds, which flows into existing stock prices, but there has been no increase in pr ofit from the builders point of view, just much higher input costs. If a property owner then needs to repair the property, those repair costs have skyrocketed (Auckland callout costs are now over $200 before any work is actually performed) yet are not factored into CPI, all that is seen is the "increase in value" of the property, disregarding the increase in costs. The whole concept of such a tax is so absurd that it demonstrates that its proponents either have aboslutely no clue how everything in the economy is intrinsically linked, or they fully understand it and it is simply an envy tax. Such a tax would further increase rents for already struggling tenants, due to the tax being a cost increase with no direct income increase to the landlord - a value increase in a residential property does not produce an increased income like it does in the commercial property world. I would be being taxed on something that i get no benefit from unless i sell- the very worst type of tax that there could possibly exist, This would likely cause many to give up owning rentals, (I am seriously considering it) placing even more demand on the already woeful supply of state / community housing. Those that stick with it will collectively push hard to get rents to the level that they should currently be to reflect the input costs, the cost of capital and the cost of risk. Current rent levels, particularly in Auckland, are nowhere near where they need to be based on current property prices, constantly increasing costs due to regulations, insurance and rates, and in comparison with r eturns that could be acheived in other asset classes. My rental properties are my retirement fund. I have purchased them in order to provide for myself in the future and reduce the load on the Government. Taxing my capital is taking away my savings, - not the interest / income on the savings but the savings themselves. That is straight out theft. !!! Why would i bother to do anything for myself if the Government is just going to take it away ? I may as well just sit back and rely on Government handouts, or sell up and move permanently to Australia, where i get fairer and equal tax treatment, and only get taxed on income actually received, not some notional wealth increase calculated using manipulated numbers to benefit political agendas. Thus NZ loses: access to my skills, the Australian income that i currently send to NZ (reducing the balance of payments), a taxpayer, and rental properties (my properties would likely sell to first home owners - there would be less investors - and stats show that rentals on average house 4 people while home owners average 1.5 - 2 per household.) I am all for revamping the tax system, but it must be fair, apply across the board to everyone, to every asset class, and only apply to income actually received.

I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, Maureen 18 From:Angela Smith Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 4:19 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 19 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, 20 From:Devadunna Abeynaike Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 3:35 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Brackets, creep / fiscal drag Tax brackets should be made bigger and the top tax rate should not kick in until $100,000. The first bracket should be increased to $25,000 and other brackets increased too. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation Rates of tax for companies, trusts and the top rate for individuals should be made the same so that people are not wasting time trying to minimise taxes. Expensing of capita I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase for items costing less than $1million. For higher cost items after writing off $1M the balance should be written off over 3 years. If an item cost $2.5M the write off in year one is $1m + $500,000 making a total of $1.5M. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by and businesses run by charities should be taxed the same as other entities. \[1\] 21 Capital gains tax I support a tax on capital gains as it would broaden the tax base. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations to use say 50% for research to find long term solutions and the balance for cleaning up the environment. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a way that those who use it pay for it. Lifestyle taxes I oppose varying GST for different products.

I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water.

Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase.

Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, 61 From:Trinda Jackson Sent: Saturday, 28 April 2018 7:55 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working G roup recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 62 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages.
