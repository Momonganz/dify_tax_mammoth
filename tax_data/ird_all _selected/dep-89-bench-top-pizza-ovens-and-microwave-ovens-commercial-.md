Bench-top Pizza Ovens and Microwave Ovens (Commercial)
======================================================

Determination DEP89 (Aug 2014) sets a general depreciation rates for bench-top pizza ovens and microwave ovens.

#### Note to Determination DEP 89

The Commissioner has set general depreciation rates for bench-top pizza ovens and microwave ovens (commercial) by adding new asset classes to the "Hotels, motels, restaurants, cafes, taverns and takeaway bars" and "Shops" industry categories.

As loaned or hired assets tend to be handled and transported frequently and are not as well maintained as owned assets, a further asset class is provided for "pizza ovens (bench-top, for long-term loan or hire)", with a lesser estimated useful life. Note: Long-term loan or hire applies to a period greater than one month.

Commercial microwave ovens are very common in commercial kitchens and also in shops. These ovens are usually of a similar size to domestic microwave ovens but are constructed of better quality materials, and are not as large or long lasting as industrial microwave ovens used in food processing factories. A new asset class of "microwave ovens (commercial)" has been provided.
