Overview
--------

In March 2021 the Government [announced several changes to the taxation of residential investment property](/news/2021/2021-03-23-government-property-announcements)
 including:

*   extending the bright-line test for residential properties from five to ten years (this change became law in March 2021), and
*   limiting interest deductions on residential investment properties (the design of the rules [were consulted on](/news/2021/2021-06-10-interest-deductibility-consultation-launched)
    ).

In September 2021 the Government [released draft legislative proposals](/news/2021/2021-09-28-interest-limitation-proposals)
 aimed at limiting interest deductions for residential investment properties. These proposals will be considered by Parliament and may change.

In summary, residential investment properties capable of being used for long term accommodation would be subject to the proposed rules. However, the following exclusions and exemptions are proposed:

*   an exclusion for the main family home
*   exclusions for several types of residential property, and
*   exemptions for new builds and for property development.

The following information sheets provide general information about how the proposed rules are intended to work:
