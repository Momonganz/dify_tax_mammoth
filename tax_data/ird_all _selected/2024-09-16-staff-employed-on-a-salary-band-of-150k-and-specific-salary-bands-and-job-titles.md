25OIA1195 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 16 September 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 19 August 2024. You requested the following: On 1 July 2023: How many staff did the Ministry employ that were in a salary band of $150k+ What were the specific salary bands and job titles for these positions. On 1 July 2024: How many staff did the Ministry employ that were in a salary band of $150k+ What were the specific salary bands and job titles for these positions. Information being released The information you have requested is attached as Appendix A. T able 1 in Appendix A displays the number of staff employed within any roles where the pay band can reach or exceed $150,000, broken down into roles associated with each pay band. Tables 2 and 3 display the range for each pay band. Information relating to the remuneration of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is published on the Public Service Commission’s website, accordingly this part of your request is refused under section 18(d) of the OIA, as the information is publicly available. This information can be found here: Chief executive remuneration - Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. We have withheld some information under section 9(2)(a) of the OIA in order to protect the privacy of natural persons. That information is the total number of non-managerial staff: 1. That are in roles with less than 10 persons in the role; and 2. The role is not by its nature limited to one employee; and 3. The number is not otherwise public knowledge. Where applicable the actual number will be replaced and displayed as “<10”. As required by section 9(1) of the OIA, I have considered whether the grounds for withholding the information requested is outweighed by the public interest. In this instance, I do not consider that to be the case. 25OIA1195 Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.
