If you find that you prefer the TIB from our website and no longer need a paper copy, please let us know so we can take you off our mailing list. You can e-mail us from our website. Online TIB (HTML format) •This is the better format if you want to read the TIB on-screen (single column layout). •Any references to related TIB articles or other material on our website are hyperlinked, allowing you to jump straight to the related article. This is particularly useful when there are subsequent updates to an article you’re reading, because we’ll retrospectively add links to the earlier article. •Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily, but this is not the better format if you want to print out a whole TIB. •All TIBs from January 1997 onwards (Volume Nine, No.1) are available in this format. Online TIB articles appear on our website as soon as they’re finalised – even before the whole TIB for the month is finalised at mid-month. This means you can read the first of any month’s TIB articles on our website in the last two weeks of the previous month. Printable TIB (PDF format) •This is the better format if you want to print out the whole TIB to use as a paper copy – the printout looks the same as this paper version. •You’ll need Adobe’s Acrobat Reader to use this format – available free from their website at http://www.adobe.com •Double-column layout means this version is better as a printed copy – not as easy to read on-screen. •All TIBs from July 1989 (the start of the TIB) are available in this format. The printable TIB appears on our website at mid-month, at the same time as we send the paper copy to the printers. This means you can get a printable TIB from our website about two weeks before we can post you a paper copy. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Foreign currency amounts – conversion to NZ currency The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 1999. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published in the Tax Information Bulletin following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign cur- rency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equiva- lent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key x y xis the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. yis the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 1998. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 4.1717 = NZ$47,942.09 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 December 1998. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 21.2667 = NZ$16,457.65 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1998 and has a balance date of 30 Novem- ber 1998. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-November 1998: (0.8839 + 0.8696 + 0.8842 + 0.8777 + 0.8908 + 0.8666 + 0.8885) ÷ 7 = 0.8802 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.8802 = NZ$511,613.63 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 1999. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 31 December 1998 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 31 December 1998 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 19.2550 = NZ$25,697.28 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

tax disclosure exemption ITR10 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1999. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR10”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1999 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1998 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8(3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” below). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 1999 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Sched- ule (IR 4G). The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. •to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign com- pany which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United King- dom and the United States of America). •the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy •an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 11 FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be dis- closed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC •an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Nor- way, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme •a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person’s 1999 tax return. See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) for more information. •interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year •an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s booklet Foreign Investment Funds (IR 275B). A resident who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1999 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed five forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclo- sure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G or IR 4GS form to disclose an “in- come interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign com- pany (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 1999 disclosure exemption excludes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents’ hold- ings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 1999 international tax disclosure exemption re- moves the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 1999 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Text of determination on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 12 Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR10” 1. Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not re- quired to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1999. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign invest- ment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption (i)Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1999, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. (ii)Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 1999, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: •No attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or •No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign invest- ment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 1st day of April 1999. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates Local authority trading enterprise definition Introduction The Local Government Amendment Act 1999 amends the definition of local authority trading enterprise (LATE) to remove non-business charitable organisations from the definition of LATE. The Act also simplifies the definition of LATE for both accountability and tax purposes. Background In 1989 the Local Government Act 1974 was amended to permit councils to establish LATEs. It was intended that these council-controlled businesses would face the same commercial pressures as any other firm – including the requirement to pay tax. However, it became apparent that, because of the very broad legal meaning of ‘char- ity’, most activities carried out by LATEs could be structured to obtain tax-exempt status. Section 3 of the Taxation Remedial Provisions Act 1998 was thus enacted to prevent LATEs from obtaining income tax exemptions under section CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j). However, it became clear that because of the broad definition of LATE, a number of non-business charities would lose their tax-exempt status. This was an unin- tended effect. As a result, the application date for section 3 of the Taxation Remedial Provisions Act 1998 was deferred until 1999-2000 income years so that the definition of LATE could be reviewed. Key features •The definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974 has been amended to include only (i)a company that is directly or indirectly controlled by one or more local authorities; or (ii)an organisation that is directly or indirectly controlled by one or more local authorities where the organisation carries out a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. •Local authorities will need to control 50% or more voting rights to obtain control of a company or an organisation. In addition, local authorities may obtain control of an organisation by obtaining the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors or managers of the organisation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 13 •The definition of LATE in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has also been amended to include, in addition to LATEs as defined in the Local Govern- ment Act 1974, council-controlled holding organisa- tions that control a LATE. Application dates The amendments to the Local Government Act apply from 1 April 1999 and the amendments to the Income Tax Act apply from the 1999-2000 income year. Detailed analysis The Local Government Amendment Act 1999 amends the current definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, which provide that LATEs must satisfy certain accountability requirements. For these accountability purposes a LATE means: (i)A company in which equity securities carrying 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the shareholders of the company are – (A)held by 1 or more local authorities; or (B)controlled, directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities; or (ii)An organisation that – (A)operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit; and (B)is subject to significant control, directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities;... The definition of ‘significant control’ applicable to the definition of LATE has also been amended so that it now reads: “Significant controls” means, in relation to an organisation, – (a)control of 50 percent or more of the votes at any meeting of the members or controlling body of the organisation; or (b)the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors, or managers (howsoever described) of the organisation, – whether or not jointly with other local authorities or persons. (emphasis added) The Act also amends the definition of LATE in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This is the definition applicable for tax purposes and it states that: Local authority trading enterprise means – (a)A local authority trading enterprise (as defined in section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974): (b)An organisation (as defined in section 594B(2) of the Local Government Act 1974) that – (i)is subject to significant control (as defined in section 594B (2) of that Act), directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities; and (ii)has significant control (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of a local authority trading enterprise within the meaning of paragraph (a):... The tests for identifying a LATE vary depending on whether the entity is a company or an organisation. Company Under the amended definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, a company is a LATE if one or more local authorities hold or control, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the company. There is no requirement that a company must carry out a trading undertaking. This requirement is subsumed under the company structure. It is assumed that if local authorities set up a company, their intention must be to use that company to carry out a trading undertaking for the purpose of making a profit. This assumption is largely consistent with the other provisions of the Local Government Act 1974. Under that Act, local authorities are often required to carry out certain trading undertak- ings (such as providing transport services) using a company structure. A company that is not a LATE under the Local Govern- ment Act 1974 will not be a LATE for tax purposes. Non-company organisation Under the amended definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, a non-company organisation (other than a committee of local authorities) is a LATE if: •one or more local authorities have control of 50% or more votes at a meeting of the members or controlling body of the organisation; or •one or more local authorities have the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors, or managers of the organisation, whether or not jointly with other local authorities or persons; and •it operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Control The definition of LATE envisages two ways that local authorities may obtain control of an organisation. In addition to obtaining control by obtaining 50% or more voting rights at any meeting of the organisation, local authorities may control an organisation (such as a joint venture) by obtaining the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors or managers of the organisation. Trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit The amended definition clarifies that a local authority controlled organisation is a LATE only if it operates a ‘trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit’. From a policy perspective, the term ‘operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit’ is analogous to ‘running a business’. Support for this interpretation can be found in the definition of continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 14 However, a holding organisation may be a LATE for tax purposes. The definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that an organisation will be a LATE if: (a)it is controlled by one or more local authorities; and (b)it controls a LATE as defined in the Local Govern- ment Act 1974. The definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 contemplates that a holding organisation that controls a business entity is effectively a LATE even though it does not carry out a business directly. The revenue risk of not recognising the holding organisation as a LATE is significant, as income derived by the holding organisation from the business entity could then be directed back to the local authorities without being taxed. This outcome would have been inconsistent with the intention of taxing local authorities on all income they derive from their LATEs, regardless of the form it is returned to them. LATEs and income tax exemptions The amended definition of LATE for tax purposes will apply from the 1999-2000 income year to coincide with the application date of section 3 of the Taxation Reme- dial Provisions Act 1998. Together these provisions ensure that a LATE will not be able to obtain the charitable and district improvement income tax exemp- tions under sections CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under the amended definition of LATE, a non-business charitable organisation will not be a LATE. The organi- sation may continue as a tax-exempt entity as long as it continues to satisfy the statutory criteria of a charity. However, charitable companies and charitable business organisations that are controlled by the local authorities will remain as LATEs and, hence, lose their charitable income tax exemptions under sections CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j). Fabric samples and fabric display stock Depreciation determination not to be issued In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997), we published a draft general depreciation deter- mination on fabric samples and fabric display stock. It proposed a general depreciation rate of 100%, based on an estimated useful life of one year, under both the “Shops” and “Textile, Garment and Carpet Manufactur- ing” industry categories. We received a number of submissions on the draft determination. As a result of those submissions, the Commissioner has decided not to issue the determination because of the variable life of each sample. Taxpayers have advised that these samples are only useful for as long as they have stock of the particular fabric. On that basis, the life of a sample may be as short as one month, or, occasionally, as long as two years. In most situations, it would seem that a sample has a useful life of less than twelve months. Any general depreciation rate must be one of the banded rates set out in Schedule 11 to the Income Tax Act 1994. Under that schedule, the maximum deprecation rate that can be set is 100%, which translates to an estimated useful life of one year. For the reasons outlined above this rate is not appropriate, and so the Commissioner has decided not to issue the determination. The circumstances of each case must dictate whether such samples can be fully deducted in the year the cost is incurred, or depreciated over a longer period. ‘business’ under the Income Tax Act 1994 and the ordinary meaning of business. Under section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, business is defined to include ‘any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit’. However, as the term ‘trading undertaking’ is used throughout the Local Government Act 1974, it would not have been appropri- ate to substitute the phrase with a business test. At the practical level, whether an activity amounts to a business is an issue that has been widely tested at the court of law. To constitute a business, the activity must exhibit a number of characteristics. The leading case law in this area is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. The factors to be taken into account when considering whether the activity carried out by an organisation is a business are: •whether the actions of the organisation exhibits an intention to make a profit; •the nature of the activity; •the period over which the organisation engaged in the activity; •the scale of operations and the volume of transactions; •the commitment of time, money and effort; •the pattern of activity; and •the financial results. These factors, taken together, will determine whether an organisation carries out a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Holding organisation The definition in the Local Government Act 1974 precludes holding organisations (organisations that hold investment assets) from becoming a LATE, as they do not operate a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Examples of organisations like these are community trusts that were set up by local authorities solely to hold strategic or investment assets. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 15 Plastic growing trays Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is no suitable general depreciation rate for plastic growing trays, used in the Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture industries for growing forestry seedlings. The trays are fed into a machine, and each cell is filled with the growing me- dium plus a seed. The trays are then placed into a controlled environment until the seedlings are mature enough to be transferred outside. The seedlings (and the trays) are constantly irrigated, and when kept outside are subject to UV radiation. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Plastic growing trays, for producing forestry seedlings” into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 33% D.V. (24% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 5 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1.

Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. If you wish to make a submission on the proposed changes, please write to: Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Adjudication & Rulings National Office Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON We need to receive your submission by 31 May 1999 if we are to take it into account in finalising the determination. FBT prescribed rate of interest for quarter starting 1 January 1999 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low-interest employment related loans has been reduced. The new rate of 6.5% will apply for the quarter commencing on 1 January 1999 and subse- quent quarters. The prescribed rate, down from 6.94%, is a reflection of the fall in market rates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 16 General interest items Trading stock: nursery plants The new legislation requires nursery plants that are trading stock to be valued at market selling value or using a cost valuation method. Difficulties in determin- ing market values or cost values meant that previously Inland Revenue accepted that immature plants that were not for sale could be valued at nil. Inland Revenue also accepted that mature plants which were grown by a nursery and which were valued under the cost option could be valued at 50% of the listed selling price. At this stage this remains the best available information for valuing these items on a cost or market basis and will continue to be accepted by Inland Revenue up to the end of the 1999-00 income year. Our administrative practice will be to accept the follow- ing valuations under the new trading stock regime for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 income years: •the market selling value of immature plants that are not for sale is nil; and •mature plants that are grown by the nursery and that are valued using a cost valuation method can be valued at 50% of the listed selling price. This administrative practice will ensure that compliance costs for growers are minimised until they have an opportunity to work through valuation issues with Inland Revenue. If taxpayers think that there are better methods to value their nursery plants using a cost valuation method or market selling value, they may use them. The consultation on calculating market selling value and cost will take place in this income year. Officials will work through the following details with the nursery industry: •how the market selling value of immature plants that are not for sale can be established •how immature and mature plants that are grown by the nursery can be valued at cost, or another cost valuation method such as discounted selling price. Growers or other interested parties who want to be involved with consultation on valuation issues for nursery plants may contact Jane Tait in the Policy Advice Division (ph 04 474 7182; fax 04 474 7217), PO Box 2198, Wellington, jane.tait@ird.govt.nz. Inland Revenue has received enquiries about the valua- tion of certain nursery plants that are trading stock. This item sets out our response. Background The new trading stock legislation enacted in November takes effect from the 1998-99 income year. The legisla- tion was enacted following extensive consultation with taxpayers, both on the proposals outlined in the Govern- ment discussion document on the proposed reforms and during the Parliamentary process. The discussion document indicated that the issue of whether trading stock should include trees and crops grown in the land would be considered at a later stage. It was envisaged that this review of the trading stock treatment of trees and crops would encompass a range of issues, including the valuation of plants that were trading stock. Such a review would, of course, involve consulta- tion with affected taxpayers under the generic tax policy process. The reference to crops in the discussion document prompted queries to Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division from nursery industry representatives. We told them there would be consultation with the nursery industry on any industry-specific changes to the tax treatment of trading stock. More recently, tax advisers and nursery plant growers have asked how nursery plants that are trading stock are to be valued for the 1998-99 year. Interpretation This item outlines Inland Revenue’s view as to how nursery plants should be valued under the trading stock rules for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 income years. This interpretation may be altered for the 2000-01 and future years as a result of consultation with the nursery plants industry this year. Trees and crops grown in the ground are considered to be part of the land and are therefore excluded from the definition of trading stock. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 17 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Temporary shortfall: definition of later return period Section 141 I(3)(b), Tax Administration Act 1994: Temporary shortfall – reduction A tax practitioner has asked about the meaning of “later return period” as used in the definition of Temporary tax shortfall. Section 141 I states: 141I(3) \[Temporary tax shortfall\] A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that – (a)The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and (b)No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and (c)No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and (d)The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. If “later return period” in subsection (b) has the same meaning as in subsection (a) a taxpayer who makes a mistake in two consecutive periods before correcting the mistake would not be eligible for a temporary shortfall reduction because the same or similar shortfall has arisen in a later return period. This would mean that if a taxpayer makes the same or similar mistake twice before permanently correcting or reversing them, the shortfalls will not qualify as temporary and penalties will not be reduced. Inland Revenue considers that “later return period” in paragraph (b) refers to a return period arising after the review by the Commissioner. It is not intended to mean any return period arising after the period in which the shortfall first occurred. The Commissioner’s review is when he examines the temporary shortfall to satisfy himself of the various requirements prescribed in section 141I. Section 141I(3)(b) says that for the correction to be a temporary shortfall the Commissioner must be satisfied that no similar tax shortfall will arise in a later return period. The word “will” indicates that this subsection is referring only to future similar shortfalls – those occur- ring in a return period after the Commissioner’s review. We advised the practitioner that provided the mistake was permanently reversed or corrected before the Commissioner detected it and the Commissioner is satisfied that the same or similar tax shortfall will not arise after his review, the shortfall will be a temporary shortfall. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 18 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Insurance company’s share profits: revenue or capital CIR v National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited Decision date: 22 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Share purchase, diversification Summary The Court of Appeal did not overturn an earlier High Court decision that profits on a share sale by an insur- ance company were not assessable. Facts National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited (“National Insurance”) is a fire and general insurer, carrying on business in New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. In the early 1970s it began to look for opportunities to diversify into other businesses comple- mentary to its insurance business. It acquired 15% of the shares in Chase NZ in May 1972. These shares were swapped in 1982 for a 30% share in Southpac following the merger and reorganisation of NZI and South British. In late 1987-88 National Insurance sold its 30% share- holding of the issued capital of South Pacific Merchant Finance Ltd (Southpac) for $80m. Of this amount $40m was paid to National Insurance by way of two equal dividends. The profit on sale was $67,151,671.40. The shares had been acquired in December 1982. The Commissioner included the amount of the profit in National Insurance’s assessable income on the basis that the purchase and subsequent sale of the Southpac shares was part of the ordinary business of National Insurance. Alternatively the Commissioner considered that the profit was assessable under section 65(2)(e) second limb. A further alternative argument was that the Commis- sioner considered that the way in which National Insurance sold the shares was in contravention of section 99 of the Act. Decision Essentially the judgment of the Court is based on the findings of fact made by Williams J in the High Court. The Court was not convinced that the findings made by Williams were not open to be made by the Judge on the evidence before his Honour. •“\[54\] For the above reasons we are not taken to the point where it could be said that this Court should interfere with what ultimately were essentially find- ings of fact.” In respect of the first issue (section 65(2)(a)) •“\[42\] The Judge has not been shown to be wrong in his final conclusions under this head.” In respect of the second issue (section 65(2)(e)) In relation to the application of section 65(2)(a) (‘busi- ness profits’), the Court appeared to accept the applica- tion of the principles of law normally applying to this area (i.e Californian Copper Syndicate; Punjab Co- operative Bank Ltd; Auckland Savings Bank; Union Bank of Australia; Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Co; London Australia Investment Co), though with an important qualification. The qualification was that business of a bank or insurance company involves the investment in ‘readily realisable securities’. This is a significant departure from the banking and insurance cases which have held on more than one occasion, that profits derived from the sale of property (land and buildings) intended to be held long term or indefinitely, and held for more than 10 years, were assessable. The general principle was stated by the Court in para- graph 9 of the judgment as being ‘Whether the gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business.’ This general principle is contained in the Court of Appeal decision in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 at 11,391. A major issue put to the court was the distinction between the phrases ‘diversification of business’ and ‘diversification of investment’. Williams J had not made a distinction between the two phrases in the High Court judgment. Williams J had in fact used the two phrases interchangeably. Despite direct submissions on the point, the Court of Appeal has provided no comment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 19 In the course of the judgment, the Court reviewed the fac- tors relied on by Williams J and those put forward by the Commissioner. The Court found that the factors listed by Williams J were not compelling support for the question at issue. But despite this finding the Court considered that the judgment overall supported the conclusions arrived at by Williams J. As a key authority and for a discussion of the principles of law applicable, the Court referred to the National Distributors case with regards to section 65(2)(e) second limb. Under this head the Commissioner had argued that Williams J had not considered the different acquisitions of the Southpac shares individually. This was accepted by the Court, which found that Williams J had not been shown to be wrong. The various factors put forward by Williams J in the High Court judgment were considered by the Court. The one factor that appears to have been given greatest weight was the oral evidence of the witnesses that was ‘unshaken in cross-examination’. In respect of the cross-appeal, which the Court did not allow, their Honours stated that in their view all that needed to be said on this issue is that when a Court decides to take into account the amount of a party’s solicitor and client costs, the appropriate figure to use for that purpose is the amount actually payable by that party, including any GST component of that liability. The amount of the actual award will remain in the discretion of the Court in the usual way, and in exercis- ing that the Court can take into account all other relevant considerations. Timber cost: establishing deductible amount Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR Decision date: 24 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Cost of “timber”, exchange, sale Summary The Court of Appeal held partially for the Commis- sioner. Their Honours held that “cost” equated to the amount paid for the shares which gave access to the forestry assets, the “cost of timber” is the proportion of the price paid for the shares allocated to the timber and exchange can be a “sale” for the purposes of section 74(5). Facts Tasman Forestry Limited (“Tasman”) is part of the Fletcher Challenge Group. In the income years ending 30 June 1986-90 it claimed a deduction for the cost of timber against income from the sale of that timber. The nature of the acquisitions varied. Firstly there were acquisitions by way of in specie distributions from companies liquidated by the objector in 1986. Tasman sought to include as the cost of timber for deduction against income received from subsequent sales of felled timber, an amount corresponding to the fair market value of the timber at the time of the in specie distributions. The value of the forests claimed was equal to the value of the shares in the companies which were liquidated. Secondly, there were acquisitions following exchanges with Elders Resources NZFP Ltd (“Elders”) in 1988. Tasman exchanged certain forests and preference shares held in another Fletcher company for forests owned by Elders. Tasman then sought to claim as the “cost” of forests the market value of the acquired forests. Thirdly, there was an in specie distribution in 1990 of the assets of Crista Holdings Ltd (“Crista”). Tasman had acquired the shareholding of Crista in 1988 for $105 million. Tasman then caused the assets of Crista to be revalued up to $169 million on the basis of fair market value. In 1989 Crista was liquidated and the assets distributed in specie to Tasman. Tasman then claimed as the “cost” of the Matahina Forest the amount of $169 million. Decision The Judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Gault J. The Court held that section 74(2)(b) had two limbs and the first called for the identification of profits and gains from the sale of timber in the relevant year. Its focus is quite distinct from that giving rise to the cost of that timber for the purpose of reduction of the profit or gain in accordance with the second limb. The first limb has nothing to do with the means by which the timber was acquired and the cost to be ascertained under the second limb. Accordingly there is nothing in section 74(2)(b) that requires a sale transaction to enable a cost to be isolated. The Court agreed with Justice Laurenson in the High Court that section 74(5) is merely a machinery provision which is not the only means by which cost of timber can be identified. The Commissioner submitted that “cost” in section 74(2)(b) equated with expenditure and the appellant submitted that “cost” is to be equated with economic sacrifice and that the cost of acquisition was the eco- nomic value sacrificed to acquire the timber. The Commissioner’s submission was rejected. The Court stated that “profits or gains” in section 74(2)(b) is to be given its ordinary business meaning (CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited \[1995\] 3 NZLR 513 at 515) and accordingly the word “cost” in the same sentence should also not be construed narrowly. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 20 Loans acquired in business takeover: whether capital or revenue CIR v Wrightson Limited money’s worth, which Tasman had to give to acquire the timber. The cost to Tasman was the loss of the propor- tion of the assets transferred by it which represented the value of the timber acquired. The Court went on to state that they were not persuaded that the exchange was not a sale for the purposes of section 74(5). The Court therefore did not apply that aspect of the decision in V H Farnsworth v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,259. As obiter comment the Court stated that they were not convinced that the exchange transaction in question could properly be described as an exchange within the technical meaning of that term so as to distinguish it from the separate concepts of sale and barter. Decision date: 15 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Acquisition of book debts, capital v revenue, assessable income Summary This was the Commissioner’s appeal from the High Court decision of Heron J. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of Heron J and found in favour of the Commissioner. Facts Wrightson Limited (“Wrightson”) was part of the Fletcher Challenge group of companies. It provided a wide range of services to the rural community and operated through 40 rural service centres. The services it provided through these centres included the sale of goods (e.g. seeds, fertilisers, fencing materials), services as real estate agents/stock agents/auctioneers and credit and loan facilities to its customers. The credit and loan facilities related to both short-term credit on the purchase of goods and medium-long term loans to customers with security taken over assets owned by the borrowing customer. Wrightson also took money on call and term deposits, paying interest accordingly. Therefore, in many respects part of Wrightson’s activi- ties were similar to that of any ordinary lending institu- tion. In 1986 Wrightson acquired all of the rural services business of Dalgety Crown. At the time, Dalgety Crown was carrying on a business which was substantially the same as Wrightson, including the provision of credit and loan facilities to its customers. As part of the deal to acquire the rural services business of Dalgety Crown, Wrightson acquired debts with a face value of $117m at a cost of $104.3m. The High Court found that the accounts were purchased for the purpose of adding to the profit-making structure of Wrightson’s stock and station agency business and therefore the amounts subsequently recovered in excess of the cost of the debts were capital receipts. For the purposes of the appeal the Commissioner abandoned his argument under section 65(2)(e), third limb, and concentrated on section 65(2)(a). On its part, Wrightson conceded the point that they were in the business of money lending. Decision The Court of Appeal accepted Wrightson’s submission that, in the absence of a provision like section 85 dealing with a particular kind of asset, when an asset like stock in trade or a book debt is acquired as part of a capital transaction it is ordinarily to be treated as a capital item. Basically, it would appear to make no difference whether the acquirer is starting up a new business or supplementing an existing business. As long as the acquirer continues to operate the acquired business separately from its existing business, the gains or losses made on the trading stock are capital in nature. How- ever, if the retailer on acquiring the competitor’s new business immediately integrates it into its existing business and the purchase was made with that objective a different view can be taken. The Court was prepared to accept that if Wrightson had done no more than collect the debts on a separate ledger The Court held that in respect of the in specie distribu- tions the “cost” to Tasman in acquiring the forests was the amount paid for the company shares which gave access to the forestry assets. The appropriate proportion of that cost is to be treated as the cost of timber. The Court held that with regard to the Matahina forest the cost of the timber was that proportion of the price paid for the shares allocated to the standing timber. This differs from what Tasman claimed and the subsequent revaluation from $105 million to $169 million cannot be taken into account in the cost of timber for Tasman. The Court had no difficulty in holding that in the exchange transaction Tasman incurred a cost in the acquisition of the forests received. The transfer of forests and the allocation of shares was something of value, from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 21 and applied the proceeds elsewhere in its business then the transaction would have retained a capital character in relation to the debts. The Court in Crompton v Reynolds & Gibson makes that clear. However, Wrightson in this case did not acquire the book debts without material change. They were revolving accounts and thus had fluctuating balances. They were intended to be turned into cash by collection in the ordinary operation of Wrightson’s business. Further advances were also made to meet the seasonal requirements of the former Dalgety clients. At page 10 of the decision Justice Blanchard stated: “When so appropriated to that business, which happened immediately, the debts became part of the taxpayer’s circulat- ing capital and repayments were then revenue receipts. They became part of the taxpayer’s money dealing activity. In the language of the President in AA Finance Limited ... the debts then “were part of the revenue earning process rather than additions to the profit-making structure.” As the appropriation was immediate the value adopted was that attributed for the purpose of calculating the price paid to Dalgety.” Thus the case of Crompton, so heavily relied upon by Wrightson, was distinguished and the appeal allowed.
