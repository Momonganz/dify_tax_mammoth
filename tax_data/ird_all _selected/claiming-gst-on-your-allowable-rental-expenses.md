=======================================================================================================

If you're registered for [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
 you can claim the GST on expenses for goods and services. You can do this for goods and services used, or available for use, when you're renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
.

The use of your property for short-stay renting will determine what GST you can claim.

| *   The whole property is rented out (income-earning use) some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately for some of the time.<br>*   Vacant for 62 days or more. | *   You can claim GST on expenses based on the mixed-use asset rules before 1 April 2024.<br>*   For periods after 1 April 2024, you can use the mixed-use asset rules or another fair and reasonable method to apportion costs to reflect the extent of income-earning use of the property. |
| *   All the property is rented out (income-earning use) some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately some of the time.<br>*   Not vacant for 62 days or more. | *   You can claim GST on expenses relating only to income-earning use.<br>*   Do not claim GST on private use expenses.<br>*   Split shared rental expenses based on a fair and reasonable method, for example the days the property was used and available for use. |

Claiming GST on the property purchase
-------------------------------------

You may also be able to get a GST input tax deduction for the purchase of your property (or claim some GST if you owned the property before you registered for GST and started renting out short-stay accommodation.).

Special rules apply for second-hand goods purchased from associated persons and those where the mixed-use asset rules apply. 

If you change the use of your property from taxable to exempt, or sell it, you must account for GST on disposal.
