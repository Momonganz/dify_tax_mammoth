================================================================================================================================

This page sets out what activities are eligible for a research and development (R&D) loss tax credit. It also shows those activities that are not eligible for the tax credit.

Your research and development (R&D) should be a study to gain new knowledge of a scientific or technical nature. This can result in new or large improvements to materials, products, devices, processes or services.

Research activities
-------------------

Your research must:

*   be original
*   involve a planned investigation.

Planned investigations should be about gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. 

### Original 

Original is defined as being new. That is, not already available publicly or commercially. This also covers research and development to create something new for your company.

### Planned

Planned is defined as a proposed strategy for a future goal. There should be a stated end result and a structured approach for achieving this.

### Investigation

Investigation is defined as a series of processes with clear steps to gain new knowledge.

### New knowledge

New knowledge refers to a new theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. For example, knowledge that was unknown before and not expected.

Development
-----------

Development uses research findings to produce new, innovative or substantially improved:

*   materials
*   devices
*   products
*   processes
*   systems
*   services.  

### Substantial improvement

Substantial improvement has a high threshold. It is more than just an improvement and should be easily recognised. There should be an identifiable amount of originality and innovation.

### Innovation

This is the way to tell if your project is R&D. It separates your project from business-as-usual activities.

### Development activities excluded for the R&D loss tax credit 

There are development activities excluded for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit.

*   Activities that happen before commercial production. These also known as pre-production activities. For example, tooling-up, trial runs, production planning, and start-up procedures.
*   Activities that have moved into commercial production.
*   Activities that seek to duplicate work already developed by others. These are not R&D unless you can show that the knowledge is not available to the company, for example, a trade secret.
*   Activities that reproduce existing product or process, for example, reverse engineering. 

Examples of areas considered to be R&D

The following are examples of what may be considered R&D and must meet the definition for the R&D loss tax credit: 

*   A deliberate search for new knowledge, intellectual property and know-how.
*   A clearly defined project with separate and identifiable costs.
*   Results written up as part of a knowledge capture during or at the end of an R&D project.
*   Freedom to Operate (FTO) search and analysis as part of planning and scoping the R&D project. FTO is required when determining whether valid intellectual property rights exist, or will be infringed.

**Software**

*   Application programme interfacing where unknown programme interactions require new technical solutions.
*   Complex data capture and analysis requiring new technical solutions.

Examples of areas considered not to be R&D

The following are examples of some areas that aren't considered R&D for the purposes of the R&D loss tax credit:

*   Exploring if something is already known compared to gaining new knowledge.
*   Reverse engineering or copying compared to substantially improving something.
*   Routine design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies, seasonal or other periodic design changes to existing products.
*   Adapting an existing product or process to a particular customer's need or site. 
*   Drafting documents to publish or communicate research results. 
*   Work to implement or comply with international quality management systems, for example, ISO 9001.
*   Clinical trials beyond Phase II.

**Software**

*   Supporting, de-bugging or making minor improvements to existing computer software.
*   Business support systems or infrastructure development, for example, a database built to manage the company's research projects.
*   Business-as-usual software development without noticeable innovation. 
*   Database creation.
*   Improvements to existing software and systems. 
*   Cross-platform development and programming.
*   User interface design, dashboard creation, front-end functionality design and development. 
*   Automated data capture and analysis.
*   Adding modules to existing software unless it can be show that something is significantly different to what is already available. 
*   Development of industry standard products not noticeably different from what is currently available.
