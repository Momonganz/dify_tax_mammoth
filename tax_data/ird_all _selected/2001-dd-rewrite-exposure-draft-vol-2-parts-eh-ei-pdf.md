In each case, more detailed calculation rules appear in section EI 5. Consequently, four categories of control interests (3)Accordingly, the rules in section EI 3 for calculating control interests by totalling various direct and indirect control interests and associated parties’ interests are applied on a category-by-category basis.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 623 EI 3 Control interest: total of direct, indirect, and associated person interests A New Zealand resident’s control interest in a foreign company at any time is the total of the following for the relevant control interest category: (a)any direct control interest that the person holds in the company: (b)any direct control interests in the company held by persons associated with the New Zealand resident: (c)any indirect control interests that the person holds in the company: (d)any indirect control interests in the company held by persons associated with the New Zealand resident. Origin:CG 4(2). Defined terms:associated person, control interest, control interest category, foreign company, New Zealand resident, person. EI 4 Limits to requirement to include associated person interests Non-resident relatives (1)For the purposes of section EI 3, a New Zealand resident is associated with a non-resident relative only if the New Zealand resident holds a direct control interest or indirect control interest in the foreign company. No double counting (2)Despite section EI 3 (b) and (d), for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC, a direct control interest or indirect control interest may be counted only once. Origin:(1) CG 4(3). (2) CG 4(7). Defined terms:associated person, CFC, control interest, foreign company, New Zealand resident, non-resident, relative. Comment:Current section CG 4 (7) appears necessary only to deal with the associated person aggregation, even though it is more broadly drafted. EI 5 Direct control interests Categories of direct control interest (1)A person has a direct control interest in a foreign company at any time if they hold— (a)any of the shares in the foreign company: (b)any of the shareholder decision-making rights (as defined in section OB 1 (Definitions)) for the company: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 624 EI – CFC and FIF rules (c)a right to receive (or to apply) any of the income of the company for the accounting period in which the time falls: (d)a right to receive (or to apply) any of the value of the net assets of the company, if they are distributed. Percentage of total is counted (2)The direct control interest in each control interest category is the percentage of the total that the person holds. Available subscribed capital measurement (3)When the direct control interest in the category in subsection (1)(a) is calculated, the percentage is the total of the available subscribed capital per share of the shares held as a percentage of the total available subscribed capital per share of all shares in the company. Varying decision-making rights (4)When the direct control interest in the category in subsection (1)(b) is calculated, if the percentage varies between the rights described in the different paragraphs of the definition in section OB 1 (Definitions), the highest percentage is taken. Income distribution rights: assumptions (5)When the direct control interest in the category in subsection (1)(c) is calculated, it is assumed that— (a)the income is distributed on the last day of the accounting period; and (b)the person’s entitlement is unchanged during the period; and (c)a payment of interest on a debenture subject to section FC 1 (Floating rate of interest on debentures) or section FC 2 (Interest on debentures issued in substitution for shares) is a distribution of income.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 625 Examples of entitlement (2)A person is entitled to acquire or extinguish something if the entitlement is absolute or contingent and whether the entitlement— (a)arises under a company’s constitution; or (b)arises under the terms of an option; or (c)arises under the terms of a convertible note; or (d)arises under the terms of any arrangement substantially similar to any of those described in paragraphs (a) to (c); or (e)arises in some other way. Standard security arrangements (3)Despite subsections (1) and (2), a person is not treated as being entitled to acquire something if— (a)the entitlement arises under a security arrangement; and (b)the person acquired the security arrangement in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis; and (c)the security arrangement’s terms conform to generally accepted commercial practice. No double counting (4)Despite subsections (1) and (2), for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC, each of the percentage holdings described in section EI 5 may be counted only once.

EI 7 Indirect control interests How an indirect control interest arises (1)A person has an indirect control interest in a foreign company to the extent to which the rules in this section attribute to them some or all of the direct control interests held by a CFC in the foreign company. Attribution of the CFC’s direct interests (2)A CFC’s direct control interest in another foreign company is attributed under the following subsections. Associates (3)For the purposes of this section, the CFC is treated as also holding any direct control interests in the foreign company held by persons associated with the CFC. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 626 EI – CFC and FIF rules Attribution of direct interests to smallest controlling group (4)The rules in subsections (6) to (11) apply to attribute the CFC’s direct control interests to the smallest controlling group, to ensure that the attribution exercise does not dilute recognition of a factual chain of control. Attribution on basis of respective income interests (5)If the CFC’s direct control interests are attributed to more than 1 person, the direct control interests are divided in proportion to each group member’s respective income interest in the CFC. If only one controlling group (6)If there is only 1 group of New Zealand residents whose control interests have caused the CFC to be a CFC under section EI 1, the CFC’s direct control interests are treated as being held by that group. More than one group but one is smallest (7)If there is more than 1 group whose control interests have caused the CFC to be a CFC under section EI 1, the CFC’s direct control interests are attributed to the smallest group. Equal smallest groups (8)If there are 2 or more groups that are equally the smallest, and 1 group has the greatest total control interests in the CFC, the attribution is to that group. Equal smallest groups with equal greatest control interests (9)If there are 2 or more smallest groups with equal greatest total control interests in the CFC, the attribution is made in full to each group. No double counting (10)Despite subsection (9), for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC, a direct control interest may be counted only once. Applying this section sequentially down a chain (11)If a foreign company becomes a CFC under this section, this section is then applied to attribute its direct control interests.

Percentage of total is counted (2)The person’s direct income interest is the percentage of the total that the person holds. Highest taken if varying percentages (3)However, if the percentage varies between the different categories, the person’s direct income interest is the highest. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 628 EI – CFC and FIF rules Available subscribed capital measurement (4)When the direct income interest in the category in subsection (1)(a) is calculated, the percentage is the total of the available subscribed capital per share of the shares held as a percentage of the total available subscribed capital per share of all shares in the company.

Calculation of branch equivalent income or loss EI 21 Branch equivalent income or loss: calculation rules Rules set out in this section (1)For the purposes of calculating a person’s attributed CFC income or loss, the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC for an accounting period is calculated under the rules in this section. (The person is called the taxpayer in these rules.) CFC treated as New Zealand resident (2) The rules in this Act are applied as if the CFC were always a New Zealand resident, and— (a)the CFC’s branch equivalent income for the accounting period is equal to the CFC’s net income for the period; and (b)the CFC’s branch equivalent loss for the accounting period is equal to the CFC’s net loss for the period. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 635 Modifications to rules (3)However, the rules in the Act are modified by the following subsections when doing the calculation. Conversion to New Zealand dollars (4)The taxpayer must choose either— (a)for all the calculations to be done in New Zealand dollars; or (b)for all the calculations to be done in the currency of the CFC’s financial accounts. (If the CFC has no financial accounts, the currency used is that of the CFC’s country of residence.) The result is then converted into New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month that falls in the period. Consent for change of currency (5)Having chosen a currency, the taxpayer must use the same currency for calculating branch equivalent income or loss for the CFC for each later consecutive accounting period, unless the Commissioner allows the taxpayer to choose again. Change for commercial purpose (6)The Commissioner may consent to a change under subsection (5) only if satisfied that— (a)the taxpayer’s main purpose in changing is a commercial one (the advancing, deferring, or reducing of tax not being a commercial purpose); and (b)the change does not have an effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity), subpart DN (Attributed losses from foreign equity), or this subpart. New Zealand currency for financial arrangements (7)Despite subsections (4) to (6), New Zealand currency calculations must be used to calculate that part of the branch equivalent income or loss attributable to financial arrangements if— (a)the total value of financial arrangements to which the CFC is a party is more than $1,000,000 at any time during the relevant accounting period (applying section EH 23 (2)(b) to measure the values); or (b)the CFC’s total net foreign exchange loss attributable to financial arrangements, calculated under subsections (4) to (6) for the accounting period, is more than $100,000. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 636 EI – CFC and FIF rules Limit to subsection (7) (8)Subsection (7) does not apply to a financial arrangement if— (a)it is a variable principal debt instrument; and (b)all the rights and obligations of all the parties to the financial arrangement are expressed in the currency chosen under subsection (4)(b); and (c)no other party to the financial arrangement is associated with the CFC; and (d)no person enters into the financial arrangement under an arrangement that has a purpose of defeating the application of subsection (7). Opening cost base: tangible assets: first period (9)If the taxpayer had no attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous accounting period, the taxpayer must choose whether to measure the cost base at the start of an accounting period of premises, plant, machinery, equipment, and trading stock of the CFC at— (a)historical cost minus accumulated depreciation (if any), or another value used by the CFC as the starting value for the period for income tax calculations in the country in which the CFC is resident (but only if the value is below market value); or (b)the starting value that would be used under this Act if the CFC had always been a New Zealand resident. Opening cost base: tangible assets: later periods (10)If the taxpayer had attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous period, the cost base at the start of an accounting period of premises, plant, machinery, equipment, and trading stock of the CFC is the closing value at the end of the previous period used to calculate the income or loss. Opening cost base: financial arrangements: first period (11)If the taxpayer had no attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the previous accounting period, the taxpayer must choose to calculate the consideration under the financial arrangements rules for a financial arrangement at the start of an accounting period, at either— (a)the market value of the financial arrangement; or (b)the absolute value calculated using the formula— consideration paid to the CFC + expenditure – consideration paid by the CFC – income. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 637 Definition of items in formula (12)In the formula,— (a) consideration paid to the CFC is the consideration paid to the CFC for all periods before the accounting period: (b) expenditure is expenditure that would have been incurred under the financial arrangements rules for all periods before the accounting period if the CFC had been resident in New Zealand: (c) consideration paid by the CFC is the consideration paid by the CFC for all periods before the accounting period: (d)income is income that would have been derived under the financial arrangements rules for all periods before the accounting period if the CFC had been resident in New Zealand. Provisions that do not apply (13)The following provisions do not apply: (a)the consolidation rules: (b)sections CD 32 to CD 39, subpart CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity), subpart DN (Attributed losses from foreign equity), or this subpart to the extent to which any of the sections or subparts would result in attributed CFC income, attributed CFC loss, or attributed repatriation for the CFC: (c)section CW 8 (Money lent to government of New Zealand): (d)section CW 37 (1) (Local and regional promotion bodies): (e)section DO 1 (Enhancements to land, except trees) and section DO 2 (Shelter belts): (f)section EH 6 (Non-resident party carrying on business), section EH 7 (Trustee not resident), and section EH 17 (a) (Financial arrangements rules do not apply): (g)section CB 26 (Refunds under income equalisation scheme), subpart DQ (Income equalisation schemes), and subpart EN (Income equalisation schemes): (h)subpart FG (Apportionment of interest costs): (i)section GC 3 (Effect on continuity provisions of change in beneficiaries of trust): (j)section IE 1 (Net losses may be offset against future net income) and section IF 1 (Net losses may be offset against future net income): (k)section IG 2 (Net loss offset between group companies) and section IG 3 (Special provisions in relation to group companies for 1991-92 income year). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 638 EI – CFC and FIF rules Business treated as if carried on in New Zealand (14)The following provisions apply as if the CFC’s business activities were carried on in New Zealand: (a)sections CT 1 to CT 4, CT 6 to CT 8, CX 38, DT 1 to DT 14, DT 16, DT 17, DT 19, and IH 3, all of which are sections dealing with petroleum mining: (b)sections DO 4, DO 6, DO 7, DP 1, DP 3 to DP 5, and DP 9, all of which are sections dealing with farming and forestry expenditure: (c)section EZ 11 (Additional depreciation loss for excluded depreciable property that is plant or machinery): (d)the definitions in subpart OB (General definitions) that specifically apply for the purposes of those sections. Transfer pricing rules (15)Section GD 13 (Cross-border arrangement between associated persons) applies only to a transaction that has a purpose or effect of defeating any of the jurisdictional ring-fencing rules for CFC losses and tax credits in section DN 4 (Ring-fencing cap on deduction), section IE 3 (Attributed foreign net losses), section IG 4 (Group of companies attributed foreign net losses), section LC 4 (Foreign tax credits-controlled foreign companies), and section LC 5 (Group of companies controlled foreign company tax credits). Also, when section GD 13 is applied, the relevant definitions of associated persons are those in both section OD 7 (Defining when 2 persons are associated persons) and section OD 8 (3) (Further definitions of associated persons). Dividends generally (16)Sections CW 9 to CW 11 (which are sections dealing with exempt income from equity) and section CZ 8 (Treatment of units and interests in unit trusts and group investment funds on issue as at 1 April 1996) do not apply and dividends are income that is not exempt income, unless subsection (17) applies. Some dividends exempt income (17)Despite subsection (16), dividends are exempt income of the CFC if either— (a)the dividends are derived by the CFC from another CFC and the taxpayer has a 10% or greater income interest (under the rules in sections EI 14 to EI 17) in the other CFC for an accounting period falling in the same relevant income year or the previous income year; or (b)the dividends are from shares that are an attributing interest in a FIF of the CFC. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 639 Benefits from money advanced (18)When section CC 9 (Consideration other than in money) is applied, the borrower is treated as if it carries on a business in New Zealand. No tainting by association (19)Sections CB 6 to CB 8 (which are sections dealing with the disposal of land within 10 years) and section CV 1 (Companies within wholly- owned groups) do not apply to treat an amount derived by the CFC as income merely because of the activities of a person associated with the CFC if the associate is a non-resident. Crown acquisition of land (20)The reference in section EJ 4 (1) (Disposal of land to Crown) to the Crown includes any relevant government outside New Zealand. Depreciation recovered (21)When sections EF 40 to EF 43 are applied, the CFC is treated as having had a deduction for an amount of depreciation allowance or depreciation loss, and to have an adjusted tax value accordingly, if an amount of depreciation allowance or depreciation loss has been deducted when calculating the CFC’s branch equivalent income or loss for any period and the attributed CFC income or loss of any person. GST and value-added taxes (22)When section CX 1 (Goods and services tax), section DB 2 (Goods and services tax), section EF 37 (Consideration for purposes of section EF 36), section EF 44 (Cost: goods and services tax), section EZ 1 (FIF interests held on 1 April 1993), and section EZ 12 (Additional depreciation loss for acquisitions or qualifying improvements between 16 December 1991 and 1 April 1994) are applied, references to output tax, input tax or goods and services tax payable include a reference to the equivalent item arising under the value-added tax or other tax rules of a country or territory outside New Zealand if the rules have a similar intent and application to the New Zealand goods and services tax rules. Government grants to businesses (23)When section DF 1 (Government grants to businesses) is applied, a reference to the New Zealand government includes a government outside New Zealand but, to the extent to which section DF 1 still does not apply to a grant or subsidy to the CFC from a government, the grant or subsidy is income of the CFC. Subvention payments (24)If an amount is paid as consideration for the transfer of tax losses,— (a)it is income if derived by the CFC; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 640 EI – CFC and FIF rules (b)it is a deduction if payable by the CFC but only if paid to a person resident in the same country as the CFC and if deductible under the taxation law of that country. Life insurer (25)Subsection (26) applies if— (a)the CFC itself carries on the business of providing life insurance; or (b)shares in the CFC are held (directly or indirectly) by a foreign company (the parent company, in subsection (26)) that carries on the business of providing life insurance and those shares have to be taken into account under sections EI 8 to EI 13 to calculate the taxpayer’s income interest in the CFC. Policyholders (26)If the test in subsection (25) is met, the life insurance rules do not apply and the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC is the amount actuarially determined to be the part of the CFC’s net income or loss to which shareholders (and not policyholders in either the CFC or the parent) are entitled. When subsection (26) does not apply (27)Despite subsection (25), subsection (26) does not apply if the Commissioner— (a)considers that the amount calculated is not a reasonable reflection of the part attributable to shareholders; or (b)has requested and not received sufficient information to enable the actuarial calculation to be reviewed. Mineral mining activities (28)Sections CG 13 to CG 15, CU 1 to CU 25, CX 39 to CX 41, CZ 5, CZ 6, DU 1 to DU 12, DZ 5, IH 4, and IH 5 (all of which are sections dealing with mineral mining) apply, with any necessary modifications, if the CFC carries on activities outside New Zealand that are substantially the same as the activities to which those sections apply. Petroleum mining activities (29)Sections CT 1 to CT 4, CT 6 to CT 8, CX 38, DT 1 to DT 14, DT 16, DT 17, DT 19, and IH 3 (all of which are sections dealing with petroleum mining) apply, with any necessary modifications, if the CFC carries on petroleum mining activities outside New Zealand that are substantially the same as the petroleum mining activities to which those sections apply. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 641 Finance leases and specified leases (30)A lease entered into by the CFC before the start of the first accounting period in which the CFC is a CFC is neither a finance lease (subject to the financial arrangements rules and sections FC 8A to FC 8I) nor a specified lease (subject to the rules in sections FC 6 to FC 8). When subsection (30) does not apply (31)Subsection (30) does not apply if another party to the lease is either a CFC or a New Zealand resident. Taxable distribution from non-qualifying trust (32)If the CFC gets a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust— (a)section HH 3 (4) (Gross income assessable to beneficiaries) does not apply; and (b)the taxable distribution is not taken into account in calculating the CFC’s branch equivalent income or loss; and (c)section EI 19 applies. CFC with interest in FIF (33)If the CFC has rights in a FIF,— (a) the rights are not prevented from being an attributing interest of the CFC in a FIF merely because the notional New Zealand residence of the CFC under subsection (2) causes section EI 32 to apply; and (b) the CFC’s FIF income or loss is not taken into account in calculating the branch equivalent income; and (c) section EI 46 applies. Transitional treatment of cross-border reinsurance (34)Section CZ 2 (General insurance with risk period straddling 1 July 1993) applies as if the reference to New Zealand were a reference to the CFC’s country of residence.

Comment:Although the length of this section is contrary to standard rewrite practice, an exception is considered justified because of the fact that the subsections are a list of items that have a similar function. An alternative is to put the modifying rules in a separate schedule, but it is debatable whether separation would assist readers. Draft subsection (21) needs further review to ensure it reflects the current depreciation rules. The interrelationship of draft subsections (29) and (14)(a) needs further review. The subsections should possibly be combined.

Pro-rating (3)If subsection (1) or (2) applies to shorten an accounting period of a CFC, a person with attributed CFC income or loss from the CFC for the period may choose to calculate the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC either— (a)using the results for the shortened period only; or (b)by applying the pro-rating formula in subsection (4) to the results for the unshortened period. Pro-rating formula (4)The formula for calculating branch equivalent income or loss under subsection (3)(b) is— days in shortened periodunshortened period branch equivalent income or loss x days in unshortened period.

Change of CFC’s balance date EI 26 Change of CFC’s balance date When this section applies (1)This section applies if a person— (a)has an income interest in a CFC; and (b)has calculated attributed CFC income or loss or attributed repatriation from the CFC on the basis of one accounting year (the old accounting year); and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 646 EI – CFC and FIF rules (c)wants to change to use a different accounting year (the new accounting year) for the calculations. Change requiring Commissioner’s consent (2)The person may make the change only if the Commissioner agrees. Commissioner’s reasons (3)The Commissioner may consider any relevant factors when making the decision, including— (a)whether the change is sought because ownership of the CFC has changed: (b)whether the change is sought because of taxation or other legal requirements in a country where the CFC is resident or does business: (c)whether the change is sought to achieve consistent balance dates in a group of companies: (d)whether the change would postpone liability to income tax on attributed CFC income or on attributed repatriation or to dividend withholding payment on attributed repatriation. No transitional deferral (4)If the new accounting year ends in a later income year than the year the old accounting year ends in, and that fact would result in an amount of attributed CFC income or attributed repatriation being derived in the later income year, the amount is not deferred to the later income year and instead is treated as derived in the previous income year.

Comment:It would probably be preferable to reverse the default rule, that is, daily measurement used unless the person chooses to measure quarterly. If not reversed, this is, arguably, too obscure a spot for this rule. Anti-avoidance rule: stapled stock EI 28 Anti-avoidance rule: stapled stock When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a New Zealand resident holds rights (the stapled rights) that give rise to an income interest or control interest in a foreign company; and (b)the rights may, or may ordinarily, be disposed of only together with rights in another company; and (c)the other company is a New Zealand resident or a CFC. Stapled rights held by company (2)When each of subpart CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity), subpart DN (Attributed losses from foreign equity), and this subpart is applied, the stapled rights are held by the other company and not by the person.

Rights accruing before first becoming resident (2)The rights must have accrued before the person first became a New Zealand resident. Attribution formula (3)The extent to which the rights have accrued before the person first became a resident is calculated using the formula— adjusted immigration value current value xcurrent value. Definition of items in formula (4)In the formula,— (a)adjusted immigration value is the market value of the rights on the day on which the person first became a New Zealand resident, adjusted to the extent reasonable to allow for the rate of earnings (or loss) of the scheme from that day until the relevant time: (b)current value is the market value of the rights at the relevant time. Employee scheme or self-employed (5)Either— (a)the scheme must be one where the person’s rights can be acquired only through the person’s employment; or (b)the person must be wholly or mainly self-employed, either when the person first acquired the rights or at the relevant time for applying this section.

Contributions by person, employer, or other scheme (7)Contributions to the scheme for the person’s benefit must be made only by or on behalf of— (a)the person; or (b)the person’s employer (or a person associated with the employer); or (c)the representatives of another superannuation scheme— (i)as a transfer of the person’s benefit rights in the other scheme; and (ii)if those benefit rights would have qualified for the exemption in this section. Restricted rights to assign or cash in (8)The person’s future benefits under the scheme must not be able to be assigned, or exchanged for a current receipt of cash (or other property), except— (a)if the person becomes physically incapacitated; or (b)if the person is transferring the benefit rights into another, similar, scheme; or (c)when or after the person retires at normal retiring age; or (d)if the person is assigning the benefit rights to a spouse under a matrimonial property agreement; or (e)at the cost of a substantial decrease in the present value of the benefits. Matrimonial property assignment (9)When the person has obtained the rights by their being assigned under a matrimonial property agreement, the exemption in this section applies if the assignor spouse would have been entitled to it.

EI 37 Non-resident’s pension or annuity exemption Exemption (1)The rights of a natural person to benefit from a pension or annuity provided by a FIF are not an attributing interest if the requirements in subsections (2) and (3) are met. Relevant period of non-residence (2)The person must have provided the consideration for acquiring the rights— (a)when the person was not resident in New Zealand; or (b)when the person was resident in New Zealand but in the period ending 3 years after the end of the income year in which they last became a New Zealand resident; or (c)when the person was resident in New Zealand but as a result of commuting or transferring their interest in a superannuation fund in anticipation of their ceasing to be a New Zealand resident.

Comment:Should there be an exception for physical incapacity? Should there be an exception for transfers to another scheme? Should there be an exception for retirement at normal retiring age? See draft section EI 36 (7) for a comparison. The Tax Information Bulletin vol 13, no 2 (February 2001) expresses the view that the correct interpretation of the 4-year rule in draft subsection (2)(b) is that, if consideration is provided after the 4-year period, the interest becomes a FIF only from the end of the 4-year exemption for immigrants. However, this does not seem to reflect the statutory wording – which may well have contemplated only a single lump sum payment for any annuity, – meaning that a payment after the end of the 4-year period will normally coexist with the fact that the annuity only first arises then in any event. The reference in draft subsection (4) to the Income Tax Amendment Act 2002 is a reference to the Act that will implement the rewrite of Parts A to E. Calculation of FIF income or loss EI 38 Four calculation methods Use of one calculation method (1)If the tests in section CQ 5 (When FIF income arises) or section DN 6 (When FIF loss arises) are met, the amount of a person’s FIF income or loss is calculated under— (a)the accounting profits method; or (b)the branch equivalent method; or (c)the comparative value method; or (d)the deemed rate of return method.

EI 39 Exclusion of death benefit amounts Death benefit not included in FIF income (1)When this section applies, a person is treated as not deriving FIF income to the extent to which the income arises solely from receiving a death benefit under a life insurance policy. Contract before becoming resident (2)This section applies if— (a)the person (or the deceased) (the contracting party), when not a New Zealand resident, entered into a binding contract that gave rise to the benefit; and (b)at the time the contract was entered into, the contracting party either had not previously been a New Zealand resident or had not been a resident for at least the previous 10 years; and (c)the benefit was not increased by a voluntary action taken after the contracting party became a resident.

Accounting profits method (2)A person may use the accounting profits method for an accounting period to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF only if— (a)the FIF is a company; and (b)at all times during the accounting period when the FIF exists, interests in the FIF similar to the person’s attributing interest were— (i)quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange; or (ii)offered widely by or on behalf of the FIF to the public in one or more countries; and (c)the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the FIF for the accounting period are calculated under generally accepted accounting principles (or an equivalent standard for consistent and undistorted reporting of net profits) of the country in which the FIF is resident; and (d)the net after-tax accounting profits or losses are detailed in financial statements— (i)sent or made available to shareholders in the FIF; and (ii)readily available to interested members of the public; and (iii)audited by a chartered accountant (or accountant of equivalent professional standard in the country in which the FIF is resident); and (iv)for which such an accountant has given a standard audit opinion, without qualifications, to the effect that the financial statements represent the income and financial position of the FIF to the degree of validity normally required in the country in which the FIF is resident; and (e)the net after-tax accounting profits or losses are calculated, in any case in which the FIF has one or more subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 658 EI – CFC and FIF rules (f)the net after-tax accounting profits or losses include any extraordinary items; and (g)the person has no reason to believe that the net after-tax accounting profits or losses do not fairly represent the net after- tax profits or losses of the FIF for the accounting period; and (h)the FIF is not an entity described in schedule 4, part C; and (i)the Commissioner has not concluded that the net after-tax accounting profits or losses do not fairly represent the net after- tax profits or losses of the FIF for the accounting period. Branch equivalent method (3)A person may use the branch equivalent method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF for an accounting period only if— (a)the FIF is a company; and (b)the person can provide to the Commissioner, if requested, sufficient information to enable the Commissioner to check the calculations required by section EI 43. Deemed rate of return method (4)A person may use the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year only if any of the following apply: (a)it is not reasonably practicable for the person to use either— (i)the comparative value method, because the person cannot determine the market value of the attributing interest at the end of the income year; or (ii)the accounting profits method for any accounting period that falls wholly or partly in the year; or (b)the person is a natural person and at all times during the income year the total value of attributing interests in FIFs held by the person is not more than $250,000, the value of each interest being— (i)its book value (calculated under section EI 45 (7)) at the end of the previous income year, if the person held the interest then and used the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income for all attributing interests in the previous year: (ii)its market value, in any other case; or (c)section EI 41 requires the person to use that method; or (d)section EI 49 requires the person to continue using that method.

EI 42 Accounting profits method Calculation formula (1)If a person is using the accounting profits method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF, the total FIF income or loss from all their attributing interests in the FIF for the relevant accounting period is calculated using the formula— accounting profits or losses x income interest. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 660 EI – CFC and FIF rules Definition of items in formula (2)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) and (4). Accounting profits or losses (3)Accounting profits or losses is the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the FIF for the accounting period. Income interest (4)Income interest is the person’s income interest in the FIF for the accounting period. The income interest is calculated under all the following CFC rules (applying as if the FIF were a CFC): (a)sections EI 8 to EI 11 and EI 13 (which, in general, describe how to calculate an income interest by totalling direct and indirect interests): (b)sections EI 16 and section EI 17 (which describe how to deal with periods of non-residence and variations in ownership during an accounting period): (c)section EI 27 (which describes a concession to allow ownership to be measured only on quarterly measurement dates) but subject to subsection (5). Election to measure on 31 March only (5)In order to simplify the process of calculating the person’s income interest, the person may choose to be treated as holding, at all times during a tax year, the same interest (including a zero one) that they held at the end of the tax year. The person makes the election by completing their return of income accordingly for the relevant income year. Choice irrevocable (6)An election under subsection (5) is— (a)irrevocable and applies to the person and all their attributing interests in the FIF in later years; but (b)subject to the anti-avoidance rules in section GC 9 (Variations in control or income interests in foreign companies) and section GC 10 (Attributed foreign income and foreign investment fund income–arrangements in respect of elections). Conversion to New Zealand dollars (7)The person must choose either— (a)for all the calculations to be done in the currency of the FIF’s financial accounts, the result being then converted into New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month that falls in the accounting period; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 661 (b)for all the calculations of the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the FIF to be done in New Zealand dollars. Reduced FIF loss if economic loss not equivalent (8)In the cases described in subsections (9) and (10), the amount of any FIF loss calculated under subsection (1) is reduced to be equal to the person’s corresponding economic loss (if any). Application of subsection (8) if no economic loss (9)Subsection (8) applies if the person suffers no, or substantially no, economic loss corresponding to the FIF loss, whether because of a call option, a put option, or any other reason. Application of subsection (8) if FIF loss excessive (10)Subsection (8) also applies if the amount of FIF loss is more than any corresponding economic loss suffered by the person, whether because of the application of the rules for calculating the person’s income interest or any other reason.

Comment:The ‘income interest’ calculation includes all the person’s rights in the FIF. Therefore, the calculation result has to be the result for all the person’s attributing interests in the FIF. Arguably, therefore, draft section EI 40 (1) should require the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods to be used for all interests in a FIF, even if in different classes. Rather than cross-referring, in draft subsection (3), to the CFC rules, it would have been possible to repeat those rules, but this would be a lengthy exercise. EI 43 Branch equivalent method Calculation formula (1)If a person is using the branch equivalent method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF, the total FIF income or loss from all their attributing interests in the FIF for the relevant accounting period is calculated using the formula— branch equivalent income or loss x income interest. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 662 EI – CFC and FIF rules Definition of items in formula (2)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) and (4). Branch equivalent income or loss (3)Branch equivalent income or loss is the branch equivalent income or loss of the FIF for the accounting period. This is calculated by applying section EI 21 of the CFC rules— (a)as if the FIF were a CFC and the person were calculating their attributed CFC income or loss; but (b)subject to subsections (5) and (6). Income interest (4)Income interest is the person’s income interest in the FIF for the accounting period. The income interest is calculated under all the following CFC rules (applying as if the FIF were a CFC): (a)sections EI 8 to EI 11 and EI 13 (which, in general, describe how to calculate an income interest by totalling direct and indirect interests): (b)sections EI 16 and EI 17 (which describe how to deal with periods of non-residence and variations in ownership during an accounting period): (c)section EI 27 (which describes a concession to allow ownership to be measured only on quarterly measurement dates). Taxable distribution (5)If the FIF derives a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust in the accounting period,—– (a)the taxable distribution is excluded when calculating the FIF’s branch equivalent income or loss (due to the combined effect of subsection (1) and section EI 21 (32)); and (b)the person has additional attributed CFC income calculated by multiplying the taxable distribution by the person’s income interest in the FIF; and (c)the person is liable for income tax on the additional attributed CFC income at the rate in schedule 1 that applies to amounts under section HH 3 (4) (Gross income assessable to beneficiaries). Interest in foreign company (6)If the FIF itself has an income interest (calculated under subsection (4)) in a foreign company for the accounting period, the person has additional FIF income or loss calculated using the formula— interest x FIF’s FIF income or loss. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 663 Definition of items in formula (7)In the formula,— (a) interest is the person’s income interest in the FIF for the period: (b)FIF’s FIF income or loss is the FIF’s FIF income or loss calculated under the rules in section EI 46 (4) and (5), as if the FIF were the CFC. Application of CFC rules tax credit rules (8)The rules in section LC 4 (Foreign tax credits—controlled foreign companies) and section LC 5 (Group of companies controlled foreign company tax credits) apply to allow the person to claim foreign tax credits but on the basis of the assumptions made in subsection (9). The rules in those sections allow foreign tax credits relating to attributed CFC income but apply a jurisdictional ring-fencing approach to the use of tax credits. Assumptions in reading tax credit rules (9)The rules in section LC 4 (Foreign tax credits—controlled foreign companies) and section LC 5 (Group of companies controlled foreign company tax credits) are applied as if— (a)the FIF were a CFC; and (b)the FIF income of the person from the FIF were attributed CFC income; and (c)the person’s income interest (calculated under subsection (4)) were their relevant income interest for the purposes of those sections; and (d)any relevant person’s FIF income calculated under the branch equivalent method from a FIF that is resident in the relevant country were attributed CFC income. Reduced FIF loss if economic loss not equivalent (10)In the cases described in subsections (11) and (12), the amount of any FIF loss calculated under subsections (1) and (6) is reduced to be equal to the person’s corresponding economic loss (if any). Application of subsection (10) if no economic loss (11)Subsection (10) applies if the person suffers no, or substantially no, economic loss corresponding to the FIF loss, whether because of a call option, a put option, or any other reason. Application of subsection (10) if FIF loss excessive (12)Subsection (10) also applies if the amount of FIF loss is more than any corresponding economic loss suffered by the person, whether because Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 664 EI – CFC and FIF rules of the application of the rules for calculating the person’s income interest or any other reason.

Comment:See the first comment under draft section EI 42. In draft subsection (4), rather than applying the special tax rate, should the amount simply be grossed up to achieve the same result? Rather than cross-referring, in draft subsections (3), (6), (7), and (8), to the CFC rules, it would have been possible to repeat those rules, but this would be a lengthy exercise. EI 44 Comparative value method Calculation formula (1)If a person is using the comparative value method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF, the FIF income or loss from that interest for the relevant income year is calculated using the formula— (closing value + gains) - (opening value + costs). Definition of items in formula (2)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (3) to (6). Closing value (3)Closing value is the market value of the person’s interest in the FIF at the end of the income year. (The value is zero if the person has disposed of the interest or is then applying another calculation method to it). Gains (4)Gains is the total of all amounts that the person derives during the income year from holding or disposing of the interest. The amounts include any foreign withholding tax or other tax that the person is allowed as a credit under section LC 1 (Credits in respect of tax paid in a country or territory outside New Zealand). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 665 Opening value (5)Opening value is the market value of the person’s interest in the FIF at the end of the previous income year. (The value is zero if the person did not hold the interest then or was then applying another calculation method to it). Costs (6)Costs is the total of all expenditure that the person incurs during the income year in acquiring or increasing the interest. Conversion of foreign currency amounts (7)If an amount is derived from, or incurred on, the interest in a foreign currency during the year, the person must choose either— (a) for each foreign currency amount in the year to be converted into New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate on the day the amount is derived or incurred; or (b)for all foreign currency amounts in the year to be converted into New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each month that falls in the year.

EI 45 Deemed rate of return method Calculation formula changes if interest changes (1)If a person is using the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year, the FIF income or loss is calculated— (a)by the standard formula in subsection (3) if the person has held the interest unchanged throughout the year; and (b)by totalling the amounts calculated by the part-year formula in subsection (5) for each part of the income year during which the interest is unchanged, in any other case. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 666 EI – CFC and FIF rules When an interest changes (2)A person’s attributing interest in a FIF changes during an income year if the person— (a)acquires or increases the interest; or (b)disposes of or reduces the interest (but merely receiving an annuity payment from the interest is not a disposal or reduction). Standard formula (3)The standard formula is— opening book value x deemed rate. Definition of items in standard formula (4)In the standard formula,— (a)opening book value is the book value of the interest at the end of the previous year, calculated under subsection (7) or subsection (8): (b)deemed rate is the rate set by the Governor-General by Order in Council for this section for the relevant income year. Part-year formula (5)The part-year formula is— (opening book value + costs) x (deemed rate x days) 365. Definition of items in part-year formula (6)In the part-year formula,— (a)opening book value is the book value (if any) of the interest at the end of the period before the part-year, calculated under subsection (7) or subsection (8): (b)costs is the total of all expenditure (if any) that the person incurs in acquiring or increasing the interest during the part- year: (c)deemed rate is the rate set by the Governor-General by Order in Council for this section for the relevant income year: (d)days is the number of days in the part-year, (for this purpose, an acquisition or increase is treated as occurring at the start of a day and a disposition or reduction is treated as occurring at the end of a day).

Closing book value zero if changing to another method (9)The closing book value is always zero if the person is using a calculation method for the interest different from the deemed rate of return method at the end of the year or (in a case to which subsection (5) applies) the part-year. Top-up income if deemed rate inadequate (10)If the closing book value of a person’s attributing interest in a FIF at the end of a year or part-year is below zero, the person has additional FIF income equal to the deficit for the relevant income year. Exemption from subsection (10) (11)Subsection (10) does not apply if— (a)the person is a natural person; and (b)at all times during the income year the total value of the person’s attributing interests in FIFs is not more than $250,000, the value of each interest being— (i)its book value (calculated under subsection (7) or subsection (8)) at the end of the previous income year, if the person held the interest then and used the deemed Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 668 EI – CFC and FIF rules rate of return method to calculate FIF income for all attributing interests in the previous year: (ii)its market value, in any other case; and (c)the deficit in closing book value arises only because the person disposed of some or all of the interest; and (d)the gain that the person derived from disposing of the interest or part-interest is not income, except to the extent to which it gives rise to FIF income. Top-up income if gains more than deemed income (12)A person calculating FIF income under the deemed rate of return method can also have additional FIF income under section EI 48. FIF income reduced on disposal if deemed rate excessive (13)If a person has disposed of the whole of an attributing interest in a FIF and the closing book value for the relevant year or part-year is more than zero, the excess is subtracted when the person’s FIF income under the deemed rate of return method for the year is calculated. When subsection (13) does not apply (14)Subsection (13) does not apply if— (a)the person is a natural person; and (b)at all times during the income year the total value of attributing interests in FIFs held by the person is not more than $250,000, the value of each interest being— (i)its book value (calculated under subsection (7) or subsection (8)) at the end of the previous income year, if the person held the interest then and used the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income for all attributing interests in the previous year: (ii)its market value, in any other case; and (c)the gain that the person derived from disposing of the interest or part-interest is not income, except to the extent to which it gives rise to FIF income. Conversion of foreign currency amounts (15)If an amount is derived from, or incurred on, the interest in a foreign currency during the year, the person must choose either— (a)for each foreign currency amount in the year to be converted into New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate on the day the amount is derived or incurred; or (b)for all foreign currency amounts in the year to be converted into New Zealand dollars at the average of the close of trading spot Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 669 exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month that falls in the year.

Additional FIF income or loss if CFC owns FIF EI 46 Additional FIF income or loss if CFC owns FIF When this section applies (1) This section applies if— (a) a person has an income interest of 10% or more in a CFC for an accounting period, under the rules in sections EI 8 to EI 17; and (b)because section EI 21 (33) applies, FIF income and FIF loss is not taken into account in calculating the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC for the period for the person. FIF income or loss formula (2)The person instead has FIF income or loss, for the income year in which the period ends, calculated using the formula— income interest x CFC’s FIF income or loss. Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a) income interest is the person’s income interest in the CFC for the period under the rules in sections EI 8 to EI 13: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 670 EI – CFC and FIF rules (b)CFC’s FIF income or loss is the CFC’s FIF income or loss for the period calculated under subsections (4) and (5). Application of FIF rules to choice of method (4)The person must— (a) choose, under the rules in sections EI 38 to EI 41, the calculation method for calculating the CFC’s FIF income or loss; and (b) otherwise apply the calculation rules in sections EI 38 to EI 49 as if the person directly held the attributing interest; and (c)apply the FIF loss ring-fencing rules in section DN 8 (Ring- fencing cap on deduction: not branch equivalent method) and section DN 9 (Ring-fencing cap on deduction: branch equivalent method) as if the person directly held the attributing interest. Exclusion of policyholder entitlements (5)Despite subsection (4), the CFC’s FIF income or loss does not include any amount actuarially determined to be attributable to policyholders in the CFC or another company as a result of applying the rules in section EI 21 (25) and (26) to the CFC. Unqualified grey list CFCs still subject to rule (6)This section applies whether or not the CFC is an unqualified grey list CFC under the rules in section EI 22 for the period. Origin:(1) CG 7(5).

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 671 No income other than FIF income (2)The person is treated as not having any income from the interest for the period other than FIF income and, in particular, any dividends derived in the period from the interest and any income gain from disposing of the interest in the period are disregarded. No deductions other than FIF loss (3)The person is not allowed a deduction for any amount incurred in the period on acquiring some or all of the interest, except to the extent to which the amount is taken into account under the relevant calculation method in calculating FIF income or loss for the period.

EI 48 Top-up FIF income: deemed rate of return method When this section applies (1)This section applies at any time when a person— (a)has an attributing interest in a FIF for a period; and (b)is calculating the FIF income or loss from the interest using the deemed rate of return method; and (c)derives in the period, from holding or disposing of the interest, an amount that would have been income if section EI 47 (2) had not applied. Gain income if deemed rate inadequate (2)The gain is FIF income to the extent to which the amount calculated using the following formula is positive: total income gains – total FIF income. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 672 EI – CFC and FIF rules Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a)total income gains is the total of amounts (including the amount in question) derived by the person until that time from holding or disposing of the interest that would have been income if section EI 47 (2) had not applied: (b)total FIF income is the total of FIF income (reduced by the total of any FIF losses) derived by the person from the interest until (and including) the relevant period. Consequence of partial sale (4)If the person disposes of part of the interest, this section applies to the part disposed of and the part retained as if they were separate interests.

EI 49 Top-up FIF income: 1 April 1993 uplift interests When this section applies (1)This section applies at any time if a person— (a)has an attributing interest in a FIF for a period; and (b)held the interest on 2 July 1992; and (c)calculated their FIF income from the interest in the period starting on 1 April 1993 under the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method; and (d)was treated as having reacquired the interest on 1 April 1993 for an uplifted cost under section CG 23 (1)(d) (as it applied then); and (e)derives in the period, from holding or disposing of the interest, an amount that would have been income if section EI 47 (2) had not applied. Gain income if FIF income accrual inadequate (2)The gain is FIF income to the extent to which the amount calculated using the following formula is positive: total income gains - total FIF income. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 673 Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a)total income gains is the total of amounts (including the amount in question) that the person derived until that time from holding or disposing of the interest that would have been income if section EI 47 (2) had not applied: (b)total FIF income is the total of FIF income (reduced by the total of any FIF losses) that the person derived from the interest until (and including) the relevant period. Consequence of partial sale (4)If the person disposes of part of the interest, this section applies to the part disposed of and the part retained as if they were separate interests.

Changing calculation method EI 50 Limits on change of method No change unless allowed (1)Once a person uses a particular calculation method to calculate FIF income or loss for an attributing interest in a FIF for a particular period, they must use the same method for interests in the FIF for the next period unless they are allowed to change under subsections (2) to (7). Change on practical grounds (2)The person may change if it is not practical to continue with the same method because— (a)in the case of the accounting profits method, section EI 40 (2) prevents its continued use or it is impossible to obtain enough information to continue to use it: (b)in the case of the branch equivalent method, it is impossible to obtain enough information to continue to use it: (c)in the case of the comparative value method, it is impossible to find out the end-of-year market value of the interest: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 674 EI – CFC and FIF rules (d)in the case of the deemed rate of return method, if the person was entitled to use that method only by falling under the $250,000 threshold in section EI 40 (4)(b), the threshold is exceeded: (e)in the case of the deemed rate of return method, if it was the default method under section EI 41, it ceases to be the default method. Choosing to change (3)The person may also change by notice to the Commissioner if— (a)the notice complies with subsection (4); and (b)either— (i)the person is a natural person and the $250,000 threshold in subsection (5) is not exceeded; or (ii)the change is to, or from, the branch equivalent method and within the rules in subsections (6) and (7). Notice of election (4)The notice of an election to change under subsection (3) must— (a)give the reasons for the change; and (b)comply with the Commissioner’s notice requirements; and (c)be given before the end of the first income year or accounting period for which the change is to take effect, unless the Commissioner agrees to a retrospective notice; and (d)in the case of a natural person relying on the $250,000 threshold test in subsection (3)(b)(i), be given before the end of the year or period that is before the one from the end of which the change takes effect. Natural person: $250,000 threshold (5)A natural person may make an election under subsection (3) if the total market value of their attributing interests in FIFs is not more than $250,000 at the end of the income year or accounting period before the year or period from the end of which the change takes effect. Changes to or from branch equivalent method (6)A person may make an election under subsection (3) to change— (a)to the branch equivalent method if— (i)this is the first time they have chosen to change to the branch equivalent method for an attributing interest in the FIF; or (ii)subsection (7) allows them to make another election: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 675 (b)from the branch equivalent method if— (i)they are changing back to a calculation method that they used for attributing interests in the fund before they used the branch equivalent method; and (ii)this is the first time they have chosen to change from the branch equivalent method, unless subsection (7) allows them to make another election. Repeated change to or from branch equivalent method (7)A person may change more than once to, or from, the branch equivalent method if— (a)there has been a change in circumstances (such as a significant change in shareholding) that significantly changes their ability to obtain enough information to use the branch equivalent method; and (b)altering their income tax liability is not the principal purpose or effect of the change.

EI 51 Consequences of changes in method Changes between cost-based methods and look-through methods (1)Subsection (2) applies if a person holding an attributing interest in a FIF changes the calculation method for calculating FIF income or loss from the interest— (a)from either of the cost-based calculation methods (the comparative value method and the deemed rate of return method) to either of the look-through calculation methods (the accounting profits method and the branch equivalent method); or (b)from either of the look-through methods to either of the cost- based methods. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 676 EI – CFC and FIF rules Treatment as sale for market value (2)The person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the interest to an unrelated person immediately before the start of the first accounting period to which the new method applies; and (b)reacquired it immediately after the start of the period; and (c)received for the disposal and paid for the reacquisition an amount equal to the interest’s market value at the time. Change from comparative value method to deemed rate of return method (3)If a person holding an attributing interest in a FIF changes from the comparative value method to the deemed rate of return method for calculating FIF income or loss from the interest, the person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the interest to an unrelated person immediately before the start of the first income year to which the new method applies; and (b)reacquired it immediately after the start of the year; and (c)received for the disposal and paid for the reacquisition an amount equal to the interest’s market value at the time. Change from deemed rate of return method to comparative value method (4)If a person holding an attributing interest in a FIF changes from the deemed rate of return method to the comparative value method for calculating FIF income or loss from the interest, the person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the interest to an unrelated person immediately before the start of the first income year to which the new method applies; and (b)reacquired it immediately after the start of the year; and (c)received for the disposal and paid for the reacquisition an amount equal to the interest’s closing book value (calculated under section EI 45 (7)) at the end of the previous income year.

Treatment as sale at market value (2)The person is treated as— (a)having sold the interest immediately before the change of residence for an amount equal to its market value at the time; and (b)not holding the interest when not resident in New Zealand (unless they become resident again and subsections (3) and (4) apply). Person coming to New Zealand (3)Subsection (4) applies if a person— (a)becomes a resident of New Zealand; and (b)holds an attributing interest in a FIF at the time; and (c)for the period after the change of residence, uses the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from the interest. Treatment as purchase at market value (4)The person is treated as— (a)having bought the interest immediately after the change of residence for an amount equal to its market value at the time; and (b)not holding it when not resident in New Zealand (unless they had previously ceased being resident and subsections (1) and (2) applied).

Comment:In draft subsection (3) (current section CG 23 (2)), there is a circularity problem – one cannot, in some cases, determine whether the $50,000 threshold is breached without applying the deemed sale rule. EI 53 Change in application of FIF exemptions Exemptions ceasing to apply (1)Subsections (2) and (3) apply if a person— (a)holds rights in one of the categories of rights described in section EI 30 (2) to (4); and (b)either— (i)the rights become an attributing interest in a FIF because one of the exemptions in sections EI 32 to EI 37 ceases to apply; or (ii)the person starts having FIF income or loss from the rights because they incur a cost on an attributing interest in a FIF and exceed the $50,000 threshold in section CQ 5 (1)(d) (When FIF income arises) and section DN 6 (1)(d) (When FIF loss arises). Market value for cost-based methods (2)If the person uses the comparative value method or deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from the rights for the period following the change, the person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the rights to an unrelated person immediately before the change; and (b)reacquired them immediately after the change; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 679 (c)received for the sale and paid for the repurchase an amount equal to their market value at the time. Pro-rating under look-through methods (3)If the change occurs during an accounting period of the FIF and the person uses the accounting profits method or the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from the rights for that period, the FIF income or loss is reduced by subtracting the amount calculated using the formula— days before change FIF income or lossx days in period. Definition of items in formula (4)In the formula,— (a)FIF income or loss is the FIF income or loss of the person from the rights for the period before allowing for the reduction: (b)days before change is the number of complete days in the period before the change occurs: (c)days in period is the number of days in the period. Exemptions starting to apply (5)Subsections (2) to (4) apply if a person— (a)holds an attributing interest in a FIF; and (b)either— (i)the interest ceases to be an attributing interest in a FIF because one of the exemptions in sections EI 32 to EI 35 starts to apply; or (ii)the person ceases having FIF income or loss from the interest because they dispose of an attributing interest in a FIF and fall below the $50,000 threshold in section CQ 5 (1)(d) (When FIF income arises) and section DN 6 (1)(d) (When FIF loss arises). Market value for cost-based methods (6)If the person uses the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from the interest for the period before the change, the person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the interest to an unrelated person immediately before the change; and (b)repurchased it immediately after the change; and (c)received for the sale and paid for the repurchase an amount equal to its market value at the time.

Defined terms:accounting period, accounting profits method, amount, attributing interest, comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, FIF, FIF income, loss, market value, person. Comment:In draft subsection (1)(b)(ii) (current section CG 23 (7)(b)), there is no reference to the threshold being breached just because the market value uplift applies. As with section EI 52, the existing reference may create circularity. EI 54 FIF migrating from New Zealand When this section applies (1)This section applies when a person holds rights that become an attributing interest in a FIF because an entity becomes a FIF. Cost-based methods using market value (2)If the person uses the comparative value method or deemed rate of return method to calculate the FIF income or loss from the interest for the period following the change, the person is treated as having— (a)disposed of the interest immediately before the change to an unrelated person; and (b)repurchased it immediately after the change; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 681 (c)received for the sale and paid for the repurchase an amount equal to the market value of the interest at the time of the change. Pro-rating under look-through methods (3)If the change occurs during an accounting period of the FIF and the person uses the accounting profits method or deemed rate of return method to calculate FIF income or loss from the rights for that period, section EI 25 does not apply and the FIF income or loss is reduced by subtracting the amount calculated using the formula— days before change FIF income or lossx days in period. Definition of items in formula (4)In the formula,— (a)FIF income or loss is the FIF income or loss of the person from the rights for the period before allowing for the reduction: (b)days before change is the number of complete days in the period before the change occurs: (c)days in period is the number of days in the period. Origin:(1) CG 23(7A). (2) CG 23(7B), (7C). (3) CG 23(7D). (4) CG 23(7D). Defined terms:accounting period, accounting profits method, amount, attributing interest, comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, FIF, FIF income, loss, New Zealand, person. Comment:Reference to the branch equivalent method does not appear in current section CG 23 (7D) but it seems appropriate to add it to draft subsection (3). Again, with regard to the $50,000 threshold, there may be circularity because an uplift under draft subsection (2) may be the cause of the threshold being breached. EI 55 Death of person holding FIF interest When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a person dies; and (b)they hold an attributing interest in a FIF at the time; and (c)the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method is used to calculate their FIF income or loss for the period before the death. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 682 EI – CFC and FIF rules Treatment as sale for market value (2)The person is treated as having sold the interest immediately before death for an amount equal to its market value at the time. Origin:(1) CG 23(4). (2) CG 23(4). Defined terms:attributing interest, comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, FIF, FIF income, loss, person. Measurement of cost EI 56 Measurement of cost When this section applies (1)This section applies when the cost of a person’s attributing interest in a FIF is being measured for the purposes of— (a)the natural person $50,000 exemption in section CQ 5 (1)(d) (When FIF income arises) and section DN 6 (1)(d) (When FIF loss arises); and (b)the comparative value method; and (c)the deemed rate of return method. FIFO cost flow identification (2)If it is not possible to specifically identify the cost of the interest, because of multiple acquisitions or dispositions or both by the person, the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method of identifying cost flows is applied. Share splits or similar (3)If the person acquires the interest as the result of a share split, non- taxable bonus issue, or similar event, and the acquisition is not income for the person, subsections (4) and (5) apply. Allocation of original cost (4)The cost of the interest is a fair allocation (based on market values at the time of the split) of the cost of the original property that is split. Allocation replacing original cost (5)For the income year in which the split occurs and later,— (a)the cost allocated to the interest is no longer the cost of the original property that was split; and (b)the person is treated as having incurred the allocated cost amount on acquiring the interest when the original property was acquired; and (c)the person is treated as not incurring any other cost on the interest merely because the original property ceases to exist. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EI – CFC and FIF rules 683 Non-monetary cost (6)If any cost is incurred in kind and not in money, the amount of the cost is equal to the market value of the cost incurred in kind, measured as at the time incurred. Exclusion of term life insurance element of premiums (7)If the interest is an entitlement to benefit under a life insurance policy, the cost of the interest excludes a premium incurred in a previous income year (or accounting period) to the extent to which the premium relates only to term life insurance for the previous period and does not increase the policy’s surrender value. Exclusion of holding costs (8)The cost of the interest does not include any expenditure under the financial arrangements rules or interest on money borrowed to acquire it, or other holding costs, incurred after its acquisition.

Defined terms:accounting period, attributing interest, amount, comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, FIF, financial arrangements rules, income, income year, life insurance, non-taxable bonus issue, person, premium, share. Comment:Current section CG 14 (1)(ca) is not rewritten on the basis that it seems to duplicate the rules for migration in current section CG 23, which involve a deemed sale and reacquisition at market in any event. Change of FIF’s balance date EI 57 Change of FIF’s balance date When this section applies (1)This section applies if a person— (a)has an attributing interest in a FIF; and (b)calculates their FIF income or loss from the FIF using the accounting profits method or the branch equivalent method; and (c)has calculated FIF income or loss from the FIF on the basis of one accounting year (the old accounting year); and (d)wants to change to use a different accounting year (the new accounting year) for the calculations. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 684 EI – CFC and FIF rules Commissioner’s consent (2)The person may make the change only if the Commissioner agrees. Commissioner’s reasons (3)The Commissioner may take into account any relevant factors when making the decision, including— (a)whether the change is sought because ownership of the FIF has changed: (b)whether the change is sought because of taxation or other legal requirements in a country where the FIF is resident or does business: (c)whether the change would postpone liability to income tax on FIF income. New accounting year if change approved (4)If the change is approved, the person may use the new accounting year. Limit on transitional deferral (5)If, in order to make the transition, the transitional accounting period is more than 12 months and ends in a later income year than the old accounting year ends in, and that would result in an amount of FIF income being derived in the later income year, subsection (6) applies and section CQ 5 (1)(f) (When FIF income arises) does not. Income pro-rated over whole period (6)For the transitional accounting period, the FIF income is divided by the number of days in the period and the resulting amount is FIF income of the person derived on each day in the period.
