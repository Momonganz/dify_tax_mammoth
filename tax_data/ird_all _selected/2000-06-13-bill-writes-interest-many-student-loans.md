Bill writes off interest on many student loans
==============================================

The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill, introduced today, writes off interest for full-time, full-year students and low-income, part-time students. It also introduces a new base interest write-off that will reduce the loan balances of many other students and former students. See the Minister's media statement:

### Government legislates to abolish interest on student loans for current students, reduce interest for former students

Legislation introduced today scraps interest on student loans for full-time, full-year students and for low-income, part-time students while they are studying.

Also potential winners are many former students paying off loans. They may see their loan balance reduced by hundreds of dollars a year.

The changes, which were announced late last year, will be backdated to 1 January 2000 for loans taken out after that date, and to 1 April 2000 for earlier loans.

"This will make a real difference to thousands of students and former students," said Revenue Minister Michael Cullen.

"Although most students earn little or no income while they are studying, until now the interest on their loan has compounded each year. By the time they completed their studies the interest could have represented a significant part of the debt. After a four-year course, for example, the interest component could have been as much as one-fifth of the total debt."

"Many former students will also be better off as a result of the new base interest write-off, which will help them to pay off their loans more quickly. For example, someone who earns $25,000 and has a $15,000 loan to pay off will save about $400 this year," Dr Cullen said.

The changes to interest charged on student loans are:

*   Current full-time, full-year students, irrespective of income, will have their interest fully written off.
*   Current students whose courses are not full-time and full-year and whose income is $24,596 or less will also have their interest fully written off.
*   For former students and current students who do not meet the criteria above, 50 percent of their compulsory repayment obligation will be credited to the base interest charged on their loan, with any excess written off. The other 50 percent will be credited to the CPI component of the interest charge and to the principal, thus accelerating repayment of the principal.

The loan statements issued by the Department of Work and Income and the Inland Revenue Department will continue to show accrued interest on all loans. The interest of eligible borrowers will be written off after the end of each income year.

#### Do you qualify for an interest write-off or reduction? (NZ resident borrowers only)

Non-resident borrowers engaged in full-time study overseas may be entitled to a base interest write-off on hardship grounds. Refer to section 55 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992.

### Attachment 2: How much will the new base interest write-off save you in the 2000/01 income year?

| $15,000 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 | $12 |

| $35,000 |     |     |     | $208 | $513 | $818 | $1,012 | $1,012 | $1,012 |
| $40,000 |     |     |     |     | $263 | $568 | $1,178 | $1,262 | $1,262 |
| $45,000 |     |     |     |     | $13 | $318 | $928 | $1,512 | $1,512 |
| $50,000 |     |     |     |     |     | $68 | $678 | $1,288 | $1,762 |
| $60,000 |     |     | NO CHANGE |     |     |     | $178 | $788 | $1,398 |
| $70,000 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | $288 | $898 |
| $80,000 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | $398 |
| $90,000 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

NB: The above figures are the maximum savings for borrowers who do not qualify for a full interest write-off. The savings arise because, from the 2000/01 income year, only 50 percent of the repayment obligation will be credited to the base interest charged and any excess will be written off. The other 50 percent will be credited first to the interest adjustment interest (this is equivalent to CPI and until now has been capitalised as at 31 March each year) charged for the year and second to the loan principal. This means that your loan balance will reduce faster.

The savings vary according to the size of the loan balance (which determines the amount of base interest charged) and the borrower's income (which determines the amount of the repayment obligation). The maximum amount saved is 50 percent of the compulsory repayment obligation. For simplicity, the above figures assume that no payments were made during the year. Because the maximum amount that can be saved is 50 percent of the repayment obligation, payments (which would reduce the interest charge) may not reduce the above savings.

The savings for any particular borrower can only be determined on the basis of his or her income and loan balance.
