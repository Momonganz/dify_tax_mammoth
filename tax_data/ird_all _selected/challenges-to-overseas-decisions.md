 for enforcement under the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the [2007 Child Support convention](/api/glossary/item?id={389FC8B1-8B62-4A99-9627-DCF293805298})
) you can challenge this decision.

Your challenge must be in writing.

If you live in New Zealand, we must receive your challenge within 30 days from the date of the notification of registration or refusal.

Challenge grounds

You can only challenge our decision to accept or decline an application for recognition and enforcement of an overseas maintenance obligation on the grounds listed in the 2007 Child Support Convention. The Convention refers to the decisions as either making a declaration or a registration for enforcement (accept) or a refusal to do this (decline).

The grounds available depend on the type of overseas maintenance decision.
