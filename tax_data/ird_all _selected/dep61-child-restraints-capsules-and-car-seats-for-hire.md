Child restraints (capsules and car seats) for hire
==================================================

Determination DEP61 (2007) sets a depreciation rate for child restraints (capsules and car seats) for hire/rental.

In _Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 19, No. 4_ (May 2007) on page 4, we advised that a draft general depreciation determination proposing the setting of a general depreciation rate for "Rental car seats" was available for comment. The one submission we received on the draft agreed with the rates we proposed.

The Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as "Determination DEP61: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination General Determination No. 61". The determination inserts a new asset class "Child restraints (capsules and car seats) for hire" into the "Transportation" asset category. It is based on an estimated useful life (EUL) for the assets of 5 years.
