The average amount withdrawn column represents the average amount that each KiwiSaver member has withdrawn during each financial year. 24OIA2144 Page 2 of 5 Please note these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data. Column Count of members includes members who made one or more withdrawals. Financial Year Count of members Amount withdrawn Average amount withdrawn 2019 81,361 $1,582,669,336 $19,452 2020 89,004 $1,992,304,929 $22,384 2021 81,290 $1,953,858,153 $24,036 2022 56,186 $1,448,679,592 $25,784 2023 54,618 $1,274,996,679 $23,344 2024 61,597 $1,516,738,686 $24,624 Questions 2 and 5bii The table below shows the amount withdrawn in the Ashburton District from KiwiSaver funds from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data, and the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. Financial Year Count of members Amount withdrawn Average amount withdrawn 2019 610 $11,699,511 $19,180 2020 606 $13,034,558 $21,509 2021 614 $15,022,478 $24,467 2022 394 $9,937,303 $25,222 2023 369 $8,364,923 $22,669 2024 407 $9,983,316 $24,529 Question 3b The table below shows the top reasons given when making a request for withdrawal and the number of applications Inland Revenue has processed and approved, including the number of approved applications received from KiwiSaver providers from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data. As noted above, the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. 24OIA2144 Page 3 of 5 Reason for withdrawal Year withdrawal made 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Court ordered 198 175 273 446 260 364 First home 40,161 41,366 54,492 38,724 30,143 29,898 Permanent emigration 2,027 2,231 1,761 1,107 1,654 2,295 Serious illness 2,023 1,972 1,519 1,320 1,472 1,396 Significant financial hardship 16,728 18,217 19,936 14,469 20,601 26,603 Other 27,115 31,613 8,952 198 588 1,131 KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data; however, providers will occasionally send Inland Revenue retirement withdrawal data under the “Other” category. A change to the way data was provided in April 2020 significantly reduced the receipt of data in the “Other” category. This category may contain retirement withdrawals; however, as this information is not required and is provided ad-hoc, it is not reliable when determining the number of retirement withdrawals. Inland Revenue is not provided further data to determine what KiwiSaver providers may categorise as “Other” and is thus unable to provide any additional information or explanation regarding that category. Question 4 The tables below show the age of the KiwiSaver members making a withdrawal request and the amount withdrawn from the 2019 financial year to 2 May 2024. The age of the members is recorded as at 30 June 2023. As noted above, these figures do not cover all types of withdrawals as KiwiSaver providers are not obliged to provide Inland Revenue with retirement withdrawal data, also the data below may include data on members who made a withdrawal under more than one category within the same period. The 65+ category includes data for customers for which Inland Revenue holds no age data. Count of members Age Group 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 0 - 17 589 630 27 19 11 11 18 - 24 7,215 7,567 6,138 4,326 3,717 3,935 25 - 34 30,932 33,018 36,402 25,835 21,374 23,109 35 - 44 17,338 18,595 18,542 13,794 14,922 17,478 45 - 54 11,681 12,534 10,921 7,600 8,754 10,327 55 - 64 7,222 7,831 6,032 4,438 5,653 6,505 Age 65+ 6,384 8,829 3,228 174 187 232 24OIA2144 Page 4 of 5 Amount withdrawn Age Group 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 0 - 17 $1,201,813 $1,471,978 $34,051 $40,837 $39,572 $57,271 18 - 24 $68,715,167 $75,112,446 $88,586,434 $67,003,331 $55,273,056 $60,841,535 25 - 34 $595,272,170 $680,371,213 $903,833,785 $685,008,530 $512,302,757 $582,075,993 35 - 44 $371,580,902 $437,797,551 $493,301,147 $382,650,718 $365,715,493 $449,971,384 45 - 54 $253,886,644 $305,264,895 $273,308,669 $209,214,783 $213,961,938 $266,967,336 55 - 64 $148,368,543 $187,571,706 $129,290,739 $101,770,711 $123,707,048 $151,394,057 Age 65+ $143,644,097 $304,715,140 $65,503,327 $2,990,683 $3,996,815 $5,431,109 Inland Revenue does not hold data on the relationship, parental or home ownership status of KiwiSaver members making a withdrawal request, thus these parts of question four of your request are refused under section 18(g) of the OIA as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not have grounds to believe this information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another department. Questions 5a, 5c and 6 When a KiwiSaver member applies to withdraw funds, these applications are received and processed by their KiwiSaver provider, except for applications from members under significant financial hardship or serious illness who are also within the initial two month holding period. (This period provides time for new members who have been automatically enrolled by their employers to decide to opt out or remain enrolled). As such Inland Revenue does not hold data on the number of withdrawals requests made, the number of applications denied or the top five reasons for denials, thus these parts of your request are refused under section 18(g) of the OIA as the information requested is not held by Inland Revenue and I do not have grounds to believe this information is held by or more closely connected with the functions of another department. Question 7 Inland Revenue has an administrative role in KiwiSaver, and primarily facilitates the timely transfer of KiwiSaver contributions from members to scheme providers. You may wish to reach out to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment which has policy responsibility for the withdrawal settings under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, For an independent view on KiwiSaver, you may be interested in reading the three yearly review of retirement income policy produced by the Retirement Commission, which is available on its website (retirement.govt.nz). 24OIA2144 Page 5 of 5 Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: commissionerscorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.
