1\. This report asks you to refer the attached Cabinet paper to Cabinet Office so that it may be considered either by:

*   The Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee (EGI) at its meeting on 12 April 2017; or

3\. If Cabinet agrees to these recommendations, the Budget 2017 revenue forecasts will be adjusted by $100 million per year from 2019/20 (with $50 million forecast in the preceding year).
