[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Income tax rates are the percentages of tax that you must pay.

The rates are based on your total income for the tax year. Your income could include:

*   salary or wages
*   a Work and Income benefit
*   schedular payments
*   interest from a bank account or investment
*   earnings from self-employment
*   money from renting out property
*   overseas income.

Some income is taxed before you get paid. This includes salaries, wages, Work and Income benefits, schedular payments and interest. The amount of tax your employer or payer deducts depends on the tax code and income information you gave them.

You might get a refund or have tax to pay at the end of the tax year if you've been taxed at the wrong rate during the year. It's important to use the correct tax code.

Other income is not taxed before you get paid. This includes income from self-employment or renting out property, and some overseas income. You pay tax on this income at the end of the tax year. The amount of tax you pay depends on your total income for the tax year.

Secondary tax rates
-------------------

If you have more than one source of income, you pay secondary tax. This helps you pay the right amount of tax so you do not get a bill at the end of the year.

The amount of secondary tax you pay depends on the secondary tax code you give your employer or payer.
