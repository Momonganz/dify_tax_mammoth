1 Classified In Confidence: Inland Revenue Highly Protected Business Transformation Programme Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Executive Summary Version 1.00 IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Blueprint Context Co-existence •The Technology and Enterprise Integration section of the Blueprint contains the high-level design of the Application Architecture, Integration Architecture, Technical Architecture and Security Architecture associated with the Business Transformation Programme. •This blueprint is one chapter in the overall Business Transformation high level design blueprint. •The blueprint outlines the technology components required to support the direction in the business blueprints. •The Analytics, Data Warehouse, Reporting and Enterprise Content Management logical architecture will be addressed in the design phase. •Key Design Decisions that inform the blueprint content will be revisited in detailed design to assess cost benefit and impact of the chosen core tax system. •The Technology Change and Operations blueprint will outline the process, governance and organisational elements of Technology. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Approach to Content Development The Technology and Enterprise Integration blueprint content will be developed by capability domains, each capability domain will be documented as a section in the blueprint. The diagram below illustrates the approach to developing the Technology & Enterprise Integration Technology Blueprint. For each capability domain a reference architecture assessment will be performed to identify the future state technology capability, this will take input from current IR reference models and \[Information redacted\] Reference Architectures for each capability domain. The capability domain assessments and directions then form the content for the Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint. In addition, the development of this Blueprint is aligned with the following principles: •The existing IR Reference Architectures are not to be replaced by this Blueprint. It is, however, possible that the outcome of the Blueprint will trigger updates to those architectures, adjusting them to Programme’s needs. Any changes to approved reference architectures will be called out as separate decisions and will be submitted to the Technical Architecture Design Council (TADC) for approval •The recommendations contained in this Blueprint are aligned with the IR Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Principles •Future state recommendations have looked to adopt “as a Service” solutions and the utilisation of the available “All of Government (AoG)” services where appropriate. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 4 Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Technology & Enterprise Integration Blueprint Blueprint Outline IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 6 Data Architecture Domain Summary The purpose of data architecture is to provide coverage of known data, both structure and unstructured. This allows IR to effectively support their business intelligence and analytics initiatives. Key Design Decisions Data Lifecycle Management •IR will identify and implement a dedicated end to end data migration toolset to support the BT data migration. •IR will implement multiple archiving solutions based on requirements Master, Reference & Meta Management •IR will leverage existing COTS solution (eg, Core Tax, ESS) as the platform for Master Data Management. •Metadata management will be incorporated at the COTS solutions level (eg, Core Tax, ESS), as required. Data Quality Management •Data Quality will be incorporated in the Data Migration toolset to support the BT programme. •This data quality toolset will be expanded to be used to support on-going Data Quality as part of the broader Enterprise Approach to Data Governance. Big Data Management •IR will approach Big Data cautiously, and will implement solutions where real business benefits can be shown. •IR’s technology approach to Big Data is to utilise open source product solutions. •Among the possible deployment scenarios, IR will examine leveraging Public Cloud infrastructure to support its Big Data Platform where data sovereignty, and privacy concerns can be addressed. KDD#114 – Data Lifecycle Management •IR will implement a hybrid archiving approach. This will utilise the most appropriate archiving solution on a case by case basis, e.g. a single solution will not implemented to satisfy all archiving needs. KDD #218 – Big Data Platform •Where business value has been proven, IR will approach Big Data based on Open Source products. •This allows a cost effective, and low risk approach to examine the value of any Big Data initiative. BT KDD #219 - Master Data Management Platform •IR will leverage existing COTS solutions (eg, Core Tax, ESS) as the platform for Master Data Management •A separate stand alone Enterprise-wide Master Data Management solution will not be implemented Future Characteristics IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 7 Integration Architecture Domain Summary Enterprise Integration is the technology function that connects applications and enables requests for actions to be carried out and data to be transferred between them. Completed Key Decision Paper #9 - BT Internal Integration Platform •The Foundation sub-Programme includes an upgrade of the current JCAPS integration platform to \[Information redacted\] to deliver a transitional EAI integration capability. •This KDD recommends the use of \[Information redacted\] and the foundation integration layer as the technology platform to implement the end state internal integration layer (ESB) Key Design Decisions Future Characteristics External Integration •IR will implement a best of breed Business to Business (B2B) Gateway and leverage it for all the new B2B interactions. •IR will implement a best of breed API Gateway to deliver API capability to support future digital services. •IR will implement a Data Cache capability (May be part of the capability of B2B or API solution). Internal Integration •Leverage \[Information redacted\] as the platform to deliver the future state Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for internal integration Business Process & Rules Management •\[Information redacted\] will continue to be the centralised reference solution of business rules until Stage 1 of BT. •This platform decision will be evaluated during Detailed Design in line with the COTS vendor. Data Integration •A single toolset will be selected and implemented to support end to end data migration activities to support the BT Programme. This includes profiling, cleansing, enrichment and conversion. •This toolset will be used for on going capability requirements around bulk data migration and integration. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 8 Execution Architecture Domain Summary The Execution Architecture lists the capabilities that underpin business applications at run-time. Key Design Decisions Common Services •The NSP will leverage existing Voice, Email, SMS, Print (including bulk printing) and Integration services where these are fit for purpose and align with the core COTS solution. Mobility •A Mobile Device Management platform will be implemented to securely manage ALL mobile devices used to access services on the IR network. •Both IR and non-IR staff will be able to access mobility resources from devices across a range of platforms. Enterprise Content Management •IR will implement an Enterprise Content Management solution. •IR will implement a Social Media Management solution that can be used to interact with customers using a range of social media channels Presentation & Execution Partitioning •The core COTS solution will be implemented with High Availability in the Production data centre, with data replication to support secondary site recovery. •IR’s web presence will be largely based on the capabilities of the COTS solution, with a potential need for additional capability in the Web content space. There were no specific Key Design decisions in this area during High Level Design. Completed Future Characteristics IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 9 Operations Architecture Domain Summary Operations architecture describes the services, tools, standards and control structures required to keep the application production or development environment running at a desired service level. Key Design Decisions IT Organisation, Asset & Service Management •Inland Revenue will implement a robust asset & configuration management capability. •Inland Revenue will expand on existing ITIL based Service Management capabilities. •A range of these capabilities around Service Management will be discussed within the Technology Change & Operations Blueprint document. IT Operations Management •IR will implement a monitoring event aggregating solution, delivering a centralised monitoring dashboard. •IR will use the automation & scheduling capability within core COTS solutions. •A consistent backup and restore strategy will be implemented based on the criticality and volatility of the information to be backed up. This will include regular test cycles. Design Decision #137 - Monitoring & Reporting •Individual domains (eg Network, Storage etc.) will utilise specialist tools. A consolidated monitoring ‘dashboard’ will be implemented to consolidate monitoring and events from all these sources. Inland Revenue will NOT setup up a single integrated solution for all monitoring capabilities.
