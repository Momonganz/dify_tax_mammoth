Depreciation Rate for skin therapy machines used for beauty treatments
======================================================================

This determination inserts a new asset class for skin therapy machines into the "Medical and Medical Laboratory" and "Shops" industry categories, that applies for the 2017-18 and subsequent income years.

#### Note to Determination DEP103

The Commissioner has recently been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for skin therapy machines used for beauty treatments. The beauty treatments include hair removal, reducing winkles, freckles, vascular lesions and pigmentation problems.

The asset uses intense light pulse (“IPL”) treatment supplemented by a Radio Frequency (“RF”) emitting mode, which radiates the follicles or skin cells with a shortwave or microwave radio frequency. In the RF mode, it is effectively operating as a diathermy machine (Diathermy is deep treatment of tissue by heat applied through RF or microwaves). The machine may include a handpiece which emits the light and/or RF that is waved over the skin and has a sapphire plate that touches the skin which is refrigerated by means of a circulating coolant to prevent overheating and burning.
