Individual offshore person in New Zealand

If you're an individual offshore person in New Zealand at the time of applying you'll generally still need to provide an active New Zealand bank account or letter from an approved entity stating that they have completed customer due diligence.

If you cannot provide proof of your active New Zealand bank account you can take the IR742 and supporting documents to an Inland Revenue office to verify. This means that you are not required to have an active New Zealand bank account to get an IRD number.
