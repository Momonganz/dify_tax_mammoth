A newly acquired company can join an existing group from the day it becomes eligible to be a member. All other elections will apply from the beginning of the following income year.

If the company is no longer eligible or entitled to membership, unless a later date is requested, membership will cease from the beginning of the income year in which it became ineligible or no longer entitled. The company may use the date that it is no longer to be treated as part of the imputation group however the company must notify us within 30 days after the date on which eligibility or entitlement to part of the group ended. We may agree to extend the 30 day period if it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so. If a company leaves the group in the same year that it joined the company is treated as leaving on the same day it joined. If there is no nominated company for the group this will mean membership of all companies ceases at the beginning of the income year. Liquidation will mean membership of the group ceases during the income year, on the day of liquidation, and not the beginning of the income year. Change in nominated company It is the exiting nominated company's responsibility to advise us if there is to be an alternative nominated company for the imputation group. The change of a nominated company will apply from 30 days after the date we receive the notice, unless a later date is specified on the notice.
