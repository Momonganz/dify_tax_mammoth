This report seeks your agreement to raise the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 6.71% to 7.89%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the quarter beginning 1 April 2023. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 4.78% to 6.71%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 January 2023. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 7.89% for December 2022 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 6.7 1% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer In Confidence IR2023/004: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 16 Fe bruary 2023, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 23 February 2023. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 16 February 2023. Revenue implications 12. Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 7.89% will increase the amount of net tax revenue that will be collected over the remainder of the 2022/23 fiscal year by approximately $0.56 million. The full year impact is estimated to be an increase in tax revenue of $2.23 million per year for subsequent years. $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 0.780 3.100 3.100 3.100 3.100 Company tax (0.220) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) (0.870) Net revenue 0.560 2.230 2.230 2.230 2.230 Impact on operating balance (0.560) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) (2.230) 13.

The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and the attached Cabinet paper. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2023 Proposal 1This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2023 to the Executive Council. The proposal is to increase the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment- related loans from 6.71% to 7.89%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. 2Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment- related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 January 2023, is 6.71%. 5The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 1 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 DOC  \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 7In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 April 2023 – the beginning of the next quarter. No waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance 8The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of WaitangiNot applicable 8.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990Not applicable 8.3 the Human Rights Act 1993Not applicable 8.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 8.5 relevant international standards and obligationsNot applicable 8.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Complies Regulations Review Committee 9Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 10 The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. 2 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 11 The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. 12 The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. Publicity 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 14 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 15 The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications 16 Raising the prescribed interest rate to 7.89% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.56 million over the 2022/23 year and $2.23 million per year over the remaining forecast period. 3 2qddsziq5 2023-03-07 13:15:43 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1note that the regulations set the prescribed rate of interest for calculating the taxable benefit of low-interest, employment-related loans; 2agree that, consistent with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey for December 2022, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be raised from 6.71% to 7.89% from the quarter commencing on 1 April 2023; 3note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendation b, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/232023/242024/252025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 0.7803.1003.1003.1003.100 Company tax (0.220)(0.870)(0.870)(0.870)(0.870) Net revenue0.5602.2302.2302.2302.230 Impact on operating balance (0.560)(2.230)(2.230)(2.230)(2.230) 4note that the changes are forecast changes and do not have appropriation implications; 5authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2023.
