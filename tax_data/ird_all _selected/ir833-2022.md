Notes to complete the IR833 Bright-line property rule for residential property Residential property includes land: • with a house on it • that the owner has an arrangement to build a house on, or • that the owner would be able to build a house on under the district plan rules. Under the bright-line property rule, regardless of your intentions when you acquired it, a sale of residential property may be taxable if you acquired it on or after: • 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 2 years • 29 March 2018 through to 26 March 2021 inclusive, and sold/disposed of it within 5 years. This includes property acquired as a result of an offer made to purchase property on or before 23 March 2021, and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021, or • 27 March 2021 and sold/disposed of it within 10 years or 5 years to the extent the property has a new build on it. To qualify as a new build, it must be acquired no later than 12 months after the code compliance certificate (CCC) was issued. For further information for what qualifies as a new build refer to part 2 of the Bright-line property tax guide – IR1227. If one of these bright-line periods applies to your property transaction, and none of the exclusions apply, then you will have to pay tax on any profit you've made on the sale or disposal of the property. Exclusions For individuals and trusts (in limited circumstances), there are specific exclusions to the bright-line property rule. These are: Inherited property - a sale or other disposal of a residential property that was transferred to an executor or administrator of a deceased estate or to an individual beneficiary. Relationship property settlements - the transfer of property to someone under a relationship settlement agreement. Main home - If you are selling a property you need to determine if it's your main home. You can only have 1 main home. It is the property you have the greatest connection to. Main home held in a trust - a sale/disposal by a trustee where the property was the main home of a principal settlor of the trust (or a principal settlor does not have a main home) and it was the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. You can use the main home exclusion if the situations in the table below apply unless you have used it twice in the previous 2 years, or you or a group of persons have a regular pattern of buying and selling your main home. Main home exclusionThe situations that must apply Properties acquired before 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for more than 50% of the time you’ve owned it, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021You have used: • a property as your main home for 100% of the time you’ve owned it. This includes any continuous period of up to 12 months where it was not used as your main home, and • more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) as your main home. Note: A person who is constructing a building may qualify for the main home exclusion even if the construction takes longer than 12 months as long as the period of time is reasonable. Relevant dates for property sales subject to the bright-line property rule (Boxes 4 and 5) If you have ticked that the sale or disposal of the property is taxable under the bright-line property rule, use the dates in the table below. Type of purchase/acquisitionDate to use Purchase/acquisition of propertyDate of registration with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) Purchase/acquisition where no registration occurs prior to the sale/ disposal date The latest date you acquired an interest in the property, for example the date of contract.

If your property is subject to either the 5 year bright-line period for new builds or the 10 year bright-line period, and it was not your main home for the entire time you owned it but you used it as your main home on some days during the bright-line period, your net profit (loss) is reduced for the main home days. You will pay tax under the bright-line property rule only on the proportion of any gain in value that relates to the days in the bright-line period that it was not used as your main home – see the following notes for Boxes 6 to 8 to work out your reduced net profit (loss). Reduced sale price (Box 6) If the sale is taxable because the property was your main home for some of the time you owned it but it was also used for other purposes for a continuous period of more than 12 months, your property sale income is reduced based on how long the property was your main home. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the sale price. Show the result in Box 6. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home e.g. 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Sale price is the total price you sold the property for before deducting any expenses. Reduced purchase price (Box 7) If the sale price at Box 6 is reduced for days it was used as your main home, the purchase price must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by the purchase price. Show the result in Box 7. Main home days is the total number of days when more than 50% of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home. This includes days in a period of up to 12 months that it was not used as your main home, if the period was immediately before or after a period that the property was used as your main home. For days when 50% or less of the property's area (including your backyard, gardens and garage) was used as your main home, multiple the number of those days by the proportion of the property’s area that was your main home e.g. 250 days x 30% = 75 main home days. Days in the bright-line period is the total number of days in the bright-line period. The start and end dates of the bright-line period are the dates you put in Boxes 4 and 5. Purchase price is the price you purchased the property for. Reduced deductible expenses (Box 8) If the sale and purchase prices at Boxes 6 and 7 are reduced for the days it was used as your main home, the deductible expenses must also be reduced. Divide the number of main home days by the number of days in the bright-line period. Then multiply the result of that by total deductible expenses. Deduct this amount from the total deductible expenses and show the result at Box 8. For information about what you can and cannot claim, see the following note on deductible expenses. Deductible expenses (Box 8) Expenses incurred in acquiring the property (other than the purchase price) and the cost of any capital improvements you made can be included as deductible expenses in Box 8. Capital improvements are things like adding on a new room – they do not include repairs and maintenance. Do not include any deductions for other expenses here, for example if you have other deductible expenses (such as interest, rates and insurance) from renting the property out. Deductible expenses from renting the property out are included separately in your tax return. You may not claim a deduction for these types of expenses if you did not use the property to earn income (eg, rent). If you're not sure whether an expense is deductible, we recommend you refer to part 5 of the Bright-line property tax guide – IR1227 or seek advice from a tax agent. Bright-line loss If your total costs are more than the sale price of your property, you can only offset the loss against net income from another property sale. Any remaining loss can only be used in a future year when you have net income from another property sale. Provisional tax If your tax to pay on the taxable profit from your property sale is more than $5,000 tax at the end of the year from your last return ($2,500 before 2020 return), you may be required to pay provisional tax in the following tax year. If you're not likely to have the same amount of tax to pay, you could consider estimating your provisional tax for the following year. Because there are penalties for under- paying provisional tax, we recommend you get professional advice about doing this. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide.
