=============================================================================

An instalment arrangement is a formal debt repayment plan. It’s for debt you cannot pay in full by the due date, or overdue debt.

By keeping to the agreed repayment plan you may stop us taking further collection action. You can set up an instalment arrangement to repay your debt in set amounts weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. 

If you’re paying with internet banking you do not need to set up a direct debit agreement. You still need to request an instalment arrangement for any debt you cannot pay in full before the due date.

Any overdue debt balances may cause use of money interest (UOMI) and penalties. You can find more information about penalties and interest on our website.

Before you start
----------------

You'll need to know:

*   how much you can afford to pay towards your debt
*   whether you'll pay by direct debit or another method
*   when you want your instalment payments to start.

Apply for an instalment arrangement in myIR
-------------------------------------------

From the homepage in myIR, apply to pay using instalments by selecting:

*   'Request an instalment arrangement' under the 'I want to ...' column.

Read about the service and payment methods.

Select if you can or cannot pay the minimum amount
--------------------------------------------------

You'll be able to see the total amount owing and a list of the due amounts for each tax type.

Select whether you can or cannot pay the weekly amount shown under 'Minimum payment amount'. You'll be able to pay fortnightly or monthly if you choose, but make sure those amounts work out to match this figure on a weekly basis.

*   If you cannot afford the minimum repayment, we'll ask you to confirm your contact details and we'll give you a call to talk about your options.
*   If you're able to pay the minimum amount, carry on with the application.

Choose a payment method
-----------------------

Select how you'll pay instalments:

*   direct debit
*   credit or debit card
*   internet banking
*   future Working for Families payments - select 'WfFTC Entitlements'.

Enter your details that match the payment method you're using.

Set and view your instalment schedule
-------------------------------------

For your instalment details, choose:

*   a frequency, that is, how often you want to make the payments
*   an amount, such as the minimum payment or a higher amount
*   the first instalment date. The dates you can choose will depend on how you're making your payments, for example direct debit or manually.

Once you’re finished, click 'Calculate' and you’ll see your instalment plan.

Review and submit your application
----------------------------------

Make sure all your payment and plan details are right. If so, click 'Submit'.
