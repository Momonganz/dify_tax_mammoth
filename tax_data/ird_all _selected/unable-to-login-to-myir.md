I've forgotten my user ID

*   Go to the myIR login page
*   Click on 'Forgot user ID or password'
*   Click on 'Forgot username?'
*   Enter your IRD number and verify your email address.

IRD numbers have 9 digits so if your number has 8 digits, add a 0 before entering your IRD number.

I've forgotten my password

You will need your myIR logon username and the email address that's registered with your myIR logon to reset your password. You can reset your password by choosing 'Forgot user ID or password?' on the myIR login page.

For a strong password, we recommend combining four words. Uncommon words are better. Avoid commonly used password terms and passwords used on other websites.

Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and not more than 255 characters long.

Passwords cannot include:

*   more than 2 of the same numbers in a row
*   more than 3 of the same letters in a row
*   common sequential keyboard combinations
*   commonly used password terms
*   your user ID.

Examples of sequences and words that cannot be included: qwerty, zxcv, bbbb, 12345, 112233, 007, 1995, 2002, P@ssword, letmein, secret, changeme, remember, openup.

You cannot reuse your last 10 passwords.

My password does not work

If you have typed the correct password, try clearing your computer cache and cookies, then close your browser and try again. This should clear any previous passwords still being used by the browser to log in. See below.

Otherwise, you should reset your password.

### If you're using Google Chrome

in Chrome, click the ⋮ (vertical ellipses) in the top right corner of the screen

1.  choose More tools
2.  choose Clear browsing data...
3.  choose the desired time range in the drop-down menu. To delete everything, select All time
4.  make sure the box next to Cookies and other site data and Cached images and files are ticked, then click Clear data.

### If you're using Internet Explorer

1.  in Internet Explorer, click the gear icon on the top right corner
2.  choose Internet options from the drop-down menu
3.  under Browsing history click Delete
4.  make sure the box next to Cookies and website data are ticked, then click Ok

If clearing your computer cookies is not the issue.

*   If you've been copying and pasting your password - try typing it in.
*   Enter it in the correct case as your password is case-sensitive
*   Make sure you do not have an extra space character at the end of your user ID - your smartphone may have added one in.

I requested a password reset but I do not have a reset email yet

It can take up to 10 minutes to deliver the email. Be sure to check your junk folder as well.

I received a blank screen when I tried to log in

If you're trying to log in and do not receive an error message after you entered your user ID and password, close your browser and log in again. If this does not work, try clearing your browser history.

Bookmarking pages

My RealMe login does not work
