Standout yearling threshold announced
=====================================

**24 January 2020**

Inland Revenue has released the price yearlings must be sold for at this year’s Karaka Yearling sales so they can be considered as ‘standouts’ and possibly eligible for tax deductions.

In 2018 the Government announced its policy that allows new investors, who purchase standout yearlings with the intention to breed them for profit, to be able to claim tax deductions as if they had an existing bloodstock breeding business.

Investors will also be taxable if the standout yearling is subsequently sold for a profit.

To qualify for tax deductions the standout yearling must be purchased at Karaka 2020 from Book 1 and cost more than $430,000 for fillies and $368,000 for colts.

To be eligible, investors have to provide Inland Revenue with evidence within 4 months of buying the yearling that they intent to derive a profit from breeding the high-priced filly or colt.

A yearling intended for breeding and purchased through a syndicate, or subsequently syndicated after Karaka 2020, also qualifies the new investor to claim income tax deductions under the policy.
