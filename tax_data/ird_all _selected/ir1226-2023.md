Read part 4 of our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information. Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, Lot and DP number. Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you should use Worksheet B or Worksheet C. Use the decision tree on page 1 to work out which worksheet you should use. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: • total rents • other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) Step 3 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed. Step 7 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include excess deductions carried forward from a previous year in this step. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. Step 8 Excess residential rental deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 11 Total residential rental deductions Adding Step 7 and Step 9 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. 4 Step 12 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Calculate the net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions at Step 11 from rental income at Step 5. If the deductions for your residential portfolio or individual property are more than the income you earned from the residential portfolio or individual property, the result at Step 12 is a net loss. Record a net loss as a negative amount. Step 13 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and any individual properties at Step 12. Do not include any net losses from Step 12 in this calculation. This amount on this worksheet cannot be a negative amount (a loss) because there have been no taxable sales to release excess deductions. If you have no net income across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0 on your return. Step 14 Excess residential deductions carried forward for each portfolio and property When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to the next income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless it is sold. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss at Step 12, enter that amount here. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income at Step 12, enter 0 here. Step 15 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 16 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for portfolio and individual properties If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Only complete the relevant columns in Steps 16a and 16b. For each portfolio and individual property, EITHER 16a or 16b can be calculated, but not both. If the property has a nil/"0" result at step12, then leave both 16a and 16b blank. Step 17 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated at Step 16 for your residential portfolio and individual properties. 5 Worksheet B - Non-taxable sales, no net income from revenue account property When you should use Worksheet B Use this worksheet this year if: - You have sold an individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and the sale was not taxable. - You have sold the last property in a residential portfolio that the residential property deduction rules apply to this year and any of the sales were not taxable. - You did not earn net income this year from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Before you start, identify which properties you have in a portfolio and which properties are individual properties. You will also need information about rent received, expenses and any excess deductions left over from property sold in a previous income year. Complete only the columns you need for your situation. For example, if you only have one individual property or a residential portfolio, complete the first column only.

Residential rental deductions claimed this year Explanatory notes to help you complete Worksheet B Part 1 Residential income and deductions Note Use the following notes to help you complete this worksheet. Read Part 4 of our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information. Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, lot and DP number. Only complete the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) For more information about rental income, see our guide Rental income - IR264. Step 2 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed Step 4 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for all properties in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any amounts from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. 7 Step 5 Excess deductions bought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. Step 6 Total residential deductions Adding Step 4 and Step 5 together calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 7 Net residential income or loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties Subtracting Step 6 from Step 3 calculates the net profit or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Part 2 Transfers of unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential rental property Part 2 of this worksheet helps you: - Transfer any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property. - Transfer any unused deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio where 1 or more of the sales of all the properties in the residential portfolio (in any year) was not taxable. Step 8, Step 8a and Step 8b Recalculate net income or net loss for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have unused excess deductions if: - Step 7 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 7 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property that the residential property deduction rules apply to. If you have not sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, answer N/A. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, do that at Step 8a and Step 8b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, the excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 8a the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a residential portfolio or individual property in the column for that portfolio or property. Enter this as a positive amount. Next, enter in Step 8b the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If only one property in the portfolio has been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No at Step 8 and continue to Step 9. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 9 Recalculated net residential income after transferred amounts Recalculate the net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. The result for a property that was sold should now be 0. If no amount has been transferred to any residential portfolio or individual property, the result will be the same as the net amount from Step 7. Part 3 Totals for income tax return Part 3 of this worksheet helps you calculate the amounts that need to be entered on your income tax return for residential rental income. Step 15 Net residential income Add together only the net income from your residential portfolio and individual properties at Step 9. This amount cannot be a loss. Do not include any net losses from Step 9 in this calculation. If you have no net profits across your residential portfolio and any individual properties then enter 0. Step 16 Excess residential rental deductions carried forward for each residential portfolio and individual property When your deductions exceed rental income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the portfolio or property is sold. The amount calculated in this step is the excess deductions for the residential portfolio and each individual property taking into account any transfers of excess deductions after you sell a property. This amount must be carried forward as excess deductions. If any of the excess deductions are from a residential portfolio or individual properties that were sold in the current year, keep a track of these deductions and which property they relate to. This information will be needed in a later year when you sell the property. Step 17 Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward This step brings the results for each residential portfolio and individual property together. If you have no excess deductions to carry forward, enter 0 on your return. Step 18 Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each residential portfolio and individual property The amount of deductions for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year from the residential portfolio or individual property. If your income is higher than the amount of your deductible expenses, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. For each residential portfolio and individual property, take the total residential deductions at Step 6. Then add the amount of any excess deductions transferred to the property at Step 8b or subtract the amount of any excess deductions transferred from the property at Step 8a. Finally, subtract the amount of any excess deductions for the property at Step 16. Step 19 Residential rental deductions claimed this year Add together the residential rental deductions claimed this year calculated for each residential portfolio and individual property you own. 8 Worksheet C - Full worksheet Use this worksheet if: - You have sold an individual property this year and the sale was taxable. - You have sold the last property in a residential portfolio this year and the sale was taxable. - You have sold a property in a residential portfolio this year (which was not the last property in the portfolio) and the sale was taxable. - You have net income from a residential rental property that is held on revenue account.

Total excess residential rental deductions carried forward Explanatory notes to help you complete Worksheet C Part 1: Residential income and deductions Note Use the following notes to help you complete this worksheet. Read Part 4 of our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information Property references A property reference could be a street address, certificate of title, lot and DP number. Complete only the number of columns required for your situation. Residential portfolio and individual properties If you have more than 1 residential property and you are applying the rules to all your properties on a portfolio basis, do not fill out any individual property columns. You will need to combine the income and expenses of all of the properties in the portfolio in 1 column. If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Sale of a residential rental property If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio this year, you will need to use a column for the sold property or portfolio. Where the term "sale" is used in this worksheet, it is intended to cover all types of disposals. Step 1 Rental income Enter the total gross rental income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties you own that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following in this amount: - total rents - other income (such as insurance receipts or rates refunds) Step 2 Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) for a residential portfolio or individual properties Net bright-line income from the taxable sale of one or more residential rental properties in a residential portfolio is included in the residential income of that portfolio. Net bright-line income from the taxable sale of an individual property is included in the residential income of that property. Do not include any net bright-line losses. Instead keep your own record of all bright-line losses you have made. Do not include net income from residential rental properties that are not taxed under the bright-line property rule in this step. Step 3 Other residential income Enter the total other residential income you have earned in this income year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Include all of the following: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed Do not include net income from a residential rental property that is excluded from the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account at this step. Instead include the amount in Step 9. Residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account is property that: • you have notified us will be taxable on sale and you are able to separately identify the deductions relating to the land. • is taxable on sale because it's held in a business of developing, dealing in, subdividing or building residential property. You will find more information about the notification requirements for residential rental property on revenue account in Part 4 of the Rental income - IR264 guide. If you had a net loss from the taxable sale of a residential property, then enter zero for that property. Step 5 Rental expenses Enter the total amount of deductible expenses you have incurred this income year for a residential portfolio and individual properties you own. Enter the expenses as a positive amount. If you have a residential portfolio you will need to combine the total expenses amounts for each property in the portfolio. Do not include in this step: - any expenditure or loss from the sale of a residential rental property. - excess deductions carried forward from a previous year. For close companies making adjustments for loss of continuity or group company transfers of excess deductions you need to adjust this figure by the appropriate amount. 12 Step 6 Excess deductions brought forward for a residential portfolio and individual properties You will have calculated this amount in the previous year as an amount to carry forward for a residential portfolio or individual property. This amount will include any excess deductions transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in a previous year. This amount will also include any unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of residential property that arose in a previous income year and which were not allocated to another property in the year of the sale. You can also use this step to transfer any unused excess deductions brought forward from a previous income year that have not yet been transferred (because you did not have a property to transfer them to). Include the unused excess deductions to be transferred in the column of the residential portfolio or individual property that you want to transfer them to. You must transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across one or more properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 7 Total residential rental deductions Adding together rental expenses and excess deductions brought forward calculates the total amount of deductions for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Step 8 Net income for each portfolio and property Calculate net income or net loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties by subtracting the total residential rental deductions from rental property income. Step 9 Net income from revenue account property You can offset excess deductions from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from a residential property that is outside the residential property deduction rules because it will be taxed on sale (revenue account property). Revenue account property is a property that is part of a business in developing, dealing in, or building residential property that is not a business premises or it is property that you have notified us will be taxable on sale regardless of when it is sold. The exclusion from the residential property deduction rules is generally only available if certain requirements are met. Refer to Step 3. The income from revenue account property that is required to be entered at this row does not relate to your residential portfolios or individual properties entered in this worksheet. It relates to any other revenue account property, if you have any. Enter net income from taxable sales, net rental income, and any depreciation recovery income from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules because they are on revenue account. Do not include income from properties that are otherwise excluded, such as your main home or a holiday home taxed under the mixed asset rules. If you do not have revenue account property income, or if your revenue account property has made a loss, enter 0 here. Step 10 Allocate revenue account property income You can offset losses from a residential portfolio or individual property against net income from revenue account property (revenue account property income). You must allocate all net income from revenue account property to one or more of your residential portfolio or individual properties. It is your choice as to how you allocate the income. You do not need to allocate it equally across all your portfolio/properties. If you did not have any net income from revenue account property at Step 9, enter 0 here. Step 13 Recalculated net position If you have net income from revenue account property, you will need to recalculate the net position for the properties you allocated that income to. If you did not allocate any revenue account property income to a residential portfolio or individual property, then this figure will be the same as that at Step 8. Step 15 Sales of residential rental property If you have sold one or more individual properties or a residential portfolio, you will need to work out if any excess deductions need to be transferred. Part 2 will help you do this. If the only property you have sold was in a residential portfolio that continues to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the portfolio), answer No here. If you answered No for all portfolios and individual properties that you own, go to Step 24. Part 2 Transfers of remaining unused deductions from the sale of an individual property or the sale of the last property in a portfolio Complete Part 2 if you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio in this income year. This Part helps you work out if any excess deductions are required to be transferred from the sale of the property or residential portfolio to another property or portfolio. Step 17 Total excess deductions transferred to a residential portfolio or individual property This step must be completed if: • in this year, you have sold your individual property and the sale is taxable, or you have sold the last property in your residential portfolio, and the sale of all properties in the portfolio were taxable (this is the property or portfolio that you answered Yes at Step 16); and • the property or portfolio sold this year had excess deductions transferred to it from another property that was sold in previous years and that sale was not taxable; and • the property or portfolio sold this year has a loss at Step 13. If no excess deductions have been transferred to the individual property or residential portfolio in any income year, enter 0 here. Record all excess deductions that have been transferred to the residential portfolio or individual property in any income year. You must keep track of amounts transferred from one property to another because these amounts may affect the amount of deductions you can claim on the sale of the property when the sale is taxable. Transfers of excess deductions made in this year are recorded at Step 17b and Step 17c. Step 17a Unused excess deductions to be transferred Step 17a must be completed for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 16. If a property shows a net loss at Step 13, and it had deductions transferred to it (which is shown at Step 17), compare the amounts at Step 13 and Step 17, and treating them as both positive amounts, enter the lesser amount at Step 17a. This step calculates the unused excess deductions to transfer in the current year or to carry forward for each portfolio or property that was sold in the income year where the sale was taxable. Excess deductions that would otherwise be released on a taxable sale must be reduced by the amount of any unused excess deductions transferred to the property. 13 Step 17b and Step 17c Transfer unused excess deductions from a taxable sale You will have unused excess deductions remaining from a taxable sale of an individual property if the property has a loss at Step 13 and excess deductions were previously transferred to the individual property. You will have unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of the last property in a residential portfolio if the property has a loss at Step 13, the sales of all properties in the portfolio were taxable, and excess deductions were previously transferred to the residential portfolio. If you have another property or portfolio to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, you can transfer any unused excess deductions from a taxable sale to another property at Step 17b and Step 17c. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, enter 0 in Step 17b and Step 17c. These excess deductions must be carried forward until you can transfer them. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount at Step 23. To make the transfer this year, first enter at Step 17b the amount of unused excess deductions remaining from the sale of a portfolio or property in the column for that portfolio or property. Next, enter in Step 17c the amounts of unused excess deductions to be transferred to your other property or properties that you want to transfer the unused excess deductions to. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 18 Non-taxable sales If you had a mix of taxable and non-taxable sales of all the properties in a residential portfolio, answer No here for the portfolio. This question requires you to look at all sales of portfolio properties for the current year and all previous years. If one or more properties are not taxable on sale, any excess deductions remaining after the sale of the last property in a portfolio must be transferred to another residential portfolio or property. Step 19, Step 19a and Step 19b Transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. If the last property in the portfolio has not been sold, and the portfolio will continue to exist, answer No for the portfolio at Step 19. You will have unused excess deductions remaining if you answered Yes at Step 18 because: - Step 13 shows a loss for an individual property that was sold and the sale was non-taxable, or - Step 13 shows a loss for a residential portfolio if the last property in the portfolio has been sold and at least 1 of the sales of a portfolio property (in any year) was non-taxable. You must transfer all these unused excess deductions to another residential portfolio or individual property if you have one and have earned residential income in this income year. If you have another property to transfer the unused excess deductions to in this year, make the transfer at Step 19a and Step 19b. If you answered Yes for an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 19, enter the amount of the net loss for the property from Step 13 in Step 19a. Allocate all of the amount in Step 19a to one or more properties in Step 19b. If you have no other property to transfer these excess deductions to, or you have not earned any residential income in this income year, enter 0 in Step 19a and Step 19b. You will need to carry these excess deductions forward. They will be included in your Excess deductions carried forward amount on your return. The excess deductions will be reinstated in the next income year in which you earn residential income from a residential portfolio or individual property. You will need to keep track of this amount for future income years. You can transfer unused excess deductions from a non-taxable sale of residential property across multiple properties, until all the excess deductions are used up. Step 20 Recalculated net position for transferred amounts Recalculate net profit or loss for your residential portfolio and individual properties to take account of any transfers of excess deductions remaining after the sale of an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio. Remember that a net loss is a negative amount. If you did not make any transfers to or from a residential portfolio or individual property at Step 17 or Step 19, enter the amount from Step 13 here. Part 3 Calculating excess deductions for a residential portfolio and individual properties This section is comprised of four subparts. For your residential portfolio and individual properties only complete the subpart that applies to your circumstances: Part 3A, Part 3B, Part 3C or Part 3D. Each section will help you to calculate your net residential income, excess deductions and deductions claimed for your residential portfolio and individual properties. Complete Part 3A for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio was not sold this year AND you have transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. Complete Part 3B for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was not taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and one or more of the sales of all of the properties in the portfolio was not taxable. Complete Part 3C for an individual property or residential portfolio if: - the individual property was sold this year and the sale was taxable. - the last property in the portfolio was sold this year and ALL of the sales of the properties in the portfolio were taxable. Complete Part 3D for an individual property or residential portfolio if any of the following are true: - the individual property was not sold AND you have not transferred excess deductions to it in Part 2. - the last property in the residential portfolio w as not sold this year AND you have not transferred excess deductions to the residential portfolio in Part 2. - did not sell any properties in this year. - None of your properties showed a net loss at Step 13 (and you answered No to all at Step 14). Part 3A Individual property or last property in a portfolio not sold and has excess deductions transferred to it Complete this section for an individual property or residential portfolio that has not been sold this year but that has had unused excess deductions transferred to it from the sale of another residential portfolio or individual property in this income year at Step 17c or Step 19b. 14 Step 21 No sale of the individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio AND transferred excess deductions If you transferred unused excess deductions this year to a residential portfolio or individual property you have not sold, the transferred deductions will affect your net profit or loss at Step 13. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in this income year. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 21a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio or individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of income earned from the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Step 21b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 3B Non-Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 18. Step 22 Excess residential rental deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 22a Deductions claimed this year This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your individual property that was sold in the income year where the sale was not taxable. This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio that was sold in the income year where at least one sale of all the properties in the portfolio in any income year was not taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. Calculate your deductions claimed this year by starting with your total deductions at Step 7. If you transferred any excess deductions from this property to one or more other properties at Step 17b or Step 19a, subtract the amounts transferred from your total deductions. If you transferred any excess deductions from another property to this property at Step 17c or Step 19b, then add the amounts transferred to your total deductions. Finally, subtract the amount of excess deductions to carry forward as calculated at Step 22. The amount of deductions for a residential rental property in an income year is limited to the amount of residential income you earn in the income year for the property. If your residential income is higher than the amount of deductible expenses you have incurred for the property, then you will be able to claim all your deductions. Step 22b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that this subpart applies to. Part 3C Taxable sales Complete this section for your residential portfolio and individual properties for which you answered Yes at Step 16. Step 23a Residential rental deductions claimed this year This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where the sales were all taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. If the sale was taxable, you can claim all your deductions for the property minus any transferred amounts. Step 23b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were sold in the income year where: - for a residential portfolio, the last property in the portfolio was sold and the sales of all the properties in the portfolio were taxable - for an individual property, the sale was taxable. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. This step also takes into account any unused excess deductions remaining after the taxable sale of an individual property or residential portfolio at Step 23. Unused excess deductions that remain after a taxable sale will relate to transfers made in previous years to the property from non-taxable sales. 15 Part 3D No sales of individual property or last property in a residential portfolio and no transferred excess deductions or no net loss at step 13. Complete this section for each individual property that you did not sell in this income year and that you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section for a residential portfolio if you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to it at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section if you sold a property in a residential portfolio that will continue to exist (ie, you did not sell the last property in the residential portfolio) and you did not transfer any unused excess deductions to the portfolio at Step 17c or Step 19b. Complete this section if you answered No at Step 15 because you did not sell any residential property this year. Complete this section if you answered No to all at Step 14 because none of your properties had a net loss this year. Step 24 Excess residential deductions to carry forward This step calculates the excess deductions that must be carried forward for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. A residential portfolio is sold if the last property in the portfolio has been sold in the income year. When your deductions exceed residential income for a residential portfolio or individual property in an income year, the excess deductions must be carried forward to a future income year in which you earn residential income. Excess deductions that arise from a residential portfolio or individual property can only be used against the residential income from that portfolio or property unless the property is sold. Step 24a Residential rental deductions claimed this year for each portfolio and property This step calculates the deductions that can be claimed this year for your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. If a residential portfolio or individual property has a net loss then the amount of deductions that may be claimed this year is limited to the amount of residential income for the residential portfolio or individual property. If a residential portfolio or individual property has net income then all deductible expenses relating to that residential portfolio or individual property may be claimed this year. Step 24b Net residential income This step calculates the final net position of your residential portfolio and individual properties that were not sold in the income year and to which no transfers of excess deductions were made. Part 4 Totals for income tax return This section must be completed for your residential portfolio and all individual properties that you own. The totals in this section must be entered in the relevant boxes on your income tax return. Step 32 Net residential income The total amount of net residential income may be a loss. This may happen if you have a net loss from the taxable sale of individual property, or the last property in a residential portfolio has been sold, and the sales of each property in the portfolio were taxable.
