Ngā mihi ki a koe mōu i pānui i tā mātou Pūrongo ā-Tau
------------------------------------------------------

At Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue, we’re passionate about Aotearoa New Zealand being a great place to live and work. We make it simpler for everyone to pay tax that pays for the things they value such as healthcare, education and protecting the environment.

For almost 150 years we’ve protected the integrity of the tax system so New Zealanders can trust that everyone is contributing what they are meant to. 

We support people with initiatives such as Working for Families, child support payments and KiwiSaver.

We also administer government initiatives that provide additional support to individuals and businesses when things are tough or they are impacted by adverse events.
