Use two-step verification in myIR
---------------------------------

Once you’ve set up your myIR profile, you can choose to strengthen security by using two-step verification.

When logging into myIR with two-step verification, you will need to provide a unique security code to verify your identify. 

You can receive security codes by email or an authenticator app on your mobile device.

Registering and acting on behalf of someone else
------------------------------------------------

If you're a parent or legal guardian living with a child under 16, you can register a myIR account for your child. But if your child is over 16, you cannot register on their behalf.

If someone wants you to be their nominated person and act on their behalf, you can access their account details through your own myIR logon. You will have to be set up as a nominated person before you can do this.
