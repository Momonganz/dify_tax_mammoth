Hōtaka pūtea Wāhi kē Financial Schedules - Non-departmental
===========================================================

Why we include the non-departmental schedules
---------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue collects and distributes money on behalf of the Crown and the following non-departmental schedules provide information on the financial extent of these activities. The Commissioner is accountable for the financial management of these activities.

In 2020-21, we collected $94.5 billion of revenue on behalf of New Zealand to fund government programmes. We paid $6.1 billion in non-departmental expenses, including Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver member tax credits, interest, the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment and other expenses.

What non-departmental schedules are and are not
-----------------------------------------------

The non-departmental schedules are prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and the Treasury instructions to disclose non-departmental activities.

The non-departmental schedules do not, and are not intended to, constitute a set of financial statements and, therefore, do not include elements that would normally be expected to be found in financial statements, such as details of a surplus or deficit or ‘Statement of financial position’.
