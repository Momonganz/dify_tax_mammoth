The attribution rule is aimed at ensuring people do not avoid the higher income tax rates by diverting employment income to an associated entity (such as a company, trust or partnership).

Attribution rules
-----------------

The attribution rule applies when all of the following apply.

*   A person (the working person) provides personal services.
*   They are associated with an entity (the associated entity).
*   The associated entity provides services to a third person (the buyer), and the services are personally performed by the working person, and the working person earns net income of more than $70,000 including income of the associated entity if the attribution rule applies.
*   At least 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services comes from the buyer and/or a person associated with them.
*   At least 80% of the associated entity’s income from personal services is earned by the working person and/or a relative of the working person.

Exemptions
----------

The attribution rule does not apply when any of the following apply.

*   Both the associated entity and the working person are non-residents for the full income year.
*   The associated entity is a natural person acting in that capacity (and is not a partner of a partnership or a trustee).
*   The services being provided are essential support for a product supplied by the associated entity.
*   The associated entity has substantial business assets (discussed below).
*   The associated entity is a CFC and the CFC rules (discussed below) apply.
*   The total amount to be attributed for the income year is less than $5,000. However, this exception can only be relied on once - it does not apply if the working person has more than 1 associated entity and the other associated entity has not had income attributed because of this exception.

Substantial business assets
---------------------------

The attribution rule is not applied when the associated entity has substantial business assets that are a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the entity’s assessable income.

Substantial business assets are depreciable property that both:

*   are not for private use, or if they are then no more than 20% is for private use
*   have a total cost of more than $75,000, or 25% or more of the associated entity’s income from services for the year.

Controlled foreign companies (CFC)
----------------------------------

The attribution rule is not applied when all of the following apply.

*   The associated entity is a CFC.
*   The amount that would be attributed to the working person under the income attribution rules would also be attributed CFC income or a loss (under the rules for when attributed CFC income or losses arise).
*   The working person files a return of income in which they return the amount as attributed CFC income.

The $5,000 exemption will not apply if the associated entity is a CFC.

Example: Diverting income to a company

An individual earns a salary of $190,000 from their employer. Without the attribution rule they could establish a company which would be contracted to the employer whereby the individual performs the same employment services. Tax on income to the company would be at the company rate of 28%, rather than the applicable personal rate of up to 33% (or up to 39% from the 2021-2022 year onwards) if the employee was receiving the income directly. The individual could then choose to receive $70,000 in salary (taxed at up to 30%), and either leave the remainder in the company, or distribute it to an associated person such as a spouse. Without the attribution rule in both cases the top tax rate applied would be either 30% or lower.
