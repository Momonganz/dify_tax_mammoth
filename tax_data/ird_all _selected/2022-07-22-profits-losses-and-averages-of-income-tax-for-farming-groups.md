Page 2 of 3 Ref:22OIA2018 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] ANZSIC Level 3 Description A016 Dairy cattle farming A017 Poultry farming A018 Deer breeding, farming A019 Other livestock farming Registrations (questions 1 and 4) In questions 1 and 4, you ask for the number of registered taxpayers with certain industry classifications. This is provided in Table 1 in tab “Q1,2,4,5” of the attached spreadsheet. The registration data in this table is a count of current taxpayer registrations broken down by industry, as at 22 June 2022. Dairy farmers are identified by the level 3 ANZSIC code ‘A016’. An active registration does not necessarily imply that the customer is “active”. As such, it is not a particularly meaningful metric if you are trying to capture active participation in an industry. To provide a more accurate representation of customers who are active, I have also included (in Table 2) the number of taxpayers who have filed income tax returns for the 2020-21 income year. Because partnerships and look-through companies file the same tax return, I have shifted the number of returns filed by look- through companies into the ‘Companies’ category to make it more consistent with registration data. Please note that where the number of taxpayers in a category is below 20, this has been suppressed (marked ”C”) to protect taxpayer privacy. All counts of taxpayers are rounded to the nearest 10, including the totals, and the sum of the numbers in the columns may not match the reported totals due to this rounding and suppression. Dollar values are rounded to the nearest $100,000 and expressed in $millions. Tax paid (questions 2 and 5) Information on income tax paid by industry and entity type is provided in Table 3 on tab “Q1,2,4,5”. These figures are calculated using annual income tax returns. For companies this figure is residual income tax as declared on an IR4 or IR8 tax return. For trusts, the figure is calculated as trading profits (ignoring trading losses) allocated to beneficiaries or trustees, multiplied by average beneficiary or trustee rates. For partnerships and look- through companies, the tax figure is calculated as the income after expenses multiplied by average tax rates for individuals who received partnership or look-through company income. This average is calculated as if these income streams were the last dollar earned. Because partnerships and look-through companies file the same tax return, I have shifted the tax from look-through companies into the ‘Companies’ category to make it more consistent with registration data. The tax from look-through companies is captured in the “Companies” total reported in the table. For individuals, self-employment income, partnership income and/or shareholder salaries were taxed as if these income streams were the last dollar earned for the person. Distribution of income (question 3) The distribution of incomes within the dairy farming industry (ANZSIC code A016) is provided in the attached spreadsheet on tab “Q3”. The income that is being reported differs by entity: • Companies: taxable income (which is net of any brought forward losses claimed) or income after expenses (for look through companies) • Individuals: self-employment income or shareholder remuneration (which are measured before brought forward losses are claimed) • Partnerships: income after expenses • Trusts: business income • Māori Authorities and Clubs/societies: taxable income.
