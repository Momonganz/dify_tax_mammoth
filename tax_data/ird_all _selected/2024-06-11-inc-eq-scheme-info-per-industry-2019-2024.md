You requested the following: Can I please get a copy of the following information in relation to the NZ Income Equalisation Scheme managed by Inland Revenue: For each income year from 2019 to 2024 and separated by industry categories of Farming, Fishing, Forestry and testing, construction and mining: a. The amount of deposits paid into the equalisation scheme; b. Balance of total funds held in the scheme at the end of each year; c. The amount of refunds withdrawn from the scheme; d. For funds refunded during the relevant income year, the duration (in years) that deposited funds remained in the scheme before being refunded; e. The total amount of interest paid by the Crown in relation to the scheme; f. Number registered participants in the scheme; g. Number of new registered participants in the scheme; h. If possible, please split out the above categories into their specific farming type / activity undertaken eg vegetable growing, dairy farming, fruit growing etc. If you have any queries, please contact me. Background The income equalisation schemes (Scheme) covers the farming, fishing, and forestry industries. Business types that qualify for this scheme include: • farming/agriculture/horticulture on land in New Zealand • fishing (including rock oyster farming, mussel farming and freshwater fish farming) • forestry in New Zealand (except for companies, public authorities, Māori authorities or unincorporated bodies). The environmental restoration scheme covers the testing, construction, and mining industries when their business relates to environmental restoration. However, no entities from these industries are registered under the Scheme; therefore, Inland Revenue holds no information for these industries in relation to the Scheme.
