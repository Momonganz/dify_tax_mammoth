Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers - preliminary consumers price index adjustments 06/02 (April 2006)
=================================================================================================================================

Preliminary CPI Adjustment 06/02 (2006) for Determination DET 05/03: Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers.

In accordance with the provisions of Determination _DET-05/03_, as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005), Inland Revenue advises that, for the 2007 income year, the preliminary _weekly standard-cost_ component is to be adjusted as follows:

*   The _weekly standard-cos_t for one to two boarders will increase from $200 each to $207 each.
*   The _weekly standard-cost_ for third and subsequent number of boarders will increase from $162 each to $168 each.

The above amounts have been adjusted in accordance with the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index for the twelve months to March 2006, which showed an increase of 3.3 percent. For boarding service providers who have a standard 31 March balance date, the new amounts apply for the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 . These adjusted amounts are intended as a preliminary indication of the likely levels of weekly standard-costs. These figures will be further adjusted, to apply retrospectively to the 2007 income year, based on the All Groups Consumers Price Index movement for the twelve months ending March 2007, when available.
