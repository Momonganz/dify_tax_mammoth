It is a basis for Inland Revenue to use as a first step in determining an individual debtor’s non-discretionary household expenditure when collecting debt. The information can be used to compare a person’s household expenditure to an average expenditure for similar households in the same region. Data Source This guide is based on data obtained from the Household Economic Survey 2023 administered by Statistics New Zealand, adjusted for inflation. The Household Economic Survey gathers information from approximately 3,000 NZ households about their weekly household operating expenditure. In conducting the Household Economic Survey every effort was made to obtain a sample that is representative of NZ households. However, there will always be households whose expenditure varies from the figures in this guide. The tables in this guide provide data broken down by region and household composition. For the purposes of the Household Economic Survey, a household comprises a group of people who share a private dwelling and normally spend four or more nights a week in the household. They must share consumption of food or contribute some portion of income towards the provision of essentials for living as a group. Regions Two types of regions are listed in this guide - urban and rural. Urban – Towns with populations over 10,000 people, broken down into 5 sub-regions: yAuckland yWaikato and Bay of Plenty yWellington yrest of the North Island (ie Northland, Gisborne, Hawke’s Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu-Whanganui) ySouth Island. These include all main and secondary urban areas in the region. Rural – Towns (all rural or minor urban areas) with a population of less than 10,000 covering all areas of NZ. Household compositions The household compositions used in this guide are: ycouple only ycouple with 1 dependent child ycouple with 2 dependent children ycouple with 3 or more dependent children y1 parent with dependent child(ren) y1 person. For these purposes, a dependent child is younger than 18 years of age and is not employed full-time. No liability is accepted by Statistics New Zealand or Inland Revenue for any use or interpretation of this information. 4AD164 Household expenditure Household expenditure is divided into 16 categories. 1.

The following should be considered: 1. Household Economic Survey data are not collected based on ethnicity. Ethnicity may affect expenditure in different categories eg some ethnic groups may send part of their income to relatives overseas. 2. Expenditure does not necessarily rise with increasing household size. 3. Households are diverse and have differing characteristics and expenditure priorities. These include family size, age of adults and children, income earned, occupation, etc. For example, households with no children may spend more money on ‘eating out’ than young families who may be reliant on a single income. 4. Household income is not a factor in collecting and collating data. 5. The Household Economic Survey was designed to produce national estimates. In this guide where data have been broken down into regions, the sampling error of the data will increase. This reduces certainty that the sample accurately reflects the regional population. 6. Within regions expenditure patterns will not be uniform. 7. Factors influencing a household's expenditure or income include household size, household composition, geographic location, and employment-related factors. 8. Where insufficient expenditure data were collected, Statistics NZ has imputed (estimated) the amounts. These are marked with an asterisk (\*). Using the tables To compare your household’s weekly spending to the amounts in the following tables, follow these steps: 1. Gather details of your household weekly spending, including GST. 2. Categorise your household’s weekly expenditure into the 16 categories described on pages 4 and 5. 3. Select the table for the region where you live from pages 7 to 12. 4. Select the household within the table that matches yours. 5. Compare your weekly spending with that shown in the table. The expenditure amounts are: yweekly average expenditure for reporting households only yrounded to the nearest 10 cents yinclusive of goods and services tax (GST) and excise duties.
