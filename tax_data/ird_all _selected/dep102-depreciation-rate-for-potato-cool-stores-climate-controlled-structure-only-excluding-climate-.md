Depreciation Rate for potato cool stores (climate controlled) structure only, excluding climate control plant
=============================================================================================================

Depreciation determination DEP102 (2017) adds an asset class for 'potato cool stores (climate controlled) structure only, excluding climate control plant'.

#### Note to Determination DEP102

The Commissioner has recently been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for potato cool stores.

Potato cool stores are specialist buildings that control humidity and temperature so that potatoes can be stored for long periods without spoilage occurring. These cool stores are fitted with refrigeration reticulation machinery, air transfer systems and associated electronic componentry (climate control plant).

In appearance, potato cool stores are dome-shaped tunnels. They are usually constructed of zinc coated galvanised steel (corrugated iron). The Commissioner accepts that these specialised buildings are exposed to a humid, corrosive environment that impacts the life of the building’s construction material.

For this reason the Commissioner is satisfied that the estimated useful life (EUL) of these specialised buildings is 33.3 years and has set a provisional depreciation rate for these assets accordingly.

It should be noted that it is the Commissioner’s view that the climate control plant is not attached to the potato cool store building; it can be easily removed without damaging either the plant or the building. This being so, the various items of climate control plant are separate items of depreciable property and (where appropriate) may be able to be separately depreciated. Further information, regarding whether items of depreciable property form part of a building, may be found in Interpretation Statement _IS 10/01 Residential Rental Properties – Depreciation of Items of Depreciable Property \[[1](#01)\
\]_.
