If you think you'll get a large refund or debt at the end of the tax year, follow these steps to apply for a tailored tax code. This will help you pay the right amount of tax throughout the year.

Businesses and organisations cannot apply for this kind of tailored tax code.

Apply every year
----------------

You need to apply for a new tailored tax code every tax year (1 April to 31 March). If you already have one, we’ll send you a letter in early February reminding you to apply.

We'll send you a letter and certificate within 10 working days of receiving your application to let you know your tailored tax rate. If you have myIR, you will see a copy of your certificate there. This lets you know we have approved your application.

Please note that applications made during February and March may take longer than 10 working days.

You need to tell your payer what your tailored tax rate is. Do this by showing them your certificate.

If you have a tailored tax code for your New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran's Pension, we'll let Work and Income know.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

You need to reapply for a tailored tax code every tax year you want one.

We’ll contact you through myIR, or send you a letter, in time for you to reapply.
