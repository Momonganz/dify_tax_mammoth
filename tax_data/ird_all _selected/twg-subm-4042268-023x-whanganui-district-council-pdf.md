Obstacles in securing financing from banks, limited and expensive insurance, unable to attract tenants We need a better understanding of problems faced by such towns and estimate the necessary level of incentives as economic and social consequences will be more severe 1 Wood, J.

Increasing earthquake resilience Whanganui’s champions Champion #2– plans seismic strengthening to 67%, Category 2 Heritage NZ, built in 1910 Two storey stand-alone office building, ground floor vacant since Nov 2014 (low NBS) Rental income from both floors $71,600 ($127 per m2) Estimated cost of seismic upgrade is $500K ($885 per m2) plus $250K for restoration Applying for Heritage EQUIP major works grant which could provide up to 50% of seismic strengthening costs Strengthening must be financially viable – rental income post remediation needs to be sufficient to cover the debt servicing of retrofit + return on the building Increasing earthquake resilience Whanganui’s future Whanganui falls in the medium seismic risk area, requiring councils to identify EQPBs w/in 5- 10yrsand owners to strengthen or demolish w/in 25yrs Given the long-term 30-yr horizon of regulatory obligations, owners take a ‘wait and see’ approach EQPBs cannot attract investment-grade tenants (gov’t, banks, top-end retailers) AND have higher vacancies ‘Champions’ are great BUT there are 120 pre-1976 buildings in the central zone that will likely require seismic upgrades In order to achieve economic viability, significant financial incentives are needed: •Major works grants (e.g. Heritage EQUIP) •Subsidised interest-free loans •Property rates relief (e.g. Tax Increment Financing) •Equity participation (e.g. HNZ shared equity scheme) •Allow tax deductibility of retrofit costs •Extend EQC cover to strengthened commheritage bldgs Thank you! www.quakecore.nz
