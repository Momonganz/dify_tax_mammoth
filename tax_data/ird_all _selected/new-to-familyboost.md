New to FamilyBoost
==================

FamilyBoost is a childcare payment to help eligible households pay for the cost of early childhood education (ECE). You may be able to claim up to 25% of your weekly childcare fees, or a maximum of $975 every 3 months.

Claiming: what you need to know
-------------------------------

You must be registered in myIR to claim FamilyBoost.

Childcare fees can include optional charges and services.

Claims for FamilyBoost are for the household, not for each individual child.

You need to lodge a claim each quarter:

*   July to September
*   October to December
*   January to March
*   April to June.

Eligibility
-----------

What you will be able to get is based on your:

*   care arrangements for your children
*   tax residency
*   child or children’s age
*   household income.

The maximum entitlement is $975 each quarter. If you earn more than $35,000 in a quarter, the amount you can claim slowly reduces until your income reaches $45,000.

We assess FamilyBoost claims quarterly. This means you may be eligible in 1 quarter but not in the next.
