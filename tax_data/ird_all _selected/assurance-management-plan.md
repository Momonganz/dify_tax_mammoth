Key Objectives and Outcomes Transformation will enable Inland Revenue to deliver on government expectations and priorities, and meet New Zealanders’ expectations of a modern revenue system. Transformation will: • Provide confidence in the continued collection of tax revenue and distribution of entitlements; • Improve government’s ability to make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively; • Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right; and • Create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealand. At the end of transformation, Inland Revenue will be more agile, effective and efficient, enable customers to self-manage with speed and certainty, enable government to make timely policy changes, and work with other agencies to optimise interaction across government. 1.1 Business Transformation Programme Overview The Programme is a multi-year, multi-stage initiative as illustrated in the programme roadmap below, noted by Cabinet that will deliver outcomes over four stages, as described below. The roadmap illustrates the expected delivery sequencing of the programme. Page 7 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.2 Programme Costs and Benefits 1. 2.1 Costs and Benefits The table below shows the estimated whole of life cost and expected monetary benefits (adjusted for inflation) NZD $ Estimated Whole-of-life Cost (WOLC) Expected Monetary Benefits WOLC Duration To 2023-2024 1. 2.2 Benefits committed to government The Detailed Business Case (November 2015) outlines financial and non-financial benefits across five benefit areas. These benefit areas are mapped to the programme’s investment objectives. Benefit Area Description Easier for customers Customers will find it easier to meet their obligations and receive their entitlements. Agility to implement policy The time and costs for IR to implement (policy) changes will be markedly reduced. Revenue system resilience The revenue system will be simpler and more resilient, and recover from any failure quickly. Additional Crown revenue and efficiency savings Improved customer compliance increases assessed Crown revenue and IR will be more efficient and smaller than today. Compliance effort savings The compliance effort for businesses will reduce. More detail on the programme’s costs and benefits are fully documented in the November 2015 Programme Update and Detailed Business Case. This is published on Inland Revenue’s website. Page 8 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.3 Risk Rating Risk Rating from Risk Profile Assessment (RPA) High Overall the programme is considered to be inherently high risk. Accordingly, considerable emphasis has been placed on developing the capabilities required to manage and mitigate risks and issues. The programme’s management of risk was recognised as “an exemplar” in the last six Gateway reviews (last one completed March 2020). Refer to Section 1.5 below, for the current Programme risks that are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee 1.4 Key Risks as per the Programme Business Case The Programme has been recognised as a high-risk initiative and a number of key risks have been identified, as per the Programme Business Case (March 2013). These key risks can be categorised in three broad areas, as shown in the table below – scope, delivery and downstream impacts, with how the Programme is currently mitigating these Scope – Is Inland Revenue doing the right things? Risks Mitigations • Transformational planning is not fully mature, so the preferred way forward may not deliver the benefits anticipated or may cost more. • The external environment, including government and customer requirements/expectations and technology developments, may change over the life of the programme. • Inland Revenue has adopted strong programme governance and management that includes internal and external stakeholders. • Inland Revenue’s benefits management framework provides clear accountabilities and owners for realisation of benefits. • Programme plans will be designed around giving Inland Revenue and government flexibility to respond to changes • Inland Revenue has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement to ensure that stakeholders' needs are well understood. Delivery - Can Inland Revenue deliver the programme? Risks Mitigations • Inland Revenue cannot manage the programme and business as usual. • Inland Revenue’s senior management is distracted by competing priorities and pressures. • Inland Revenue has adopted strong organisational and programme governance and management to ensure that organisational priorities are clear and any trade-offs are discussed and agreed with the Government. • Inland Revenue cannot source and manage the services and expertise that we require to deliver the programme. • Resources with proven experience in procuring and managing large-scale vendor contracts have been acquired. Retention strategies have been developed for critical resources across the transformation journey. • Inland Revenue has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement to ensure that stakeholders' needs are well understood. Page 9 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • High dependence on third parties, including other government agencies and intermediaries, to support the changes proposed. • The programme becomes disconnected from Inland Revenue service delivery functions and revenue system participants, and the transition to the new operating model is slow and complex. • Inland Revenue will extensively engage with other government agencies, revenue system participants and within Inland Revenue to ensure the proposed change is fit for purpose and all parties are prepared for change. Downstream impacts - Are there other implications for government? Risks Mitigations • The potential impact of Inland Revenue’s transformation on other agencies has not been assessed. • The Commissioner will continue to work closely with the chief executives of other agencies to identify where changes may be required and to ensure that any impacts are carefully planned for. • There may be intervals in which Government’s ability to make significant policy changes is constrained because of the need to instigate a change freeze while migrating to the new platform. • Inland Revenue will continue to work closely with Ministers to ensure that any potential constraints or trade-offs are identified and discussed early. Page 10 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.5 Programme Risks As at 16 September 2020, there are currently 56 programme risks, of which 14 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee as follows: Risk Ref Type of Risk Risk BTR- 19\*\* Stakeholders There is a risk that Government loses confidence in IR's ability to deliver the Business Transformation Programme. BTR- 29\*\* External Environment There is a risk that external decision-making takes longer than planned and timescales are extended. BTR- 77\*\* Business Process There is a risk that the Business Transformation Programme becomes a technology replacement rather than a true business transformation. BTR- 84\*\* Information management There is a risk that the benefits to the Crown, customers and IR that were committed to Cabinet in the 2015 programme business case are not realised and/or are not realised within required timeframes. BTR- 90\*\* External Environment There is a risk that the scope, timing and priorities of the Business Transformation Programme may change due to external factors. BTR- 168\*\* Financial There is a risk that the contingency agreed by Cabinet as part of the business case funding approval is applied to fund other competing priorities/pressures, creating a risk of insufficient funding to complete delivery of BT. BTR- 178\*\* Stakeholders There is a risk of misalignment between the programme’s agreed scope, roadmap and delivery timeframes, and expectations on the programme to deliver all-of-government (AoG) capabilities. BTR- 3260^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing cutover of products to START and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on FIRST after 1 July 2022 will result in operating on an unsupported Mainframe ecosystem BTR- 4767^ Stakeholders In the event of a Major Incident (P1 & P2), if clear processes and responsibilities are not known or effective, and/or the correct skills are not available, then time taken to successfully resolve the incident will be prolonged. BTR- 6394^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of \[Information redacted\] and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on \[Information redacted\] after 1 July 2022 may result in inability of IR to exit the \[Information redacted\] Data Centre resulting in potential cost and contractual impact BTR- 6395^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing decommission of EDW and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on EDW after 1 July 2022 will result in inability of IR to exit the \[Information redacted\] Data Centre resulting in potential cost and contractual issues BTR- 6396^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing decommission of FIRST satellite functions and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on FIRST after 1 July 2022, will result operating on an unsupported Mainframe and cause IR to potentially delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre BTR- 6838^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of E-File and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on E-File after 1 July 2022, may cause IR to delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre BTR- 6839^ Information, communication, technology Delay in completing the decommission of Kiwisaver B2B (OFM) and any unforeseen residual activity/reliance on OFM after 1 July 2022, may cause IR to delay the exit of \[Information redacted\] Data Centre Note: \*\* = Programme risks that are non Stage specific. ^ = Programme risk that impacts Stage 4. Page 11 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The diagrams below map the likelihood and the consequences of these risks occurring. The risk profile of these risks based on the respective current r isk rating is as follows: The risk profile of these risks is based on the respective target risk is as follows: Page 12 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Part 2 – Assurance Management Plan Overview 2.1 Assurance Approach The key focus of the assurance approach is to ensure that all governance and management aspects of the programme are working appropriately, and that the programme stays on target to achieve its objectives. The objective of the Assurance Management Plan is to ensure the effective coordination of all assurance activities across the Programme. The primary objectives of assurance within the Programme are to: • Increase confidence that the agreed scope and deliverables will be delivered and are appropriate considering the business outcomes expected and the size and scale of the programme • Provide assurance to the CIR/SRO and key stakeholders that the Programme is producing quality outcomes, including delivery within schedule and budget • Provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the programme management functions, within the context of the required activities and outcomes detailed in the programme business case • Provide an independent assessment of the status of deliverables and processes at critical stages of the programme • Ensure that any risks and issues identified within the programme are managed in a timely manner with the right level of focus • Identify improvement opportunities, which may further increase the likelihood of programme success • Leverage past review results to ensure that common pitfalls can be avoided where necessary; and • Ensure adherence to ICT and Government procurement guidelines and rules. 2.2 Lessons Learned and Post Implementation Reviews The programme undertakes key lessons learned during and at the end of each release/stage, to capture proposed actions to address the learnings, to improve Programme performance for the remaining releases/stages. Lessons identified are assigned action owners and are incorporated into planning for the subsequent releases/stages. The programme also incorporates any key lessons learned from other programmes and projects from within Inland Revenue and other government agencies. The programme utilises independent quality assurance activities to gain additional insights and to identify any opportunities for improvement. Any recommendations identified from these reviews are assigned owners to action and are followed up by the Programme. These responses and updates are also provided to Internal Assurance and Advice’s as part of their quarterly process to follow up, monitor and report completion of these actions. The Programme is committed to sharing its key lessons learned with its external stakeholders. A Post-Implementation Review is conducted after completing a major release/stage. Its purpose is to evaluate whether the release/stage objectives were met, to determine how effectively the release/stage was run, to learn lessons for the future, and to ensure that the organisation gets the greatest possible benefit from the release/stage. Page 13 of 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2.3 Key Assurance Activities The Programme will require a variety of assurance services through all releases/stages of the Programme, with key assurance reports and advice aligning with milestones as outlined in current planning documentation. The table below summarises the key assurance activities that will be performed across the Programme to provide assurance to our key internal and external stakeholders that the programme is set up to succeed and achieve its outcomes.

Note: This will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis by the PMO as more information comes to hand and will be included within and tracked via the Programme Master Schedule. Any material changes in the assurance schedule will be communicated to the Central Agencies. 3.2 Ongoing Programme Assurance Activities Assurance activities will be coordinated as part of the Programme Management Office (PMO) function and will be incorporated into regular programme planning and reporting to the PLT, PGC and PIC as required. The BT Assurance Management Plan will be endorsed by CR&A and the Deputy Commissioner Transformation. The document will be approved by the Senior Responsible Officer (SRO).
