Payments provided to employees that work from home; Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment (WITHDRAWN)
============================================================================================================================================

Over the past two years, the Commissioner has published several determinations that deal with the additional expenditure that employees may face when they work from home and/or use their personal telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment. 

Determination EE003 applies for the period 1 October 2021 until 31 March 2023 and sets out the extent to which a payment made by an employer to an employee in these circumstances is able to be treated as exempt income to the employee.  In order to make it easier for employers and employees to locate the information that they may require, this determination amalgamates and replaces all previous determinations that have been published on this topic.

[Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 9 - October 2021](/tib/volume-33---2021/tib-vol-33-no9)
 

This determination has been replaced by [EE004: Tax treatment of reimbursing payments made to employees who work from home and/or payments made for an employee’s use of personal telecommunications tools and/or usage plans in their employment](/determinations/miscellaneous/2023/ee004)

From 1 October 2021, this determination replaces:
