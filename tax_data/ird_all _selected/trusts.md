Trusts
======

A trust is a creation of the law of equity and is not a legal entity distinct from its trustee. Instead, a trust is a fiduciary relationship where a trustee holds property for the benefit of beneficiaries or, where the trust is a charitable trust, for the specified charitable purposes. Although the trustee has legal ownership of the trust property, they hold it subject to the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries and must act in accordance with the terms of the trust and the Trusts Act 2019.

The Commissioner has published various items on income tax, GST and disclosure issues involving trusts. This overview sets out these items organised by the following headings:
