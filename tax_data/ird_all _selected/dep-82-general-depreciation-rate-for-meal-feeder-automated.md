General depreciation rate for meal feeder - automated
=====================================================

Determination DEP 82 (2012) sets a depreciation rate for automated meal feeders used by primary producers to deliver supplementary dry and liquid feed to stock.

#### Note to Determination DEP 82

The Commissioner has set a general depreciation rate for "meal feeders, automated" by adding a new asset class in the "Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture" industry category.

The Commissioner considers that the new asset class has an estimated useful life of 20 years.

#### What is the asset?

Automated meal feeders are used by primary producers (farmers) to deliver supplementary dry and liquid feed to stock. For example, to cows while they are being milked. Automated meal feeder systems may also be used in other farming activities such as poultry or fish farming.

Although there may be variations to the overall design to meet the customised requirements of each user, an automated meal feeder system generally consists of:

*   Meal feed pan
*   Galvanised steel silo to hold the feed until dispensing
*   Polyethylene tank to hold the liquid feed until dispensing
*   Galvanised steel silo which gives the ability to mix the feed being dispensed
*   Associated PVC pipework
*   An internal auger to move the dry feed and alkathene pipe which delivers the liquid feed, from the respective storage facilities
*   Pump which moves the liquid feed to the stainless feed pan
*   Motor or vibratory feeder, and
*   Control system.
