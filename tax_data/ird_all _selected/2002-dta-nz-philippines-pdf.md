If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to — (a)that permanent establishment; or (b)sales within that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind as those being sold, or other business activities of the same or a similar kind as those being carried on through that permanent establishment if the sale or the business activities had been made or carried on in that way with a view to avoiding taxation in that other State. 2.Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3.In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4.Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts paid or charged (other than reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of: (a)royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights; (b)commission for specific services performed or for management; and New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement (c)interest or money lent to the permanent establishment, except in the case of a banking institution. 6.No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 7.For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 8.Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. – Paragraph 2 inserted by Article I of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] Article 10 Dividends 1.Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2.However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 as the case may be, shall apply. 5.Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 6.Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the Philippines from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount remitted abroad.

This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect. 4.The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.

Article 25 Exchange of Information 1.The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes covered by the Convention insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention, as well as to prevent fiscal evasion. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1.

Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 2.In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a)to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b)to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c)to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). Article 26 Territorial Extension 1.This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to any territory for whose international relations New Zealand is responsible, which imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions (including conditions as to termination) as may be specified and agreed between the Contracting States in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels or in any manner in accordance with their constitutional procedures. 2.Unless otherwise agreed by both Contracting States, the termination of the Convention by one of them under Article 29 shall also terminate, in the manner provided for in that Article, the application of the Convention to any territory to which it has been extended under this Article. 3.Paragraph 4 of Article 2 shall apply to any taxes imposed by any territory to which the Convention is extended under this Article. Article 27 Diplomatic and Consular Officers Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic and consular officials under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements.
