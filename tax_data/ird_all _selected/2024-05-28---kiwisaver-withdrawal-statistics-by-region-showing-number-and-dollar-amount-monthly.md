24OIA2216 Page 1 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 28 May 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 30 April 2024. You requested the following: Kiwisaver withdrawal statistics by Region - that shows the number and dollar amount of Kiwisaver withdrawals by region (here) - and was hoping you could provide me with a timeseries version (monthly or annually) of this dataset going back as far as available. The information you have requested is enclosed as Appendix A. To protect the privacy of individual persons, this information cannot be broken down monthly as it increases the risk of being able to identify an individual, which is contrary to the confidentiality provisions set out in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act (TAA). As such, your request for regional data is refused under section 18(c)(i) of the OIA, as releasing this information would be contrary to section 18 of the TAA. Data back to the financial year 2020/21 is the most up-to-date information Inland Revenue ha s, as this is the year KiwiSaver data was transitioned into its new system. These figures can change over time as new information is sent through from providers. Inland Revenue intends to publish 2024 data at the end of September 2024. Right of review If you disagree with my decision on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decision. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. If you choose to have an internal review, you can still ask the Ombudsman for a review. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenueâ€™s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety.
