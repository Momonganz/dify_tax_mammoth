=============================================================================================

If we want to adjust a return you’ve filed, we’ll generally send you a Notice of proposed adjustment – IR770 (NOPA).

If you disagree with the change we want to make, you need to send us a Notice of response (NOR) within 2 months of the date on our NOPA. If you do not, you’re deemed by law to have accepted our proposed adjustment.

Download and save the form
--------------------------

Download the Notice of response - IR771 form and save it to your computer. You’ll need to print the completed form and send it to us.

If you use your own document, use the same headings as in our NOR form and attach the IR771 as the cover sheet.

Give us reasons why you want the change. Tell us why it’s correct and what laws support it.

If you cannot tell us what laws support it, you’ll need to provide enough details that we can identify the laws for you.

List the documents that support your view and the facts you’re relying on. Attach copies to your NOR.

For example:
