Why not have it collected automatically by the banking system that whenever someone makes a remittance overseas via credit card or other online means the banking network identifies the payee and grabs the GST. I can see the ongoing collection/policing requiring voluntary registration being another cost to taxpayers that compromises the benefits to be gained.

Whi le I broadly support the measure, some of the thinking it is incorrect. Myt h: everything’s already available here The Minister’s media release of 1 May 2018 states “Large multinationals sell exactly the same products into our market without collecting GST”. The selection of goods available in New Zealand is vastly smaller than what’s available internationally. There are a huge number of goods that simply aren’t stocked in New Zealand, meaning local retailers aren’t disadvantaged when goods are purchased overseas. For example, in April 2018 alone, I searched for quality underwear in a size 22, special camera attachments for my iPhone and specific brands of shoes, and none of these items were available in New Zealand at any price or from any retailer. While I have no issues paying GST on goods I buy locally or internationally, it’s important not to perpetuate the myth that everything anyone could ever want can be purchased from a local retailer. Myth : Kiwis are motivated to shop on international websites based on price Serv ice in many stores is non-existent and I don’t wish to reward bad service by spending money in such stores. If I’m not going to receive personalised service, then I will purchase online either through a local or international website. To say Kiwis are shopping on international websites purely because of price is also a myth. As part of this process, retailers should take a good, hard look at their service levels and what they can do to retain customers. Man y thanks for the opportunity to comment.

Hi Thank you for your email of 2 May which raised the potential for double taxation under the Government’s proposals to collect GST on low-value imported goods in situations where multiple low- value goods are shipped together with a total value exceeding $400. To prevent GST being paid twice on low-value goods shipped in a single package, the discussion document suggests that the consumer would need to provide Customs with appropriate evidence that GST has already been paid on some or all of the goods in that package. For example, the consumer could retain proof of purchase (such as an invoice or an email from the supplier providing confirmation of their order) that shows they were charged GST by the supplier along with the amount of GST paid on the items. The Government is seeking feedback on whether this approach is appropriate, or whether other approaches for preventing or relieving double tax in these situations may be more workable. For example, Australia has a slightly different approach to supplies of multiple low-value goods. While offshore suppliers should charge GST at the point of sale on goods valued at or below the Australian low- value threshold of AU$1,000, there is an exception to this rule when the supplier has a reasonable belief that the goods will be grouped together and shipped in one package. However, in cases where the supplier is unable to form a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together but it turns out that the goods are in fact sent together in one package, Australian Customs will collect GST at the border if the total value is more than AU$1,000. In these situations, the consumer is required to seek a refund of the GST from the supplier. One point that we should probably clarify in relation to the proposals is that the value on the package should be exclusive of any GST charged by the supplier. So in your example where 40 items valued at $10 each are shipped together in a single package, the value on the package should be $400 instead of $460. But you are nevertheless correct that there is the potential for double taxation under the proposals, such as where two goods valued at $210 each are shipped together in a single package. I trust that this response is helpful. We would be very receptive to hearing any suggestions that you may have about ways to prevent or relieve double taxation in these situations, so please send in a submission if you have any thoughts on how the proposal in the discussion document could be improved. You can write a submission to us by replying to this email.

Just like 'trade me' in New Zealand, where people selling their own second hand items do not pay GST, people who are on e-bay who are not traders, but selling their own second hand items should not be expected to pay this tax. Nor should it be added at the border for second hand items over $400. An example of this may be a wedding dress - where it is likely to cost more than $400, but is used. Taxes have already been paid on this item in the original country when it was bought and sold the first time around.

However this monitoring work would rely heavily on the values and information we and other CBAFF members supplied in their low and high value entries. The issue with this is that while other integrated Courier Companies supply this information electronically it is currently not supplied by goods coming in via Post. This would give shippers more incentive to use this import method. Particularly from some countries into NZ. We note that IRD have raised a concern on consumers being taxed twice. Once at the border and once at the point of sale. We feel this was a moot point as on arrival the customs broker would be checking if GST had already been collected or not by looking at the commercial invoice. They always require a copy of the commercial invoice in order to complete a customs entry so this would already need to be requested. If GST was collected twice by mistake then this should be refunded by Customs and not the vendor. While large well known Vendors would look to do the right thing and refund their customers not all vendors would and it would not be fair to put the NZ customer at a disadvantage when it is the NZ public this initiative is designed to benefit. The ATO come to NZ and held several presentations this year to NZ eCommerce Exporters on the upcoming changes 1 st July 2017. This was extremely valuable for our customers and it would be highly recommended that IRD did the same in AU and other countries. We also feel that the data matching across NZ and AU mentioned is a great idea. Being able to register in AU or NZ and have the same codes work in both countries would be ideal as a lot of our shippers send to both AU and NZ already. It would also make it easier for those only sending to AU now also want to look at NZ. We are more than happy to discuss any of the above submission with either IRD or Customs further if required.

BY EMAIL: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Introduction Booksellers New Zealand Incorporated (BSNZ) is a not for profit membership organisation representing the interests of some 300 booksellers in almost every community in New Zealand. A summary of out main points are listed in the box below. Summary of major points and recommendations: •BSNZ is strongly supportive of the Government's decision to collect GST from offshore suppliers of low-value goods. •We are supportive of an offshore registration supplier model for collecting GST on low value goods, because it is simple, straightforward, and in line with the Australian approach. •We are in favour of the earliest possible implementation date given the growth rate of online shopping. •We support a threshold for supplier registration being $60,000 revenue in a 12-month period. •We favour an approach that requires offshore suppliers to return GST on goods valued at or below $400, instead of the current de minimis of $60 of “duty”. This flat threshold will vastly simplify understanding and compliance. •In principle, we support the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges for goods valued at or below $400, but we are concerned that New Zealand-domiciled retailers will still suffer a competitive disadvantage in relation to duties on items below the $400 threshold. • We are strongly supportive of online marketplaces and “re-deliverers” being included in the offshore supplier model. PUB-025 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1. Since 2009 we have been researching the effects on the competitive position of our members as a result of the loophole in the application of the existing Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This has allowed New Zealand consumers to avoid paying GST on consumption of low value goods purchased from offshore online retailers. We have been advocating strongly that this has placed New Zealand bookshops and other small retailers in an unfair competitive position 2. The New Zealand Government’s GST legislation was designed to be universally applied and the small exceptions to this, including the original granting to NZ Customs of an exemption on collecting GST on goods below $400, saw the universality largely enforced. 4. However, the purchasing of low value goods from offshore online retailers has grown hugely in recent years and has grossly exposed the 1985 exemption when there was very little online retailing, if any. 3. The introduction of new legislation establishing an offshore supplier model that will require offshore online retailers, and related marketplaces, to collect GST on sales into New Zealand will effectively level the playing field for domestic retailers which currently have a 15 per cent price disadvantage. 4. The proposed offshore supplier model is a sensible and pragmatic solution, preferable to collection between the point of sale and delivery, or after delivery, as both would require entirely new systems to be devised. 5. Collection at the point of sale for physical goods is the natural extension of the system that was implemented successfully for services and intangibles in 2016. 6. We are supportive of the proposal as outlined in the discussion paper and our comments are summarised below: 7. For too long New Zealand based retailers, both in bricks and mortar stores and online, have been at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore online suppliers because of the outdated application of the 1985 legislation providing a loophole for online offshore retailers. This affects the New Zealand bookshops and other retailers in many ways, stunting their growth, and reduction in employment, and includes a detrimental flow-on effect to suppliers and the general commerce within a community.. 8. Bookshops in particular, are hubs of their communities and thus the cultural health of communities throughout New Zealand are put at risk if they cannot compete fairly. 9. We are in favour of the earliest possible implementation date. The systems that will be needed to implement the new legislation are largely in place as a result of the requirement of offshore online retailers supplying digital services, such as e-books, to collect GST. 10. As the discussion paper notes, it is difficult to estimate the total revenue foregone resulting from the non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods. This is because we don’t have good data about the volume and value of goods under the de minimis crossing our border. Customs has RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT estimated it at around $80 million in 2016 but our own research has suggested it could be much higher. 11. Research conducted by Victoria University for BSNZ in 2011 suggested that online sales by New Zealand retailers would increase substantially if offshore online retailers were required to collect GST on their sales into New Zealand. 12. The experience of applying GST to services and intangibles has shown that the actual revenue collected is much more than initially estimated. When the system was proposed it was estimated that the Government was foregoing approximately $40 million a year in revenue. Total revenue from the GST returns filed by offshore suppliers for the first twelve months was $113 million. 13. Before the implementation of offshore registration for services and intangibles there was also concern about uptake and non-compliance. That has also proved not to be a major issue and over 200 merchants have registered to date. It is noted that one major supplier of books into New Zealand, Abe Books (owned by Amazon) has already informed New Zealand bookshops that if they sell into Australia the price of their books will be increased by 10 per cent as Abe Books intends to comply with the Australian legislation as of 1 July, 2018 14. We favour the proposed approach that requires offshore suppliers to return GST on goods valued at or below $400, instead of the current de minimis of $60 of “duty” – this removes the complication of determining the product type and the country of origin in order to correctly apply a tariff. 15. We support the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges for goods valued at or below $400. This is a much easier threshold to understand and apply than the roving de minimis of $60 duty owing. 16. We are strongly supportive of online marketplaces and “re-deliverers” being included in the offshore supplier model. If they are excluded, there is a real risk that this will provide another loophole that allows GST to be avoided by offshore suppliers. We note in many cases in the United States where States have legislated to ensure that online retailers collect sales tax on previously exempted cross border sales, re-deliverers have not been included which has created another large loophole. 17. The Australian model, like that proposed for New Zealand, closes this loophole by ensuring that re-deliverers are required to pay GST. 18. We support the detailed proposals for registration and returns. Extending the existing GST registration system is a straightforward approach. New Zealand's existing GST registration system is already working well for foreign suppliers of digital services, and we see no reason why it won't also be effective for low value goods. 19. In the longer-term, we also support exploring joint-registration systems with other countries, and potentially a single harmonised GST system. The more that Australia and New Zealand can simplify and streamline border requirements, the better it will be for both businesses and consumers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 20. We would be happy to present our views in person and our submission is available to be made public if required. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Submission on “GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system” A government discussion document – published May 2018 Introduction The Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Incorporated (CBAFF) wishes to make a submission the discussion document published in May 2018 in respect to GST on low value imported goods. CBAFF CBAFF is the leading industry association representing customs brokers, freight forwarders and related service providers in New Zealand’s part of the international supply chain. The representation for such service providers also extends to their clients being importers and exporters. Those service providers and their clients are the parties subject to control of the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry for Primary Industries and Inland Revenue Department, together with other agencies such as the Ministry of Transport, Maritime New Zealand, Civil Aviation Authority, Environmental Protection Authority and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. CBAFF has a long history of engaging with the NZ border agencies on matters relating to the regulation of the passage of goods in and out of New Zealand and relating to wider trade policy issues such as the development and implementation of Free Trade Agreements and the development of cargo security initiatives. CBAFF is a member of FIATA – the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations and the Federation of Asia Pacific Aircargo Associations and works closely with other associations representing similar groups to those CBAFF represents. This includes Australian Federation of International Forwarders and Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia with whom CBAFF has worked collaboratively. In undertaking these roles, CBAFF draws upon the expertise of its members and their long history of representing service providers in the supply chain and those importers and exporters in the supply chain. The membership of CBAFF comprises some 110 companies delivering supply chain services for international trade to New Zealand and overseas companies. Supply chain services include: government agency compliance, arranging and/or providing transportation – international and domestic, warehousing / storage, PUB-027 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 2  repairs / maintenance,  reverse logistics and  order fulfilment. Submission presented by Rosemarie Dawson Executive Director Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Inc P O Box 34-149 Birkenhead Auckland 0626 June 2018 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 3 SUBMISSION In regards to the discussion document published May 2018 entitled “GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system”. 1. The proposal is certainly to be commended for creating “fairness” when viewed in relation to the New Zealand retail market. 2. The process for administering the scheme will be somewhat challenging for the Freight and Express industries and in this respect the proposal is short on specific operational detail. The proposal is specific in relation to registration. 3. Para 3.3. To differentiate at the point of sale between goods value at under or over NZ$400 is adding an unnecessary level of complexity to this system Based on the “broad based” GST system Companies who are GST registered should collect GST on all sales regardless of the value of the goods. On arrival consignments over $400 in value would be stopped at the Border for a high value entry clearance subject to any applicable duty, GST on CIF value and Transaction fees less GST paid at point of sale. 4. Para 3.6. We support the change of “de minimus” from $60 duty value to goods value. Based on “goods value” will make it easier and simpler to explain than the present “de minimus” based on duty value. The level of “de minimus” on goods value should reflect that of our main trading partners. Our recommendation would be for a de minimus of NZ$1000. 5. Para 3.8. We support the valuation being that of the value of the goods. 6. Para 3.10. We support the broad based GST system with few exceptions. 7. Para 3.12-3.15. The supply of multiple low value goods is likely to create some headaches and an unnecessary level of complexity. If Point 3 above is adopted then no further action required. If point 3 is not adopted then the differentiation in value between sales under or over NZ$400 will created additional costs for overseas suppliers. 8. Para 3.17-3.19 Instances where multiple low value goods may have had GST applied at point of sale that should be subject to Border clearance should have provision at time of Border clearance for any point of sale GST to be offset against collection at the Border. This could be actioned by way of a credit claim in the Border clearance and supported by evidence of GST paid at point of sale. 9. Para 3.17. What appropriate evidence is likely to be acceptable? This potentially will bottleneck the flow of consignments through the Postal system and Express Couriers which would be counter-productive to the system designed to expedite the collection of GST. 10. Para 3.24 We question the rationale behind exempting supplies to GST registered business. Para 1.6 states that New Zealand’s GST system is a broad based consumption tax, based on the destination principle. This means that all goods and services should be subject to GST when they are consumed in New Zealand. Current trading within NZ business to business attracts GST with provision to claim inputs. For simplicity at the point of sale there should not be another layer of distinction relating to GST registered businesses. 11. If however there is to be a distinction between GST registered business’ then in relation to Para 3.24-3.25 concern is expressed around the business to business exclusion of GST based on the supply of a NZ business number. A NZ business number does not necessarily mean that the RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 4 business is registered for GST. We would suggest that supply of a GST registration number (para 3.25) is implicit upon the business as a declaration of their GST status. 12. Whilst creating “fairness” for the NZ retail market it implies “unfairness” in that it only applies to offshore suppliers who voluntarily choose to register. Suppliers who don’t register but supply items under the new de minimus of NZ$400 will provide a benefit to consumers given the new “de minimus” 13. At the Border there will be difficulty in distinguishing between items/suppliers where GST has been applied, items/suppliers who are not registered and therefore no GST collected, supplies to GST registered entities where no GST need be applied and GST on multiple value consignments where GST has and has not been applied in relation to the value of the goods. 14. Concern is expressed that the proposal is around the collection of GST (revenue) on low value goods but of equal or greater importance is the recognised pathway for biosecurity risk. 15. Concern is expressed in respect to liabilities for the Brokers involved where both Administrative Penalties and Infringement Notices (as per the new Customs and Excise Act commencing October 2018). 16. Concern is expressed around the resources needed to administer the proposal. Already both Customs and MPI resources are stretched to deal with normal commercial importations without the added volumes of administering low value consignment. As an industry we would be gravely concerned if the costs involved were then reflected over imports with neither Customs nor MPI benefiting from the Import Transaction Fee and Biosecurity System Entry Levy. ENDS RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2 If GST is to be collected, under the pretence that this levels the playing field for New Zealand retailers, then there are better, less risky ways to do this than to place the burden on overseas entities that have absolutely no reason to comply. Collection at the border for all parcels would still allow this tax revenue to be collected, and an online system for payment and release of parcels would easily mitigate the administrative costs involved. This is just one of many potential solutions. With experience in retail myself, I have seen local distributors decide that the New Zealand market is too small, with sales too low, to warrant dealing with it. Again, I stress that there is a huge risk that international retailers, with no obligation to go to the hassle and expense of collecting GST for the New Zealand government, might also decide that the country isn’t worth the hassle. Without a hint of humour or irony, I sincerely hope that you reconsider this approach, as I really do need clothes to wear. Kind regards and many thanks, s9(2)(a) s9(2)(a) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 GST on low-value imported goods C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 29 June 2018 GST on low-value imported goods: an offshore supplier registration system – A Government discussion document Dear Madam Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the GST on low-value imported goods: an offshore supplier registration system discussion document (the discussion document). We agree in principle with the proposals outlined in the discussion document. New Zealand’s GST system operates based on the destination principle, which charges GST on all goods and services supplied in/to and consumed in New Zealand. Measures that address the inconsistent imposition of GST between goods purchased locally, and goods purchased and imported from overseas, will strengthen New Zealand’s GST base. However, while the proposals may have merit from a pure policy perspective, the final design of the proposal will be critical in order to ensure the rules are workable for those affected and achieve the desired outcome in the most efficient way. We therefore strongly urge that officials seriously consider the compliance impact the proposals will have on those who are captured by the rules. Our submission provides feedback on topics as requested in the discussion document. We also note further areas that we consider requires official’s considerations. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise specified (the Act). Electronic Marketplaces Electronic marketplaces (EMs) are currently required to register and remit GST on the supply of remote services to a person resident in New Zealand. The discussion document proposes that the scope of this rule should be extended to incorporate the supply of low-value imported goods (low-value goods). In our view, a straight extension of the rule does not allow for the array of different business models that operate within the EM environment for low-value goods. The key point to note is that the business models between low-value goods and remote services can differ significantly, therefore it is possible that the existing EM model would impose entirely different challenges for those that operate an EM that contains low-value goods. In short, there is a spectrum of EMs and there may not be a “one size fits all” solution. PUB-029 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 For example, some EMs merely facilitate the interaction between suppliers and consumers - they do not process any payments or handle goods. EMs who operate in such fashion would be required to significantly adjust their business structure to comply with the proposed rules. The proposal should not impose unfair burdens on or generate excessive compliance costs for offshore businesses as officials pursue an efficient and administrable system. The United Kingdom uses a joint-and-several liability (JSL) approach to the collection of VAT on the supply of goods made within EMs. The JSL rules hold EMs liable for GST where the EM knew or should have known that the offshore supplier should have been GST-registered, but was not. In this approach, the EM plays an active role in policing the GST registration status of offshore suppliers within their marketplace without the need to substantially adjust their business model. Other features of the JSL approach in the UK includes the lack of a turnover threshold for registration, and the ability for an offshore supplier to appoint an agent or ‘tax representative’ to handle their UK VAT obligations. The JSL approach is an alternative to the current proposed EM model which could reduce the compliance burden on EM operators. We therefore submit that further consideration is given to the proposals concerning EMs. We note that the proposals around EMs should, at a minimum, include the ability for an EM to use a New Zealand agent to comply with their obligations. This would replicate the current rules that apply for remote services and can be a good alternative for EMs to manage their compliance costs. We understand that officials are currently reviewing various options in relation to EMs and PwC NZ will continue to liaise with officials on these options. We will also liaise with officials on the definition of “electronic marketplace”. Re-deliverers We understand and appreciate the need to include re-deliverers within the proposal. The exclusion of such businesses from the system could present the situation where consumers may opt to purchase goods via a re-deliverer in order to avoid paying New Zealand GST. However, as with EMs, it is important that the final design of the proposal take into account the business model of re-deliverers. A clear understanding of what information and knowledge re- deliverers have in terms of their customers and the goods they process is required to ensure the final design of the proposals can be incorporated easily into existing business processes. Australia’s “Reasonable Belief” Exception Under the Australian model, an offshore supplier who reasonably believes that the supply of low value goods, when combined together surpasses AU $1000, will be grouped and sent together, can shift the imposition of GST from the point of sale to the time at which the consignment arrives at the Australian border. This is referred to as the “reasonable belief” exception. Feedback has been sought as to whether the exception should be incorporated into New Zealand’s rules. We believe that this is an unnecessary measure that if introduced would increase compliance costs for offshore suppliers as well as create uncertainty for consumers. This is because consumers may get confused as to whether GST had been charged on goods at the time of supply. As such, on balance we do not support the introduction of a “reasonable belief” exception. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 However, it will be important that a simple process is available to the New Zealand consumer to demonstrate GST has been paid where a consignment is stopped at the border. This will go to the overall customer experience for the New Zealand consumer, therefore it is important that the process needs to be simple so that the process is not seen as an additional barrier to the purchase of goods. De Minimis Threshold – Definition and Value We welcome a change to the way in which the de minimis is defined. The current definition has historically caused a significant amount of confusion for consumers importing goods. Defining the de minimis in terms of the value of the goods themselves, rather than the dutiable component of the goods, will bring clarity and certainty to consumers and offshore suppliers as to the tax treatment of imported goods. In our view, the proposed $400 threshold value is appropriate at this stage and the threshold could be reviewed two-three years after the rules are introduced. This value complements the existing operation of processes conduct by Customs at the border, while collecting tax revenue currently foregone. Valuation Methodology The valuation methodology for determining whether GST is required to be charged on a supply of goods has been raised by officials as an area requiring further consideration. We agree that this is a critical concept. Any resulting valuation methodology should be easy for offshore suppliers to understand and comply with. The issue is exemplified by the sale of a low-value good with an associated cost (e.g. shipping charge) which causes the total amount paid by the consumer to be more than $400. For customs valuation purposes, associated costs (such as costs of shipping) are included in determining value. Therefore, there is some merit in using the same methodology to reduce complexity. Furthermore, by the time New Zealand initiates an offshore supplier registration system, offshore suppliers who supply low-value goods into Australia would have had 15 months of experience with the Australian model. This model requires the deduction of freight and insurance costs in determining if goods fall above or below the de minimis threshold. When goods fall below the threshold, GST is imposed on the full transaction amount – an amount inclusive of freight and insurance costs (i.e. a ‘customs value’ approach’). It would be most efficient for offshore suppliers if New Zealand were to follow the same approach as Australia. We note that in the discussion document, the value of the goods in the various examples generally include shipping costs. It would be useful to have the valuation methodology specifically clarified to ensure there is no confusion as to the value of the goods to which New Zealand GST applies to. Transitional measures We note that the transitional measures that were included within the remote services rules helped ensure a smooth transition into the new rules. For example, the six-month transitional period for the first return provided those affected with sufficient time to adjust their systems and processes in order to determine and comply with their GST obligations. We strongly submit that the transitional measures that applied for the remote services rules apply to low-value goods also.

BusinessNZ took the opportunity to submit on this issue in 2015 via the GST: Cross- Border Services, Intangibles and Goods discussion document. There we outlined our vie ws on a range of issues relating to the collection of GST on imported goods and services, including our conclusion that any changes should remain in line with New Zealand’s overall GST system, at present one of the cleanest in the world. BusinessNZ’s principled approach In principle, BusinessNZ supports the Government in charging GST on imported goods, as well as on digital products and other services. As with GST on goods and services domestically, GST on offshore purchases should be broad and consistent. However, we have always been conscious of the need to distinguish between such a requirement and the situation where the practical and compliance implications for those who collect the tax outweigh the revenue collected. Ultimately, what the Government should aim for is an enhanced GST system that best meets the needs of the three key interested parties, business, consumers and government. Any solution meeting the needs of only 1 or 2 of these groups will not provide a long-term policy answer and will inevitably lead to ongoing revisions that create further distortions and compliance issues. BusinessNZ believes the various moving parts need to be balanced. There is a fine line between ensuring GST collected from offshore purchases meets general compliance requirements and minimises tax base erosion and ensuring the collection requirement does not, at the same time, create unintended consequences that effectively damage JacksonStone House 3- 11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT New Zealand’s economic base. One way to make certain these objectives are met is by avoiding extreme measures and instead taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach. Getting offshore companies on board Chasing the ‘last dollar’ will invariably lead to increased compliance and transaction costs, which could fall heavily on offshore suppliers exporting items to New Zealand. For some, the increased costs will simply mean New Zealand becomes a ‘no-go zone’, preventing both New Zealand consumers and businesses from purchasing items they want. And New Zealand businesses could experience reciprocal problems when looking to export their own goods if this country is perceived as one where transacting goods across borders is difficult. We strongly agree it is important to create a level playing field to enable New Zealand businesses to compete with offshore suppliers. However, from a broader perspective we would not want the Government to think the review will provide a panacea for all competitiveness woes. Acknowledging New Zealand’s place in the world In a global context, New Zealand is a very small market, whether measured using variables such as total GDP or the value of imports and exports. We are also a distant market and therefore have become a country whose efforts to reduce trade barriers have provided at least a comparative advantage over countries and regions with far larger economic clout but with trade barriers in place. When looking to create a better balance between the obligations of domestic and offshore suppliers, the Government should not make GST policy changes that lead those suppliers to view New Zealand as somewhere to be avoided from a terms of trade point of view - possibly due to significant compliance procedures associated with the export of goods or services. Overly complicated and onerous GST measures might more negatively a ffect New Zealand, compared with similar arrangements offshore, simply, as a small market in the global economy, because of existing impediments. Simplicity of capturing at source In our 2015 submission, BusinessNZ favoured the option of identifying those enterprises which deal with the bulk of sales to New Zealand, requesting they collect GST on behalf of the New Zealand Government. We believed identifying the main players would be relatively easy and it would not take a sizeable number of enterprises to ensure the greatest amount of revenue was collected. Therefore, we are pleased to see that of the three options considered in the current discussion document, the Government has decided to proceed with the ‘at the point of sale’ option, whereby suppliers would be required to register for, collect and return GST (“offshore supplier registration”). Overall, we believe the offshore supplier registration option is the best way forward, and should be introduced. Primary Recommendation: In principle, the offshore supplier registration system should proceed. 2 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT But notwithstanding our primary recommendation that of the options considered, the offshore supplier registration system should proceed, we also wish to take the opportunity to outline a recent concern that has arisen across the Tasman. The Government needs to be cognisant of this problem when developing the GST policy further. Mindful of learning from offshore experiences In relation to the point raised above regarding getting offshore companies on board, paragraph 4.4 in the discussion document points out that “For some suppliers, the compliance costs of registering and returning GST may outweigh the revenue collected in supplying low-value goods to New Zealand customers. As far as possible any new rules should be designed in a way that does not pose a barrier to trade with New Zealand as this could reduce market competition and consumer choice”. BusinessNZ agrees. In fact, we do not have to look far abroad to see the current state of play in Australia, given the country is going through its own major review of the GST issue. BusinessNZ agrees the best way forward is to require offshore suppliers to register, collect and return GST on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers where the value of the goods is $400 or less. However, recent developments in Australia show this change process as not perhaps as straightforward as first believed. As paragraph 2.21 of the discussion document points out, the Australian Parliament has enacted similar legislation to that proposed for New Zealand, namely that offshore suppliers of goods register for GST in Australia and collect and return GST on goods supplied to Australian consumers valued at or below AU$1000. Suppliers must do this if the total supplied to Australia exceeds the AU$75,000 threshold for GST registration. The requirement comes into force on 1 July 2018. However, in late May, Amazon announced that from 1 July it would block Australians from buying from its international e-commerce websites and restrict them to a smaller local platform. While other significant offshore suppliers such as Ebay and Alibaba have confirmed post the Amazon announcement that they would not be blocking Australian users, the fact that one of the largest suppliers of goods in the world has taken this step means there is nothing to stop other major suppliers following a similar path, especially if the challenge of implementing the tax is greater than the size of the market supplied. Given the New Zealand population is roughly 20 percent the size of Australia’s, our pulling power as a market puts us in an even more delicate position. At the very least, BusinessNZ believes there are two steps IRD needs to take before looking to implement an offshore supplier registration system. First, it needs to assess exactly where Australia sits in relation to the collecting and remitting of GST in terms of major international suppliers other than Amazon. We do not consider lack of agreement from a few offshore suppliers should prevent this new regime from proceeding. However, if some of the largest suppliers to the New Zealand market are blocking customers, then the trade-off between the three interested parties discussed above comes into play, as the benefit of revenue collection may be superseded by loss of consumer choice due to an adverse offshore business reaction. Second, with regard to the above, we note, on page 5, that what is proposed would apply from 1 October 2019.

We have also had the benefit of discussing the proposal with officials to feed in our thoughts at a concept stage and appreciate the time and effort made by officials to engage with us. Overall we believe the proposals are sensible, timely and appropriate. A fundamental principle of GST is that it should tax the consumer at the place of consumption, in the simplest and easiest way possible. A summary of our submissions is set out at the end of this document and our detailed submissions are in chapters 3, 4 and 5. In our view the proposed rules should be seen as an interim step to an eventual technological solution. We assume that, in time, technology will have advanced sufficiently for Governments to receive information about the nature and value of goods in a timely manner and to be able to deal with the tax aspects in an easy and low cost way. We urge officials to continue to investigate and develop technology solutions that will reduce compliance costs for businesses, Government and consumers. In addition, we strongly believe that the proposals point to the need for a publicly searchable register of New Zealand businesses and their GST status. This would provide independent comfort to offshore suppliers looking for reassurance that their customer is GST registered. A searchable register would also be invaluable to New Zealand businesses and to Customs for compliance checks. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) provides a searchable register for the NZBN, but this register does not include GST registration status. In our view, that register should include GST registration status, or a separate register should be introduced by Inland Revenue that provides information on a business’s GST registration.

We have also had the benefit of discussing the proposal with officials at a concept stage and appreciate the time and effort made by officials to engage with us. Overall we support the proposal to introduce the measures outlined in the Discussion Document as an interim measure. We assume that, in time, technology will have advanced sufficiently for governments to receive information about the nature and value of goods in a timely manner and be able to deal with the tax aspects in a simple and low cost manner, as well as provide a more comprehensive collection of the consumption tax. The Tax Working Group’s conclusion was that these proposals should proceed because practical concerns meant that the alternative options (either taxing between the point of sale and delivery, or after delivery) were not feasible in the short term. Governments should continue to investigate advances in technology so that when the practical concerns of the alternative collection options have been addressed then Government can introduce the alternatives. The “expanded vendor” registration model is not a perfect solution. The model will result in some goods not being subject to GST – such as when the goods have a value of less than $400 and the vendor is not GST registered (even if they should be). Thus, the proposals still leave a significant hole in the collection of GST on imported goods. Notwithstanding the above, in our view, the “expanded vendor” collection model currently has the greatest potential to provide an efficient and effective solution to the issue of taxation of low-value imported goods. We support the proposal as an interim step for a vendor model that also leverages the scale, aggregating and centralising power of electronic distribution platforms and intermediaries in the supply chain where appropriate. We acknowledge that expansion to include further entities will include some complexity and we discuss this further in chapter 3 of our submission. The measures proposed will have the effect of aligning the rules for goods with the rules for services, already introduced. (Although we note that this is not the case if the goods are consumer-to-consumer supplies). Moreover, the proposed measures are very similar to those introduced in Australia and are also broadly similar to the model used in the EU. This will promote ease of business for multinationals who are looking to register in many countries at once. The Australian rules have only just come into effect and New Zealand should be looking to Australia to see where their measures have been effective and where we should look to modify our proposals to deal with issues encountered. The similarity with overseas jurisdictions will also be invaluable as technology develops further and a wider range of measures become available to collect tax on cross-border sales of goods. We believe the measures outlined in the Discussion Document will eventually be superseded by a technology solution, likely involving international co-operation. Therefore, it is imperative that New Zealand develop a new regime that takes international norms into account as much as is RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

We believe that the proposals as outlined strike an appropriate balance between these two considerations.

It is consistent with GST policy to continue to treat fine metal as exempt from GST and thus not subject to the proposed rules, although we agree with the comments in the Discussion Document that it is unlikely that many will seek to import fine metal with a value below the threshold of $400. In addition, we agree with the proposal to exclude alcohol and tobacco products from the proposed rules. These products have their own regime and are subject to additional taxes for public health reasons. It would not be sensible to include these products within what is intended to be a simplified regime. In addition, we note that this is in line with the rules in Australia. Supplies of multiple low-value goods We agree with the proposal to treat a consignment of goods that is above the threshold as being subject to the current rules and taxed at the border. This rule is consistent with current practice and is sensible where the supplier is aware of the total value of the goods supplied. In addition this approach is consistent with the rules to be implemented in Australia. Preventing double taxation We agree that double taxation needs to be prevented. However, significant work needs to be done to ensure that an efficient process is applied. The current proposal is to allow a consumer to contact Customs with evidence that GST has already been paid on the goods. Officials will need to give thought to how to make this process as streamlined as possible. The proposal in the Discussion Document sounds time consuming and bureaucratic. One suggestion would be to include a prior notification procedure. The vendor could notify Customs that they are sending goods where GST has already been charged. Customs needs to develop trusted vendor or documentation protocols which allow easy Customs clearance so that the focus is on audit activity rather than clearance at the border. Another option would be to allow consumers to notify Customs prior to their goods coming into the country that they are expecting a shipment of goods with GST paid. This procedure would also allow Customs to check when the goods arrive and allow the consumer to receive goods in a timely manner.

Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 11 Ultimately we expect that a technology solution is needed but understand that this may not be possible in the short-to-medium term. Therefore, we recommend that officials consider one of the options above. “Reasonable belief” exemption The Discussion Document asks for feedback on whether New Zealand should adopt Australia’s “reasonable belief” exception. The exception “means that if the supplier reasonably believes that the multiple goods will be grouped together and shipped in one consignment, GST can be charged at the border instead of by the offshore supplier” (paragraph 3.20). Feedback from our members in public practice suggests that this would be useful for their clients. Option to tax If a “reasonable belief” exemption is not adopted, it would be of use to offshore suppliers to have an “option to tax” – that is, if the supplier is not sure whether the goods will be shipped in one consignment or not, they could have an option to charge GST. If it is subsequently discovered that the goods are shipped in a larger consignment and GST is charged at the border, the consumer could use the process proposed at paragraph 3.17 to prevent double taxation. Returns and refunds We support the proposal in paragraph 3.23 of the Discussion Document. The proposed rule is that, when an offshore supplier issues a refund, they would be able to adjust their output tax in a subsequent GST return. There would be a time limit for the adjustment based on the input tax rules. This rule is necessary as most offshore suppliers will be using simplified (pay-only) GST returns and are not able to claim input tax credits. Supplies to consumers and GST-registered businesses We support the proposal to include only supplies to consumers within the scope of the new rules. We also support the proposal to allow an offshore supplier to zero rate the supply to a New Zealand registered person. We discuss both of these in more detail below. Identification of New Zealand consumers It is proposed that a supply will be treated as being made to a New Zealand consumer if there is a New Zealand delivery address. This is appropriate as it is highly likely that the consumption of RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 12 the goods will be in New Zealand. In addition, this is a straightforward test and thus has low compliance costs for suppliers. Supplies to businesses excluded We support the proposal to exclude supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. There is currently no revenue leakage provided the business is fully taxable and therefore we do not believe that there is a need to include these supplies within the scope of the regime. There will be an increase in compliance costs for some overseas suppliers, who will need processes in place to identify business suppliers. However, the exclusion of supplies to GST registered recipients from the rules places an incentive on the recipient to inform the supplier of their registration status. This is because, if the business is inadvertently charged GST, the New Zealand business will need to obtain a Tax Invoice from the supplier. The Tax Invoice will need to comply with the requirements in section 24 of the GST Act. Obtaining a Tax Invoice is likely to be difficult and the process time consuming. It will be simpler for the New Zealand business recipient to simply supply its IRD number to the overseas vendor. This incentive to provide an IRD number increases the likelihood that the GST charge is accurate. The introduction of these proposals should also give Government an opportunity to review the requirements in section 24 and consider whether the advances in technology mean that certain fields are no longer necessary. In addition, we suggest that the threshold for the simplified tax invoice be raised. We agree with the comments in the Discussion Document that the proposed exclusion may mean some offshore suppliers are outside the regime entirely (i.e. those which supply only to GST registered businesses), which we agree is desirable. Rules for identifying business-to-business supplies We agree with the proposed rules for identifying business-to-business suppliers. In particular, we support the proposal to allow the recipient to use the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN). The MBIE website has a searchable register which allows anyone to confirm independently that the NZBN is correct. Officials should consider extending the publication function. It is our view that Government should provide a searchable register that shows a business’s name, GST registration status and IRD number (if GST registered). If there are concerns with making a registered person’s IRD number publicly available, Government should consider using the NZBN for GST purposes. Our members have a strong desire for an independent process that would enable them to verify another business’s GST registration status. This function is available in Australia and generally works well. The argument is even stronger for offshore suppliers. Offshore businesses that RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 13 supply goods and services online will generally have less direct interaction with their customers compared to those who sell domestically. In the case of suspected fraud, it would be most helpful if the supplier could search a register to check if a business was legitimate and was in fact GST registered. Ability to zero-rate business-to-business supplies We support the proposal to allow an offshore supplier to zero rate the supply to a New Zealand registered person. It will allow an offshore supplier to claim input tax if they have incurred costs in New Zealand which were subject to GST. Allowing an option to zero rate is also consistent with the rules in section 8 of the GST Act, which essentially allow an overseas supplier making supplies to New Zealand GST registered recipients to opt into New Zealand’s registration system. The proposed rule is also consistent with the rule for offshore suppliers of services. Reverse charge for GST registered businesses We agree with the proposal to require a New Zealand registered recipient to return GST where the goods will also be used for exempt or private purposes. We question whether this should be more accurately characterised as a change of use adjustment. We assume that a change of use adjustment would be more accurate and more similar to domestic purchases. We still see a place for a reverse charge where the goods will be used wholly for non-taxable purposes and the purchaser has incorrectly provided an IRD number and is not actually GST registered, or has incorrectly claimed that the goods will be used fo r business purposes. New Zealand businesses being inadvertently charged GST The easiest and most painless way for a New Zealand business to recover inadvertently charged GST is to claim the GST as input tax in its next GST return. The proposal in the Discussion Document is to allow a New Zealand business to claim the GST in its return, provided the recipient is able to obtain a full Tax Invoice from the supplier. We believe this is a good intermediate step between allowing an input tax claim (low compliance cost) and requiring the business to obtain a refund from the supplier (generally higher in compliance cost). We recognise that officials will see a possible revenue risk in allowing an input claim without evidence that the supplier has paid the corresponding output tax and thus we support the proposals as drafted.

We strongly support the proposal to remove the tariffs and cost recovery charges on low-value goods for the reasons outlined in paragraph 3.46 of the Discussion Document.

This will be easily understood because New Zealand currently has a registration threshold of $60,000. We believe having a common registration threshold that is easily understood will make it more likely that offshore suppliers will comply. Moreover, there has been comment in the New Zealand media about the role of the proposals in “levelling the playing field” for New Zealand retailers. Requiring the same dollar value registration threshold will enhance the credibility of the proposals as establishing a level playing field. In reality, the threshold applies only to supplies made to consumers in New Zealand, whereas a domestic supplier must take into account total worldwide supplies, to both businesses and consumers, so domestic and offshore suppliers do not in fact have the same registration threshold. Nevertheless we agree that the New Zealand Government should be careful not to impose a barrier to trade and thus should not look to impose a compliance burden on an offshore supplier unless it will result in a revenue benefit. We note that where a non-resident vendor exceeds the $60,000 threshold it is unlikely that they will automatically register for GST in New Zealand. Rather, it is likely that only those vendors who have material supplies of goods into New Zealand will register. This is an inherent issue with the vendor registration model. While it is addressed partly by the proposed “marketplace” rules, they do not provide a full solution, hence our comments above that these proposals should be seen as only an interim step. Special rules for marketplaces and re-deliverers Marketplaces The Discussion Document proposes that a marketplace be required to register when:  customers would normally consider the marketplace to be the supplier; and  this is reflected in the contractual arrangements. Paragraph 4.10 of the Discussion Document suggests three criteria for determining when the marketplace be required to register (i.e. when the two criteria above are met). They are when the marketplace:  authorises the charge to the customer;  authorises deliver of the goods to the customer; or  sets any of the terms and conditions of the transaction. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 17 These criteria are very similar to those in the Australian rules. By way of background, many popular New Zealand sites are more akin to online classifieds. Australian officials consider online classifieds to be outside the scope of the “marketplace” rules and we agree with this treatment. One of New Zealand’s most popular e-commerce sites is a listing platform, allowing vendors to advertise and sell their goods. Offshore vendors may also use the platform to list their goods. Goods purchased on the platform are not purchased from the platform itself, or from a related company. The platform supplies the vendor with the means to list the goods and charges a listing fee (either before or after sale). The platform is similar to a mall operator such as Westfield, in that it provides a shop front for retailers and charges a fee to the retailers, but is not responsible for, or involved in, the sales to the consumers. Taking this example, we assume that these platforms would qualify as online classifieds and would not meet the definition of a “marketplace”. At the other end of the spectrum are sites such which allow consumers to purchase through a range of channels. They supply goods directly to New Zealand consumers but also hosts other suppliers on its website. The other suppliers also sell the goods directly to consumers. Some of the other suppliers are part of the same group of companies. Others are independent retailers. Taking this example, we assume that such a overseas platform would qualify as a “marketplace”. The definition will need to make clear for which supplies:  The offshore platform is the seller in its own right;  The offshore platform must return GST as a “marketplace”; and  The offshore platform does not need to return GST because the seller is registered separately for New Zealand GST and is required to charge New Zealand GST on the sale. A practical concern is that it is not always clear to consumers whether they are making a payment to the platform or the underlying supplier. Therefore, in our view, the criteria should not require customer knowledge of the contractual arrangements. We understand that the criteria in paragraph 4.10 are very similar to those used in Australia. However, from discussions with our members it would seem that the Australian rules do not always allow the parties to distinguish between each of the scenarios easily. One example is the criterion relating to authorisation of payment. We understand that some suppliers of online classifieds provide a service whereby the platform may hold the payment until the goods are received. This service provides protection for supplier and recipient. However, we do not believe that offering this service makes the platform the supplier. Accordingly, in that situation, the platform should not be required to remit the GST on the goods supplied. We request specific clarification on this point and to have further consultation if a different view is proposed. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 18 The Discussion Document states (at paragraph 4.12) that underlying suppliers would still be required to register for supplies made to New Zealand residents not connected with the marketplace. A key question is whether the overseas supplier would need to take into account supplies made through the marketplace or whether the registration requirement would exist only where the supplies made outside the marketplace exceed the registration threshold. We assume that supplies through a marketplace are excluded when determining whether the threshold is met for direct supplies but believe this must be specifically clarified. In addition, it will be crucial to know when a supply is considered to be “through the marketplace” and when it is not. The Discussion Document states (paragraph 4.13) that “the compliance costs for these smaller suppliers fall away when the requirement to register and return GST is shifted to the marketplace”. We would like to know whether Government has evidence of this. The marketplace rules remove registration, GST return and payment from the supplier. However, there will be other compliance costs between the marketplace and the supplier (e.g. complex reimbursement arrangements) which would mean that the overall compliance costs for the supplier have not reduced overall. Re-deliverers We agree that it is sensible to require a re-deliverer to register for and charge New Zealand GST where the original supplier has no knowledge that the goods are to be shipped to New Zealand. We understand that most re-deliverers require the consumer to provide information about the type and value of the goods to be shipped. We assume that re-deliverers will be able to alter their systems to charge GST to the consumer in addition to their current costs. However, we recommend that officials check with re-deliverers to ensure that this is workable. (We note that the inclusion of re-deliverers in the model means that there is a consumer GST model being applied – although aggregated to a re-deliverer – and wonder whether this suggests that a consumer model is achievable). We support the proposal that freight forwarders and courier companies, who are simply carrying out a delivery function, not be caught by the rules for re-deliverers. However, the rules will need to provide a clear distinction between a re-deliverer as described in the proposals, and a simple freight forwarder. Moreover, the rules should provide a distinction between a re-deliverer and a finance-type company such as lay-buy or afterpay. We understand that these companies may pay the merchant directly for the goods and arrange for the merchant to ship the goods to New Zealand. Thus the payment company would meet the second of the criteria listed at paragraph 4.19 because it is purchasing the goods on behalf of the consumer. In our view, it would be more logical for the retailer to return the GST in that situation rather than the payment company. We assume from the comments in paragraph 4.11 of the Discussion RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 19 Document that officials are aware of this issue and intend that the rules will be drafted so that it is the retailer who accounts for GST rather than the payment company. We mention the issue here because there is a risk that a payment company could fall out of the “marketplace” rules yet be required to account for GST as a “re-deliverer” and we do not believe this would be a desirable result. Simplified registration system We agree with the proposal to allow overseas suppliers of goods to use the simplified registration system already in place. We understand from our members that this system is working well (although we note that our members have said that their clients generally find the New Zealand GST registration process to be straightforward by comparison with other countries). Consequence for non-residents registered to claim input tax At present, non-residents are able to claim New Zealand GST input tax on costs incurred in making their overseas supplies. However, a condition of a non-resident being able to claim GST for their overseas supplies is that the non-resident does not make taxable supplies in New Zealand. If these non-residents are subject to the non-resident supplier rules, the GST refund rules would need to be modified to allow GST to be claimed for expenses relating to their overseas supplies. Filing periods We strongly support the proposal to allow offshore suppliers to file quarterly returns. This is consistent with the EU filing requirements. Thus it will reduce compliance costs for large international organisations who file indirect tax returns across the world.

Measures to bolster compliance We strongly support the proposal to explore joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions in the future. In particular, we believe that a joint GST registration system with Australia would likely result in additional Government revenue from businesses that would not otherwise be required to register. The first steps will be to investigate technology that will allow this. Officials should continue to investigate ways in which this could occur including the technology used in other jurisdictions. Penalties for false representations by consumers We believe it is appropriate to extend existing penalties and interest rules to offshore suppliers. The Discussion Document proposes to require a person to register and pay the GST that should have been returned where as a consumer they have made false representations that they are in business to evade the GST impost. The Discussion Document gives very little detail on this proposal except to say that it would apply in exceptional cases. The spirit of the rule sounds sensible. However, the detail will be important. Without further information we are unable to provide additional comment.

Our key messages Trade Me supports: A fair regime for the collection of GST on low value imported goods. Further consideration of an extended status quo model of collection. In the event a supplier registration model is adopted, New Zealand taking a slightly different approach to Australia by adjusting some key settings to ensure a more workable regime. In particular, we support: oThe electronic marketplace (“EMP”) definition not applying to onshore marketplaces. oSpecial provisions for ‘approved marketplaces’ that are offshore. oThe Commissioner having a discretion to allow partial compliance of offshore suppliers and marketplaces. oA more simplified regime, with fewer exceptions, to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers and marketplaces and address double taxation risks. We believe these changes will help to reduce offshore supplier and EMP compliance costs. This is important as otherwise there is a material risk that suppliers and EMPs will cease supplying services to New Zealand residents, and consumers will be adversely affected. We have set out separately below our submissions in respect of the key issues discussed in the Government Discussion Paper and Additional Memo. When developing our submission, we have adopted the following principles. Over the past 19 years of operating online, we’ve found that laws work best when they are: straightforward and easy for consumers to understand and apply; RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 only apply to marketplaces operated by non-resident persons. However, as noted above, we recommend that a new provision be included that requires any such onshore marketplaces to provide information about each offshore supplier’s aggregated supplies to New Zealand to the IRD. This would better enable the IRD to enforce the GST requirements against suppliers who supply over $60,000 per year. Main policy justifications for treating the EMP operator as the supplier for low value goods for GST purposes: Minimisation of compliance costs Higher rates of compliance There is a spectrum of EMPs, some more akin to classified advertisements, to those that sell their own goods and have a great amount of control over third-party sales. There will be a point along this spectrum where the costs of compliance to the EMP operator are disproportionate to the revenue collected or to the compliance cost savings to underlying vendors trading through its platform. The EMP is deemed to be the supplier unless all of the following conditions are met: the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed that the supplier is liable for the payment of the GST; and the marketplace does not authorise either the charge or the delivery to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. We agree that there is a spectrum of online marketplace types, with differing levels of involvement in the sale of goods and services. Most marketplaces set some terms and conditions for the transaction in order to create a safe and trusted marketplace. As a result, we believe, the scope of the regime is potentially broader than perceived. If the definition is not carefully set, New Zealand risks creating a new set of distortions in the market. For example, consider the structure of a traditional taxi co-operative in New Zealand against the structure of the Uber ride-sharing service. Uber has structured their operations in such a manner that each driver who operates via the platform separately contracts with the customer. As a result, the applicable GST threshold is considered for each driver, and not for Uber at an organisational level. The outcome of this is that there is a significant portion of ride-sharing activity (and associated transactions) on which GST is not being collected. We believe that if any definition of “marketplace” is not sufficiently thoughtful and well-constructed, this could result in a shift in the manner in which online shopping and services are structured. For example, if social media platforms are not captured by the definition but bespoke marketplaces are, this would provide a social media platform with a 15% competitive advantage on price, which would distort activity across different business models. In addition, we are concerned that by creating a GST collection environment which gives a 15% benefit to less structured platforms, this may reduce the level of protection afforded to New Zealand consumers. For example, if we considered the EMP definition in respect of a marketplace with operations similar to Trade Me: ensure that the documentation identifies the supplier as making the supply: Trade Me already does this, and requires the supplier to comply with product safety, intellectual property and other legal obligations. ensure that the supplier is liable for the payment of GST: Trade Me already requires that all auctions must include GST and all tax obligations are the responsibility of the seller and/or the buyer (as the parties determine). The “or the buyer” phrase is particularly applicable for high value imported goods. change its terms such that the marketplace does not authorise the change or the deliver to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made: Trade Me already does not authorise the charge or the delivery. We often do not even see the charge. For example, Australian based sellers listing on our site can register an NZ bank account and we allow them to receive payment into that bank account, with them arranging and RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 authorising delivery once they’ve confirmed payment is received. As a result, the only thing that a marketplace structured in a similar manner to Trade Me would need to do to avoid being the deemed supplier would be to change its terms and conditions such that the marketplace doesn’t set any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. We think this creates adverse consequences. Currently, almost all marketplaces set some general terms and conditions that apply to sellers using their marketplaces, and the supplier sets the specific terms relating to a trade (e.g. shipping timeframe, returns policies etc). As a result there is a hybrid arrangement. However, the terms that Trade Me sets are focused on ensuring trust and safety, and ensuring appropriate consumer protections apply in our New Zealand environment – i.e. terms to ensure that members have trust in our site and products sold on our site are safe. We think it would not be desirable for marketplaces to be incentivised not to set such terms in order to avoid GST liability. We agree there is a spectrum of marketplaces. We have compared on the following page ASOS, Amazon, eBay, Trade Me and Facebook. If the policy settings favour using online marketplaces or suppliers to collect GST, we support either: all marketplace platforms, including social media being captured by the relevant definitions (i.e. all the examples above); or only those marketplace platforms that behave like a supplier (i.e. in the table below ASOS and Amazon being captured). From a practical perspective, we acknowledge that if a particularly broad definition is used then it will be harder for some social media platforms to comply with the requirements. This is why we support (see below) the Commissioner having a discretion to allow aspects of non-compliance where marketplaces have a compelling case not to comply with the requirements. Accordingly, we recommend a broader definition of EMP with and an ability for EMPs to be able to apply to the Commissioner to gain exemption from certain requirements. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2 Background The Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers Limited (“CAPEC New Zealand”) is an industry association representing the interests of the world’s leading integrated air express parcel delivery companies. Its members are DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS. CAPEC New Zealand Members provide daily services of time sensitive shipments to thousands of businesses of all sizes in all sectors of the New Zealand economy, as well as to the many individual consumers whose choices have been widened as a result the development of ecommerce. As a group of carriers we represent a large portion of the ECI pathway. An efficient flow of goods is crucial to our local economy and for maintaining and growing New Zealand’s international competitiveness. CAPEC New Zealand is not belligerently opposed to changes in lowering the threshold for duties and taxes. CAPEC New Zealand has consistently held the view that any changes to the collection of taxes for low value goods should be underpinned by the following Guiding Principles: •Effective and efficient collection of revenue; •Competitive neutrality (between air cargo and post); •Consistent application of border clearance and taxation arrangements; •Recognition of CAPEC New Zealand’s unique and essential role as a provider of time definite delivery services. •Ongoing and meaningful consultation with Government Executive Summary CAPEC New Zealand has reviewed the GST on low-value imported goods – an offshore supplier registration system publication by the Inland Revenue, along with the Explanatory Material and Q&A, released in June 2018. It should be noted that New Zealand Customs and the New Zealand Government has engaged closely with CAPEC New Zealand Members as part of the consultation process for the last 3 years. This engagement has proven to be invaluable in terms of clarifying policy intent and reviewing the practicality of various processes and procedures. CAPEC New Zealand greatly appreciates being consulted on such important policy reform. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 CAPEC New Zealand believes that the only equitable, timely and cost effective m ethodology to collect GST from Low Value Goods is through collecting the GST for goods valued at under $400 directly at point of sale at origin. This methodology can be implemented without the need to delay the movement of goods through the Border and will assist in Facilitation of Trade. We understand the position taken by Government on the current inequities of GST collection between low value on shore and off shore purchases. We also believe that the consumer should be able to access the benefits of a truly global market place. With this in mind we firmly hold the position that the collection of tax must be done in a way that the cost of collection does not outweigh the amount collected and done with minimal disruption. Furthermore the consumer should not have to take on additional collection costs over and above that of the tax itself. Based on the above CAPEC New Zealand strongly supports the offshore collection of GST and endorses the model and approach that Australia has taken. CAPEC New Zealand would like representation and consultation in relation to any potential changes to the LVG threshold and any changes to the current collection at the border for tax & duty. Notwithstanding this stakeholder engagement, there remain several key areas of focus for CAPEC New Zealand Members have concerns with the offshore collection model. These can be summarized as follows:- • Double Taxation • Valuation • Issue of Combined Entries • Refund of Undue Payments • Reconciliation • Vendor Compliance/Enforcement • Currency (Exchange rate) Double Taxation CAPEC New Zealand believes that double taxation will be common if duties are calculated at invoice item/line level and strongly suggests taxation at a total invoice level per transaction. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 CAPEC New Zealand is concerned that consignments valued above $400 c ontaining multiple goods, some or all of which are valued at or below $400, will have a common occurrence of double taxation. When the goods valued above $400 enter New Zealand, they will undergo a formal customs clearance and will be subject to import transaction fee, duties and GST. CAPEC New Zealand supports the reasonable belief test for vendors to apply. This allows the vendor to not collect GST on a low-value imported good if they have a reasonable belief that the good will be sent in a consignment valued above the low-value threshold. Valuation CAPEC NEW ZEALAND believes the Customs value of the goods should be based on CIF by the vendor. This is because GST is currently collected by NZ Customs for goods over $400 based on CIF. If the vendor collected GST where the valuation of the goods is based on the Customs value, the occurrence of double taxation will be more likely(see below) Example of Double Taxation: Customs Value based on Cost of Goods (NZD) IPAD Cost 380 Total GST Charged by Vendor: 57 (If the vendor only charges GST on the value of goods and doesn’t include the freight component when it reaches New Zealand, the freight component will push it over threshold). When the Goods enter NZ they will undergo a customs entry and the below charges will apply: Total GST Charged by NZC 63.00 Import Transaction Fee 52.67 Total Charges 115.67 Therefore it is important that the mechanism to collect GST is based on CIF when collecting GST using the vendor collect model. This will therefore match the way GST is assessed at the border for goods over $400. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 Is sue of Combined Entries New Zealand Customs currently combine entries for multiple shipments for same importer but different suppliers. Ex ample: Consumer buys a shirt from Vendor A worth NZ$300 and shoes from Vendor B worth NZ$200. Because the value is worth less than $400 for both Vendor A and B, the offshore vendors charge GST at the point of sale. New Zealand Customs requires the shipments to undergo combined entry when they enter New Zealand. These goods will then be subject to duties, GST and entry charges. Therefore double taxation will occur. CAPEC New Zealand believes that all entries into New Zealand for goods under current threshold should be exempt from combined entries if they are from different suppliers. This will reduce the amount of potential double taxation. Refund of Undue Payments Wh en both New Zealand Customs and the Vendor have charged GST a process will be needed to relieve the double taxation by refunding the consumer for the extra revenue they have paid. There are three main ways in which this could occur:- • Customs could refund the GST they have collected without the need to cancel and or adjust the original entry. • The vendor could refund the GST they have collected. • The consumer could request a refund of GST through an IRD refund claim process similar to how businesses currently claim GST refunds. Car riers and New Zealand Customs do not have the resources to handle the additional work associated with entry adjustments and refunds where GST has been collected by the vendor and at the border. Preferred option would be the consumer would approach the vendor for a refund. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 Reconciliation What mechanisms will be in place for reconciliation of paid consignments? Vendor Compliance / Enforcement CAPEC New Zealand strongly suggests that any non compliance/enforcement will not be the responsibility of the Members. Currency (Exchange Rate) The Customs value, or the value for duty of imported goods, is used to calculate the Customs duty. When the invoiced amount is not in New Zealand dollars, it will be converted at the rate in force on the day your entry is presented to us. Exchange rates used by us are set for a two-week period, and are published 11 days in advance. These rates may differ slightly from the currency rates published by overseas trading banks. The Members strongly recommend review for consistency. Summary The vendor collect model is acknowledged by CAPEC New Zealand’s the best approach and commends Inland Revenue’s decision to avoid the receiver collect model. Our belief is that the Inland Revenue wants to gain maximum clarity on the effectiveness of the vendor collect model without adding increased cost and regulatory burden to the express industry. We believe that the model proposed, whilst avoiding tax collection at the border, creates a new set of challenges which need to be considered during the process design. We encourage Inland Revenue to review the proposed design for collecting GST offshore and ensure that is effective and efficient for the express industry, provides meaningful data to the regulators and improves the GST revenue for the Crown. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 CAPEC New Zealand looks forward to receiving a response from Inland Revenue fo r consideration prior to the Draft proceeding to Parliament. Further industry consultation is critical in ensuring this policy reform leads to a more efficient and effective process. In this regard, CAPEC New Zealand Members would again extend an invitation to Inland Revenue officials to visit our facilities to gain a better understanding of the international air express environment and we would like to be involved in any workshops/working groups when it comes to industry input and feedback for the design of the proposed offshore GST collection model. Yours sincerely Dianella Ngakuru, Country Manager – Federal Express (Chairman) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1 | Page Submission to the Inland Revenue Department on GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system discussion document 3 July 2018 PUB-037 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2 | Page Overview This document is a submission on the proposed imposition of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Low Value Goods (LVGs) sold to and imported by New Zealand buyers (Proposed Measures) using electronic distribution platforms (EDPs) by an industry group comprising Alibaba Group’s AliExpress, eBay and Etsy, which are third party online marketplaces (3P). Applying the same tax burden to remote, often small, retailers is unfair and potentially at risk of being reciprocated by other Governments on NZ small businesses operating online. The current proposal will result in high rates of non-compliance and thus not achieve the desired revenue increases for the Government of New Zealand, will disadvantage customers on 3P platforms, and will not achieve the Government’s objective of levelling the playing field for New Zealand retailers. We also recommend the establishment of an IRD-led industry working group (including marketplaces, logistics providers, payments systems and retailers) on this matter and a review of any model twelve months after any legislation is passed. Equally NZ should take stock of Europe’s timeline on this matter and align with those global timelines. The extraterritorial imposition of GST is contrary to good tax policy and has the following technical complications: 1. Reduced revenue of $40-65 million per annum – and rising The Government’s own estimates assume that two-thirds of online purchases will be captured by the proposed model. The Australian Treasury, when proposing a similar model in 2017, assumed a compliance rate of just 25%. Based on a similar compliance rate in New Zealand, the actual revenue raised by this tax would be $40-65 million per annum less than is projected, with the shortfall rising by about 10% annually as the volume of online trade increases. The proposed model will result in significantly reduced revenue to be reinvested into essential services for New Zealanders compared to a model which captures a larger percentage of online transactions. 2. Very high rates of non-compliance We believe compliance will be low as consumers will simply turn to websites or marketplaces that are not compliant; or use eBay or AliExpress as a search engine then purchase the equivalent product directly from the seller or through alternative, non- compliant retailers who will be able to offer the products at 15% less than compliant players; and which have spotty track records regarding consumer protection and regulatory compliance. There will be no new border processes to ensure GST has been captured. We understand that neither IRD nor Customs will be given additional resources to enforce the new rules. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 | Page 3. We are not traditional retailers As a technical matter, the proposed model is extremely difficult for 3P marketplaces to implement and we are yet to analyse any issues related to measures taken to comply with the flawed Australian collection model. 3P marketplaces do not hold the goods, and do not control the movement of the goods. We are not the sellers or owners of the goods, we simply connect buyers and sellers. The focus should be on 1P retailers/suppliers in the truest sense of that word. Government could consider an exemption for 3P marketplaces and focus on suppliers in the truest sense of that word. In our view however a logistics services/freight handler model would be far more effective and capture all LVG parcels coming across the border, as we outlined during Australian consultations too. 4. Unprecedented compliance costs will increase costs for Kiwi consumers The proposed model will require extensive system changes and ongoing compliance costs that will at least be partly borne by consumers as the NZ GST is a consumption tax, and therefore a tax on consumers. What Government is proposing is that suppliers bear the brunt of collection. eBay, Etsy and AliExpress are global platforms. These system changes are technically difficult and will still result in a less-than-optimal rate of revenue collection. There is a high degree of risk that consumers and businesses will face complications with the implementation of the proposed model as it is novel, complex and remains untested. 5. New Zealand retailers remain disadvantaged To use Australian Treasury modelling as an example, New Zealand businesses will continue to be disadvantaged as up to 75% of low value goods imported into New Zealand will continue not to be taxed, and thus continue to have a tax-price advantage over goods sold locally in New Zealand. This rate could increase should overseas retailers or marketplaces decide not to offer products to New Zealand consumers. This has been the case in Australia where Amazon has decided to restrict cross-border sales. Changing the GST laws as they relate to overseas online purchases will not fix all the issues faced by traditional retailers: for example, but not limited to wages, cost of rent and general cost of doing business in NZ. 6. Unfair to SMBs and individual sellers Under current GST rules, vendors who sell less than $60,000 of goods into New Zealand are exempt from GST. Under the new proposal, overseas Small and Micro Businesses (SMBs) will no longer be exempt if they sell through a platform like eBay, Etsy or AliExpress. This puts small businesses at a severe, clear and discriminatory disadvantage if they use 3P marketplaces, compared to suppliers who sell directly through websites or other channels which may result in decreased visibility, transparency and compliance in respect of regulations set by New Zealand authorities. 7. Higher trade barriers The extraterritorial application of New Zealand’s GST laws will create additional costs for overseas businesses and limit the free trade of goods into New Zealand. This is not in the spirit of various free trade agreements across the globe. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 | Page The proliferation of efforts to expand the imposition of local sales-type taxes on remote small businesses in the name of fairness will make it harder for Internet-enabled small enterprises to export. Before the Internet very small enterprises and microentrepreneurs rarely, if ever exported. They were generally trapped in their local market, increasingly faced direct competition from large enterprises with greater access to global markets, and were subject to ups and downs of their economic neighbourhood. The Internet has dramatically expanded the opportunity to small businesses to trade. While it is still very difficult for small and micro enterprises to compete head-on with giant competitors, access to global commerce platforms with many millions of users has allowed small enterprises, including in New Zealand, to carve out successful niches and grow. A better future for small businesses, who will continue to face large competitors with their traditional access to global markets, is to maintain low tax barriers and promote access to greater Internet-enabled exports and imports. A fairer more efficient collection model The authors of this submission believe the proposed model should be abandoned and replaced with a fairer more effective model, for example one based on an extension of current systems such as via collection at the border. This is what already happens for goods worth more than $400. Under the current proposal, there would be one system for goods under $400, and another system for everything else. A border collection model would address many of the concerns raised above, and would significantly increase the revenue captured. 100% of imports pass through the border so 100% of GST would be collected. Alternatively, the current proposals require rewriting to ensure they are workable. In particular, 3P marketplaces that merely provide listing and processing services to users should be treated differently under the proposed amendments. 3P marketplaces do not set the price, hold or handle goods, or have full knowledge of the flow of physical goods – therefore a model intended for online retailers cannot be easily applied to our platforms. We would welcome the opportunity for further discussion of the points made in this submission. About Us The members of the Industry Group operate websites that provide the ability for sellers to list goods for sale to buyers. These services are referred to as “3P”. 3P service providers rely on the information provided from users, do not set the price of the goods, and do not handle the goods. It is important to distinguish “3P” services from “1P” services where the website operator acquires the goods wholesale and resells the goods in its own right. Further information on each member of the Industry Group is outlined below. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 | Page Alibaba Group’s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere.

In case you did not have time to join the calls or to provide written input, there is still a time window until the end of this week (Fri day July 6 th ) to provide written input. We have attached the relevant consultation documents again in this e-mail for your convenience. The first consultation document deals with the scope of market place rules, double taxation issues and valuation methods for the proposed $400 threshold. The colleagues from New Zealand Inland Revenue are mainly seeking feedback on the below 3 points which they also mentioned in their memorandum: 1. How to define an electronic marketplace for the purpos es of an offshore supplier registration model, if we propose to deem electronic marketplaces the suppliers who must collect the tax. 2. How to minimise the potential for double or non-taxation where low-value goods are transported with higher value goods and how to deal with refunds. 3. What is the appropriate value to apply the tax: the custom’s value or the price paid by the consumer. In addition, we received another consultation docume nt this morning from the New Zealand colleagues (which you will also find attached) focusing on approaches to the marketplace rules. Any input to this document is also highly appreciated. We would like to kindly encourage you to share your written input directly with the following colleagues from New Zealand Inland Revenue: Chris Gillion In case you have any follow up questions to the consultation, please feel free to contact the above mentioned colleagues directly.

This is particularly the case for deemed suppliers whose existing systems and contracts may not readily deal with the requirements to comply with the GST. Submission On balance, we consider it is now appropriate to apply GST to cross-border sales. However, it is important that the GST is implemented in as efficient a way as possible. Government needs to recognise that the proposal will disrupt commercial arrangements and that it is necessary for the administration of the system to be as light touch as possible. At the border compliance, particularly, needs to have a mind-set change so that goods from compliant suppliers are efficiently cleared. Foreign Supplier Model The starting point in Wayfair is that the tax is a tax on the consumer of the goods. However, collection and enforcement problems mean that the collection is imposed on the supplier. That is also the position for the document’s proposal – in particular, that technology limitations mean that the supplier should charge and collect the GST. However, the proposal is not limited to a supplier model. Both electronic marketplaces (“EMPs”) and re-deliverers are also required to register. The first extends the GST to goods supplied that would not be taxable if acquired in New Zealand. Individual businesses are not able to use the threshold and consumer to consumer (“C2C”) supplies are within the net. The re-deliverer registration requirement is a consumer collection model (albeit a before the border model). This hybrid model suggests that the limitations may be overstated. Further, the model means that there is a difference between the (theoretical) incidence of the tax (on the consumer) and the legal liability (on the supplier/deemed supplier). The proposed model is a mix of compromise and opportunism to raise as much revenue as possible. Submission It is important that there is on-going attention paid to the regime to make changes to reduce the costs as quickly as changes to Customs and postal processes allow. Summary of submissions Our further detailed submissions are in the Appendix. We summarise below our submission points. — To reduce compliance costs for offshore businesses required to register and account for GST under the proposed rules, we recommend that: - New Zealand’s rules for GST on low-value imported goods should be aligned with Australia’s to the extent Australia’s rules are workable. Problems arising from those rules should be dealt with and not repeated in New Zealand’s rules. - Registrants should be given the option to charge GST on all their low-value imported goods sales, so that they do not have to verify which sales are made to GST registered businesses. - A searchable public register of GST registered businesses is made available to allow registrants to determine whether they are making supplies to GST registered businesses. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 3 — The rules should include provisions to ensure that consumer-to-consumer sales of low-value imported goods made through an electronic marketplace (“EMP”) are not subject to GST. — The threshold for the low-value goods should be determined with reference to the Customs value of the goods and the GST value of the goods should include delivery charges. — Consideration should be given as to whether the threshold can be increased from the proposed NZ$400 to NZ$1,000. — Customs and Inland Revenue need to have an efficient clearance and audit process to ensure double taxation does not arise. In particular, processes should be established so that it is reasonable to rely on audit rather than at the border clearance processes. — The time limit for making output tax adjustments for refunds given by offshore suppliers should not be limited to two years. — The rules should provide practically achievable criteria for EMPs to apply for an exemption from the rules so that the primary obligation to return the GST on the sale of low-value imported goods is on the actual supplier. The overriding of commercial arrangements and the cost of implementation should be dealt with by the proposal. — The rules should state the time of supply for vouchers issued by EMPs is at the time of redemption as opposed to issuance. — The rules should confirm that offshore suppliers only take into account direct sales when determining whether the offshore supplier has exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. Officials should also consider a simplified set of threshold rules being applied. — Non-resident suppliers required to charge GST under these (or the remote services) rules, should be entitled to recover input tax on acquisitions for their non-New Zealand activity and supplies. — The application of New Zealand consumer law to GST pricing of foreign suppliers should be considered and if necessary, it should be confirmed that GST exclusive quoting but GST pricing at the checkout is allowed.

Yours sincerely Peter Scott Partner John Cantin Partner RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 4 Appendix: Submission on GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system (A government discussion document) General design comments Extended offshore supplier registration model The discussion document notes that three options were considered for the collection of GST on low-value goods being: 1 At the point of sale where the offshore supplier will be required to register for GST and collect GST on their sales. 2 Between the point of sale and delivery where the courier companies and New Zealand Post would collect the GST on low-value goods sales. 3 After the delivery of the goods where the recipient of the goods would pay the GST after their delivery. The discussion document recommends an offshore supplier registration model (under the first option) at present as there are practical concerns for the latter two options that make them infeasible in the short to medium term. We note that the model outlined in the discussion document is not a pure offshore supplier registration model due to the extension of the GST registration requirement to include EMPs and re-deliverers. These are not the supplier of the goods. This presents some policy and practical challenges that need to be carefully considered in the design of the proposed rules. Further, particularly for EMPs, existing business models and contractual arrangements will not easily accommodate the proposals. We note below particular submissions that may allow more appropriate outcomes. Alignment with Australian rules GST applies to low-value goods imported into Australia from 1 July 2018. The proposed rules for charging GST on low-value goods imported into New Zealand are largely similar to the Australian model. Given Australia and New Zealand’s close relationship and geographic proximity, there will be many offshore suppliers, EMPs and re-deliverers that will be selling/shipping low-value goods to both countries. We would encourage officials that, to the extent possible, New Zealand’s rules should be aligned with Australia’s. This will help minimise the compliance cost for offshore businesses that need to comply with both countries’ low-value goods rules. However, equally, attention should also be paid to practical and technical problems with the Australian rules. Our feedback is that the rules are not always as easily implemented as the model would suggest. New Zealand has time available to work with suppliers to consider the rules and to find solutions. Consumer to consumer (C2C sales) From a policy perspective, so that New Zealand and foreign sourced goods have the same treatment, the proposed rules should not apply to sale of goods that would not be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. The proposals may overreach where the goods are being sold by a private seller, i.e. C2C sales through an electronic marketplace. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 5 The proposed rules should ensure that C2C sales are not subject to GST where they are sold through an electronic marketplace. Some suggestions on how this can be achieved are: — Exclude from the EMP rules, platforms that mainly only provide a service to list goods for sale. This will ensure that C2C sales would not be subject to GST. The offshore private seller would not have an obligation to charge GST under the proposed rules. On the other hand, offshore businesses that use the listing platform to sell their goods would still have the requirement to register for and charge GST on their low value goods sales. — If this exclusion is not workable, then we would recommend that EMPs are given the option not to charge GST on the sale of goods made through their platforms where they reasonably expect that the seller is not carrying on a taxable activity, e.g. EMPs would require their customers to confirm whether they are a business or private seller when on- boarding users onto their platform. Valuation We believe that two separate issues need to be considered: 1 what value of the goods should be used for determining whether the goods are below the threshold for GST to apply 2 whether, if a good is subject to the low-value goods regime, the costs of delivery and insurance to the end customer should be included in the taxable value of the goods. We consider the second issue first. Including international freight and insurance in the value of the goods We agree that delivery charges (i.e. international freight and insurance) for low-value goods should be included in the value of the goods for GST charging purposes. Simply, the value of the consumption in New Zealand includes the price of the goods plus the cost of getting the goods to New Zealand. Therefore, it is logical that those costs are included in the value of the goods. This is consistent with the current valuation rules in section 12 of the GST Act. This is also consistent with the stated policy objective of applying GST on low-value imported goods in order to level the playing field with local suppliers. For local suppliers, their cost of making the goods available to their customers includes the cost of delivery of the goods into their shops, and these delivery costs are then recovered in the price for which they sell their goods. Accordingly, not including delivery charges for low-value imported goods would not put the local suppliers in a level playing field. Value for determining whether goods are low-value goods Officials are considering two valuation options in determining whether goods are low-value goods, being: 1 the Customs value of the goods 2 the GST value of goods (i.e. the customs value plus delivery charges – see above). Our preference would be for the threshold to be based on the Customs value of the goods because: — From the offshore supplier/EMP re-deliverer’s perspective, it would be easier for them to set-up their systems to add GST where the value/price of the goods is below the low-value goods threshold. This is because, typically, delivery charges are not known until the customer proceeds to ‘check-out’ the goods, so whether GST applies or not would be RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 6 determined only at the end. Including the delivery charges can then be accommodated by adding GST to the delivery charge at the end of the process. — From a customer experience perspective, it would also be preferable that the prices quoted by the offshore supplier (for example in the supplier’s website) includes all applicable taxes, e.g. customers may not be happy to see a price of NZ$370 for example, and then find out when they proceed to the check out that they need to pay an additional 15% on top of the price quoted as the delivery charges exceeded NZ$30. — Australia’s low-value goods threshold is based on the Customs value of the goods. Aligning the New Zealand threshold valuation method with that of Australia’s will help minimise the compliance cost for offshore businesses that need to comply with the rules in both countries. Threshold value The discussion document proposes a NZ$400 threshold in order for GST to apply on low-value imported goods. We recommend officials consider whether this threshold can be increased. If this is an option, then we would recommend a threshold value of NZ$1,000. The practical benefits of increasing the low-value goods threshold are: — Given that Australia’s low-value goods threshold is set at AU$1,000, increasing the New Zealand threshold to NZ$1,000 will further align the rules between the two countries. — A higher threshold will reduce cases where a single consignment has multiple low value goods that exceed the threshold and the practical issues associated with that issue. We note that the Customs de minimus value will need to be aligned with the threshold to ensure there is no double-taxation of the imported goods. Supplies of multiple low value goods Double taxation As noted in the discussion document, there is a potential for double taxation where a single consignment includes multiple goods that individually are below the low-value goods threshold, but in aggregate, exceed the threshold. In this case, the offshore supplier (assuming they are required to register for GST) would have charged GST on the individual items sold under the proposed rules; however, as the consignment value is above the customs de minimus value, NZ Customs will also seek to collect GST at the border, when these goods are imported. In order to prevent double taxation, it is proposed that the consumer would need to provide Customs with appropriate evidence of the GST payment so that GST will not be collected again at the border. While we agree that this is an option, we would urge officials to consider more efficient procedures for providing evidence to Customs that GST has already been paid at the point of sale. Requiring customers to produce the evidence that GST has been paid on the imported goods creates a delay in the movement of goods at the border (as the goods will not be cleared until the customer has provided the evidence required). This raises the concern that implementing the GST on low value goods will unduly interfere with trade. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 7 Further, this adds administrative costs to Customs in contacting the customer and processing the evidence provided. A trade-off for GST being applied on low value goods is that duty and cost recovery charges will not apply. We assume that will be the case for consignments of low value goods otherwise consumers will pay GST and customs cost recovery charges and duty. The costs would not therefore be recovered by Customs. We recommend officials consider Customs: — Develop an Approved Supplier regime for registered suppliers/EMPs/re-deliverers. Consumers of goods supplied by Approved Suppliers would not be required to separately prove GST payment. Instead, Approved Suppliers would be subject to post-importation audit activity by Customs and Inland Revenue, and/or — Provide documentation guidelines that would allow a supplier to show that GST has been charged. We would expect over time suppliers would comply with these requirements if it made the customer experience easier. If measures such as these are implemented, enforcement of the proposed rules should be easier. Complying suppliers will be more visible so that audit checks are simpler. Potentially non-complying suppliers will also be more visible. We have made two assumptions: 1 Information will be exchanged between Customs and Inland Revenue under the Customs and Excise Act 2018. 2 The proposals’ references to the consumer proving GST has been paid is intended to be a reference to GST has been charged. A consumer is unlikely to ever be in a position to prove that GST has been paid by the supplier. Reasonable belief Australia has a reasonable belief test for whether goods will be part of a consignment or not and therefore whether the threshold is breached or not. If New Zealand has an equivalent rule, the reasonable belief exclusion should be optional. This would allow: — GST to be applied automatically to goods that are below the threshold. This is likely to be attractive if Customs processes for confirming that GST has been charged are efficient and not intrusive. — Suppliers, who are uncertain whether goods are part of a single consignment or not, to charge GST without any concern that it may have been incorrectly charged. Option to charge GST on B2B sales It is proposed that only sales of low-value imported goods to non-GST registered recipients (B2C sales) will be subject to GST under the proposed rules. However, there will be an option to zero-rate sales to GST registered recipients (B2B sales). The proposed rules will require the offshore supplier, EMP or re-deliverer to differentiate between B2C sales that are subject to the proposed rules and B2B sales that are not. This creates a compliance burden as procedures/systems to verify whether the recipient of the goods is GST registered will be required. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 8 In order to ease the compliance burden for registrants, we recommend they are also given the option to charge GST on all their low-value imported goods sales, i.e. not to differentiate between B2C and B2B sales. We emphasise that this should be an option and not the default rule as not all registrants may want to charge GST on all their sales. Registrants that already have their systems set-up to differentiate between B2B and B2C sales will want to have the option to continue to treat B2B sales as not subject to GST or zero-rated. Public register of GST registered businesses As noted above, the requirement to differentiate between B2B and B2C sales under the proposed rules is a compliance burden for the registrant. In order to ease this burden, we would also recommend that a searchable public register of GST registered businesses is made available. This would provide registrants with an easy and cost- effective method for checking whether the recipient is GST registered. This would have the additional benefit for a range of other situations under current GST legislation where confirmation of the GST status of a supplier or recipient is needed to determine the correct GST treatment (for example, zero-rating of land transactions; insurance claims paid by insurers; claiming of second-hand goods credits). Refunds/returns Where an offshore supplier provides a refund to the customer for goods returned by the customer, it is proposed that the supplier will be able to adjust its output tax for the GST refunded. However, it is noted in the discussion document that the time limit for making the output tax adjustment would be two years, as required under section 20 of the GST Act 1985. We do not agree that the two year time limit applies to a domestic supply. The two year time limit only applies to unclaimed GST input tax. It does not apply to output tax adjustments (for example, via credit note). A two year limit should not apply to offshore suppliers. If there is an option to charge GST on B2B sales, we would expect the recipient’s input tax claim would automatically be adjusted via the credit note rules. We recommend that is confirmed. Requirement for EMP to register and return GST on low-value imported goods Under the proposed rules, EMPs will be required to register for and return GST on low-value imported goods sold through their platform where customers would normally consider the EMP to be the supplier and this is reflected in the contractual arrangements between the parties. Policy and practical considerations We note that this proposal is contrary to the scheme of the rules that apply to domestic suppliers. This is a significant departure from the policy of the domestic rules. Even an agent for a supplier is not the supplier for GST purposes unless specific rules are followed and the parties agree. The proposal is justified on revenue and compliance grounds. The proposal will capture more supplies with fewer registered persons. Officials should be aware that the: — Proposal comes at a cost to EMPs. Implementing the rules when the EMP is not the actual supplier is not necessarily straight-forward or cheap. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 9 — Goods are likely to be less tied to a platform than remote services. Suppliers have direct distribution channel options that may not be the case for remote services. The differences in thresholds may therefore encourage suppliers to direct rather than EMP channels. This would mean that the same economic transaction has different GST results. — Proposal is likely to require that commercial arrangements will need to be renegotiated. We have not analysed the position in any detail but we would not expect section 78 to facilitate amendments to existing contracts between suppliers and EMPs. (These contracts are unlikely to have New Zealand as the governing law. We have not researched whether section 78 can have extra-territorial reach. However, even if it can, commercial renegotiations would still likely be required.) — Proposal may mean that consumer to consumer transactions are included when they would not be if the supply was a domestic supply. — Resident EMPs, which may have resident and non-resident suppliers, have a particular problem as domestic suppliers are deemed to sell through the EMP as well. We recommend that, if the EMP proposal proceeds, these particular issues are dealt with. Ability for supplier to be responsible It is proposed that the remote services rules of when an EMP will be required to register will be applied for low-value imported goods, i.e. an EMP will be required to charge GST unless all the following criteria are met the: 1 documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the EMP 2 underlying supplier and the EMP have agreed that the supplier is liable for the payment of the GST 3 EMP does not authorise either the charge or the delivery to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. In respect of the second criteria above, we understand that if a supplier is not required to register, as it does not meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, the criteria can still be satisfied. In other words, if the supplier agrees to meet their GST obligations, that is satisfied if they are below the threshold and not required to register for GST and charge GST. We also note that based on our discussions with various EMPs, it is highly unlikely that the EMPs will be able to satisfy especially the third criteria in practice. This is a concern as in some cases it would not be reasonable for the EMP to have the primary responsibility for returning the GST, e.g. if the payment is received directly by the supplier. The EMP proposal is also contrary to a supplier model of responsibility for charging and collecting GST. To mitigate those concerns, it is also proposed that EMPs will be allowed to not be treated as the supplier, at the Commissioner’s discretion, where the EMP has a ‘compelling case’ that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with its obligations. While we support consideration of this option, we would encourage officials to: — set the criteria for what a ‘compelling case’ would be at a practically achievable level; and — consider whether this option can be more widely applied, given the EMP rules do not sit easily with domestic policy. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 10 Vouchers issued by EMPs Some EMPs issue gift cards/vouchers that can be used to purchase goods in the EMP’s platform. The vouchers may be used to: — Purchase goods that are not consumed in New Zealand, for example, if goods are purchased using a voucher but are not shipped to New Zealand. No GST should apply. — Purchase goods that are above the threshold so that there will be double taxation if GST is charged on issue. Further the vouchers may be in denominations that are more or less than the threshold but may be used for low value goods or not. We recommend that a specific time of supply rule is included in the rules for vouchers issued by offshore EMPs, so that the time of supply for these vouchers is only on redemption of the vouchers. This will ensure that GST will only apply where these vouchers are used to purchase low-value imported goods into New Zealand. Registration threshold The proposed rules require an offshore supplier to register for and charge GST on low-value imported goods where its supplies exceed NZ$60,000. However, it is not clear from the discussion document, whether the NZ$60,000 threshold for an offshore supplier will only include its direct sales to New Zealand customers, or whether they include both direct sales and sales made through an EMP. We understand that the threshold is to be applied only to direct sales. This should be clear in the proposed rules. The registration threshold rules have look back and look forward rules. With exchange rate as well as demand volatility, it is likely that foreign suppliers will move above and below the threshold. Theoretically, and consistent with domestic suppliers, this would make them liable to register and provide them with an option to deregister. Consideration should be given to whether the threshold tests can be amended for offshore suppliers so that they can practically be applied. As an example, the test could be applied annually based on the supplier’s financial balance date rather than on a rolling 12 month basis. Section 54B Non-resident supplier registration Non-residents are able to register and recover input tax for supplies acquired for a taxable activity that does not involve New Zealand taxable supplies. This rule is consistent with the policy that GST is a tax on personal consumption and is not a tax on business. The rules currently prevent a non-resident from using these rules if they make any New Zealand taxable supplies. In our view, they should still be able to claim input tax for acquisitions which relate to supplies outside the scope of New Zealand’s GST. A consequential change to section 54B is required to allow this to occur. GST inclusive pricing New Zealand consumers are used to transacting on a GST inclusive basis. If that is not the case, suppliers are careful, as a result of New Zealand consumer law, to make it clear that the quoted price does not include GST (i.e. GST will be added to determine the total consideration.) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 11 Offshore suppliers are unlikely to be transacting on the same basis. This is particularly the case where the supplier sells to multiple jurisdictions with different tax rules. As the application of a particular rule is not known with certainty until the goods are ordered, tax is often added at the check-out. We would expect foreign suppliers to want to continue with their current processes. Whether and how New Zealand consumer law applies to imported low-value goods needs to be considered. The current and desired position should be confirmed and consulted on by Officials. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT High Level Summary of Key Points on the GST on low value goods proposals in New Zealand Ge n eral •A simple and flexible tax regime is key from a business and tax authority perspective in order to ensure that trade remains as unaffected as possible by VAT/GST considerations, thereby maximising tax revenues – a win-win for all parties. Striking the right balance in terms of compliance requirements should also help minimise the cost of collection for business and the cost of administration/enforcement for tax authority. This is particularly important for the new marketplace rules on low value goods where a variety of fast evolving business models exist, which makes it difficult to come up with a “one size fits all” approach, therefore flexibility is key. With this in mind giving business a range of options at hand, which they can chose from based on clear rules and sound administrative practices will create certainty and will allow them to act as tax collector in the best possible way ensuring neutrality of the tax and market (channel) neutrality through creating a level playing field, while at the same time safeguarding VAT revenues for governments. Given the significant complexity around scope, double taxation and valuation, therefore any solution needs to be efficient, simple and flexible. •On the basis that the measures impact foreign businesses, determining an effective communication strategy is critical to success – how will non-resident businesses know that the rules exist? Australia ́s approach with roadshows, etc. might also be helpful to consider. Happy to support on this, as I have done with the Australian colleagues. •Sufficient lead time should be set aside in order that business and tax authority are able to make adequate preparations for implementing the rules. This is also important for the communication strategy. From a business perspective, 6 – 12 months is generally considered a minimum length of time for making ready, although longer may be required if significant IT systems development is necessary. •The rules introduced for digital services in New Zealand a couple of years ago (which BIAC also facilitated input to) try to keep things simple and flexible for business regarding the way how best and easiest to comply and should therefore also be as much as possible followed for low value goods. Business sees the New Zealand rules on digital services as best practice in the international context and encourages New Zealand Inland Revenues to build the new rules for low value goods on this fundament. Looking at the consultation documents, business clearly recognizes, that New Zealand Inland Revenues ́ aim is to make things as business friendly as possible, which the business community is highly appreciating and is very thankful for. Specific aspects As mentioned in our calls, businesses from the marketplace sector are best placed to share business specific aspects on the points addressed in the consultation documents, as they know the commercial environment best. However, I am very happy to share my personal thoughts based on my experience and what I have learned from my discussions with them. PUB-040 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT • Scope of the proposed EMP rules: o It might make sense to deem the marketplaces the supplier in all circumstances in order to avoid undue complexity. However, this raises potential equity issues for small businesses trading below the registration threshold but selling goods through a platform versus small businesses acting independently and not charging VAT. Personally, I'm not sure there's much option here but to allow a slightly unlevel playing field since the value of supplies should be low versus potentially high complexity. o As mentioned in the consultation documents, a broad approach might potentially result in some EMP operators being liable for GST in situations where it may not be reasonable to deem them to be the supplier for GST purposes. Therefore, giving them the possibility to approach Inland Revenues in a kind of ruling request to achieve certainty whether they are in scope or not of the new tax collector regime is very helpful and highly appreciated. o Both options highlighted in the consultation document  Option 1: Extend the marketplace rules for remote services to low- value goods but include a Commissioner’s discretion  Option 2: Marketplace liable unless they are a “recognised marketplace” have pro ́s and con ́s as highlighted in the consultation document. From my perspective, these options are not mutually exclusive. Therefore offering both as a starting point when the new rules are introduced and then try out which one works best in practice and then discard the other one later, might also be an approach to consider. o Regarding the aspect whether to deem the EMP operator to be the supplier regardless of residency or location of the vendor, or only if the vendor is based outside New Zealand, my personal view is that the option should be picked which most likely creates a level playing field and ensures both (monetary) neutrality (no VAT costs) and market channel neutrality for business. For this to happen the domestic supply “underlying supplier to marketplace” (B2B supply) needs to be treated as outside the scope of VAT to avoid cash flow and neutrality issues for the marketplaces. The possible addition to carve out EMPs through which predominantly domestic supplies are made is an excellent idea, which could also be followed. Also here, keeping things flexible as a starting point and gain practical experience before discarding things, might be an approach to consider. • Double taxation o The multiple consignment issues, FX variances and reasonable belief tests look complex, but business appreciates that NZ IR are being reasonably flexible in their approach. Conceptually, I would rather have fewer and more certain rules, but from a practical perspective, I think it makes sense to start with flexibility here and then adjust in light of experience. o Even with the best intention and process there will always be instances of double taxation it is therefore very important that an efficient refund process is put in place. There are two main ways mentioned in the document how RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT things could be set up - customs could refund the GST they have collected, or the vendor could refund the GST they have collected. Also here I think both ways are not mutually exclusive it might depend on the specific circumstances to decide which way is best to go. Therefore offering both ways as a starting point and then finding out in practice, which one works best and then discard the other one might also be an approach to consider. We are living today in a technology driven world of “try and improve”, therefore, adapting such an approach giving flexibility as a starting point and then see what works best in practice might be an avenue to explore and to reach the best way forward in practice after having tried things out first. • Valuation methodology: o It seems overly complex to set up a system to calculate GST based on the total value, but only charge this if the Customs value is equal to or less than $400. • Australian Experience o The experience in Australia will be critical. At this moment, given the rules are only effective since July 1, 2018, there is not much experience out there yet from the business side how things function in practice. As mentioned on the phone, very happy to collect the BIAC members ́ experience regarding Australia in the next couple of months and to set also up a conference call with all of you, if you find it helpful.

Historically, many governments and tax authorities have adopted Goods and Services Tax (GST) policies whereby the importation of goods below a defined de-minimis threshold would not be subject to GST and/or associated customs duties or charges. As the NZ Government’s discussion document notes, these policies have stemmed from a recognition that the compliance and administrative costs associated with low value imported goods (LVIGs) would outweigh the value of any GST collected. Amazon recognises the NZ Government’s concerns about its tax base and the position of NZ domestic retailers as being the primary drivers of the proposal to require offshore suppliers to collect GST on LVIGs supplied to NZ consumers. In addressing these concerns, Amazon urges the NZ Government to consider the elements of a GST collection model that will best meet its objectives of creating a genuinely level playing field between domestic and overseas retailers and maximising the collection of GST revenue. In particular, we urge the government to consider an approach that will ensure compliance by all suppliers regardless of differing business models. We are concerned that an unenforceable and unworkable collection model will harm both consumers and competition by potentially reducing access to competitively priced goods from overseas marketplaces. We recognise that the NZ Government has proposed an offshore supplier registration model that would require marketplaces to be treated as the supplier for the purpose of registering for GST and calculating, collecting and remitting GST on underlying supplier transactions. We also note the advice of the NZ Government’s Tax Working Group that “\[o\]ptions for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery...should continue to be reviewed to see if practical issues with them can be overcome and become an effective means of collecting GST on low value goods.” 1 Amazon is concerned that the proposed supplier model will not achieve the NZ Government’s objectives to create a level playing field between NZ and overseas retailers and maximise GST revenue collection. Moreover, this approach will likely require dedicated resources to address its shortfalls, similar in scale to those required to implement the modernised transporter model, while collecting only a fraction of the comparable revenue. While we welcome the opportunity to suggest improvements to the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model, Amazon would ultimately need to assess the feasibility and impact of any model adopted once the implementation details were established. This assessment may result in changes to 1 Letter to NZ Government from Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group, ‘GST on low-value imported goods’, 26 February 2018 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 the products and services Amazon is able to provide to NZ consumers, including goods or services offered by third parties on Amazon’s websites. The following submission addresses the challenges of implementing an effective model for the collection of GST on LVIGs. We have structured our submission into three distinct sections: 1. The broad issues with compliance and enforcement against entities and the necessity of border enforcement mechanisms in achieving the objectives of the proposed changes. 2. Our response to the advice of the Tax Working Group by outlining the scope and benefits of an alternative model, the modernised transporter model, for remittance of GST on LVIGs. 3. Our response to the NZ Government’s proposed model for an offshore supplier registration system, with suggestions for how this approach could be improved. Amazon emphasises that even with these improvements, the model will likely not meet the NZ Government’s objectives, nor match the modernised transporter model's rates of compliance or revenue collection. As an overarching recommendation, we strongly support the proposed removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from all imported goods valued at or below $400 regardless of the GST collection model ultimately adopted. This approach will reduce complexity and compliance costs and deliver direct benefits to NZ consumers. Finally, we urge the NZ Government to ensure the introduction of any new rules provides a lead time of 18-24 months to allow for businesses to implement changes to systems and processes and also to allow for appropriate communication plans to be deployed. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 1. Compliance and enforcement on low-value imported goods Effective compliance in cross-border tax collection requires enforcement at the border. Any collection model without border enforcement will depend on voluntary compliance and offshore enforcement, as was recognised in the final report of the Australian Government’s 2017 Productivity Commission review. 2 Australia will be the first country globally to adopt a supplier registration model. According to the Australian Government’s own modelling, at maturity – five years after implementation - this model will only collect GST on approximately half of all low-value goods imported into Australia. Amazon is concerned that even these estimates are optimistic, as ecommerce business models will continue to evolve, and consumers will increasingly purchase from untaxed suppliers driven by financial incentives. This low collection rate reflects the fundamental flaw of Australia’s legislated supplier registration model, in that it lacks any mechanism to enforce compliance at the border. Without border enforcement, governments will not achieve their objectives of creating a level playing field between domestic and overseas retailers and maximising the collection of GST revenue. Amazon supports these objectives and has urged the Australian Government to adopt an approach that would better achieve them. In its current form, the NZ Government’s proposed offshore supplier registration model (the ‘supplier model’) is similarly dependent on voluntary compliance from many thousands of offshore suppliers (including small businesses) and marketplaces that have no presence in NZ. This will require offshore enforcement of NZ laws against each of these businesses in every country in which they operate. Local laws cannot be effectively enforced with respect to goods sold by nonresident entities, in part due to the limitations of multilateral and mutual assistance treaties. This has the real potential to disadvantage local businesses, as voluntary compliance with the law cannot be assumed. As a result, Amazon is concerned that many businesses will not comply with the supplier model and will face no consequences for non- compliance given the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism. Another key limitation of the supplier model is that purchases made through online intermediaries and referrers are untaxed. Suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Consumers will adapt their buying behaviours to seek out the marketplaces and suppliers who do not charge the GST, further reducing GST collection. Moreover, as technology advances, the cost of establishing a marketplace will continue to plummet and new marketplaces will proliferate, potentially increasing such behaviour. A fair and effective cross-border tax collection model should be technologically neutral, keeping pace with these shifts in buying behavior and the ever-changing supply chain models that continue to emerge. Border enforcement would address this limitation and therefore create a more level playing field. 2 Australian Government Productivity Commission, Collection Models for GST on Low-Value Imported Goods, Productivity Commission Inquiry Report, No. 86, 31 October 2017, pp. 44-47 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 We note the discussion document cites the NZ Government’s implementation of the GST on cross-border services and intangibles as evidence that an offshore supplier registration system is “effective and relatively easy to comply with.” 3 However, we suggest that there are fundamental differences between the requirement for non-residents including marketplaces to collect GST on electronically supplied services (ESS) and the proposal to apply a similar requirement for tangible goods. These include:  There is a mechanism to tax tangible goods at the time of physical importation, with the potential to achieve close to 100% compliance. This option does not exist for ESS;  Cross border transactions of goods require the determination of where the goods are shipped from and whether the goods fall within changes to LVIG rules, raising the issue of which party is best placed to accurately make these determinations. ESS do not require similar determinations;  A standard rate of GST is applied to all ESS transactions, whereas goods in most jurisdictions attract different GST rates depending on the underlying product type. This requires detailed analysis to determine the appropriate GST liability, raising the issue of which party is best placed to accurately make these determinations;  Once the GST registration threshold is breached, all ESS transactions are subject to GST. This is different to LVIG requirements, where there is an additional need to identify whether the value of a transaction is above or below prescribed LVIG values; and  Transactions involving goods can be canceled, requiring the return of items, and giving rise to additional complex requirements for the supplier to track and amend underlying GST charged on initial sales. The process is much simpler for ESS transactions, which can simply be reversed. Amazon urges the NZ Government to consider these important differences as it assesses whether the offshore supplier registration model for ESS can be easily replicated for tangible goods. Amazon believes there is a case for considering a different approach for LVIGs, particularly in the potential role of border enforcement. 1.1. Stricter customs/border controls A common feature of all transactions that involve goods shipped to customers from overseas is that the goods need to be imported and declared to customs or border authorities. If customs and border authorities’ GST compliance activities are carried out correctly and strictly enforced, this should ensure that the majority of offshore suppliers declare and remit the correct amount of customs duties and GST on the goods they import. Robust compliance measures should apply to shipments through both express carriers and postal operators, ensuring compliance regardless of transportation mode. Amazon recommends that the NZ Government would most efficiently achieve its objectives by focusing on increased resourcing, better technological and reporting systems, and identification of indicators of fraud or under-declared values for goods. 3 'GST on low-value imported goods – an offshore supplier registration system: a government discussion document', Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, May 2018, p. 10 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 Amazon also recognises that at present, NZ customs and border authorities may lack the resourcing and capability to undertake compliance and enforcement activities in relation to LVIGs cost-effectively at scale. However, shifting collection responsibilities and costs to offshore marketplaces is not the most efficient alternative, and ultimately, effective enforcement at the border may require much of the same resources and capabilities that the NZ Government is seeking to avoid. In this context, it is appropriate to consider which entities in the supply chain are best placed to assist with GST collection and remittance on LVIGs, in a way that facilitates effective border enforcement. Amazon notes that there is already operational infrastructure and technical mechanisms in place for the collection and remittance of GST on high-value goods at the border. Express carriers and postal operators are involved in the actual delivery of all imported sales and are therefore ideally placed to assist in border enforcement of GST on LVIGs. They customarily contract with suppliers to fulfil the customs clearance procedures and pay the import duties and taxes on their behalf. They have the direct relationships required to collect essential shipping data elements (ultimately from the principal supplier) including description of the goods, consignee details, country of dispatch and country of destination, weight, pieces, value and currency (at shipment level). As the NZ Government may be aware, Amazon has proposed an alternate collection model, utilising the unique position that express carriers and postal operators occupy in the supply chain for imported goods. Amazon has described this approach as a ‘modernised transporter model’ because it leverages the technological change that is already underway in parcel processing globally, driven by a combination of commercial and national security concerns. Amazon has provided submissions detailing the modernised transporter model to the Australian Government’s Productivity Commission inquiry into models for collecting GST on low value imported goods. 45 As stated above, we recognise that the NZ Government has requested feedback on the design of an offshore supplier registration model. At the same time, we note the advice of the NZ Government’s Tax Working Group that “\[o\]ptions for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery...should continue to be reviewed...” 6 This recommendation recognises that the involvement of express carriers and postal operators is critical in achieving the NZ Government’s objectives for collecting GST on LVIGs. If the NZ Government were to adopt the supplier model for GST collection on LVIGs, it would be only the second country globally to do so. The model is untested, with the Australian Government’s modelling suggesting that approximately 85% of LVIGs passing its border will remain untaxed in the first 12 months. 7 Amazon is also concerned that an unenforceable and unworkable collection model will harm 4 http://www.pc.gov.au/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0008/221489/sub035-collection-models.pdf 5 http://www.pc.gov.au/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0017/222182/subs004-collection-models.pdf 6 Letter to NZ Government from Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group, ‘GST on low-value imported goods’, 26 February 2018 7 Australian Treasury estimates indicated collection rates starting at 15 per cent in 2017-18 and then 21 per cent in 2018-19. See Amazon, ‘Submission to the Productivity Commission: Collection models for GST on low-value imported goods’, 4 September 2017, p. 43. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 NZ consumers by potentially reducing access to competitively priced goods from overseas marketplaces. We would therefore urge the New Zealand government to delay adoption and implementation until it has had sufficient opportunity to determine whether offshore suppliers are able to make the complex changes needed to comply with Australian law, whether Australian authorities are able to enforce the law, and whether large numbers of non-Australian suppliers are voluntarily complying. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 8 2. The modernised transporter model Amazon proposes an alternative GST collection model that takes the core principles of border enforcement and combines them with the significant and ongoing technological developments in logistics and clearance processes over recent years. The modernised transporter model would place enforceable liabilities on a limited number of domestic express carriers and NZ Post (collectively ‘transporters’) who each have a physical presence in NZ, and in respect of whom Inland Revenue has jurisdiction. For these reasons, and because the model will over time drive consistent treatment of goods entering NZ irrespective of who sold them, this model will ensure nearly 100 percent GST collection rates and will truly level the playing field between NZ and overseas retailers. Importantly, the modernised transporter model is neutral across transportation modes, using the availability of Electronic Advance Data (EAD) from both cargo and postal operators. Where currently certain transporters may be challenged to provide EAD, other stakeholders may be incentivised to provide the data in return for expedited facilitation, such as pre-arrival clearance and immediate release. In this respect, the model takes advantage of technological advancements that have occurred through recent years and are continuing to gather pace, driven by a combination of commercial and national security concerns. Governments are seeking greater visibility and assurance in regards to goods crossing their borders, while postal operators are competing with express couriers in parcel delivery, meeting the increasing expectations of customers for fast and convenient delivery. Achieving these outcomes cost-effectively and at scale requires data-driven solutions across both the cargo and postal streams to ensure there are no loopholes for non-compliant and potentially unsafe goods. The modernised transporter model is an alternative, not a complement, to the supplier model, and the former cannot be layered on top of the latter. A single point of tax assessment with a single party (the transporter) accountable for the GST is the only model that will drive consistency and compliance. Layered models will lead to duplicate or no GST being collected and asking multiple parties to incur compliance costs will further drive up costs for consumers. Whether under the supplier model or the modernised transporter model, the event triggering the GST liability on goods sold overseas to NZ consumers is not the sale of the goods alone (a transaction that occurs outside of NZ and which should not be subject to NZ taxes) but rather the importation of those goods into NZ. The actual importer of the goods is generally the consumer, and the supplier of the LVIGs typically engages the transporter on behalf of the consumer to handle importation of the goods into NZ and delivery to the consumer. As the transporter is the party facilitating the importation of the LVIGs for the consumer, the transporter is the most appropriate party to collect and remit the GST payable on those goods, based on information from the supplier. This model would also provide consistency with the established process whereby courier companies collect GST on goods above the de minimis threshold. Amazon would welcome the opportunity to discuss implementation of the modernised transporter model with the NZ Government in more detail. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 9 3. Improvements to proposed offshore supplier registration system Amazon recognises that the NZ Government has proposed an offshore supplier registration model that would require marketplaces to be treated as the supplier for the purpose of registering for NZ GST and calculating, collecting and remitting GST on underlying supplier transactions. We are concerned that this approach will not achieve the NZ Government’s objectives to create a level playing field between NZ and overseas retailers and maximise GST revenue collection. Moreover, this approach will likely require dedicated resources to address its shortfalls, similar in scale to those required to implement the modernised transporter model, while collecting only a fraction of the comparable revenue. While we welcome the opportunity to suggest improvements to the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model, Amazon would ultimately need to assess the feasibility and impact of any model adopted once the implementation details were established. This assessment may result in changes to the products and services Amazon is able to provide to NZ consumers, including goods or services offered by third parties on Amazon’s websites. 3.1. Border enforcement The primary, practical limitation of the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model is that it lacks an effective border enforcement process and is instead dependent on voluntary compliance and ineffective offshore enforcement. Without border enforcement, Amazon is concerned that the NZ Government’s proposed model will increasingly leak GST revenue over time and distort competition. Suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Consumers will have an incentive to purchase through untaxed suppliers and marketplaces, while non-compliant entities will benefit at the expense of compliant entities, and goods will flow through the border with no GST collected and remitted. Moreover, as technology advances, the cost of establishing a marketplace will continue to plummet and new marketplaces will proliferate, increasing such behaviour. Amazon believes this outcome would be unworkable and urges the NZ Government to consider different methods of border enforcement to create a more level playing field between NZ and overseas-based retailers. 3.2. Red lane/green lane parcel processing Amazon recommends the NZ Government consider steps to modernise parcel processing for LVIGs with the aims of maximising compliance and GST revenue collection. The NZ Government may consider leveraging recent and ongoing technological advancements in parcel processing to put in place border enforcement that is low-cost and scalable over time, with minimal impacts on NZ consumers. While this approach would not achieve the same level of compliance as the modernised transporter model, any level of border enforcement would improve compliance and level the playing field among offshore sellers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 10 Under present arrangements, Electronic Advance Data (EAD) is required to be submitted to the NZ Customs Service for packages sent via express couriers and freight forwarders. Amazon proposes that suppliers should be required to provide the NZ Customs Service with certain minimum EAD to help assess on an expedited basis that GST has been collected and remitted. Customs should then ‘match’ carrier information with supplier information and, accordingly, determine which packages are GST compliant. Based on this compliance determination, packages should be directed through different channels at the border. If a package is not GST compliant because it cannot be ‘matched’ between a marketplace and courier, that package should automatically be sent to a red channel. GST compliant packages would be directed through a green channel. 3.3. Primary liability A principle underpinning any fair and effective cross-border tax collection model is that it should not shift tax debts onto parties that do not have – and may be unable to obtain – sufficient information to determine the tax payable. The marketplace operator or provider is not the legal seller of record (SOR) in the transaction and marketplaces will not always know where and how these suppliers conduct their business to determine the GST accurately. For example, third party sellers who list their goods on Amazon are in control of their product listings, terms of sale, and fulfilment of sold goods to consumers. While some sellers can elect to use Amazon’s logistics services, Amazon frequently will not touch the goods or services that are sold by third parties through Amazon’s online stores since many sellers will directly fulfil orders submitted by consumers. In such cases, Amazon only facilitates orders between shippers and importers and may lack necessary information for determining the tax payable. Amazon therefore recommends that marketplaces should not have primary liability for GST or associated penalties for any GST errors relating to third-party sales due to inaccurate information provided by the suppliers. Rather, in an offshore supplier registration model, tax liability should be either on the SOR or the importer, with the marketplace operator (or carrier) liability limited to remitting collected proceeds designated by the SOR or consumer. 3.4. Channel neutrality A key limitation of the offshore supplier model is that suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Amazon considers that any GST law should be neutral and equitable in terms of its application across businesses. In particular, if the NZ Government seeks to place any obligations upon marketplaces, these should be the same regardless of the structure of marketplace operations and whether marketplace operators are physically located within a particular territory or not. The scope and meaning of ‘marketplace’ should be based on the broadest possible definition that captures all marketplace models and operations that facilitate underlying transactions between third- party sellers and customers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 11 3.5. Marketplace neutrality by enforcing or removing GST exemptions Amazon is concerned that the registration threshold of NZD $60,000 of low-value goods into NZ would make it nearly impossible for the government to detect noncompliance with the new GST law for all but the largest offshore suppliers. For example, without this threshold, it would be possible to execute a test buy for an inexpensive product from a company that is suspected of noncompliance in order to check whether they are paying the GST. However, with such a sizeable exemption, it may be very difficult to prove that a foreign business is above the threshold or required to be registered for GST. A similar issue arises with goods improperly classified as gifts to avoid taxation. The NZ Government should consider measures to prevent circumvention. This could be achieved by eliminating the NZD $60,000 threshold. Similarly, the gift exemption should either be fully enforced or eliminated to prevent improper classification. 3.6. Additional enforcement measures Inland Revenue should consider additional measures applicable to other parties that would continue to be involved in the supply of goods to NZ consumers. This could include financial institutions involved in the payment chain playing a further role in identifying non-compliant suppliers and blocking payments for underlying transactions where GST has not been collected. While including financial intermediaries is a potential option, there may be significant limitations to its implementation given the complexities of cross-border payment systems and the number of financial institutions and services involved. Express carriers and postal operators, which have control over the goods and customs formalities, should be required to undertake due diligence on both the consignment of goods and suppliers so that they are able to provide sufficient details to the authorities to identify non-compliant providers. Inland Revenue, working with the NZ Customs Service, should dedicate time and resources to actively identifying non-compliant suppliers. This could be achieved by performing ‘test buys’ from relevant websites and following those purchases through to determine whether GST is being collected and remitted by those suppliers. This would then allow the NZ Customs Service to focus specifically on bad actors and subsequently route packages shipped by those suppliers through a red channel. 3.7. Administrative simplifications Ease of implementation is an important consideration, not only for offshore suppliers, but also for government, as it will make implementation of any GST collection model more achievable. In part, the following simplifications support measures already proposed in the NZ Government’s discussion document:  Amazon strongly supports the proposed removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from all imported goods valued at or below $400 regardless of the GST collection model RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 12 ultimately adopted. This approach will reduce complexity and compliance costs and deliver direct benefits to NZ consumers.  Amazon recommends that Inland Revenue and the NZ Customs Service provide clear and simplified guidance as early as practicable on how GST status should be reflected in manifest and entry declaration data to avoid duplicative taxation at the border.  Amazon recommends that the NZ Government harmonise the bases for assessing customs value and GST value to create a simplified assessment basis. Having different valuation bases for customs duties and GST adds confusion and complexity in administration for all suppliers, particularly small and medium sized enterprises.

Deloitte welcomes the opportunity to submit on the proposed design of an offshore supplier registration system to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand customers and appreciates the numerous discussions with officials that we have had as part of this submission process. We acknowledge that due to the changing nature of the way New Zealand consumers are purchasing goods, the Government has made the decision to amend the GST legislation to increase the number of suppliers who are subject to New Zealand GST. Following the consideration of three different options for collecting GST on low value imported goods, the Government has decided to seek public comment on a model that collects GST at the point of sale (“offshore supplier registration”). Summary of submissions Our submission points will cover the following issues: 1. We support the proposed change from a ‘de minimis’ threshold applied by the New Zealand Customs Service (“Customs”) to a consignment value. 2. We submit that offshore suppliers applying the $400 value threshold should test the threshold using the ‘customs’ value. 3. We encourage Officials to consider the rationale for changing the taxing point to the point of sale in light of the nature and range of legal relationships existing at the point of sale - GST liability generally should follow legal ownership unless there are very strong reasons to change this.

We support the implementation of an exception similar to the ‘reasonable belief’ exception in Australia, as described in paragraphs \[3.20\] and \[3.21\] of the discussion paper. 5. Reducing legislative complexity by not excluding supplies made to businesses could significantly reduce offshore suppliers’ compliance costs and should be considered. 6. We recommend a two-tiered approach where Inland Revenue allows ‘Approved Marketplaces’ to only provide information on suppliers and supplies made into New Zealand, with no liability to collect GST. This rebuttable presumption model would push the GST liability to the underlying legal supplier of the goods, unless that underlying supplier fails to comply with the New Zealand GST rules, in which case the responsibility for the GST on future sales would fall back on the marketplace following notification by Inland Revenue. 7. We support the proposed concession to allow Marketplaces’ to act ‘as agent’ for underlying suppliers upon mutual agreement. 8. A lower registration threshold (i.e. $30,000) for offshore suppliers may counter-balance any concerns that putting liability on the underlying supplier will result in a lower level of compliance. 9. While not a revenue issue, we note that the paper does not contain detailed guidance on how, in practice, Customs processing of goods will occur to minimise delays. 10. We recommend that Officials review the proposed application date with Marketplaces and offshore suppliers to confirm that it will provide sufficient time for the development of required business systems and operating procedures required by the proposed changes. 11. We recommend that Officials seek further information and data from Marketplaces to support the policy rationale with clear evidence-based thinking. We have set out our submissions in more detail below. Yours sincerely Allan Bullot Partner for Deloitte Limited (as trustee for the Deloitte Trading Trust) If you have any queries about this submission, or for more information, please contact Allan Bullot at s9(2)(a) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 3 The scope of the proposed offshore supplier registration rules Definition of ‘low-value goods’ 1 1. We support the proposed change from a ‘de minimis’ threshold applied by the New Zealand Customs Service (“Customs”) to a consignment value. This will treat all parcels of the same value in the same way regardless of the contents of the parcel. 2 2. We submit that offshore suppliers applying the $400 value threshold should test the threshold using the ‘customs’ value instead of the ‘total amount paid by the consumer less GST’ - i.e. that the cost of freight should not factor into whether a good is considered ‘low value’. 2.1. This approach is the most simple and will therefore be the easiest to implement with offshore suppliers. It is also more consistent with the underlying principles of the proposed changes – i.e. to balance additional tax revenue against the compliance cost borne by taxpayers and government agencies. 2.2. We note that this approach is also consistent with the existing definitions used by Customs and therefore may make implementation more efficient. 2.3. To the extent that “value substitution” between the value of the low value good and the transportation charges is seen to occur, we submit that the anti- avoidance provisions could apply, but we would expect that such situations are unlikely to occur in practice with any great frequency. Taxing at point of sale 3. We understand the policy rationale behind changing the taxing point to the point of sale. 4. We encourage Officials to consider this policy rationale in light of the nature and range of legal relationships existing at the point of sale, recognising that there is a diversity of transaction-types that result in goods being imported and consumed in New Zealand. We consider that GST liability should generally follow legal ownership, but we acknowledge Officials may consider some situations exist where this cannot apply. 1 See paragraphs \[3.3\] and \[3.6\] in the discussion document. 2 Currently, when goods are imported, Customs collects GST. Customs applies a ‘de minimis’ threshold of $60 (GST and tariff duty) in order to balance collection costs with potential tax revenue collected. Due to the ‘de minimis’ threshold including tariff duty (which applies at different rates to different goods), parcels of equal value may have differing GST treatment depending on whether the goods are subject to tariff duty.

We understand the policy rationale behind Officials’ proposed treatment of supplies of multiple low-value goods. 6. We support a mechanism to enable Customs to verify GST paid or partially paid on a consignment of multiple low-value goods, or a mixed consignment, in order to prevent double taxation. 4 7. We also support the implementation of an exception similar to the ‘reasonable belief’ exception in Australia, as described in paragraphs \[3.20\] and \[3.21\] of the discussion paper. 7.1. A ‘reasonable belief’ exception will minimise instances of double taxation as all consignments / packages entering New Zealand worth greater than $400 will be taxed by Customs, unless the offshore supplier attaches a notice of the GST already collected at the point of sale. 7.2. This pragmatic approach will simplify the compliance burden on offshore suppliers as there will be a clear line in the sand – i.e. offshore suppliers are responsible for collecting GST on any transactions where the good, or the total package of goods consigned, is less than $400 based on ‘customs value’. 7.3. This approach will also simplify the test of whether offshore suppliers must register under the proposed rules. 8. We understand consideration is being given to increasing the low value amount from $400 to $1,000. We support this review and note that a review of the data is likely to indicate that increasing the low value amount to $1,000 is likely to remove many of the practical issues associated with multiple supplies and consignments for most sales to New Zealand consumers. Consumers versus GST-registered businesses 9. We understand the underlying policy rationale for making an exception for offshore supplies to GST-registered businesses in New Zealand. We have been advised by a number of non-resident suppliers that they would actually prefer to not have to make any distinction by excluding supplies made to businesses, as they consider that this could significantly reduce offshore suppliers’ compliance costs. 10. We note we do not consider the potential missing trader fraud risk is as significant an issue for low value goods when compared to the remote services situations. By the very nature of the goods in question being “low value” the fiscal risk is reduced compared to remote services that could be for any value. 3 See paragraphs \[3.2\] to \[3.19\] in the discussion document. 4 See paragraphs \[3.16\] to \[3.18\]. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 5 11. If offshore suppliers are allowed to charge GST on supplies to businesses, there would need to be a process of issuing GST Tax Invoices to allow for recovery by the New Zealand GST registered customers. Registration requirements and returns filing Non-resident digital marketplaces – approved marketplace options 12. Under the proposed changes non-resident digital marketplaces will be deemed to be the supplier of goods, and, if the registration criteria are met, be required to collect and return GST on the aggregated supplies made via the digital marketplace (by all suppliers). 13. We suggest strong consideration is given to a model of taxing non-resident suppliers (and deemed suppliers) of low value goods with a two stage process. This could involve a rebuttable presumption that the operator of a digital marketplace is required to collect GST on all their suppliers of low value goods to New Zealand. The presumption could be rebutted provided that the operator of the digital marketplace satisfied certain tests and obligations, primarily around the supply of information on the level of sales of low value goods to New Zealand by the underlying legal supplier of the goods. In that case the obligation (if any) to collect and remit the GST on low value goods sales would fall upon the underlying legal supplier. 14. To the extent that an approved digital marketplace is subsequently notified by Inland Revenue that one of their suppliers of low value goods to New Zealand is not correctly meeting their New Zealand GST obligations, we suggest that the following options would exist; 14.1. The digital marketplace could use commercial pressure to encourage the non- resident supplier to comply with the New Zealand GST rules within a set time frame, if this did not occur then, 14.2. The digital marketplace could either refuse to sell that non-resident supplier’s low value goods to New Zealand customers, or 14.3. have the rebuttable GST collection presumption reinstated on the digital marketplace in respect of that supplier; i.e. the digital marketplace would need to collect GST on the sales of that non-compliant non-resident supplier’s sales of low value goods through the digital marketplace to New Zealand customers for all future sales. 15. We submit that this rebuttable presumption approach, while increasing the overall complexity of the regime somewhat, would be a better approach in the long run to obtain a balance between collecting the appropriate amount of GST on low value goods in a difficult environment while preserving the principled basis of the New Zealand GST system. 16. We accept that Inland Revenue would potentially be required to create a greater number of GST registrations for non-resident suppliers under this rebuttable presumption approach. However our discussions with various parties have indicated that the number of underlying suppliers of goods may not be unmanageable. We understand that the “80/20” rule may apply here. The work Inland Revenue is doing RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 6 to check this issue with various marketplaces is to be commended and should continue. 17. This rebuttable presumption approach (allowing sales through Approved Marketplaces to initially look to the underlying legal supplier of the goods) will be technologically independent to method of selling the goods through the digital marketplace. When the GST taxing point is on the underlying legal supplier, then the method in which they make the sale of the low value goods via digital channels to the New Zealand customers is irrelevant. If the explosive growth of online sales of goods has taught us anything, it is that we cannot predict all the ways that goods will be sold to consumers. New and innovated distribution methods for low value goods are being developed all the time and there is a real risk that any legislative regime that is created in reference to a particular model of distribution runs the risk of becoming out of date very quickly. We do however always know that regardless of the distribution method being used, there will always be an entity that is the legal supplier of the low value good to the New Zealand customer, hence our preference on the underlying legal supplier of the goods. 18. Due to the selling technology indifference, the rebuttable presumption model will also not create any commercial pressures for digital marketplaces to adopt any particular method of operating such that they fall on one side or the other of any GST dividing line. We submit that it is desirable for tax legislation to have as little impact on the design of commercial operations as possible. 19. If the rebuttable presumption model was adopted, we consider it would be open to Inland Revenue to draft the definition of a “marketplace” in a broad manner. 20. We consider that the initial proposal for a “one size fits all” approach is problematic because digital marketplaces for goods display some unique characteristics, which require consideration in contrast to remote services. 20.1. Goods Marketplaces are less aggregated than similar platforms for offshore services. The disaggregation means that there are multiple business models being employed by goods Marketplaces which will be affected differently by the proposed changes – no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach will work for Marketplaces. 20.2. In our experience, digital marketplaces for services tend to be more direct with fewer distinct operating / business models applied. In contrast, there are a variety of business models currently employed by offshore suppliers selling goods for New Zealand consumption. For example, we are aware of Marketplaces that use the following models: 20.2.1. Direct selling / Out and out – i.e. selling as the principal, where legal ownership is with owner of the Marketplace; 20.2.2. Selling on behalf – where the Marketplace takes on some level of risk for the goods, advertises and facilitates payment; 20.2.3. Advertising and payment services; RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 7 20.2.4. Advertising-only services – i.e. no facilitation of payment, akin to the ‘classifieds’ section of a local newspaper; and 20.2.5. Offering a mixture of two or more of the above. 20.2.6. We also acknowledge that the future will result in a range of new and, possibly, unexpected business models we cannot currently conceive. We suggest that any new rules for GST on low value goods should be as independent as possible of the actual manner of selling the low value goods to allow for the future (currently unknown) developments in this area that are likely to occur. 20.3. We note further that within each of the above general categories are a spectrum of systems that will be affected differently by the proposed changes. For instance, while some platforms control the payment process and handle the flow of funds between consumer and underlying supplier, other platforms may facilitate payment without actually receiving or controlling any funds. It is particularly problematic to impose collection obligations on Marketplaces that do not have a part in the actual main cash flows from transactions. 20.4. Further, and perhaps most fundamentally, many Marketplaces do not take legal title over the goods sold through their platforms. To de-couple tax obligations from legal ownership of the goods is to separate the compliance burden from the recipient of (or creator of) value of the actual goods. Therefore we think lo w value goods are an appropriate situation, where provided certain conditions are satisfied, to allow the burden of GST compliance to remain the underlying legal supplier of the low value goods. 21. Taking these issues together, we recommend a two-tiered approach rebuttable presumption approach, where Inland Revenue requires ‘Approved Marketplaces’ to only provide information on suppliers and supplies made into New Zealand, with no liability to collect GST. In other words, all Marketplaces that meet the approval criteria are not required to collect GST on behalf of the underlying suppliers, but are required to provide the information necessary for Officials to be certain that offshore suppliers are correctly returning GST on imported low-value goods; and to enable Officials to identify and contact taxpayers with supplies that will exceed $60,000 \[or such lower amount as is determined to be appropriate\]. 21.1. We imagine that ‘Approved Marketplaces’ would have to satisfy Officials’ that they are able to report accurately on low-value imports through their platform to New Zealand with sufficient detail to simplify compliance procedures by Officials, and Officials would have to be comfortable in outsourcing this data- driven aspect of compliance. 21.2. Creating an ‘Approved Marketplaces’ exemption would ensure that different business models operate in a similar competitive environment, and would ensure that liability for GST sit s with the entity that has legal title of the goods at the point of sale, i.e. that the one receiving the funds for transferring legal title is the one collecting GST. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 8 21.3. ‘Approved Marketplaces’ would still be required to register for GST if its direct sales into New Zealand breach the registration threshold. 21.4. To the extent that the ‘Approved Marketplace’ has a supplier that does not comply with their New Zealand GST obligations, then following notification by Inland Revenue of the defaults, any future sales of low value goods to New Zealand customers via the ‘Approved Marketplace’ would require the ‘Approved Marketplace’ to collect GST as if they were legally sales of the marketplace. 22. We consider that this approach will be more effective because: 22.1. It balances the needs of Inland Revenue to collect GST on low value goods in a cost effective manner against the need to only impose GST on parties that are not the underlying legal suppliers of goods if absolutely necessary. 22.2. The reporting by ‘Approved Marketplaces’ will strongly incentivise underlying supplier compliance; 22.3. This lower burden on Marketplaces, provided they meet the criteria, will ensure that Marketplaces continue to find it easy to do business in / with New Zealand; 22.4. It removes GST considerations from decision-making on the best business model, recognising that digital industry depends on the certainty and simplicity of the regulatory environment; 22.5. It will balance the overall compliance cost of administering the system versus the potential tax revenues collected. As we understand the vast amount of GST is going to come from a relatively small number of larger offshore suppliers of the legal title to the low value goods; and 22.6. Recognises that digital marketplaces are a complex and dynamic environment that requires a flexible policy approach to future-proof the GST Act. 23. We also support the proposed concession to allow Marketplaces’ to act ‘as agent’ for underlying suppliers upon mutual agreement. A lower registration threshold? 24. Recognising that our proposed approach requires a concessionary stance by Officials, we submit that a lower registration threshold for offshore suppliers may counter- balance any concerns that putting liability on the underlying supplier will result in a lower level of compliance. 25. We consider that an appropriate threshold may be $30,000, though we note that this should be tested with real marketplace information from digital marketplaces to ensure that the right balance is struck between compliance costs on offshore suppliers, compliance costs for Inland Revenue and expected tax revenues. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 9 Re-deliverers 26. We submit that it should be made clear that while re-delivers will be required to collect and return GST on the value of the goods being re-delivered to New Zealand, any actual charges by the re-delivery for their services should be GST zero rated when provided by a New Zealand resident, and outside scope when provided by a non-resident. 27. We do not consider that there is any real risk in a practical sense of any form of ‘value substitution’ occurring when an unrelated re-deliver is providing re-delivery services. The non-resident supplier that is delivering goods to a non-New Zealand re-deliver address will generally have no knowledge that the goods will ultimately be sent to New Zealand. Therefore there will be no ability at all for value to be transferred from the goods to the transportation costs such that GST is avoided. Other submission points Process for goods imported 28. While not a revenue issue, we note that the paper does not contain detailed guidance on how, in practice, Customs processing of goods will occur to minimise delays. While this is a systems issue for the New Zealand Customs Service, it is directly tied to the proposals contained in the discussion document. Application date 29. We recommend that Officials review the proposed application date with Marketplaces and offshore suppliers to confirm that it will provide sufficient time for the development of required business systems and operating procedures required by the proposed changes. Data-driven approach 30. We recommend that Officials seek further information and data from Marketplaces to support the policy rationale with clear evidence-based thinking. Understanding the structure of the digital market, i.e. how many suppliers supply more than $30,000 or $60,000 annually into New Zealand, or what types of business models Marketplaces are applying, etc., for low-value goods will clarify the policy choices. Concluding statement Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on these proposals and for taking the time to consider our submission. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss these further in person. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1. Electronic Marketplace definition The EMP definition can be improved. For clarity, the Electronic Marketplace (EMP) needs to have access to the information that is necessary to determine the GST treatment of a good. In this respect the definition of an EMP should evolve to mirror a recently-released definition from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). This definition can be found here: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/e-Tax\_Guides/GST%20Taxing%20imported %20services%20by%20way%20of%20an%20overseas%20vendor%20registration%20regime.pdf Here we replicate the Singapore definition, which states that “an electronic marketplace is defined as a medium that: I. allows the suppliers to make supplies available to customers; and II. is operated by electronic means. This includes marketplaces operated via a website, internet portal, gateway, distribution platform or any other types of electronic interface, but excludes payment processors or internet service providers.” The EMP with the necessary information to comply can become liable for GST based on its contract with its merchant Therefore, we propose that the following should be added to the New Zealand definition of an EMP: “Any intermediary with the information that is necessary to determine the GST treatment and who contractually agrees to collect the GST.” RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2. EMP liability The EMP should be liable no matter where the underlying merchant (inside New Zealand or outside) is located. It is too burdensome to make a distinction. It is the underlying New Zealand merchant that should find a way to prove that the GST due was paid. The other option is to introduce exceptions. Exceptions, however, are difficult to manage and are subject to differing interpretations. 3. Foreign exchange rates In relation to foreign exchange (FX) rates. It should be authorised that a fixed rate equivalent can be determined for the year for goods that have a price close to the threshold of NZ$400 or less (excluding GST). It should be clear who needs to collect the GST, the foreign supplier or customs. Otherwise, the responsibility to collect the GST may change from one shipment to the next. Here, the real value at the time of the supply needs to be reported on the return. However, it should be a fixed value and should be agreed upon so as to know who is liable for the collection of the GST, the vendor or customs. 4. Proof of GST Payment We agree that proof of GST charged should be automatically linked to the package so that customs can check GST charged automatically without requesting proof from the customer. An automatic, and simplified, way to implement this process is necessary. 5. Refunds due to double taxation If double taxation occurs then the refund should be made by customs with a simplified process put in place. This simplified process is required so as not to place the burden of refunds on the foreign merchant that will, in turn, also need to update their original GST return. Foreign merchants will also have to retain the proof of the double taxation that occurred. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1 From: Sent:Wednesday, 2 May 2018 08:32 To: Policy Webmaster Subject: GST on low-value imported goods Dear Sir/Madam My feedback relates to the following rule: •Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect and return GST on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers if the value of the goods is $400 or less. Tariffs and cost recovery charges would no longer be collected on goods valued at or below this value. I propose that the value of $400 should be increased to $1,000 and the tariff and recovery charges also not collected on any goods valued at below that amount. The reason for this is the cost to overseas businesses in implementing these rules. The NZ government is proposing a requirement for GST to be collected on low value goods only – this means that the cost of implementing this for the overseas business relates to low value goods they are selling and therefore the cost to benefit is high for them. Having to charge GST on a books worth only $20 is a high price to pay to be able to supply to New Zealand consumers. In my experience most customers currently keep under that limit to ensure that GST and duties don’t also apply and I believe this will continue as duties can be very costly over the $400 value. Therefore increasing the limit will encourage and allow consumers to purchase more at once and help offset the costs the overseas business will now be incurring. The current $400 value has also not increased with inflation and buying power has therefore decreased when buying from offshore an increase would make up for this. The proposal ensures fairness for our NZ businesses and creates an equal playing field but this is not quite true as it adds a complexity that the NZ business does not have to face, increasing this level will ensure that we are not simply keeping an uneven playing filed but just changing the side that is affected the most. Finally with Australia implementing a similar scheme using the same $1,000 that they are proposing for the threshold will also reduce compliance costs for overseas businesses by keeping the schemes more aligned and leave less uncertainty over their sales.
