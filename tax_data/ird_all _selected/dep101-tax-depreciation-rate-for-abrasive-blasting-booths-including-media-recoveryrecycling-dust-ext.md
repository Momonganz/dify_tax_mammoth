Tax Depreciation Rate for abrasive blasting booths (including media recovery/recycling, dust extraction and ventilation systems)
================================================================================================================================

Determination DEP101 (2017) sets a depreciation rate for abrasive blasting booths (including media recovery/recycling, dust extraction and ventilation systems).

#### Note to Determination DEP101

The Commissioner has recently been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for abrasive blasting booths.

The asset consists of the abrasive blasting chamber, including the in-floor media recovery system and the media reclaimer/recycler. It does not include the blast pot, the air compressor systems and any separate dust extraction system. This is because these are considered standÂ­alone assets for which depreciation rates already exist.
