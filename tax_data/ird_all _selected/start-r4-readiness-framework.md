1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V1:00 BT Readiness Framework (forMain Releases and Other Initiatives) 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Readiness Framework Readiness forms part of the BT Deployment Strategy. The Readiness Framework has been developed to provide a singular approach and framework for stakeholders contributing to readiness assessment and release decision making. TheReadiness Framework is a decision support tool designed to provide status & visibility that the release is “where we planned to be” at a particular Checkpoint. Checkpoints 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The Readiness Framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness checklists, assessments and reports used at key checkpoints leading up to and during deployment for the main/major releases of the BT Programme •The Framework enables the release to assess progress and readiness to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the n ext. •Readiness is assessed at each of the checkpoints against a specific set of criteria, with residual risk visible throughout.T he size, reach, functional spread and complexityof a releaseinfluencesthebreadth and coverage of thecriteria assessed. •These criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and release,co llectively reflecting the readiness of our Customers,Service Providers, People, Business Units and the Release Delivery team. •The cumulative impact of prior Releases, other business activity and environmental conditions is assessed. •The assessment allows for the exception reporting to be tailored for Business Unit, Programme and Customer. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.C riteria rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business. Light Amber rated criteria may also be included should these be assessed as required, discretion will be applied. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline and additional checkpoints will be added as required to provide both additional a ssessment and certainty for decision makers. •The Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions are used to provide a consistent, familiar and standard reference. •Checkpoint dates are aligned with delivery phase gates,s cheduled governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the programme status at the time. •Note: Readiness for smaller / shorter running initiatives will complete an initiative readiness assessmenta s part of theirgo-l ive preparation which will not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component. These assessments will be covered by specific criteria within the Initiative checklist. START Delivery – Main Releases Readiness Framework Overview 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness assessment and reports used at checkpoints during the delivery lifecycle. •Readiness is assessed against a specific set of criteria (contained in a “master” initiatives readiness checklist), at agreeddate s or checkpoints, with both plans to green if applicable and residual risk captured throughout. •The size, complexity and functional spread of an initiative influencesth e criteria assessed and the number of checks completed.The checklist is adapted to suit. Criteria are never deleted, rather a column is provided for initiative specific positioning of the criteria – how it applies or does not apply, to the specific initiative. •Criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and initiative,co llectively reflecting the readiness of the initiative to either commence the deployment (the go/no-go) or proceed from a key stage/control gate to the next. •The number of checks may vary from the minimum of one (1) check immediately preceding the go-l ive (the go/no-go) as part of the deployment preparation, to multiple checks leading up to the go-live (the go/no-go) check. The initiative charter will define the approach to be used. •The cumulative impact of business-as-u sual activity, other initiatives, prior initiatives andenvironmental conditions (e.g., an election, holidays, etc) is also assessed. •The initiative readiness checklist does not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component.T hese assessments are be covered by specific criteria within the initiative readiness checklist. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline, checkpoint dates will be aligned with delivery phase gates,s cheduled governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the initiative status at the time and to provide certainty for decision makers. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.C riteria rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business. Light Amber (LA) rated criteria may also be included should these be assessed as required, discretion will be applied. •The Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions are used to provide a consistent, familiar and standard reference.

Readiness will vary by product and customer segment to recognise when the change needs to land with the customer, i.e., some readiness criteria extend beyond go-live. •Members of the External Stakeholder Engagement working group will review and endorse the assessment for each c heckpoint, including go to green plans where required.Customer segment leads will also review and provide feedback of the high-level assessment against criteria based on “where we expect to be” for each checkpoint. What’s different this release? Given the targeted customer groups impacted and smaller scale of the releases and initiatives in Stage 4: •No customer insight research is being conducted to inform the readiness assessment or marketing effectiveness, although th is will be conductedfor S4-1-R2 (child support and upgrading myIRto version 12). •Customer interaction testing of m yIRwill be reviewed and considered. •Customer readiness will be assessed against agreed criteria as reported by Community Compliance, Account Managers, P roduct Owners, Digital Ecosystem Team and others based on their interactions with customers and stakeholders using the risk RAG ratings detailed overleaf. Components of the Customer Readiness Assessment •Utilise metrics and data already collected including those relating to marketing & communications activities, for example, reach of direct mail, social media and advertising. •Reports via Account Managers (Account Managers, External Relationship Managers, Community Compliance and Significant E nterprises) against specific criteria on the readiness status of the customers, intermediaries and service partners they engage with. •Insights from Customer Design Validation into customers’ expectations of e-S ervices, including ease of use. •Assessment of known risks and issues. 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer ReadinessReporting At checkpoint 2 and 3, customerreadiness reporting provides the information required to satisfy the needs of the target audience to enable decision making e.g., customer readiness will beassessed by product and definedcustomer sub-segment. Checklist > Specific readiness criteria relevant for each checkpoint, agreed by the External Stakeholder Engagement working group. Enterprise Risk Framework Frameworksare used to define Current Status and Residual Risk Assess > Conduct assessment of evidence against the criteria for each Product before each checkpoint, including reasons if not green and go-to-green plan. Confirm assessment with the External Stakeholder Engagement working group and relevant Segment Leads. Report Summarise the point-in-time customer readiness assessment for each product, showing the RAG status, rationale and residual risk. It is important that to identify the “so what”. Thisallows the time to rectify prior to GoLive, or toensure that we “know what we areup against”should it be ahigh-risk area.This information alsofeeds intocontingency and Early Life Support planning. For any criteria indicating Light Amber to Redreport on: •Reason for not being Green •The Go to Green plan i.e., what activities are u nderway or planned to address reasons for not being green •The residual risk if the statusdo es not change, or deteriorates(using the Enterprise Risk Framework) 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] People Readiness Summary - 22- •The People Readiness Assessment is one component of the Readiness Framework.It assessessentiment and the comfort levelsof our people about the change coming i.e., "their hearts and minds".It is a component of business readiness which includes criteria about howpeople are feeling in general, with business readiness also including environmental criteria such as work on hand levels, burndown work, planning activities,prioritisation, recruitment activities, contingency plans and so forth. •Using lessons learned from previous releases, people readiness will still be assessed through in-person discussions and team surveys which enable valuable insight to be gathered from those directly impacted and allow themes to emerge quickly. •The assessment will be scaledto reflect the requirements of Stage 4, release 1, release 2 and other scope. •CCS Segment leads will review and provide feedback ofthe high-level assessment as part of the people and business readiness criteria for each checkpoint. •In addition to the report that goes to PGC, the results of the people readiness assessment will be shared with CCS Segment, Group and Team Leads to assist with their implementation planning. Components of the People Readiness Assessment Approach •“Close up” team interviews which are 30 minute discussions with the highly impacted teams using open ended questions to tease out themes and insights. Utilised mainly for those in Change Group A. •Team Surveys which are 6-7 minute surveys completed by the Team Lead following a team discussion based on a set of provided questions to assess the team's current level of awareness, understanding and readiness. Utilised for those in Change Group A and B). •Pulse Check Surveys which takes 1-2 minutes completed by a random sample of people from across the organisation to assess levels of awareness and understanding before go-live. Utilised for those in Change Group B andC). •Training uptake and insights (when training has commenced). 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Business Readiness Exception Reporting At each Checkpoint Business Readiness reporting provides the information required to satisfy the needs of the target audienceto enable decision making. Detail Checklist - containing specific readiness criteria relevant for each checkpoint Executive Summary Executive Exceptions detail •Reason not Green •Go to Green Plan •Business / Customer Risk at Go Live •Residual Risk Enterprise Risk Framework A “point in time” assessment is made for each criteria at each Checkpoint. For those criteria indicating Light Amber – Red status “exceptions’ the following details are collected: •Reason for not being Green •The “go to green” plan (i.e. what a ctivities are planned / underway to address reasons for not being Green) •The risk to the organisation (business, c ustomers etc) if status does not change (using the Enterprise Risk Framework) It is important that to identify the “so what”. This allows the time to rectify prior to Go Live, or to ensure that we “know what we are up against” should it be a high-risk area.This information also feeds into our contingency planning – so where possible high-risk areas have a contingency plan developed well ahead of Go Live.

The go- live committee therefore needs to consist of the most senior IR leaders representing the business, technology and the programme. Go-Live Committee When is it convened? The Go-Live Committee will convene at the following scheduled times (tbc): oMonday 18 Oct -4a oCommence Cutover oWednesday 27 Oct – 4b oOr (will depend when cut-over starts) oTuesday 26 Oct -4b oGo-Live or Rollback oOpen Channels oIn addition, the Go-Live Committee needs to be “on-call” from Monday 18 October until Monday 25 October should an urgent decision be required. oAny such unscheduled meeting would be exceptionally rare and where possible all decision making will be done in the pre-scheduled meetings. 30 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Role: The Go-Live Committee will be responsible for making the following decisions: 1.Should BT begin cutover of the major release into production based on the Readiness Assessment Framework 2.Should BT stop, pause or delay the cutover of the major release into production because of a major incident affecting IR or the cutover 3.Should BT roll back the major release from production because the go-live criteria cannot be meet within the agreed change window 4.Should the major release go-live because the go-live criteria have been met meaning cutover is complete and Early Life Support can commence. Responsibilities: •To provide executive level decision making during the cutover of the major release. •Ensure all decisions are made in a timely manner to minimise impact to business operations and customer experience. •To ensure that decisions are made in adherence to approved entry/exit criteria, and in the best interests of IR. •To ensure consistent distribution of key messages related to the successful deployment OR to ensure consistent distribution of key messages regarding the rationale for rolling back unsuccessful changes.
