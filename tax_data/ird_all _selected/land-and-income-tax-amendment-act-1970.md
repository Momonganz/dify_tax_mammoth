### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1970

#### Application of the Act

**Section 2.** Except where otherwise stated the amendments apply to the income year that began on 1 April 1970.

### Returns by Superannuation Funds

**Section 3** requires trustees of superannuation funds to make annual returns. Each fund has already been told of our requirements (See also sections 12, 13, 14 and 35).

### Farming Land Exempt From Land Tax

**Section 4** exempts from land tax land used for farming or agricultural purposes. This is land used for:

*   Animal husbandry (including land used for keeping poultry or bees or for horse breeding).
*   Growing fruit, vegetables or other crops.
*   Horticulture including plant nurseries.
*   Grape growing.

The exemption does not extend to land used for:

*   Forestry or silviculture.
*   A racecourse or horse training establishment.
*   Saleyards.
*   Wineries.

### Dividend Rebate

**Section 5.** For the income year that begins on 1 April 1971 the dividend rebate applies to a taxpayer whose taxable income is less than $4,000. Dividend income is taxed at the same rates as other income when the taxable income is $4,000 or more.

### Backpay Rebate

**Section 6** removes the optional rebate previously granted in Section 78G(3). The rebate is now 6c in the dollar on the portion of the backpay applicable to an earlier year, or the amount of the taxable income whichever is the less.

### Visiting Experts

**Section 7** authorises the payment of the fees, salary and allowances of the non-government member of the "Visiting Experts Advisory Committee".

### Special Exemption for Wife/Husband

**Sections 8 and 9.** The exemption for a dependent wife/husband is increased from $240 to $275. This reduces $1 for $1 when the wife's/husband's income for the year exceeds $375. There is no exemption when the wife's/husband's income exceeds $650.

### Housekeeper Exemption

**Section 10** increases the exemption for a housekeeper from $240 to $275.

### Life Insurance Exemption

**Section 11.** The maximum exemption for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions is increased from:

*   $500 to $700 for a taxpayer who is a contributor to an employer-subsidised superannuation fund, and
*   $650 to $950 for any other individual taxpayer.

### Liability of Superannuation Funds

**Section 12** repeals the absolute exemption which existed for superannuation funds.

### Investment Requirements By Superannuation Funds

**Sections 13 and 14** set out the requirements for investment in Government/Local Body securities which must be met before certain private superannuation funds will be exempt from income tax. The Department has explanatory notes on these sections.

### Share Option or Purchase Schemes

**Section 15.** The general rule for valuing benefits received is amended so that restrictions in dealing with shares are ignored unless they apply for at least eight years or earlier death. If however, there are certain restrictions on the sale of shares when an employee ceases employment before eight years these restrictions will be taken into account in valuing those shares.

### Forestry Encouragement Grants

**Section 16** deals with treatment for income tax purposes of Forestry Encouragement Grants.

*   A grant made for the labour of a landowner and his family is assessable income.
*   A grant for expenditure is not assessable income.
*   No deduction is allowed for this expenditure unless and to the extent that it is more than twice the amount of the grant.

### Income Tax and Payroll Tax Not Deductable

**Section 17.** Neither New Zealand nor foreign payroll or income taxes are allowable deductions from assessable income.

### Special Depreciation Allowances Extended

**Section 24** extends to 31 March 1972 the investment allowance of 20% on plant, machinery and buildings for use in redevelopment projects on the West Coast of the South Island.

### Farm Development Expenditure

**Section 26** relates to expenditure on land used for farming and agricultural purposes.

*   The allowance is extended to 31 March 1972.
*   As from 1 April 1970 supporting frames constructed on the land for growing crops have been added to the items deductible under the section.

### Investment Allowance

**Sections 22, 23, and 25** reintroduce the investment allowance of 10% on the cost of certain plant and machinery. The allowance is for new plant and machinery for:

*   Manufacturing,
*   Farming and agriculture,
*   Fishing,for which a binding contract was entered into on or after 26 June 1970 and before 31 March 1972, or for which on or after 26 June 1970 certain preliminary steps have been taken towards a binding contract for the purchase or construction of plant or machinery.

### Export Market Development and Tourist Promotion Expenses

*   Extends to 31 March 1974 the 50% additional deduction for qualifying export market and tourist promotion expenses.
*   Amends the Tax Act to enable export agents who are rewarded by commissions to qualify for the incentive.

### Export Market Development by Self-Employed Taxpayers
