Outline of section (2) This section provides for an adjustment to the amount of a conduit company’s foreign dividends, and for an amount of income derived by the company and a debit arising in its conduit tax relief account through the following calculations that determine: (a) the tax cash value of the surplus amount (subsection (3)); and (b) the amount of the adjustment (subsection (5)) and amount of income (subsection (7)); and (c) the amount of the debit (subsection (8)). Surplus amount as percentage: formula (3) The surplus amount is given its tax cash value for the tax year, being the lesser of 1 and the percentage calculated using the formula— surplus amount x rate group dividend withholding payments. Definition of items in formula (4) In the formula in subsection (3),— (a) surplus amount is the amount that is the difference between the result of the calculation made under section FF 5(2) and that made under section FF 6(4) as described in subsection (1): (b) rate is the rate of income tax set out in schedule 1, part A, clause 5 for the tax year: (c) group dividend withholding payments is the total amount of dividend withholding payments— (i) calculated after taking into account an amount of a net loss that the conduit company chooses to use to satisfy a liability to pay some or all of a dividend withholding payment under section NH 3 (Payment and recovery of dividend withholding payment), but before taking into account a reduction in liability under section NH 7 (Reduction in liability under conduit tax relief); and Part F - Recharacterisation 49 (ii) required to be deducted from dividends paid during the tax year to a company that is a member of the conduit company’s FAI group at the end of the tax year.

Conduit company’s election (2) If the debt percentage of a conduit company’s New Zealand FAI group for a tax year is more than 66%, the company may choose to calculate the debt percentage of its consolidated FAI group under section FF 9, as modified by subsection (3).
