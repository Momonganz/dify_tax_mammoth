Corrections
-----------

The _Increasing electronic filing_ item published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 30 No 5 contained an error on page 36 in the _Key features_ section.  
  
The text reads:  

"An investment income payer who does provide their investment income information to the Commissioner electronically is subject to a penalty of $250, due and payable 30 days after the end of the month in which the payer was required to provide the information to the Commissioner electronically".

It should read:  

"An investment income payer who does **not** provide their investment income information to the Commissioner electronically is subject to a penalty of $250, due and payable 30 days after the end of the month in which the payer was required to provide the information to the Commissioner electronically."

* * *

The _Measures to encourage provision of IRD numbers_ item, published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 30 No 5, contained an error on page 34 under the heading _Joint investors IRD numbers_.  
  
This section should have also included the following line:

"This does not apply to a joint investment made through an intermediary that is a company, trust or partnership. These investments should be treated as made by a single investor. A custodian may also adopt this treatment."
