Telling us about income
-----------------------

If you receive more than $200 in income with no tax deducted, you'll need to tell us. You do that on an individual tax return - IR3.

The IR3 is used at the end of the tax year to:

*   tell us about all your taxable income
*   claim expenses, such as costs for operating your business or maintaining your rental property
*   calculate your tax assessment so you know how much tax to pay or refund to expect.
