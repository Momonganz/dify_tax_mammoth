Determination PROV21: Tax Depreciation Rates
============================================

Determination PROV21 (2011) sets a provisional depreciation rate for a fleet tracking unit which enables the home base to monitor a vehicle's position.

#### **Fleet tracking unit â€“ Depreciation**

* * *

The Commissioner has set a provisional depreciation rate for a fleet tracking unit.

Fleet tracking units are hardwired into a vehicle and enable the vehicle's home base to monitor the vehicle's position via mobile phone network, or an internet server. The sophistication of a fleet tracking unit can range from a simple tracking unit that shows the location of a fleet vehicle on a map, to more elaborate custom applications that can provide a dashboard-style view of all fleet vehicles on a map plus information about the condition and use of each vehicle, for example, when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, when a fault occurs in the vehicle, or when scheduled maintenance is due. Fleet tracking units can also include the ability for fleet managers to send and receive text messages to and from the vehicle.

This provisional depreciation rate determination does not apply to plug-n-play GPS map display units used by drivers for navigation purposes.
