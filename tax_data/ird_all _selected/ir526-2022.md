WHAT YOU CAN CLAIM? Donations If you have receipts, you can claim a tax credit for donations of $5 or more. A donation is a gift of money, including payments made by bank transfers, credit card or cheques, made voluntarily to a school/kindergarten or a donee organisation, where there is no identifiable direct benefit to the donor, or the donor's family. It does not include a gift that is testamentary or made by way of a full or partial debt forgiveness. Go to ird.govt.nz/donations for a list of approved donee organisations. School/kindergarten donations - Box 3 You can claim a donation tax credit for school fees or to state-run kindergartens as long as they go to the general fund. Religious organisation donations - Box 4 A religious organisation donation is an unconditional donation made to a donee religious organisation or group. Other donations - Box 5 You can claim all other donations that have been made to an approved charitable organisation. CLAIMING DONATIONS The total donations you claim can not be more than your taxable income for the year. If you need to file an IR3 income tax return, we will need your return to check your taxable income before we can process your claim. If you have losses brought forward greater than your taxable income, you have no taxable income, so the credit cannot be claimed. We cannot process your claim before the end of the income year which it relates to. The exceptions are if you are completing the claim on behalf of a deceased person, or going overseas permanently or for a significant period of time. HOW MUCH YOU CAN CLAIM? The total you can claim in one tax year is the lesser of: 33.33% of your total donations, or 33.33% of your taxable income. Go to ird.govt.nz/donations for more information. SPLITTING RECEIPTS WITH YOUR SPOUSE/PARTNER If your total donations were more than your taxable income you can split your tax credit with your spouse or partner. You would claim up to your income amount and your spouse/partner would claim the rest. Example Your taxable income is $1,000 but you have receipts of $1,500. You are only eligible to claim $1,000, if your spouse/partner has income of $500 or more then they can claim the other $500.
