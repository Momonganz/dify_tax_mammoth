Residential Rental Property Chattels
====================================

Determination DEP 80 (2011) provides a new list of assets for the 'Residential Rental Property Chattels' industry category.

See also [QB 20/01: Can owners of existing residential rental properties claim deductions for costs incurred to meet Healthy Homes standards?](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2020/qb-20-01)

**Note to Determination DEP 80**  
Following the issue of _[Interpretation Statement 10/01: Residential Rental Properties - depreciation of items of depreciable property](/interpretation-statements/is1001-residential-rental-properties-depreciation-of-items-of-depreciable-property)
_ ("IS 10/01") in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22 No 4 (May 2010) the Commissioner has issued a general depreciation determination to provide a new list for the "Residential Rental Property Chattels" industry category. The list is consistent with the Commissioner’s position set out in IS 10/01 and includes items of depreciable property that are commonly found in residential properties.

Note: Some of these items cost less than $500.00 and under section EE 38 of the Income Tax Act 2007 low cost items (not part of any other property) may be treated as an expense item rather than separate depreciable property. Other items not common to residential rental properties have been removed but taxpayers may use a depreciation rate for a similar item in another industry or asset category. For example, depreciation rates for Spa pools/saunas that are listed in the "Leisure" industry category may be used.
