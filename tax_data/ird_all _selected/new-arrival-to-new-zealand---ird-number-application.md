Te tono tau tāke ina tae tauhō - u mai koe ki Aotearoa New arrival to New Zealand - IRD number application
==========================================================================================================

This process is designed for people who have recently arrived in New Zealand.

If you currently live overseas use the 'Living overseas' process.

Save time by using your visa to get an IRD number
-------------------------------------------------

If you've arrived in New Zealand, use this process to give us permission to check your identity with Immigration New Zealand (NZ). Applying for an IRD number as a 'new arrival' saves you from sending the same identification documents to us.

Time limit on applications
--------------------------

**If you have an Australian passport:**

You will not have a visa from Immigration NZ, but you'll often have 4 to 6 weeks after you arrive to use this process.

**If you hold a visa from Immigration NZ:**

With your visa from Immigration NZ, there will be wording around an arrival time. There will be a final date by which you must arrive in New Zealand. It's also the date you must apply for an [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
 if you want to use this process. If you wait until after this date, you'll need to apply for an IRD number as 'living in New Zealand and not a new arrival'.

Wanting or needing to apply for an IRD number using another way
---------------------------------------------------------------

If we cannot verify your identity using your visa, you'll need to apply for an IRD number in a different way. Depending on your situation, you'll need to apply either as:
