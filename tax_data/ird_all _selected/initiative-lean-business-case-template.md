PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
===================

|     |
| --- |
| Problem Statement |
| _“What problem are we addressing?” “What is the impact of this problem – for whom?”_ |

|     |
| --- |
| Problem Context |
| _What is the purpose for making a decision, why are we doing it, what do we want to achieve, why now and what is the perspective (assumptions, view point) of how the team have approached the decision, what conversations are required and with whom._ |

OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION
=======================

|     |
| --- |
| Opportunity Hypothesis |
| _Description of the opportunity, how does it work, what value does it provide, how does that value compare to today._<br><br>_What makes this better than today, why is this change necessary, how does this candidate align with the Strategic Drivers._<br><br>1.  _Improving data quality across the ecosystem_<br>2.  _Upping our game in how we apply analytics_<br>3.  _Understanding and proactively responding to the emergent customer interaction model_<br>4.  _Continue driving towards make compliance easier for our SME and micro customers_<br>5.  _Build the people capability needed to support our new multi-channel interaction model and leverage the transformation enablers that are now in place._ |

|     |
| --- |
| Leading Indicators |
| *   _What do we know of today that reflects the problem, its scale, and the outcomes the organisation is seeking?_<br>*   _What are the measures that will help predict the business and/or customer outcome hypothesis?_ |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Business Outcome Hypothesis | Customer Outcome Hypothesis |
| *   _What are the measurable benefits the business can expect if the Opportunity Hypothesis is correct?_ | *   _What are the measurable benefits the customer can expect if the Opportunity Hypothesis is correct? (This could be additional or relieved customer cost/effort required to meet tax obligations and/or seek entitlements)_ |

|     |
| --- |
| Timing considerations |
| _Are there any legislation dates, natural business rhythms or other timing constraints e.g. platform end of life, concurrent initiatives, dependencies, sequencing etc driving when this initiative should be delivered by._<br><br>_Consider if the delivery could be broken up into smaller pieces to deliver value earlier._ |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Customers |     |
| _A description of the customers using or affected by this service and_ | % of \_\_\_\_\_ users/customer |
| _Approximate size of the impacted customer group_ |
| Activity |     |
| _The activity or service the customer group is utilising_ | % of \_\_\_\_ actions |
| _Approximate size of the activity/ effort_ |

For each of the categories below please specify whether the saving/s identified are **Realisable** (eventuate in a direct cost reduction against any operating budget?) OR Non-Realisable (Will not directly result in a change to any operating budget?)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Annual Operational Cost Savings | Annual Customer Compliance Savings (Cost/Effort) |
| *   _Assess the approximate value contribution of implementing the change._<br>*   _Time to realise - the point that value can be realised (i.e. immediate, <1 month, <3 months, <6 months, 6+ months)._ | *   _Assess the approximate value contribution of implementing the change._<br>*   _Time to realise - the point that value can be realised (i.e. immediate, <1 month, <3 months, <6 months, 6+ months)_ |

|     |
| --- |
| Revenue Savings |
| _Is there expected to be a direct impact to and/or additional Crown Revenue?_<br><br>_This can be considered in one of the following two ways:_<br><br>*   _Money In: Revenue gained by IR if this change is made._<br>*   _Money Out: Entitlements gained by IR's customers if this change is made._<br><br>_Assessment would be against the value IR would receive and time it takes for IR to realise the value (i.e. immediate, <1 month, <3 months, <6 months, 6+ months)._ |
