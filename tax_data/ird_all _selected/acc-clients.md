If ACC pays for you to have a carer you may have tax responsibilities, depending on whether:

*   ACC pays your carer or your carer's agency directly
*   ACC pays you, and then you pay your carer or agency.

Choosing who you want ACC to pay
--------------------------------

ACC will send you a 'How would you like us to pay for your care?' - ACC84 form. If you have more than 1 carer, you need to complete a form for each carer.

Your carer(s) need to complete some parts of the form before you send it back to ACC. 

At the end of the tax year
--------------------------

Depending on who ACC pays, you have different responsibilities.

My responsibilities

What are my responsibilities when ...

Select what applies to you ACC pays my carer or agency I did not pay a carer or agency I paid only part of the payment to my carer or agency I paid the full payment amount to my carer or agency

If ACC pays your carer, or you use an agency, ACC or the agency will keep records and take care of the tax on your carer's wages.

When you keep the full payment and do not pay a carer or agency, the following applies.

### You need to choose a tax rate

The standard rate of tax for this type of payment is 10.5%. Depending on your circumstances you may need to have a different rate.

To find out more about choosing the right tax rate, read the schedular payments information.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

If you do not complete an ACC84 before ACC makes the first payment, they will deduct tax at the non-declaration rate of 45%.

If you have a tailored tax rate certificate or certificate of exemption, give it to ACC with your ACC84 form.

### Your income details

At the end of the tax year, the amount you received from ACC along with the tax credits, will show as schedular income on your income tax assessment.

If you file an Individual income tax return - IR3, the amount will show as schedular payments in your Summary of income. If you file online, we'll add the amount into your online return.

### Records you need to keep

You will need to keep the following records for 7 years:
