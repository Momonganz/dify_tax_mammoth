25OIA1184 Page 1 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 12 September 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 15 August 2024. Your full request is detailed in Appendix A, enclosed. On 3 September 2024, you clarified your request for ‘Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises’ and asked for this information to be broken down by industry codes and for the data in scope of this part of your request on large companies who have non-resident ownership to be presented only in aggregate form. As data on large companies who have non-resident ownership is not held by Inland Revenue in aggregate form, and as per your instructions, this part of your request (item 2c of ‘Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises’) is considered to have been withdrawn. You also clarified the timeframe for the ‘Extent of the use of new discretion for tax pooling’ part of your request to be for the periods from enactment to 30 June 2023 and 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. As ‘the value of the tax they have applied for’ in items 1 and 2 of this part of your request cannot be provided without substantial collation, you agreed for this information to be provided in the same manner as it was provided in your previous request \[24OIA1133 refers\]. You also asked Inland Revenue to include a list of tax types where applications have been approved/declined. Information being released Information provided for the 2023/24 tax year are lower as not all returns have for this period have been filed/completed. Provisional and terminal tax paid by provisional tax method I have interpreted this part of your request to be for the number of taxpayers who used a provisional tax method for 2023 and 2024 (these customers would have had RIT >$5,000 for the 2022 and 2023 tax year respectively) and have RIT for 2023 and 2024 (once the return is filed) greater than $5,000. The information requested for the 2022/23 and 2023/24 tax years is detailed in tables 1 and 2 respectively on the following page. 25OIA1184 Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Table 1: Provisional tax method information – 2022/23 (year ending 31 March 2023) Provisional tax method Number of taxpayers RIT value ($) Accounting income method 1,338 $71,848,614 Estimation option 21,918 $1,409,572,834 Ratio option 1,069 $55,488,014 Standard option 271,825 $20,736,726,318 Total 296,150 $22,273,635,781 Table 2: Provisional tax method information – 2023/24 (year ending 31 March 2024) Provisional tax method Number of taxpayers RIT value ($) Accounting income method 680 $33,134,498 Estimation option 15,272 $510,811,298 Ratio option 398 $19,672,774 Standard option 108,315 $4,715,500,710 Total 124,665 $5,279,119,281 Payment behaviour by safe harbour taxpayers vs non-safe harbour taxpayers Table 3 below details the number of payments, the paid amount, penalties and interest for the 2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23 tax years for safe harbour taxpayers.

Yours sincerely Teressa Dillon Domain Lead, Performance and Reporting 25OIA1184 Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix A: Your OIA request With the 2022/23 income tax year now closed for tax pooling, we’re keen to obtain the latest information about provisional taxpayers to keep our presentations and material up to date. 1 Provisional and terminal tax paid by provisional tax method We are interested in trends in the number of provisional taxpayers, the provisional tax method they are using, and the value of tax they pay (both provisional and terminal). For the 2022/23 tax year please provide 1. The number of taxpayers who used: • The accounting income method • The standard option • The estimation option • The ratio option. 2. The total value of residual income tax (RIT) for taxpayers using each method listed above. For the 2023/24 tax year: 1. The number of taxpayers using each method: • The accounting income method • The standard option • The estimation option • The ratio option. 2. The value of the provisional tax obligations of taxpayers using each method listed above. Payment behaviour by safe harbour taxpayers vs non-safe harbour taxpayers We are interested in the impact of changes in interest rules on the payment behaviour of safe harbour taxpayers (provisional taxpayers with RIT<$60k), compared to non-safe harbour taxpayers. To help us understand this, we are requesting data for three income tax periods. For each of the 2020/21, 2021/22 and 2022/23 tax years, please provide the data points representing by \[x\] in the table below: Safe harbour taxpayers Non-safe harbour taxpayers # Taxpayers $ # Taxpayers $ Value of Residual income tax \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Late payment penalties \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Dr UOMI interest \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Cr UOMI interest \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] # Payments $ # Payments $ 1 Please note when we refer to value in this request, we’re interested in the total amount of tax payable (provisional tax + terminal tax) – excluding any taxpayers who were in a loss or were not above the provisional tax threshold. We think this is usually best represented by total Residual Income Tax (RIT). 25OIA1184 Page 6 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Safe harbour taxpayers Non-safe harbour taxpayers On time payments \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Payment not on time \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] \[x\] Tax paid by Industry and Significant Enterprises We are interested what industries provisional taxpayers operate in and their relative tax contributions. Given there have been substantial economic and global events over the last 6 years, we’re interested in data over 6 income tax periods. 1. For the 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23 periods, can you please provide the following information by Industry, using the ANZSIC divisions: • Number of taxpayers • Total RIT paid • Late payment penalties • Dr use of money interest • Cr use of money interest 2. The same data above, for the same periods split by each category of “Significant Enterprises” and other taxpayers: a. Companies or groups of companies with annual turnover of more than $100 million b. Companies whose industry is governed by specialised taxation legislation c. Large companies who have non-resident ownership. Extent of the use of new discretion for tax pooling Last year we requested information on the Commissioner’s then new tax pooling discretion under the Income Tax Act 2007, s.RP17B (12)-(13). Another year on, we’re interested in the number and nature of applications for discretion, and whether there are any significant trends in the types of tax being applied for, and any common grounds for discretion not being granted. Please provide the following data split over the two periods from enactment to 30 June 2023 and from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2024: 1. Can you please advise in aggregate and by tax type: • The number of taxpayers who have applied • The value of the tax they have applied for • In the number of taxpayers who have been approved • In the number of taxpayers who have been declined. 1. Where applications have been declined, please advise the main reasons for applications being denied, for example: • The voluntary disclosure was not made “within reasonable time” • Commissioner is not satisfied the taxpayer met the criteria under subsection 13 (e.g. failure to take reasonable steps to comply). If data that could be provided directly in an excel readable or otherwise structured format would be appreciated.
