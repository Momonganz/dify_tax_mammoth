Tax Depreciation Rate for pushrod/cable propelled pipeline camera inspection systems (not including pipeline crawlers)
======================================================================================================================

This determination sets a depreciation rate for pushrod/cable propelled pipeline camera inspection systems used to inspect pipework, for example domestic household sewer pipes or water pipes.

**Note to Determination DEP105:**

The Commissioner has been asked to consider what depreciation rate should apply for pushrod/cable propelled pipeline camera inspection systems used to inspect pipework, for example domestic household sewer pipes or water pipes.

The asset is basically a compact waterproof camera with an illumination source, capable of operation inside pipes, with rechargeable batteries or a mains supply cable. Push rods are provided with a self-levelling camera head and an iPad or similar device used as a monitor/control station. There is also a separate handheld locator device which picks up a beacon signal emitted from the camera, so that underground location and the layout of the pipe can be identified.

There appears to be a large range of pipeline camera inspection systems. This determination covers the simple pushrod/cable propelled pipeline camera inspection systems. The remote operated tractor/crawler vehicle type systems are treated as a separate asset class (“pipeline crawler”) in the “Dairy plant”, “Fishing”, “Oil and gas industry” industry categories and “Compressed air plant (where not industry specified)”, “Factory and other sundries”, “Reticulation systems, including power generation (excluding electrical, communications and gas reticulation)”, ‘Water and effluent treatment (where not industry specified)” asset categories.
