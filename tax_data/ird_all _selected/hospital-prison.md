==========================================================================================================================================================

If you're a prison inmate, hospital or rehabilitation centre patient for at least 13 weeks in a row, you can apply for an exemption to stop or reduce your child support payments.

Prisoners must apply for an exemption while still in prison.

Hospital patients have up to 3 months after leaving hospital to apply for an exemption.

To qualify for this exemption, your taxable income must be:

*   only from investment income
*   less than the minimum annual rate for that child support year.

[Child support annual rates](/child-support/types/formula-assessment/amount/annual-rates)
  
  
You may still qualify if you're earning a benefit at the hospital rate or a full benefit for part of the time you're in the hospital.

Prison allowances do not count as income, though salary and wages through a release-to-work programme do. If you are receiving salary and wages from a release-to-work programme, you will not qualify for the exemption and will need to continue paying child support.

You must send us your application while you are in prison or within 3 months of being discharged from hospital. If you owe child support, you may still have to make those payments to avoid penalties.

If your situation changes, let us know. This way, you can make sure you're paying the right amount and avoid penalties.
