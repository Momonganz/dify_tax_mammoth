Before you start
----------------

If you want to know the depreciation rate for an asset, you’ll need to know the date you acquired the asset and then confirm that you don’t know the depreciation rate.

And, if you want to calculate the depreciation, you’ll also need to know the:

*   cost or adjusted tax value
*   business use percentage (if less than 100%)
*   depreciation method you want to use
*   disposal date, if applicable.  
      
    

Buildings

Buildings rates were changed from the 2011-12 through to the 2020-21 income years. Refer to the Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 for how these apply to you.

If the asset is a non-residential building with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more, you’ll need to use the opening tax book value as at the first day of your 2020-21 income year if either of the following apply:

*   owned the building during the 2010-11 income year
*   acquired the building after the 2010-11 income year and before the 2020-21 income year.

If the asset is a building which was acquired before the 2011-12 income year and has an estimated useful life of 50 years or more, we will not be able to provide a final calculation on disposal.
