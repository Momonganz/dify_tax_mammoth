### Retargeting ads on online advertising platforms

Retargeting (also known as remarketing) is a way to target ads to people who have interacted with previous phases of an advertising campaign.

It’s made possible by in-app tracking. This means only people who have their social media app permissions set to allow in-app tracking will receive ‘re-targeted’ ads. You can change these permissions within your social media apps.  

For some of our marketing campaigns we’ll use retargeting ads to deliver specific messages to customers who are most likely impacted or interested in the content.
