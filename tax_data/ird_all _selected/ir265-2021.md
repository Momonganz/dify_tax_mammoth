IR265 July 2021 General depreciation rates The information in this guide is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. 2 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Introduction General depreciation rates This guide sets out the general depreciation rates for both diminishing value (DV) and straight line (SL) that apply to assets acquired in the 2006 and later tax years. Inland Revenue sets the depreciation rates in the form of general and provisional determinations for all depreciable assets, other than fixed-life intangible depreciable assets or excluded depreciable assets, based on an asset's estimated useful life. New determinations and provisional determinations are published on ird.govt.nz and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). For more detailed information on fixed-life intangible assets see the Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Excluded depreciable assets must be depreciated using the historic rates - see our guide Historic depreciation rates - IR267, available on our website ird.govt.nz under "Forms and guides". Our online depreciation rate finder allows you to quickly search for assets across all industry and asset categories. The depreciation rates are set out in industry and asset categories. Assets which are unique to one or two specific industries are listed under the industry category. Assets which are typically used in a variety of different industries (for example, tanks, boilers and heating) are listed under the asset category. Assets are listed alphabetically within each industry and asset category. The following details are shown for each asset: • Column 1 - the estimated useful life • Column 2 - the DV rate • Column 3 - the SL rate Depreciation loading Before 21 May 2010, a 20% loading could be applied to the DV or SL depreciation rate in certain cases. The loading accelerated the depreciation of eligible assets. It generally applied to new assets never used or held for use in New Zealand and imported second-hand assets. The asset must have been purchased after the beginning of the 1995-96 income year. For buildings, imported used cars, second-hand assets acquired in New Zealand and depreciable intangible property, the 20% loading didn't apply. Any asset purchased on or after 21 May 2010 isn't entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. However, if you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. The general depreciation rates, including the 20% loading, are listed in the table on the following page. Special rules that apply to buildings Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 must apply the rates from the 2005-06 year except: • buildings acquired as relationship property or under a wholly owned group company transfer that the previous owner depreciated using the old building depreciation rates - in which case those rates continue to apply, and • buildings that were purchased, or to be built, and the relevant contract was signed prior to 19 May 2005, the old building depreciation rates also continue to apply. ird.govt.nz 3 2006 and future years asset rates Assets other than buildings acquired on or after 1 April 2005 Buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005\*\* DV rate (%)DV rate +20% loading (%)\* SL rate (%)SL rate +20% loading (%)\* DV rate (%)SL rate (%) 22.41.51.81.31 44.833.632 67.244.84.53 89.667.26.54 101278.48.55 1315.68.510.2116.5 1619.210.512.613.58 202413.516.200 253017.52100 30362125.200 4048303600 5060404800 6780.46780.400 10010010010000 10010010010000 \* The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. \*\* For buildings, depreciation will reduce to 0% from the 2011-12 income year where they have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Between the 2012 and 2020 income years, depreciation on buildings was reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applied to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property, and regardless of when the building was acquired. For the 2021 and subsequent income years, the depreciation rates of 2% DV and 1.5% SL were introduced for non-residential buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Although a 0% depreciation rate continues to apply to residential buildings, they remain in the tax base and when they are sold for more than the book value, an adjustment will be required for any depreciation (claimed prior to the 2012 income year) recovery. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which an asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. The fact that an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas won't reduce its estimated useful life. Maximum depreciation claims Whether you're using the straight line (SL) or diminishing value (DV) method you can't claim depreciation in excess of the cost price/value of the depreciable asset. To make sure you don't claim more depreciation than you're entitled to, you need to keep a track of the adjusted tax value of the asset. You'll need to keep a fixed assets register with the following information: • a description of the asset • original purchase price or valuation • date the asset was acquired and the date in service • estimated useful life of asset • depreciation method to be used for the asset • percentage of private use if any • the adjusted tax value for each year. You use this information to complete a depreciation schedule. 4 GENERAL DEPRECIATION RATES Example 1 April 2011 Simone purchases a dishwasher for $1,200, used 100% for business. Using the straight line depreciation method the rate is 13.5%. Original cost Depreciation rate Depreciation claimed Adjusted tax value Year 1$1,20013.5%$162.00$1,038 Year 2$1,20013.5%$162.00$876 Year 3$1,20013.5%$162.00$714 Year 4$1,20013.5%$162.00$552 Year 5$1,20013.5%$162.00$390 Year 6$1,20013.5%$162.00$228 Year 7$1,20013.5%$162.00$66 Year 8$1,20013.5%$66$0.00 Simone can claim $162.00 for the first seven years. However, in the eighth year the final claim is $66.00. This is because the dishwasher's adjusted tax value is less than the original calculated depreciation of $162.00. The amount of depreciation claimed can't exceed the adjusted tax value so no further depreciation can be claimed on the dishwasher after year seven. Buildings and building fit-out asset categories The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: • a structure of considerable size • permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time • enclosed by walls and a roof • able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 10/02 "Meaning of 'building' in the depreciation provisions" provides a full explanation and can be found in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010). The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it doesn't form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that Inland Revenue will apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's seen as being part of the building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). How to find the right rate Follow this step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate. 1. See the "Industry" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate industry category for your industry and your asset is listed there, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 2. 2. See the "Asset" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate asset category and your asset is listed, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 3. 3. If the asset is listed under an industry category (step 1) which isn't your main industry, and you use the asset in a similar way to the industry shown, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 4. 4. If none of the first three steps apply, use the default class from the appropriate asset category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 5. If none of the first four steps apply, use the default class rate from the appropriate industry category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 6. Where there is no appropriate listing for your asset under an industry or asset category, you can apply for a provisional depreciation rate.
