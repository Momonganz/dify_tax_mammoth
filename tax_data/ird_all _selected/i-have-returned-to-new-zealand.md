Kua hoki mai au ki Aotearoa I have returned to New Zealand
==========================================================

Welcome back to Aotearoa New Zealand. Here's some info on the ways we can help you settle back in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Get your IRD number

Your IRD number helps you keep track of the tax you pay and get the right entitlements. It's unique to you. If you had an IRD number but cannot remember it, we can help.

Show all

If you think you had an IRD number before you left

*   Use our 'Find my IRD number' service.  
    [Find my IRD number](/managing-my-tax/ird-numbers/find-my-ird-number)
    
*   Call us on 0800 227 774. After answering our security questions we'll be able to update your details and advise you of your IRD number. Please be aware that the longer you've been away, the harder it may be to pass our security questions.
*   Complete an ‘IRD number application – resident individual - IR595’ and select ‘requesting confirmation of your IRD number’ at Step 4. Take your completed IR595 to any PostShop or AA with your passport and another form of photo ID and we’ll post you your IRD number within 10 working days.
*   Visit one of our offices with photo ID. We’ll update your details and print you a letter with your IRD number on it.

New to New Zealand and hold a New Zealand passport

*   You can apply online, then take your original ID to an AA office to verify your identity.

*   If you do not have the correct documents and you’ve completed your stay in isolation, you’ll need to complete an ‘IRD number application – resident individual - IR595’ and take it to one of our offices with your original ID.

New to New Zealand and hold a New Zealand residency visa or Australian passport

*   You can apply online, with a special code supplied to you by Immigration New Zealand. After Immigration verify your details we’ll issue you an IRD number.

New to New Zealand and hold a visitor, work, or student visa

*   You can apply online if your visa has not changed since you entered New Zealand, and you’ve received a special code from Immigration New Zealand.  
    [Apply for an IRD number – new arrival to New Zealand](/managing-my-tax/ird-numbers/ird-numbers-for-individuals/new-arrival-to-new-zealand---ird-number-application)

### If you want to start a business

If you are wanting to set up a company, trust, partnership or other type of business, you'll need a different IRD number for each one.

### Get it done online

myIR is our secure online service and it can be used to do things like updating your contact details, filing your tax returns and sending us messages. Things might have changed since you were last in New Zealand – most Kiwis now have myIR. If you have not already registered for myIR, find out how you can.

### If you have a student loan

If you have a student loan, you’ll remain an overseas-based customer until you’ve been back in New Zealand for 183 days. At that point, you’ll be deemed a New Zealand-based customer and your repayments will be based on your income. Please ensure your employer uses an SL tax code on any income you receive in New Zealand. Find out more about how to repay your student loan.
