Te whakakore i tō tautoko tamariki Cancel your child support
============================================================

If you're a [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 and you do not want to receive child support anymore, you can cancel it.

If there is recognised care in place for a child, all carers must agree to cancel.

[Sharing care of a child or children](/child-support/eligibility/sharing-care)

The easiest way to cancel is in myIR. You can cancel for an individual child or for a child support group, which is for all the children in your care that a liable parent pays you for. You may have more than 1 child support group.

Before you start
----------------

You'll need:

*   the name of the [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
    
*   the date you want child support to stop.

In myIR, select 'More...' on the Child support - Receiving carer panel

Other ways to do this

You can fill out the Cancelling your child support - IR107 form online or on paper.

You’ll need to tell us:

*   the name of the liable parent
*   which child or children this applies to
*   the date you want child support to stop.

If you do not put a date, or if you put a date that is before we receive the form, we’ll cancel your child support:

*   for formula assessments, from the day we received your cancellation form
*   for voluntary agreements, from the day before we received your cancellation form.

You can also tell us on the form if you do not want to receive any child support payments still owed to you.

Check you've included your correct information and any documents we need. Sign the form and send your documents to us at:

What happens next
-----------------

We may get in touch with you to confirm a few details.

We'll cancel your child support from the date you give us on the form.

If you do not want us to collect any money still owed to you, you'll need to fill out a separate form.

Your responsibilities
---------------------

If you're getting the [Unsupported Child's Benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={85E0DDDD-CC2F-447C-AD88-1270C9B4CDCF})
 for a child, you cannot cancel for child support for that child.

If you cancel your child support, you’ll need to reapply for child support if you would like payments to start again.

If you have asked us not to collect any child support payments, you cannot later ask us to collect them. If you change your mind and would like the payments collected, you can collect those by applying through the Family Court.
