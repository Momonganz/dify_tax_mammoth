This determination applies for the 2005/2006 and subsequent income years.

### 2\. Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAG(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 I set in this determination the provisional rates to apply to the kinds of items of depreciable property listed in the table below by:

*   Adding into the "Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, Cafe's, Taverns and Takeaway Bars", "Residential Rental Property Chattels", and "Telecommunications" industry categories the provisional asset class, estimated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed in the table below.

| Provisional asset class | Estimated useful life (years) | DV rate (%) | SL rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Set-top boxes with hard drive and personal video recorders (PVRs) with hard drive | 4   | 50  | 40  |

### 3\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed by me on the 22nd day of January 2008.
