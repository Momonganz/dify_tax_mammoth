Allocation guidelines
=====================

Applications from taxpayers for binding rulings (private rulings, product rulings or status rulings) will be assigned to relevant business units within Inland Revenue handled by:

*   the Tax Counsel Office (TCO)
*   appropriate personnel within the Customer and Compliance Services group, or
*   jointly by TCO and the Customer and Compliance Services group.

The criteria below form the basis for this allocation. This allocation is to be made on the basis of the technical issues contained within each ruling application, rather than on the basis of each application as a whole.

The allocation guidelines generally reflect the fact that TCO is the final point of technical decision-making for the Department (particularly on matters that are complex or have a high level of uncertainty) and the business unit ultimately responsible under the escalation process for resolving internal inconsistencies on the correct application of the legislation.

These criteria are only for initial allocation purposes. It is possible that some of the matters referred to may only become apparent during the actual processing of the ruling application. However, once issues within an application have been allocated to a business group for processing, it shall be that business group's responsibility to process those and they shall not be reallocated unless there are exceptional circumstances.

In exceptional circumstances, or where this is necessary or highly desirable due to relative workload demands and available resources, with the approval of the Chief Tax Counsel the allocation of a particular application may vary from these guidelines.
