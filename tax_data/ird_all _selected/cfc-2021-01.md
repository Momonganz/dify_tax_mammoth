Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 1 - **[February 2022](/tib/volume-34---2022/tib-vol-34-no1)
**

Reference
---------

This determination is made under section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)
-----------------------------------------------------------

A person has no attributed CFC income or loss from a CFC under sections CQ 2 and DN 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if the CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007 because the requirements of sections CQ 2(1)(h) and DN 2(1)(h) are not satisfied.  
  
Section EX 21B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC if it is an insurer that meets the requirements of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Commissioner makes a determination under that section. In the absence of such a determination, a CFC carrying on an insurance business is unlikely to be a non-attributing active CFC, because an attributable CFC amount includes the CFC’s income from an insurance business or from being an insurer under s EX 20B(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.  
  
Section 91AAQ(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner for such a determination in respect of a CFC, if the CFC satisfies subsection (2).  Pursuant to section 91AAQ(1)(a) and (7), Tower Limited has made an application to extend an earlier determination in respect of the CFC set out below.  Tower Limited has a 30 September balance date.  
  
It has been determined, having regard to the matters set out in subsections (4) and (5) of section 91AAQ of the Tax Administration Act 1994, that the CFC satisfies the requirements set out in section 91AAQ(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and is accordingly a non-attributing active CFC for the purposes of section EX 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Scope of the determination
--------------------------

The CFC to which this determination applies is:

| Name | Jurisdiction |
| --- | --- |
| Tower Insurance (Cook Islands) Limited | Cook Islands |

Interpretation

Determination
