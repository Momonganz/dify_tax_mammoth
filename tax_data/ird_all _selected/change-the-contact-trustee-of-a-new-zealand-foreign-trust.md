Before you start
----------------

You'll need your:

*   final date as the contact trustee
*   contact details.

For the new contact trustee, you'll need their:

*   full name
*   contact details
*   status with the NZFT - if they're already a trustee or new.

Change the contact trustee in myIR
----------------------------------

From the homepage in your myIR account, select:

*   'More' on your New Zealand foreign trust account
*   'Send a message'
*   'Update trust registration'.

Enter your details, the leaving contact trustee
-----------------------------------------------

Let us know:

*   the date you plan to stop being the contact trustee
*   your email and postal address, so we can reach you afterwards.

Enter the details for the new contact trustee
---------------------------------------------

In the same message, tell us the new contact trustee's:

*   full name
*   email and postal address.

#### The new contact trustee is also a new trustee to the NZFT

The new contact trustee will need to add themselves to the NZFT within 30 days of being appointed.

They can do this by sending us a message in their own myIR account. They'll need to upload the documents that support their appointment as the NZFT's contact trustee.

This needs to be reviewed by us and we'll process your request within 15 working days. If we need more information, we'll contact you.

Once the new contact trustee receives confirmation that this link has been set up, they'll be able to link to, and access, details for all of their NZFT accounts.

Upload supporting documents
---------------------------

Attach documents, if any, that support changing the contact trustee.

#### The new contact trustee is also a new trustee to the NZFT

The new contact trustee must send us any documents that amend or supplement the trust deed - for example, the deed that appoints them as a trustee. They'll need to do this within 30 days of being appointed and can upload the documents when they request to add themselves to the NZFT.

Review and submit
-----------------

Make sure you've given us the right information for both you and the new contact trustee.

If it's all correct, click 'Submit'.
