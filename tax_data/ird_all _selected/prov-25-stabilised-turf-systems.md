Stabilised Turf Systems
=======================

Determination PROV25 (Jun 2013) sets provisional depreciation rates for stabilised turf systems.

#### Note to Determination PROV25

The Commissioner has set provisional depreciation rates for stabilised turf systems by adding new asset classes to the "Leisure" industry category.

Stabilised turf systems comprise the playing surfaces of some sports stadiums.  The turf systems are made up of the playing surface, infill, base, drainage, and watering system.  The turf systems vary in that one involves synthetic grass and the other synthetic tufts and plastic mesh through which natural grass grows.  Ground preparation work, other than trenches cut to facilitate the installation of drainage pipes, is not depreciable as it relates to the land. 

As the determination shows, the stabilised turf system consists of a number of components that have different useful lives.
