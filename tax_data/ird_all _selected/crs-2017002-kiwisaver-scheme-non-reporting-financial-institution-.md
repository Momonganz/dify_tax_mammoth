“TAA” means the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

A KiwiSaver scheme is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme under the FMC Act. The register is maintained by the Financial Markets Authority. In order to be included on the register, a KiwiSaver scheme must fully meet the registration requirements as set out in sections 126 to 128, and other relevant provisions, of the FMC Act.

Three of the additional registration requirements in section 128 are that a KiwiSaver scheme:

*   Is a trust, established and governed by a trust deed, under NZ law;
*   Has a purpose of providing retirement benefits directly to individuals; and
*   Has a manager who has at least one director who is a New Zealand tax resident.

The policy intent behind KiwiSaver schemes is to encourage long-term savings habits and asset accumulation by individuals principally through the workplace. Only natural persons can become members of a KiwiSaver scheme. A member must meet the New Zealand requirements which include:

*   Being a NZ citizen, or being entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely under NZ law; and
*   Living, or normally living, in New Zealand.

KiwiSaver members who are in paid employment have minimum contributions deducted from their earnings and paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system along with their employer’s contributions. Inland Revenue then distributes the funds to each KiwiSaver member’s allocated KiwiSaver scheme which allocates the funds to that member’s account. If a person changes employment or leaves the workforce their KiwiSaver member’s account goes with them.

KiwiSaver members who are not in paid employment can choose to make contributions directly to their KiwiSaver scheme or to Inland Revenue. All KiwiSaver members can also make voluntary contributions into their own, or into another, KiwiSaver member’s account.

All KiwiSaver contributions are locked in until the later of:

*   When a member is eligible for New Zealand Superannuation; or
*   After five years of membership;

unless a member makes another type of permitted withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act 2006.

A KiwiSaver scheme:

*   Is principally a fund to provide retirement benefits to its members;
*   Is subject to regulation under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the FMC Act, the ITA and the TAA;
*   Is subject to AML/CFT procedures under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009;
*   Has information reporting and disclosure obligations to Inland Revenue;
*   Attracts a Crown contribution by way of an annual limited member tax credit for individual members contributing a minimum amount each year;
*   Only allows members to make permitted withdrawals; and
*   Attracts a lower tax rate for investment income tax, if the scheme is a PIE.

A KiwiSaver scheme has substantially similar characteristics to a Broad Participation Retirement Fund in subparagraphs B(1)(b) and B(5) of Section VIII of the CRS standard, and has other substituting characteristics which indicate that such a scheme presents a low risk of being used to evade tax.

Determining that a KiwiSaver scheme is a NRFI, and specifying this under NZ law, does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS standard.

### **Scope of determination**

A KiwiSaver scheme does not fully satisfy the requirements for, but has substantially similar characteristics to a Broad Participation Retirement Fund outlined in subparagraphs B(1)(b) and defined in B(5) of Section VIII of the CRS standard.

This determination is issued by the Commissioner and applies to a KiwiSaver scheme where:

*   The KiwiSaver scheme does not have a single beneficiary with a right to more than 5% of the fund’s assets; and
*   The KiwiSaver scheme is a scheme that is registered on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme, under the FMC Act; and
*   The KiwiSaver scheme continues to maintain its registration on the register of managed investment schemes as a KiwiSaver scheme, and its manager complies with the relevant on-going registration requirements under the FMC Act.

### **Determination**

A KiwiSaver scheme, as outlined in the scope of this determination, is a non-reporting financial institution for the purposes of the CRS applied standard and requirements under Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Application date**

This determination applies for the reporting period beginning 1 July 2017, and subsequent reporting periods under the CRS applied standard.

Dated at Wellington on the 23rd day of May 2017.
