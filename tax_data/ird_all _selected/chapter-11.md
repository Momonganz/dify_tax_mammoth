### 11.1 Introduction

11.1.1 This chapter briefly summarises the main elements of the BE, FIF and trust regimes and draws together all of the Committee's recommendations and some concluding remarks.

### 11.2 BE Regime

11.2.1 The BE regime recommended by the Committee is set out in chapters 2, 3 and 4 and follows closely that outlined in our first report. The regime will apply when five or fewer New Zealand residents hold interests, either directly or indirectly, or through nominees or associated persons, which add up to 50 percent or more of the rights or powers of ownership of a foreign company. The rules for determining whether a company is controlled are necessarily wide in scope. The rules for attributing the income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) to individual residents are more circumscribed. Income or loss will be calculated according to New Zealand tax rules, with some necessary modifications.

11.2.2 Residents with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC will be required to compute their share of its income or loss, which is then attributed to them with a credit for the corresponding share of the foreign tax paid by the CFC. Residents would be able to aggregate their attributed income or loss, and the foreign tax credits, in respect of CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction. We propose that excess tax credits should be able to be carried forward. The New Zealand shareholders of a CFC resident in a grey-list country (Australia, Canada, France, Japan, West Germany, United Kingdom, United States) will be exempt from the regime unless the CFC utilises a significant tax preference. Where such a preference is used, the Committee recommends a simplified basis of income calculation.

11.2.3 In our first report, we suggested that a foreign company should be a CFC if it was controlled by 5 or fewer residents on any day of its accounting year. After further consideration, in light of the high compliance costs of monitoring control interests which in some cases could change, if not daily, relatively frequently, the Committee now recommends that a resident's control and income interests be measured on the last day of the calendar quarters that fall in the accounting year of a CFC. A foreign company would be a CFC if 5 or fewer residents have an aggregate control interest of 50 percent or more on any of the quarterly measurement days. This change necessitates more elaborate anti-avoidance measures than would be necessary if control and income interests on every day in the year were taken into account. A remaining problem is the circumvention of the BE regime by the disposal of shares for a capital gain, but this can be addressed comprehensively only by the general inclusion of capital gains within the income tax base.

11.2.4 With respect to the grey list countries, the Committee recommends that only significant tax preferences should be listed and that it would be best not to list specific preferences until there has been some experience with the BE regime. The fundamental criterion for listing a preference should be that it is significant enough to attract New Zealand investment. Where a preference is listed, the listing should have prospective application.

11.2.5 We proposed a number of transitional provisions in our first report. The principal provision is the exclusion from the BE regime for a two year period (ie until 1 April 1990) of interests in CFCs, resident in countries other than listed low tax jurisdictions, that were acquired by taxpayers on or before 17 December 1987. We recommend one further transitional measure in this report whereby residents with interests in CFCs on 17 December 1987 could elect to apply the regime for the two year period from 1 April 1988 until 31 March 1990 so that losses generated in that period would be available at the commencement of the regime on 1 April 1990 for offset against attributed income derived in the same jurisdiction.

### 11.3 Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) Regime

11.3.1 The FIF regime is set out in chapter 5 and section 245O of the draft legislation. The regime buttresses both the BE regime where tax deferral benefits do not depend on control and the proposed regime for superannuation where residents invest in foreign superannuation funds. It does this by taxing New Zealand residents on the income they derive through foreign companies, foreign unit trusts, or foreign superannuation funds ("foreign entities") which provide New Zealand residents with significant tax advantages.

11.3.2 The Committee has defined a FIF as any foreign entity which derives its income or value primarily or substantially from holding or trading portfolio investments in shares, investments in debt instruments, real property, commodities, etc, where the effect of the fiscal residence, the tax treatment applying to the entity in its country of residence and the distribution policy of the entity is to reduce the tax payable on the income of the entity to a level significantly below what it would have been had the income been taxed in New Zealand as it was derived.

11.3.3 We define an interest in a FIF in a similar way to an income interest under the BE regime, but this is extended to include life insurance or superannuation policies issued by a foreign entity. FIF income or loss is determined by reference to the change in value of the interest in the entity. We propose that there should be no credit for any foreign tax paid by the FIF because attributed FIF income or loss is effectively net of foreign tax. Attributed FIF income and losses of a taxpayer should, however, be able to be aggregated without limitation and, in addition, attributed FIF losses should be able to be offset against other income up to the extent of the past attributed FIF income returned by the taxpayer.

### 11.4 Trusts

11.4.1 The trust regime recommended by the Committee is described in chapter 6 and is set out in Part F of the draft legislation. We propose a number of changes from the regime recommended in our first report but these are of form rather than of substance. The basic principles underlying the proposed regime can be summarised as follows:

a   the taxation in New Zealand of the foreign-source income derived by a trust should not turn on the residence of the trustee. The material factor is the residence of the beneficiaries but since they are often not specified, recourse must be had to the settlor. In addition, a settlor will frequently have some influence, if not control, over the trustee so that the disposition of the income of the trust remains to some extent in the hands of the settlor. For these reasons, we consider that if the settlor is resident foreign-source trustee income should be taxable here;

b   where there is a resident settlor of a trust in the year in which it derives foreign-source trustee income, the liability for New Zealand tax on that income should rest in the first instance with the trustee (whether that trustee is resident or not). If the trustee is not resident, the liability should fall to the resident settlor as agent of the trustee in the event that the trustee defaults;

c   distributions from a trustee to a resident beneficiary should generally be taxable unless the trustee (or settlor, in the event of default) has been liable to tax in New Zealand.

11.4.2 We use the term "qualifying trust" to denote a trust in respect of which trustee income has been subject to tax in New Zealand in all income years since its settlement. Distributions from these trusts should be non-assessable to beneficiaries. "Foreign trusts", on the other hand, are trusts which have had, at no time after 17 December 1987, a settlor who is a New Zealand resident. We recommend that distributions from the trustee income of these trusts derived in income years commencing after 1 April 1987 should be assessable to a beneficiary, at his or her marginal tax rate, but other distributions from such trusts be exempt.

11.4.3 "Non-qualifying distributions" are distributions from trusts which are not qualifying or foreign trusts. We propose that these distributions, other than of the corpus of the trust, should be assessable to a beneficiary at a tax rate of 45 percent with no credit for any foreign tax, except withholding tax, paid by a trustee. The higher rate is intended as a proxy for an interest charge on tax deemed to have been deferred in respect of such distributions.

11.4.4 The Committee proposes that transitional provisions apply in respect of trusts settled by residents before 17 December 1987. These are that:

a   the settlor would have no liability, as agent of the trustee, for tax on the trustee income of the trust;

b   where such a trust winds up before 31 March 1989, all distributions other than of corpus and capital profits (which would be exempt) would be subject to a final tax of 10 percent;

c   where the settlor, trustee or a beneficiary of such a trust pays a tax equal to 10 percent of the net trust assets as at 31 March 1988, it would be treated as a qualifying trust provided that the trustee income of the trust is subject to tax in New Zealand in subsequent income years.

### 11.5 Disclosure

11.5.1 Disclosure of relevant information, with penalties for non-disclosure, and default methods where the taxpayer is not able to comply are critical to the effective operation of the regime. We outline our views on disclosure in chapter 7.

### 11.6 Imputation and Withholding Payment Systems

11.6.1 Our recommendations relating to the imputation and withholding payment systems cover details of the regimes which were left unsettled in our earlier report or which have emerged in the drafting of the legislation. There are no changes of substance or policy involved.

### 11.7 Summary of Recommendations

11.7.1 In summary, the Committee recommends that:

#### Definition of "Company" and "Trustee"

#### Definition of Associated Persons

g   in relation to the BE regime only, the term associated persons mean:

i   any 2 companies:

.   which consist substantially of the same shareholders, as presently defined in section 7; or

.   which are under the control of the same person or persons, as defined in section 7; or

vi   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or any person associated with that person) has derived a benefit from that trust or, being a person associated with the settlor of the trust, could derive a benefit from it (except where the trust is for the benefit of employees only and the person, or an associated person, does not manage or control the affairs of the trust);

vii   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or a person associated with that person) is a settlor of that trust (except where such an association exists as a result of an employer settling a trust, such as a superannuation fund, for the benefit of employees only and the employer or any associated person does not manage or control the affairs of the trust);

viii   two persons who habitually act in concert with respect to the holding or exercising of interests in foreign companies, with respect to those interests;

#### Definition of Interests In a Company

h   residents' control and income interests in foreign companies be defined in terms of:

i   paid-up capital;

ii   nominal capital;

iii   rights to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company or variations in its capital (e.g. by the issuing, redemption, acquisition or cancellation of any shares);

v   net assets of the company (or the proceeds from the realisation thereof) which the person would be beneficially entitled to receive or to have dealt with in his or her interest or behalf if they were distributed;

#### Frequency of Measurement of Interests

i   for the purposes of determining control and income interests in a foreign company, residents be required to measure their interests in the company in each category of interest listed in recommendation h on the last day of each calendar quarter;

j   an interest held on a measurement day be deemed to have been held on every day of the previous quarter;

k  provisions be included to reverse the effect of short term transactions and changes in the aggregate interests in foreign companies which have the effect of reducing the income attributed to residents or increasing an attributed loss;

l   residents who have a control interest in a foreign company at any time during its accounting year equal to or higher than 10 percent be required to disclose the interests they hold in the company on its balance date and any disposals of such interests made during its accounting year and where a resident has a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC at any time during its accounting year, the taxpayer be required to disclose the equivalent information in respect of the CFC;

#### Calculation of Control Interests

m   the control interest of a resident in a foreign company in any category of interest be defined as the aggregate of the person's direct and indirect control interests in that category and those of associated persons;

n   as a general principle, interests in a foreign company held by a CFC or associated persons of the CFC be attributed to the group of residents with the highest aggregate control interest in the CFC and, where there is more than one such group, to the smallest one and, where there is more than one person in any such group, the interests of the CFC be apportioned among them according to their income interests in the CFC;

o   any interests held by a nominee of a person be deemed to be held by that person;

p   a foreign company be defined as a CFC in respect of any accounting year of the company if, on any of the measurement days that fall within that accounting year, there are five or fewer residents whose aggregate control interest in the company in any category of interest is 50 percent or more;

q   where residents are directors of a foreign company and in aggregate have a control interest in the company in any category of interest of 50 percent or more, the company be deemed to be a CFC irrespective of the number of such directors;

r   where shares in a foreign company (the "stapled" company) can be transferred only in conjunction with the shares of a New Zealand resident company or a controlled foreign company, shares in the stapled company be deemed to be held by the New Zealand resident company or the controlled foreign company;

#### Calculation of Income Interests

s   the income interest of a resident in a CFC for any calendar quarter be the highest of the sum of the resident's direct and indirect income interests in the CFC on the last day of that quarter in the five categories of interest defined in recommendation h;

t   an entitlement to acquire an interest in a foreign company give rise to an income interest where:

i   the consideration payable to exercise the entitlement is less than the market value of the interest to be acquired; or

ii   the person holding the entitlement has given any form of financial assistance to the person holding the interest; or

iii   the holding of the entitlement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the BE regime;

u   the income interest of a resident in a foreign company held through a CFC be calculated by multiplying the resident's direct income interest in the CFC by the CFC's direct income interest in the other company, and so on where the interest is held through more than one CFC;

v   the income interest of a person in a CFC for any accounting period of the CFC be calculated as the average of the person's income interests for the quarters which fall in that accounting period;

#### Attribution of Income and Losses

w   residents be exempt from the BE regime in respect of a CFC and an accounting year of the CFC where their income interest in the CFC for that year and that of any associated persons is less than 10 percent;

x   the attributed income or loss of a resident with respect to a CFC and any accounting year of the CFC be calculated by multiplying the resident's income interest in the CFC for that year by the BE income or loss of the CFC for that year;

y   an attributed loss of a resident not be recognised where the resident suffers little or no economic or financial loss;

z   where the aggregate income interests of 10 percent or more of residents in a CFC in any accounting year would otherwise exceed 100 percent, the income interest of each resident be apportioned downward so that the aggregate income interest equals 100 percent;

#### Adoption of CFC's Accounting Year

aa   residents be required to report attributed income in respect of a CFC in any accounting year in the income year in which the balance date of the CFC falls;

ab   where a foreign company changes its balance date, residents be required to obtain the Commissioner's consent to compute their control interests, income interests and attributed income or loss in respect of that company on the basis of its new accounting year and the Commissioner's decision apply to all residents with interests in the company;

ac   where a CFC changes its balance date to a later date and the Commissioner consents to the residents using the new accounting year, any attributed income of a resident for the resulting long accounting period be brought to account in the income year in which the old balance date falls;

#### Foreign Tax Credits

ad   subject to recommendation ae, income and withholding tax paid by a CFC be creditable under the BE regime;

ae   the proportion of the total income tax paid by a CFC that is creditable under the BE regime be the proportion of its total income that is taxable in its country of residence or the country of source of the income;

af   residents be able to aggregate their proportionate shares of the creditable taxes paid by CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction;

ag   the maximum credit allowable to a resident in any income year in respect of his or her aggregate attributed income derived from interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction be the New Zealand income tax payable on that income in that year;

ah   residents be able to carry forward excess tax credits in respect of CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction for offset against New Zealand income tax payable in any future income year on attributed income in respect of CFCs resident in that jurisdiction;

ai   the carry forward of an excess credit by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test equivalent to that in section 188;

aj   a credit allowed to one company in a specified group of companies in respect of an income interest in a CFC be able to be transferred to another company in the specified group for offset against the New Zealand income tax payable by that company on attributed income derived from a CFC resident in the same jurisdiction as the first-mentioned CFC, subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191;

ak   foreign income tax paid by a CFC in respect of income attributable to another CFC be deemed to be paid by the latter CFC;

#### Attributed Foreign Losses

al   an attributed loss of a taxpayer derived from an income interest in a CFC be able to be offset only against attributed income derived from income interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction as the first-mentioned CFC in the same or a future income year;

am   the carry forward of an attributed loss by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test equivalent to that in section 188;

an   companies in the same specified group be able to aggregate attributed income and losses in respect of income interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191;

#### Application of BE Regime to CFCs Resident in "Grey List" Country

ao   where a CFC resident in a grey list country utilises a listed significant preference in any accounting year, the BE regime apply as for CFCs resident in other jurisdictions except that the BE income or loss of the CFC be computed as its taxable income or loss for that year, measured according to the tax law of its country of residence (before taking into account any losses of the CFC incurred in other years or losses incurred by any other company), adjusted for the effect of the listed preference;

#### Definition of Foreign Investment Fund

ap   the foreign investment fund regime apply to interests in foreign companies, foreign unit trusts and foreign superannuation funds that fall within the definition of a foreign investment fund and that the definition of an interest in a foreign investment fund include policies of life insurance or superannuation issued by a foreign investment fund;

#### Treatment of FIF Losses

aq   residents be able to aggregate their FIF income and losses derived in any income year from all FIFs in which they have an interest;

ar   where a FIF loss derived by a resident in any income year exceeds his or her FIF income for that year, the excess loss be able to be deducted from other income of the resident derived in that year to the extent that the excess loss is less than an amount equal to the cumulative FIF income of the resident derived in earlier income years, less the sum of any excess losses set off against other income in those earlier years pursuant to this provision;

as   to the extent that a FIF loss cannot be set off against FIF income or other income derived in the same income year, it be carried forward for offset against FIF income derived in future income years;

at   the carry forward of a FIF loss by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test similar to that in section 188;

### 11.8 Conclusion

11.8.1 The Committee's recommendations outlined above are incorporated in the draft legislation contained in the accompanying annex. Further refinement of the draft will be needed as it is examined by parliamentary counsel and officials. Interested parties will then have an opportunity to comment at the select committee stage. The experience of other countries has been that CFC regimes need relatively frequent amendment to meet changing business practices and no doubt that will be the case with the New Zealand regime. The increasing internationalisation of businesses and financial markets also makes it inevitable that tax legislation will become more complex, though this will affect only a small number of taxpayers.

11.8.2 The real test of the draft legislation will, however, come as it is applied. It is impossible to anticipate all of the circumstances that may arise. We are, however, confident that the basic framework of the regimes, as embodied in the draft legislation, is sound.
