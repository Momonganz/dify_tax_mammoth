24OIA1707 Page 1 of 14 21 February 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 23 January 2024. Your request is outlined in Appendix A. Information being released The information you have requested is outlined in Appendix B. Data provided in response to your first request is as at 15 February 2024. Data provided in response to your second request is as at 31 March of the years provided. Customer numbers, residual income tax (RIT) values and provisional tax obligations are based on filed returns and are subject to change as returns continue to be filed. Taxpayers liable to pay over $5,000 in residual income tax The customers included in this data are any entities (individuals, companies, trusts, etc.) who have a residual income tax of over $5,000 based on their income tax returns for 2022 and 2023, which would create a provisional tax obligation for them in the 2023 and 2024 tax years. Customers that paid provisional tax late The provisional tax information provided for those who made late payments or did not pay is based on all provisional tax assessments for the 2022 and 2023 tax years where there was any amount to pay. Customers included in this data had a provisional tax obligation in 2022 and 2023 because of their RIT value in the 2021 and 2022 tax years. Tax agent definition An active tax agent can be an individual or another kind of entity. To be considered an active tax agent, the individual or entity must have an active ‘tax agent’ indicator in Inland Revenue's system at that point in time. Counts have therefore been provided as at the end of each tax year (31 March). The filing of returns has not been used in determining tax agents because there are some filing methods where it is not possible to determine who has filed the return. The presence of the tax agent indicator is therefore more accurate, as tax agents must have at least 10 clients and meet filing requirements to retain their tax agent status. Where agency-to-agent links exist, Inland Revenue considers the overarching agency as the 'active tax agent', not the agents linked to it. Therefore, ‘Total active tax agents’ is the total agents with an active indicator minus the number of those agents who are linked to an overarching agency. 24OIA1707 Page 4 of 14 Appendix B Taxpayers
