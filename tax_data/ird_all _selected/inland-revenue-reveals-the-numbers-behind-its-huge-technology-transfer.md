Inland Revenue reveals the numbers behind its huge technology transfer
======================================================================

**10 February 2017**

More than 17,300 customers have successfully used the new Inland Revenue GST system since it went live on Monday, with over 5,500 GST returns successfully processed and new GST registrations coming through also.

Around 240 people from IR and 23 other organisations worked round the clock for almost 100-hours over Waitangi weekend to install the new GST platform. In that time 8.5 million customer records had to be verified and migrated to the new system.

This represented $80 billion of payments history and $32 billion of disbursements.

Inland Revenue’s Deputy Commissioner Transformation, Greg James, says the scale of the effort was extraordinary and it was absolutely vital that it was successful.

“There were some minor hiccups of the kind that you can get with any technical change,” he says, “but it was a huge success and gives us real confidence for the coming stages of Inland Revenue’s transformation.

“More importantly, it’s a major step in making things simpler and easier for our customers."
