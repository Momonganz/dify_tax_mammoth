YA 1 (cross-border related borrowing, and related- party debt) of the Income Tax Act 2007 New rules have been introduced requiring related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted transfer pricing approach. Under these rules, specific rules and parameters are applied to certain inbound related-party loans to: • determine the credit rating of New Zealand borrowers at a high risk of BEPS; and • remove any features not typically found in third party debt in order to calculate (in combination with the credit rating rule) the appropriate amount of interest that is deductible on the debt. Separate rules apply to financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Application date The amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The amendments will not apply to an arrangement that complies with an advance pricing agreement issued by the Commissioner before 1 July 2018. Key features Amendments to section GC 6, including the introduction of subsections GC 6(3B) to (3E), provide for the rules to restrict interest deductions on cross-border related borrowing. The rules, where they apply, alter the terms and conditions of a borrower and/or an instrument considered before applying the general transfer pricing rules, including the amendments to transfer pricing also amended by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 and discussed elsewhere in this special report. The rules are contained in sections GC 15 to GC 19: • Section GC 15 sets out how the rules operate and also defines an “insuring or lending person” as the rules operate differently for these persons. • Section GC 16 calculates how the credit rating of a borrower, other than an insuring or lending person, may be adjusted. • Section GC 17 calculates how the credit rating of an insuring or lending person may be adjusted. • Section GC 18 disregards certain features of a financial arrangement for the purpose of calculating an interest rate. 4 • Section GC 19 confirms that for arrangements existing before the new rules apply the loan must be repriced at the last day before the new rules apply that the loan was priced or repriced. Background New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of deductible debt a company can have, rather than directly limiting interest deductions. For the rules to be effective at actually limiting interest deductions in New Zealand to an appropriate level, allowable interest rates on debt also need to be limited. Historically this limitation has been achieved through transfer pricing. However, this approach has not been wholly effective. The transfer pricing rules require taxpayers to adjust the payments for cross-border related party transactions, so they align with the arm’s length conditions that would be agreed to by a third party in a comparable transaction. The arm’s length interest rate on a debt is affected by several factors including its term, level of subordination, whether any security is offered, and the credit rating of the borrower. New Zealand's transfer pricing rules have been updated and strengthened by including adopting economic substance and reconstruction provisions similar to Australia’s rules through the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. The amended transfer pricing rules disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction. They also allow transactions to be reconstructed or disregarded if such arrangements are commercially irrational and would not be entered into by third parties operating at arm’s length. Even with these stronger transfer pricing rules, tradit ional transfer pricing is not effective to prevent profit-shifting using high-priced related party debt. When borrowing from a third-party, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to try to obtain as low an interest rate as possible and on the best terms and conditions – for example, by providing security on a loan, and by ensuring their credit standing or rating is not adversely affected by the amount being borrowed and the borrowing rate. These same pressures do not exist in a related-party context. A related-party interest payment, such as from the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational to its foreign parent, is not a true expense from the perspective of the company’s shareholders. Rather, it is a transfer from one group member to another. There are no commercial tensions driving interest rates to a market rate. Indeed, it can be profitable to increase the interest rate on related-party debt above a market rate – for example, if the value of the interest deduction is higher than the tax cost on the resulting interest income. In addition, related-party transactions are fundamentally different to third-party transactions. Factors that increase the riskiness of a loan between unrelated-parties (such as whether the debt can be converted into shares or the total indebtedness of the borrower) are less relevant in a related-party context. For example, the more a third-party lends to a company, the more money is at risk if the company fails. However, the risks facing a foreign parent investing in New Zealand do not change whether it capitalises its investment with debt or equity. 5 As the foreign parent and New Zealand subsidiary are commonly controlled, in many cases the terms and conditions of any loan can be set having regard to taxation, rather than the commercial considerations that would be most important in an actual arm’s length loan. Related-party loans can feature unnecessary and uncommercial terms (such as being repayable at the borrower’s discretion or having an extremely long term) that are used to justify a high interest rate. Simply making the related party debt subordinated or subject to repayment optionality may also be used as justifications for a higher interest rate. In other cases, a high level of related party debt may be loaded into a New Zealand subsidiary to depress the subsidiary’s creditworthiness, which also is used to justify a higher interest rate. It can be difficult for Inland Revenue to challenge such arrangements under the transfer pricing rules as similar conditions are not generally found in arrangements entered into by third parties in comparable circumstances. With the new stronger transfer pricing rules, the taxpayer would have to provide evidence that the legal form was consistent with the economic substance and that a third party operating at arm’s length would agree to enter into the arrangement. These new requirements should limit the use of artificial or commercially irrational funding arrangements. However, in iso lat ion, they would still provide scope for taxpayers to choose to borrow from related parties using higher-priced forms of debt than they would typically choose when borrowing from third parties. In addition, the highly fact-dependent and subjective nature of transfer pricing can make the rules complex and uncertain to apply. Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been documented. This makes complying with the transfer pricing rules a resource-intensive exercise which can have high compliance costs and risk of errors. Transfer pricing disputes can take years to resolve and can have high costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. New Zealand is not alone in these concerns. The OECD’s final report on interest limitation rules notes that thin capitalisation rules are vulnerable to loans with excessive interest rates. This was one of the reasons behind the OECD favouring the earnings before interest, tax, depreciat ion and amortisat ion (EBITDA) approach to limit interest deductions. Detailed analysis The fo llowing flow chart sets out, at a high level, the steps a New Zealand borrower must go through, before determining a credit rating adjustment is required under the new rules. Further detail on each of these steps is provided below: 6 Flowchart 1: Process for determining NZ borrower’s credit rating Does a non-resident have an interest of 50% or more or are there a group of non- residents acting in concert? Transfer pricing rules do not apply Are you a high BEPS risk # ? Do you have related -party cross -border borrowing more than $10 million Simplifie d trans fer pricing rules apply Restricted transfer pricing rules apply\* – Determine the credit rating implied by the interest rate on your related party debt Standard transfer pricing rules apply\* Is the credit rating the same as the credit rating implied by significant third party debt? No credit rating adjustment required Is the credit rating (a) the same as if you had a debt to net assets ratio of 40% or less; and (b) BBB- or higher Credit r ating adjustment required Yes No No Yes No Yes Yes N o sign ificant th ir d par ty debt or rating different No Are you controlled by one person or a group acting in concert Yes No O ne per son # >40% debt and >110% group debt or lender has a less than 15% tax rate \*Also disregard exotic terms – not covered by this flow chart Is the credit rating within (a) two notches of your group’s credit rating and BBB- or higher; or (b) one notch of your group’s credit rating and BB+ or lower Y es G ro up 7 From restricted transfer pricing to interest rate The guidance in this TIB as well as the legislative restrictions imposed by the restricted transfer pricing rule focus on credit rating, and instrument terms and conditions restrictions, rather than directly determining an appropriate interest rate or margin. For any particular credit rating, it is necessary to use this information, along with other relevant factors, to determine an appropriate interest rate using the standard transfer pricing rules in section GC 6 to GC 14. This will frequently require access to specialist information such as that provided by Bloomberg or Reuters, on comparable instruments. This approach is unchanged between the previous transfer pricing rules and the additional requirements required under the restricted transfer pricing rule. Section GC 13, within the standard transfer pricing rules, requires accurately delineating and identifying the transaction including the conditions that independent parties after real and independent bargaining might be expected to agree upon for the identified transaction. While it would typically be expected that a transaction that had been adjusted under the restricted transfer pricing rule in GC 15 to GC 19 would not include any non-arm’s length conditions there is no override of section GC 13 so a taxpayer should still consider how this section may apply. Selection of suitable comparables and any adjustments that need to be made to them, such as converting into New Zealand Dollars, remains critical to arriving at an appropriate rate for a given transaction. Cross-border related borrowing Both the credit rating and disregarded features part of the restricted transfer pricing rule apply only where there is a cross-border related borrowing which is defined in section GC 6(3B). To be a cross-border related borrowing funds must have been provided to the borrower under which deductible expenditure arises and one or more of the following factors: • the lender and borrower are associated; • there is a person or group of persons that has an ownership right of at least 50% in the lender and the borrower; • the funding is provided through an indirect associated funding arrangement (detailed further on); or • the lender is part of a non-resident owning body or other group of non-residents acting in concert and that body or group has an ownership right of at least 50% in the borrower. Provides funds Section GC 6(3B)(a) requires that for an arrangement to be a cross-border related borrowing, a non-resident lender must provide funds to the borrower. This term has been used in the thin capitalisation rules since their inception and is also used in the non-resident financial arrangement income rules. It is explained on pages 54 and 55 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume 29, No 5, June 2017. It includes a finance lease, which in substance is a vendor- financed sale. It does not include an operating lease. Expenditure arises for the borrower 8 Section GC 6(3B)(b) requires that for an arrangement to be a cross-border related borrowing, expenditure must arise for the borrower for which the borrower is allowed a deduction. There is no advantage in adjusting the interest on a related party loan if that interest is not deductible including under sections FH 3, FH 7 and FH 11 of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules (that is, one that is not subject to reversal under section FH 12). There is no timing restriction on this provisio n, so the rules continue to apply if the deduction is temporarily disallowed, for example because it is a hybrid deduction denied subject to reversal under section FH 12. Association The lender and borrower will be associated if they meet one or more of the existing association tests in subpart YB. An ownership right of at least 50% in the borrower This test is determined under sections FE 38 to FE 41. These sections provide how ownership interests in companies are determined and ensure that the restricted transfer pricing rule applies to the same groups that are covered by the thin capitalisation rules. The calculations are similar to the control interest calculations in the controlled foreign company rules. In most cases, where rights are held in equal proportion across all (classes of) shares, having an ownership right of at least 50% will occur where two companies are associated anyway. However, this test will also include some lenders and borrower who are not associated if rights are not held in the same proportion across all (classes of) shareholders. The test references the direct control interests in section EX 5(1) as if the borrower was a foreign company and looks at the highest interest across the following categories: • shares in the borrower • shareholder decision-making rights in the borrower; which are decision making concerning: – dividends or other distributions – constitution of the company – variation in capital – appointment of a director • a right to receive income of the borrower • a right to receive any of the value of the net assets of the borrower As this test is based on the highest interest, it is possible for more than one person or group to have an over 50% interest. As this is not an income attribution provision, and only requires potential restrictions on the pricing of interest when a group has control or influence over the pricing of interest paid to them, this does not raise concerns. 9 Indirect associated funding An indirect associated funding arrangement is defined in section GC 6(3C). It is based on the similar indirect associated funding arrangement definition in section RF 12I for the purpose of the NRWT rules. The purpose of this test is to prevent a lender from circumventing the restricted transfer pricing rule by channelling funding through an unassociated person to a New Zealand borrower where direct funding would be covered by one of the other limbs of the cross- border related borrowing definition. Example 2 Foreign Co has a wholly owned subsidiary, NZ Co. Foreign Co has deposited NZ$20 million with Foreign Third Party Bank. Foreign Co and Foreign Third Party Bank have agreed that Foreign Third Party Bank will pay 9.7% interest to Foreign Co on the deposit and will also lend NZ$20 million to NZ Co at a rate of 10%. If Foreign Third Party Bank had lent NZ$20 million directly to NZ Co without this arrangement the interest rate would have been 7%. If Foreign Third Party Bank had simply lent money to NZ Co, the restricted transfer pricing rule would not apply as Foreign Third Party Bank does not have any interest in NZ Co. However, as the loan is indirect associated funding, it is covered by the restricted transfer pricing rule. Whether a cash pooling arrangement is classified as indirect associated funding was covered on page 68 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume 29, No 5, June 2017 when this term was Example 1 NZ Co has two classes of shares and two shareholders; as follows: Share class NZ Shareholder Co Non-resident Shareholder Co Total Class A 55 45 100 Class B 4 6 10 Class A shares hold all income distribution interests as well as decision making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company and variation in the capital of the company. Each class B share holds the right to appoint one director. Voting interests are determined by the shareholder decision making rights as follows: Decision making right NZ Shareholder Co Non-resident Shareholder Co Total Distributions 55% 45% 100% Constitution 55% 45% 100% Capital 55% 45% 100% Directors 40% 60% 100% Average 51.25% 48.75% 100% NZ Shareholder Co has a voting interest of 51.25% so is associated with NZ Co. However, the restricted transfer pricing rule will not apply to NZ Shareholder Co as it is not a non-resident. Non-resident Shareholder Co has a voting interest of 48.75% so it is not associated with NZ Co. However, Non-resident Shareholder Co has 60% of the right to appoint directors. Any loans to NZ Co by Non-resident Shareholder Co will be subject to the restricted transfer pricing rule. If NZ Shareholder Co sold all its shares in NZ Co to another non-resident both the new shareholder and Non- resident Shareholder Co would be subject to the restrict ed transfer pricing rule as both shareholders would be non-residents with an interest of greater than 50%. 10 introduced for the non-resident financial arrangement income rules. In short, indirect associated funding: • includes an arrangement entered into with the purpose or effect of avoiding the restricted transfer pricing rule; and • does not include commercial cash pooling arrangements such as those set up with a fluctuating debit and credit balance to cover working capital requirements. Acting in concert This test covers borrowers that have at least 50% of their rights held by a group of non-residents that act in concert to control the borrower. This overlays the 50% ownership right test described above with the existing non-resident owning body and acting in concert tests that already apply for thin capitalisation and NRWT. In section GC 16(3), such a group is referred to as a co-ordinated group and a borrower from a co-ordinated group is referred to in this report as not having an identifiable parent. Each of these terms can be used interchangeably. There are two exceptions to this general treatment: • If the borrower is owned by a single non-resident with no other business activity, and that non-resident is itself controlled by a co-ordinated group, the New Zealand borrower will be treated as controlled by a co-ordinated group. This is because the New Zealand borrower will be in the same situation as if the direct non-resident did not exist and the New Zealand borrower was owned directly by each of the members of the co-ordinated group. • If the borrower is controlled by a co-ordinated group but one of the members of that co- ordinated group meets the 50% ownership interest test by themselves the New Zealand borrower is treated as not controlled by a co-ordinated group. This is because the restricted transfer pricing rules apply without the need to consider the existence or otherwise of a co-ordinated group. Exclusion of certain preference shares Section GC 6(3E) excludes ownership interests arising from certain preference shares fro m the cross-border related borrowing test. To meet this exclusion the preference shares must be: • held by a person not associated with the issuer; and • issued with the intention of satisfying or replacing debt previously provided by the preference shareholder to the issuer in the ordinary course of business. The purpose of this exclusion is to cater for certain situations where a non-resident, in the business of lending to third parties, lends money to a New Zealand borrower who gets into financial difficulty. In such cases, rather than a portion of the debt being cancelled, the borrower may issue the lender preference shares. In this circumstance the lender, has an ownership right in the borrower, subject to the terms and conditions of the preference share. However, it clearly would not be appropriate to require the interest rate on the remaining debt to be determined having regard to the group credit rating of the preference shareholder. This exclusion will not apply if the preference shares are issued to a person who is already associated with the borrower, or if the preference shares are sold or transferred to a third party. 11 These restrictions are designed to prevent investors using this exclusion to take or extend an equit y-like interest without this being included in determining ownership for purposes of the restricted transfer pricing rules. Credit rating adjustments A borrower that is subject to the new rules will follow the process set out in Flowchart 2, to arrive at one of the following issuer credit ratings: • Default credit rating – the borrower’s own rating. • Restricted credit rating – the higher of (i) the borrower’s own rating if their debt/assets percentage is no higher than 40% debt and (ii) BBB-. • Group credit rating – the higher of the group borrower’s credit rating minus one or two notches and the borrower’s own rating (the group borrower is the group company with the highest amount of unsecured long term borrowing). • Optional credit rating – the credit rating implied from significant third-party debt. None of the credit rating methods is intended to require a borrower or another entity in the worldwide group to obtain a credit rating if it does not already have one. Instead a credit rating, subject to any restrictions imposed by the methods, can continue to be implied based on an analysis of current and historical information to form a business risk profile that considers compet it ive posit ion, managerial conduct and intent, industry and country risk and a financial risk profile based on cash flow and leverage. This forms the basis of the borrower’s stand-alone position which may be influenced by other factors including group or governmental support to form the issuer credit rating. Default credit rating The default credit rating in section GC 16(2) and (8) is the borrower’s rating including any implicit parental support. This is the rate that applies under the rules outside of the restricted transfer pricing rule. It will continue to apply where the borrower is a low BEPS risk. This is also the rating that applies when a borrower has less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowings. The Commissioner has previously issued administrative guidance for transfer pricing of loans with a total principal up to $10 million in order to minimise compliance costs. The availabilit y of the administrative approach is not intended to be affected by the new restricted transfer pricing rule and a loan priced under this approach is intended to be compatible with the default credit rating. To make this clear, loans where the borrower has less than $10 million of cross- border related borrowings have been carved out of the restricted credit ratings and group credit rating methods discussed below. Further detail on the administrative approach is available at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/transfer- pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-financing-costs.html Restricted credit rating The restricted credit rating in section GC 16(3) and (9) will apply where the borrower does not have an identifiable parent, and either is a high BEPS risk or chooses to use it to reduce compliance costs. It is based on the borrower’s standalone rating but adjusted to reduce its debt 12 level to 40% if it is above this and is subject to a to a minimum rat ing of BBB-, or equivalent given by a rating agency approved by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank approves rating agencies for their non-bank deposit taker rules which are published at: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/non-bank-deposit- takers/requirements/credit-ratings There are four rating agencies currently approved by the Reserve Bank. BBB- is the lowest investment grade credit rating assigned to a party by Standard & Poor’s, Fitch and Equifax Australasia and is equivalent to a Baa3 Moody’s rating. If a New Zealand borrower is controlled by a non-resident and that non-resident has no other business activity and itself has no identifiable parent, the New Zealand borrower will be treated for the purpose of determining its credit rating as having no identifiable parent rather than the direct non-resident being its parent. The consequence of this is the New Zealand borrower will need to consider whether the restricted credit rating applies rather than the group credit rating. Group credit rating The group credit rating in section GC 16(4) and (10) will apply where the borrower has an identifiable parent and either represents a high BEPS risk (discussed below) or chooses to use it to reduce compliance costs. A New Zealand borrower’s rating, in comparison with the group borrower’s rating, is reduced by two notches if the parent’s rating is BBB+ or above and one notch if it is below this. A notch is referred to in the legislation as the smallest division within the credit rating categories (for example from AA to AA- or AA- to A+). This distinction is made as a two-notch difference is only available where the New Zealand borrower would not end up below BBB-. BBB- is the lowest credit rating that is still investment grade. A one notch movement at a rating below investment grade would be expected to have a larger impact on the interest rate than a one notch movement at a rating above investment grade. As with the equivalent terminology in the restricted credit rating, the reference to BBB+ uses the rating scale used by Standard & Poor’s and other agencies. An equivalent rating by a different rating agency (such as a Baa1 Moody’s rating) would also be acceptable. The following table sets out the lowest available credit rating for a high BEPS risk borrower with an identifiable parent for certain credit ratings: Group borrower credit rating Maximum spread New Zealand borrower credit rating A 2 notches BBB+ A- 2 notches BBB BBB+ 2 notches BBB- BBB 1 notch BBB- BBB- 1 notch BB+ BB+ 1 notch BB 13 Optional credit rating The optional credit rating in section GC 16(5) and (11) allows a New Zealand borrower to apply a credit rating to an amount of their related party borrowing that is the same as that implied from significant 1 third party borrowing by a member of their New Zealand group. For a borrower that could use the default credit rating the optional credit rating would be consistent with this; however, this option is available for all borrowers, including insuring or lending persons, with cross-border related borrowing and third party debt. The optional credit rating allows the credit rating of a cross-border related borrowing to be set under the same credit rating that can be implied from third party lo ng-term senior debt. This is based on the same principle as the third-party exceptions used for disregarded features and described below. As with the disregarded features exception the optional credit rating can be used for cross-border related borrowing with a principal of up to four times the third-party debt – this restriction is to prevent a borrower using a small amount of expensive third party debt to justify a full deduction for the interest on a large amount of expensive related party debt. Usually a well secured loan will have an interest rate that implies a higher credit rating than that of the lower ranking debt of the entity, such as subordinated or even unsecured debt. Where a borrower has both secured and unsecured third party borrowing it would be appropriate for the optional credit rating to be based on the lower credit rating implied by the unsecured debt up to the four times limit. If this limit was reached and the borrower had no unsecured debt or chose not to base the optional credit rating on its unsecured debt, it could also calculate the optional credit rating based on the rating implied from secured debt. Choosing to use the restricted, group or optional credit rating As referred to above, a borrower can choose to apply the restricted credit rating, group credit rating or optional credit rating in certain circumstances (see section GC 16(2)(a)). Where this is available, no election notice is required. The method is chosen by calculating a deduction under the method and including this in the income tax return that first includes this arrangement. Once a borrower chooses a method for a particular arrangement in their first income tax return they cannot change to a different method in a subsequent return. What is a high BEPS risk? A borrower will generally be unable to use its standalone credit rating (default credit rating) and required to use the group or restricted credit rating options when it is a high BEPS risk, and the optional credit rating does not apply. This will occur when at least one of two factors are present: High New Zealand group debt percentage A borrower with an identifiable parent has a high New Zealand group debt percentage if its debt percentage is greater than 40%, unless its ratio is within 110% of its worldwide group (section GC 16(4)(b)). Where there is no identifiable parent, the 110% safe harbour cannot apply, and the equivalent relevant test is in section GC 16(3)(c). 1 “Significant” is not a term used in the legislation, but is discussed in the next paragraph. 14 In calculating the debt percentage for the purpose of this test, the borrower should use the same methodology and arrive at the same result as for their overall thin capitalisation calculation. This would include, for example, adjusting for non-debt liabilities and (if applicable) utilising the on-lending concession in section FE 13. Borrowing from a low tax rate jurisdiction different from the ultimate parent Borrowing from a low tax jurisdiction is borrowing from a lender resident in a country where the interest is subject to a lower than 15% tax rate. This factor is in section GC 16(3)(c)(i) and (ii) , and GC 16(4) (b)(i) and (ii) for borrowers without and with an identifiable parent respectively. This factor does not apply if the ultimate owner of that lender is also resident in that jurisdict ion. This factor is intended to apply to lending routed through a low tax country, which may be structured to achieve a tax advantage. It should not apply simply because a lender group is based in a low tax country. This factor does not apply to entities that are subject to lower, or no, tax due to a policy decision such as exempt sovereign wealth funds. This is achieved, by looking at both the lender’s own tax rate and the tax rate that would apply to a company wit h the usual tax status of a company. This test considers the jurisdiction of each lender when a loan is provided by more than one person. If any of the lenders of a specific loan fail this test the borrower will be a high BEPS risk for that entire loan rather than just the portion provided by the lender in the low tax jurisdiction. Calculation dates The high BEPS risk tests are calculated on the latest calculation date provided by section GC 16(6). For a loan that is entered into, renewed or renegotiated after the new rules apply, the calculation date will be the day the loan is entered into (under paragraph (6)(b)) or the day it is renewed or renegotiated (under paragraph (6)(c)). The calculation dates for other loans is covered separately below. The calculation date may not be on a thin capitalisation measurement date 2 . To reduce compliance costs of a borrower determining whether it exceeds the 40% threshold on that date, section GC 16(7) allows the borrower to estimate their debt percentage by making appropriate adjustments to the thin capitalisation calculations done on the most recent measurement date rather than having to re-do the entire calculation. While “appropriate adjustments” is not defined this is intended to include the effect of the new loan as well as any actions related to that wider arrangement such as using the loan to repay an existing loan or purchase a new asset. De minimis A de minimis has been included in section GC 16(3)(b) and GC 16(4)(a) to minimise compliance costs of borrowers with smaller amounts of related party cross-border loans. A borrower with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing will not have to consider the credit rating adjustment part of the rules and will apply the default credit rating as they do now. The optional credit rating will continue to be available for a borrower with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing who chooses to use it. 2 Taxpayers are only required to calculate whether they comply with thin capitalisation on their measurement dates which, under section FE 8, can be daily, 3-monthly or annually. Most taxpayers choose to have an annual measurement date. 15 The de minimis continues to apply to a loan in future years even if the de minimis is not satisfied in those future years, unless the loan is renewed, extended or renegotiated. The borrower will have to consider whether the de minimis applies each time they enter into a new cross-border related borrowing. An equivalent de minimis also applies in sections GC 17(b) and GC 18(1)(a) which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Implicit parental support A borrower must include any implicit support arising because it is a member of the foreign parent’s worldwide group when determining its default credit rating in section GC 16(8) or group credit rating in section GC 16(10)(b). This is consistent with the OECD transfer pricing guidelines 3 , in particular paragraphs 1.157 and 1.164 to 1.167 of those guidelines, reproduced below: 1.157 Comparability issues, and the need for comparability adjustments, can also arise because of the existence of MNE group synergies. In some circumstances, MNE groups and the associated enterprises that comprise such groups may benefit from interactions or synergies amongst group members that would not generally be available to similarly situated independent enterprises. Such group synergies can arise, for example, as a result of combined purchasing power or economies of scale, combined and integrated computer and communication systems, integrated management, elimination of duplication, increased borrowing capacity, and numerous similar factors... Example 1 1.164 P is the parent company of an MNE group engaging in a financial services business. The strength of the group’s consolidated balance sheet makes it possible for P to maintain an AAA credit rating on a consistent basis. S is a member of the MNE group engaged in providing the same type of financial services as other group members and does so on a large scale in an important market. On a stand-alone basis, however, the strength of S’s balance sheet would support a credit rating of only Baa. Nevertheless, because of S’s membership in the P group, large independent lenders are willing to lend to it at interest rates that would be charged to independent borrowers with an A rating, i.e. a lower interest rate than would be charged if S were an independent entity with its same balance sheet, but a higher interest rate than would be available to the parent company of the MNE group. 1.165 Assume that S borrows EUR 50 million from an independent lender at the market rate of interest for borrowers with an A credit rating. Assume further that S simultaneously borrows EUR 50 million from T, another subsidiary of P, with similar characteristics as the independent lender, on the same terms and conditions and at the same interest rate charged by the independent lender (i.e. an interest rate premised on the existence of an A credit rating). Assume further that the independent lender, in setting its terms and conditions, was aware of S’s other borrowings including the simultaneous loan to S from T. 1.166 Under these circumstances the interest rate charged on the loan by T to S is an arm’s length interest rate because (i) it is the same rate charged to S by an independent lender in a comparable transaction; and (ii) no payment or comparability adjustment is required for the group synergy benefit that gives rise to the ability of S to borrow from independent enterprises at an interest rate lower than it could were it not a member of the group because the synergistic benefit of being able to borrow arises from S’s group membership alone and not from any deliberate concerted action of members of the MNE group. Example 2 1.167 The facts relating to S’s credit standing and borrowing power are identical to those in the preceding example. S borrows EUR 50 million from Bank A. The functional analysis suggests that Bank A would lend to S at an interest rate applicable to A rated borrowers without any formal guarantee. However, P agrees to guarantee the loan from Bank A in order to induce Bank A to lend at the interest rate 3 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017. 16 that would be available to AAA rated borrowers. Under these circumstances, S should be required to pay a guarantee fee to P for providing the express guarantee. In calculating an arm’s length guarantee fee, the fee should reflect the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from A to AAA, not the benefit of raising S’s credit standing from Baa to AAA. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from Baa to A is attributable to the group synergy derived purely from passive association in the group which need not be compensated under the provisions of this section. The enhancement of S’s credit standing from A to AAA is attributable to a deliberate concerted action, namely the provision of the guarantee by P, and should therefore give rise to compensation. We note that some of the OECD guidelines, including those quoted above, use the Moody’s rating scale. The rest of this document uses the Standard & Poor’s rating scale which is more common in New Zealand. A rating of Baa3 in the Moody’s scale is equivalent to BBB- in Standard & Poor’s. Group Borrower’s credit rating For simplicity, the term ‘group borrower’s credit rating’ is used in a number of places in this TIB; however, this term is not used in the legislation. Instead section GC 16(10)(a) refers to “the credit rating for debt that is long-term senior unsecured debt and not related-party debt or between associated non-residents, of the member of the borrower’s worldwide group under subpart FE, that has the most such debt”. It is not appropriate to always base the parent’s credit rating on the credit rating of the ultimate parent of a group as in some instances this company will not be the highest rated member of the group. For example, where the ultimate parent is a non-operating holding company. This entity would not be the one providing implicit support to the New Zealand borrower and it would instead be more appropriate to base the implicit support on the credit rating of a higher rated member of the group. The group borrower’s credit rating is used because it should be easier for the New Zealand borrower to identify this entity without having to obtain the credit rating of all group members including those that may not have a published credit rating. In most instances the group borrower will be either the main operating entity of the worldwide group or a separate treasury entity that funds the group. Multinationals have a commercial incentive to ensure that the credit rating of the largest group borrower fro m third parties is as high, and therefore the interest rate is as low, as possible. Accordingly, the credit rating of the member with most long-term senior unsecured third-party debt is expected to reasonably reflect the credit of the worldwide group. The members of the worldwide group are identified using the existing rules in section FE 17 which is based on entities that are consolidated under generally accepted accounting practice. Where an entity is part of the group but not wholly-owned or does not have exactly the same shareholding as other members of the group this will not exclude that entit y fro m being considered the group borrower for the purpose of these rules. The amount of long-term senior unsubordinated debt is not apportioned to reflect different shareholdings. For example, if a group only has two entities with long-term senior unsecured debt – a 100% owned entit y wit h $400m of debt and a 60% owned entity with $500m of debt – the 60% owned entity would be treated as having debt of $500m rather than $300m and therefore would be the group borrower for the purpose of determining the group credit rating. 17 Long term senior unsecured debt The legislation does not define ‘lo ng term’, as this is a commonly used and understood term. Typically long term refers to debt with a term when issued of at least one year. In many circumstances a borrower determining which entity in their group has the highest level of long term senior unsecured debt will be able to consider non-current liabilities on each member’s balance sheet. However, this distinction may not be sufficient to differentiate between long- term senior unsecured debt and other instruments such as subordinated or secured debt or where debt that has been issued with a term of more than one year is nearing maturity. The purpose of this part of the rules is to provide a cost-effective measure for determining what an appropriate credit rating for the group is. It will typically not be necessary to identify and classify all debt within an entity or group as it is only necessary to determine which is the entity with the most senior unsecured debt rather than the abso lute amount of such debt The reason for choosing unsecured debt only is that it more accurately reflects the credit risk of the entity or group rather than the specific security provided. The exclusion of secured debt may also exclude special purpose vehicles (SPVs) set up for a specific project, such as an infrastructure investment. Where a group has no long-term senior unsecured third-party debt In a limited number of situations, a group may have no long-term senior unsecured third-party debt, in which case the standard test will not be able to identify which entity to base the group borrower’s credit rating on. Sections GC 16(10)(ab) and GC 17(ab) allow the group to determine the credit rating based on the member of the worldwide group with the highest credit rating. To reduce compliance costs, the group does not have to determine or consider the credit rating of any group member that could be reasonably considered to be unlikely to have the highest credit rating. Officials expect the member with the highest rating would typically be the one that may be expected to support the New Zealand borrower if needed, such as a main trading entity or entity with the largest balance sheet. A group would typically not be expected to consider the credit rating of entities within the group operating in countries outside the chain o f ownership to the ultimate parent unless these entities were sufficiently large relative to other members of the group that they could reasonably be expected to have a higher credit rating. Application to existing arrangements The restricted transfer pricing rule applies to cross-border related borrowing for income years beginning on and after 1 July 2018. This includes existing arrangements entered into before this date in which case, under section GC 19, the interest rate will be calculated at the date the loan was entered into (or renewed, extended or renegotiated if this resulted in the interest rate being reset) with application to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The high BEPS risk tests for an existing arrangement can be calculated at either of the following dates: • The last day before the new rules apply – GC 16(6)(a). • When the loan was last repriced before the new rules apply – GC 16(6)(d). No separate election is required for this choice; however, the borrower should document this choice in the records used to support their tax return calculations. In this way a borrower who is a low BEPS risk at either of these two dates will not have to calculate the credit rating 18 adjustment for existing arrangements. They may still have to calculate the impact of the disregarded features (discussed below). A borrower calculating their debt percentage on the date the existing arrangement was last repriced before the new rules apply will be required to apply the calculation as it applied before the amendments in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This means the debt percentage calculation will not be required to adjust for non-debt liabilities as discussed elsewhere in this TIB. When the new rules mean that a portion of the interest payments under an existing loan is non- deductible, the parties may want to reduce the amount of the payments so there is no non- deductible portion. Inland Revenue accepts that such a reduction will not, on its own, require any amendment to the amount of the interest payments which is deductible under the new rules. The restricted transfer pricing rule will not apply to arrangements that comply with an advance pricing agreement issued by the Commissioner before 1 July 2018. 19 Flowchart 2: Determining the credit rating to use for restricted transfer pricing No No Yes No Yes Yes Yes No Yes NoNo Yes No No Yes No No Yes Yes Borrower is an insuring or lending person GC 15(2) Total cross- border related borrowing > $10m GC 16(3)(b) & (4)(a) Borrower has an identifiable parent GC 16(3) & (4) Safe harbour: El ect to use group credit rating GC 16(2)(a) Credit rating of member with most debt GC 17(a) Defaul t credit rating^ GC 16(8) Group cre dit ra ting GC 16(10) Borrower’s thin cap ratio <40% in NZ GC 16(3) Lender subjec t to >15% tax\* GC 16(3)(c)(i) & (i i) Borrower ’s thin cap ratio <110% of worldwide group or <40% in NZ GC 16(4)(b) Lender subjec t to >15% tax\* GC 16(4)(c)(i) & (i i) Restricted credit rating^ GC 16(9) Ke y \* unless the lender is in the same jurisdiction as the owner(s) or ultimate parent ^ tak ing any imp licit sup por t into accou nt Yes Do you want to c alc ulat e cre dit rating based on third party debt?

A lender may wish to invoke MAP if it considers that the deductible amount in New Zealand under the restricted transfer pricing rules is less than the lender’s jurisdict ion will require to be returned as income, applying an arm’s length standard. This will require the presentation of a case to the lender jurisdiction’s Competent Authority or, depending on the provision, the New Zealand Competent Authority. Borrowers are not entitled to determine their deductible interest on the basis that the restricted transfer pricing rules are over-ridden by a double tax agreement unless they have first been through the MAP process. This guidance does not consider the substantive issues raised by such an application Further guidance is available on MAP on Inland Revenue’s website at: https://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/international-obligations/mutual-agreement- procedure/mutual-agreement-procedure-guidance.html Effect of paying non-deductible amounts If a borrower pays an amount of interest in excess of the amount which is deductible under the restricted transfer pricing rule, that payment will give rise to a dividend under subpart CD. This will not affect the borrower’s obligation to apply the withholding tax rules applicable to interest payments to the excess amount, unless the lender applies to the Commissioner under section GC 11. See example 1 on page 4 of TIB Vol 11 No 7 (March 1996)). Guarantee fees The restricted transfer pricing rule does not explicitly refer to guarantee fees. The OECD is currently developing guidance on how guarantee fees should be priced. IR officials will continue to monitor this situation including whether future legislative change may be required. No fee is appropriate for a guarantee of debt between parties who are commonly owned. Payment of a guarantee fee to a non-resident related party may be appropriate if it guarantees third party debt. However, this would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis and would not be expected to materially exceed the cost of a non-resident group member borrowing from a third party and on-lending to the New Zealand borrower with the New Zealand borrower’s interest deduction calculated under the restricted transfer pricing rule. 21 Example 3 NZ Sub is 100% owned by Foreign Parent and is a high BEPS risk as it has a debt percentage of 50%. Foreign Parent has an AA credit rating. Under a traditional transfer pricing analysis, NZ Sub would be rated BB+; however, the restricted transfer pricing rule requires related party debt borrowed by NZ Sub to have a credit rating of A+. If Foreign Parent borrowed $100 million from third party bank and on lent this to NZ Sub the cost to the group would be based on Foreign Parent’s AA credit rating and the cost to NZ Sub would be based on its A+ credit rating with Foreign Parent profiting on the margin difference between AA and A+. If, instead, NZ Sub borrowed directly from third party bank with a guarantee from Foreign Parent the cost to NZ Sub would be based on Foreign Parent’s AA credit rating. If NZ Sub paid a guarantee fee to Foreign Parent equal to the margin difference between AA and A+ the transaction would be equivalent to the related party lending example above, if the fee was greater than this NZ Sub would make a smaller profit and Foreign Parent would make a greater profit on what is economically an equivalent transaction. The guarantee fee in this case would have a high risk of being challenged. Ignoring surrounding circumstances, terms, and conditions Another way related party interest rates can be inflated is by using borrower friendly loan terms. To mitigate this risk the following features will be disregarded or adjusted for when considering the pricing of a particular instrument, subject to certain exemptions: The term of the loan being greater than 5 years Almost all NZ$ bank debt owed by New Zealand borrowers, and the majorit y o f third-party bond issues, are for a term of 5 years or less. Due to a (generally) positive sloping yield curve and the lack of comparables with terms of over 5 years, debt with very long duration can be priced higher than equivalent shorter terms. If the term of cross-border related borrowing is more than 5 years section GC 18(4) and (8)(b) will price it as if its term is 5 years unless an exception applies. This pricing should apply for the term of the loan. Further detail is provided on this provisio n below. Subordination Subordination is where an instrument ranks behind other instruments in the event of default. This reduces the chance of the creditor receiving all their money back in the event the borrower runs into financial difficulty and can be used to justify a higher interest rate. Often in a related party context any subordination will not affect the amount the parent (or other lender within the group) would receive in the event the subsidiary failed. Arrangements with subordination will have that subordination disregarded by section GC 18(3)(g) for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. Exotic features Exotic features are those generally not seen with third-party lending. Section GC 18(3) provides a list of features that will be disregarded in determining the transfer price for cross border related borrowing, which include: • payment other than in money (for example, repaying a loan by issuing shares) • interest payment deferral beyond 12 months; 22 • options which give rise to premiums on interest rates (for example, on early repayment by the borrower); • promissory notes or other instruments which do not provide rights to foreclose/accelerate repayment in the event of borrower default; • contingencies (for example, where interest is repaid only under certain conditions). Deferral beyond 12 months Any increased interest rate that arises where payment of interest is made less than annually to the extent that increase is due to the increased risk of default due to interest being deferred beyond 12 months is disregarded. This provision will not apply where the increase in interest reflects the loss of the ability to reinvest the deferred interest so that the effective rate of return is the same as if the interest was not deferred. Example 4 The arm’s length rate if a borrower borrows $100 with annual interest is 5%. If instead, the borrower issues a zero-coupon bond for $100 with a $127.63 redemption payment in 5 years’ time section GC 18(3)(b) will not apply as this bond has the same 5% interest rate. Any higher interest rate, for example to compensate for the higher credit risk from longer exposure to the borrower, will be disregarded. Third party features While generally the above features will be disregarded under the new rules for cross-border related borrowing, they will be taken into account under section GC 18(9) if the borrower (or its worldwide group, if it is part of one) has a significant amount of third-party debt with that feature. The extent to which disregarded features can be taken into account depends on the structure of either the borrower’s (or its worldwide group’s) third-party debt. That is: • the borrower’s related-party debt can have a disregarded feature in proportion to its third- party debt. For example, if the borrower has $100m of senior third-party debt and $50m of subordinated third-party debt, related-party debt that is 2:1 senior:subordinated would be allowable; or • the character of debt owed by the borrower matches the character of the borrower’s group’s third-party debt provided that type of debt is commercially appropriate in the New Zealand context. For example, say on a worldwide consolidated basis the borrower’s group has $200m of ordinary debt and $50m of convertible notes. If the borrower has $40m of ordinary related-party debt, this means that up to $10m of convertible related- party debt would be allowable (as this means the borrower’s debt character – a 4:1 mix of ordinary and convertible debt – would match that of its group). In order for the borrower to use its own third-party debt to justify an otherwise disregarded feature, that third-party debt must be significant. That is the related-party debt with a feature cannot be more than 4 times the third-party debt with that feature. This is to prevent taxpayers agreeing to small amounts of expensive third-party debt in order to justify expensive related- party debt. 23 Terms greater than 5 years Section GC 18(4) to (8) determines whether a term greater than 5 years is disregarded for the purposes of calculating the interest rate. Section GC 18(4) includes that the 5-year term restriction does not apply to instruments that qualify as regulatory capital under section GC 18(10). This is explained further in the insuring or lending persons section below. For New Zealand borrowers that are not an “insuring or lending person” whether a term of over 5 years can be included in calculating an interest rate is determined under a similar process to the general third-party features test above. The rules are necessarily more complicated for the over 5 years terms exclusion as not all loan terms can be treated equally; for example, a 6-year term third party loan could not be used to justify a 30-year term related party loan. The third-party except ion can either be (at the option of the taxpayer) based on third party debt of the worldwide group or third-party debt of the New Zealand group. Due to minor differences in terminology this decision affects which subparagraphs of sections GC 16(4) to (8) apply. This choice is also consistent with the choice available for other disregarded features in section GC 18(9)(a). The threshold term is calculated at the date the loan was entered into renewed or extended rather than the remaining term. 24 The following table sets out the steps a taxpayer must go through to if they seek to apply the third-party exception to a loan with a term over 5 years: Step Reference if using worldwide group third party debt Reference if using New Zealand third party debt 1.

Term is adjusted to the threshold term if: • the related party term is greater than the threshold term; • the proportion of related party debt with a term over 5 years is less than (or equal to) the threshold fraction; and • related party debt with a term over 5 years is less than 4 times third party debt with a ter m over 5 years. GC 18(8)(a)(i), (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) GC 18(8)(a)(i), (a)(ii) and (b)(iii) 6. Term is adjusted to 5 years if: • the proportion of related party debt with a term over 5 years is greater than the threshold fraction; or • related party debt with a term over 5 years is (equal to or) more than 4 times third party debt with a term over 5 years GC 18(8)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) GC 18(8)(b)(i) or (b)(iii) 25 Example 5 Foreign Parent Ltd has debt from third parties of the following amounts and terms: Loan Principal Original term at issue #1 $70 million Less than 5 years #2 $10 million 7 years #3 $10 million 9 years #4 $10 million 11 years Total $100 million The threshold term under section GC 18(5)(a)(i) is 9 years, which is calculated under section GC 18(6) as: Loan Term Term Debt Long-term Debt Threshold Term #2 7 years $10 million $30 million 2.3 years #3 9 years $10 million $30 million 3.0 years #4 11 years $10 million $30 million 3.7 years Total 9 years The threshold fraction under section GC 18(5)(b)(i) is $30 million/$100 million or 3/10. NZ Subsidiary Ltd 4 has existing loans of $700,000 from Foreign Parent with a term of less than 5 years. It enters into three further loans with Foreign Parent with terms over 5 years on successive days and needs to consider what term will be included for setting the interest rate. Loan 1 A $50,000 loan with a term of 7 years. • Section GC 18(8)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (7 years) does not exceed the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(i) does not apply as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($700,000 + $50,000 = 750,000) is 6.7% which is less than the threshold fraction of 30%. • Section GC 18(8)(b)(ii) does not apply as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000) is less than 4 times the value of worldwide loans with this feature (4 x $30,000,000). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(iii) does not apply as the threshold fraction was not determined under subsection (5)(b)(ii). Therefore the 7-year term is not adjusted and is included in calculating the interest rate. Loan 2 A $100,000 loan with a term of 11 years. • Section GC 18(8)(a)(i) applies as the term of the loan (11 years) exceeds the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(a)(ii) applies as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($750,000 + $100,000 = $850,000) is 17.6% which is less than the threshold fraction of 30%. Therefore the 11-year term is adjusted to the threshold term of 9 year for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. Loan 3 A $200,000 loan with a term of 9 years. 4 For simplicity for the purpose of this example disregard the $10 million de minimis in GC 18(2)(a). 26 • Section GC 18(8)(a) does not apply as the term of the loan (9 years) does not exceed the threshold term (9 years). • Section GC 18(8)(b)(i) applies as related party loans having a term of more than 5 years ($150,000 + $200,000 = $350,000) as a proportion of total related party loans ($850,000 + $200,000 = $1,050,000) is 33.3% which exceeds the threshold fraction of 30%. Therefore the 9-year term is adjusted to 5 years for the purpose of calculating the interest rate. Example 6 Foreign Co has three senior unsecured loans from third parties. These are each for US$100 million and had terms at issue of 5 years, 10 years and 15 years respectively, so the average maturity of their long-term senior unsecured debt is 10 years. NZ Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Foreign Co, has a loan from Foreign Co for NZ$20 million with a term of 10 years. The threshold term is 12.5 years (as the 5-year loan is not included in the calculation). The threshold fraction is US$200 million/US$300 million or 2/3. NZ Co’s related party debt with a term of more than five years as a fraction of total related party debt is NZ$20 million/NZ$20 million or 1/1. This exceeds the threshold fraction. So, for the purposes of calculating the deductible interest on the related party loan, the term of the loan from Foreign Co would be adjusted to 5 years. Suppose Foreign Co chooses to restructure its loan to NZ Co by lending NZ$10 million for 5 years and NZ$10 million for 12.5 years and using this to repay the original NZ$20 million loan. NZ Co’s average term of related party debt greater than 5 years is now 12.5 years and its related party debt with a term of more than five years as a fraction of total debt is NZ$10 million/NZ$20 million or 1/2. These amounts are less than or equal to the threshold term and fraction, so no adjustment is made to the term of the 12.5-year loan under the restricted transfer pricing rule. Example 7 NZ Co has a $100 million 30-year loan from its parent, Foreign Co and no third-party debt. The interest rate on this loan is reset on 1 January each year. Foreign Co has an embedded call option whereby it can demand repayment on the reset date provided it gives 30 days prior notice. Foreign Co does not face any more risk than if they provided a one-year loan that was rolled over each year. The term of this loan would be required to be adjusted to 5 years, but the annual interest rate reset, and embedded call option would continue to be included in the pricing so it is unlikely any adjustment would be required to the amount of deductible interest. 27 Flowchart 3: Determining the interest rate on a particular instrument – not for insuring or lending persons Yes No Yes No Yes No Use credit rating determined in flowchart 2 D oes th e loan have any other exotic features?

Credit ratings of insuring or lending persons Financial institutions (referred to in the legislation as an “insuring or lending person”) are generally required to use the credit rating of the member of the group with the highest amount of debt rather than the default credit rating, restricted credit rating or group credit rating discussed above. There are two reasons for this: 28 • Financial institutions are more integral to their worldwide group in that a default is more likely to affect the risk perception of the worldwide group. This results in a higher level of implicit support. • Financial institutions apply a different funding model from most other businesses, wit h much higher levels of leverage and, as interest is their main income source, calculating their debt percentage under the standard thin capitalisation rules is not appropriate. An “insuring or lending person” is defined in section GC 15(2) to include the following persons: • Banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers regulated by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. • A member of a group or subgroup not regulated by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand whose main business is lending to third parties. • An individual entity in the business of lending to third parties. These last two bullet points are dealt with by section GC 15(2)(d) and (e) respectively. An example of the last category is where a motor vehicle importer is a member of a group which also has a finance company to assist its customers to lease their vehicles. This will essentially require the group to be split into two for the purpose of applying the rules with the finance company subsidiary having a credit rating under section GC 17 and the motor vehicle importer applying section GC 16. If importing motor vehicles and operating a finance company was undertaken in a single company, the company would need to determine its main business activity so that it is treated for purposes of transfer pricing its debt as either an insuring or lending person or not. Credit ratings The default credit rating for insuring or lending persons is the group borrower’s credit rating in section GC 17(a). Unlike the approach for non-insuring or lending persons there is no high- BEPS risk test and there is no difference between the group borrower’s rating and the New Zealand borrower’s rating. In many instances, including the majority of the banking industry on their current ratings, this should not provide a practical restriction as the New Zealand rating is already the same as the group borrower’s. Even if the group borrower and New Zealand subsidiary ratings diverge in the future this may not impose a restriction in practice due to the availability of the optional credit rating – which is explained further below. Although the credit rating must be the same as the group borrower’s, this does not require the interest rates on identical debt to also be identical. If there is market observable data that a New Zealand financial institution with the same credit rating as its group borrower pays a higher or lower interest rate for an equivalent instrument, then the new rules will not prevent that differential also applying in the determination of interest rates on cross-border related borrowing. One notable example that has been identified is the credit rating of certain insurance companies. Many insurance companies, either internationally or in New Zealand, will have a high credit rating but little or no debt compared with another entity in the group that will have a slightly 29 lower credit rating but the majority of borrowing for the group. As noted above, the group borrower’s credit rating is based on the entity in the group with the highest amount of long- term senior unsecured debt. Therefore, the credit rating of the insurance group will be based on the credit rating of the entity that borrows externally which will be lower than the credit rating of the insurance company. This lower rating should more accurately reflect the actual borrowing costs of the group. There are two alternative methods of determining the credit rating. The first is a $10 million de minimis in section GC 17(b). This is consistent with the $10 million de minimis for non- insuring or lending persons and allows an insuring or lending person with less than $10 million of cross-border related borrowing to apply the credit rating that would apply under the standard transfer pricing rules in the absence of the restricted transfer pricing rule. The second alternative method is the optional credit rating in GC 17(c). This follows the same methodology as the optional credit rating for non-insuring or lending persons. The borrower can use the credit rating implied from this debt for up to four times the value of the third-party debt. Further detail on this method is provided in the non-insuring or lending person section above. Regulatory capital of banks, insurers and non-bank deposit takers The Reserve Bank requires banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers to hold certain levels of capital to support their operations. Some of this regulatory capital can take the form of debt with deductible interest for tax purposes. There are legitimate commercial reasons why multinational banking and insurance groups often issue regulatory capital in their home country, and then invest some of that regulatory capital down into other countries where they operate. Where this capital is passed down to New Zealand, it would not necessarily satisfy the general third-party exception as: • the foreign parent will often be subject to different regulatory requirements in its home jurisdiction so will have issued instruments with different features; or • the worldwide group may have a more comprehensive range of activities in its home jurisdiction. An example is a group that operates a bank and an insurance company internationally but only operates as an insurance company in New Zealand. It is important that the tax rules do not discourage the existence of regulatory capital as that increases the risk of that business being unable to meet its obligations to depositors, policy ho lders or other creditors. For banks, insurance companies, and non-bank deposit takers, the third-party test is replaced with a regulatory capital test in section GC 18(10). This test allows a bank, insurance company or non-bank deposit taker to include features in pricing related party debt if that feature was required for the instrument to be recognised by the Reserve Bank as regulatory capital or solvency capital, even where those features would otherwise have to be disregarded under the restricted transfer pricing rules. 30 There are four further areas of detail on this regulatory capital test which are: • minimum standards; • terms; • disqualification; and • back-to-back loans. Minimum standards Banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers usually maintain regulatory capital above the minimum standards, primarily so they can remain above the standards if a future event, including losses and payments of dividends, causes their regulatory capital to drop. Banks can also issue different levels of capital depending on what features it has. Potential loss of interest deductions should not discourage this behaviour. Any features that are required to meet the Reserve Bank requirements should be included in pricing even where the regulatory capital is over the minimum standard or where the entity issues a t ype of capital that has a greater risk than another type of capital. Terms Under the current regulatory framework, banks can issue Tier 2 capital which, amongst other requirements, must have a minimum original maturity of at least five years. However, when such an instrument has less than five years to maturity, the amount that is recognised as regulatory capital is amortised on a straight-line basis at a rate of 20% per annum as follows: Years to maturity Amount recognised More than 4 100% Less than and including 4 but more than 3 80% Less than and including 3 but more than 2 60% Less than and including 2 but more than 1 40% Less than and including 1 20% Due to this amortisation, banks are incentivised to issue Tier 2 capital for terms exceeding the minimum 5 years. Section GC 18(4) recognises this by allowing any term of greater than 5 years to be included in pricing on any instrument that is recognised as regulatory capital, even though that longer term is not required in order for the instrument to qualify as regulatory capital. Section GC 13(1)(b) still requires identifying conditions that independent parties after real and independent bargaining might be expected to agree upon for the comparable transactions. This means terms would not be expected to be significantly longer than the term of equivalent Tier 2 capital issued to third parties, or where there is no such capital what would be expected to be agreed by a New Zealand borrower who was issuing Tier 2 capital to third parties. 31 Disqualification From time to time, the Reserve Bank changes the regulatory capital requirements. For example, it is currently consulting on removing the requirement for regulatory capital to convert to common equity in certain circumstances. Where there is a regulatory change there will often be a transitional period where a former regulatory capital instrument will only be partially recognised and will eventually cease to qualify as regulatory capital. Where this occurs, the bank or insurance company will not necessarily repay the instrument as there may be other commercial reasons to retain it (such as meeting the expectations of external investors). The features that formerly qualified it as regulatory capital will st ill be present, even where it ceases to qualify as regulatory capital. In these circumstances, these features will still be included in the pricing, so the test is based on the instrument qualifying as regulatory capital when it was entered into rather than any subsequent changes. Officials will monitor the use of this provision and would not expect an insuring or lending person to maintain high priced related party debt that no longer qualifies as regulatory capital when there is no commercial reason to do so other than to obtain a higher tax deduction than on a new instrument, especially when equivalent third-party instruments have been repaid. Back-to-back loans Some banks, insurance companies and non-bank deposit takers have an entity, such as a New Zealand holding company or a New Zealand branch of the foreign parent, which is not itself regulated by the Reserve Bank but raises funds from the worldwide group to on-lend to the regulated entity. A consequence of this is a New Zealand taxpayer may receive high priced debt with features that provide no direct benefit to it as a stand-alone entity but will match the instrument/funding on-lent to a group member which is regulated and therefore the group is provided with a regulatory benefit. Any features included in an instrument issued by a non-regulated entity that would be necessary for it to qualify as regulatory capital (refer to the tests discussed above) if the entity was a regulated entity will be included in pricing provided that instrument is part of a back-to-back loan to the regulated entity/group. These two instruments are referred to in the legislation as the funding arrangement and the funded arrangement. This is achieved in section GC 18(10)(b), (d) and (f) by requiring that the feature “reflects” a feature of regulatory or solvency capital. This term is not intended to require perfect mirroring between features of the funding and funded arrangements, but this should not provide the opportunity for inclusion of any features in the funding arrangement under the pretext of imperfect mirroring. The inclusion or non-inclusion of a feature in the funding or funded arrangement should not prevent that instrument qualifying in respect of other features. Where more judgement is required is where a different feature is included in the funding arrangement than in the funded arrangement. An appropriate approach would be to include a feature in a funding arrangement, which does not exactly match a feature in a funded arrangement, only if the feature provides protection to the banking/insuring/deposit taker associate in a similar circumstance to that faced under the funding arrangement. Furthermore, the increase in price due to the feature in the funding arrangement should not exceed the increase in price due to the feature in the funded arrangement. 32 Not all regulatory capital will be a financial arrangement as a bank may also issue preference shares which are an excepted financial arrangement. The rules also allow the funded arrangement to be an excepted financial arrangement while the funding arrangement is a financial arrangement. In this instance, it is expected that the terms of both arrangements will less perfectly mirror each other than where the funded arrangement is a financial arrangement; however, the paragraph above that discusses the limits on features of the funding arrangement will continue to be relevant.

The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended so that debt percentages will now be based on an entity’s assets net of its “non-debt liabilities”. A number of other changes have been made to strengthen the thin capitalisation rules. These are: • a de minimis in the inbound thin capitalisat ion rules; • reducing the ability for companies owned by a group of non-residents to use related-party debt; • new rules for when a company can use an asset valuation for thin capitalisation purposes that is different from what is used for financial reporting purposes; • an anti-avoidance rule that applies when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of a year to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules; and • a minor remedial to clarify how the owner-linked debt rules apply when the borrower is a trust. Application date These amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Grandparenting for five years has been included for the 110 percent debt threshold for non-residents acting together, which is set out in more detail below. Key features The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended so that the debt percentages are based on an entity’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities. This applies to both inbound and outbound thin capitalisation. There are consequential amendments to the Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules in subpart EX of the Act to ensure the non-debt liabilities adjustment applies in relation to the CFC rules where relevant. A number of other changes have also been made to the thin capitalisation rules. These changes have: • extended the de minimis in section FE 6 of the outbound thin capitalisation rules (New Zealand companies with foreign subsidiaries) to the inbound thin capitalisation rules (foreign controlled New Zealand companies); 34 • reduced the 110 percent worldwide debt threshold to 100 percent for a NZ group controlled by a group of non-residents acting together for the purposes of the interest apportionment rule in section FE 6; • strengthened the integrity of the rules that allow taxpayers to value assets using values not reported in their financial accounts for the purposes of determining total group assets under section FE 16; • introduced an anti-avoidance rule in new section GB 51B to prevent taxpayers circumventing the thin capitalisation rules by repaying a loan just before a measurement date; and • amended the owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) to ensure they operate correctly for trusts. Background to non-debt liabilities The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand’s international tax rules and are designed to protect our tax base. Like many countries, New Zealand has been reviewing its thin capitalisation/interest limitation rules in light of the OECD’s 2015 Final Report, Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments, on Action 4 of the BEPS Act ion Plan. This review identified aspects of New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules that could be strengthened, and these aspects were subject to public consultation that followed the release of the Government discussion document, BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules, in March 2017. New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules are based on the principle that a multinational group should not have significantly less capital in New Zealand, relative to the size of its New Zealand business, than it has on a worldwide basis, unless it has no more than a 60% debt/assets ratio. Historically this comparison has been made by comparing the ratio of debt to assets for the New Zealand group with the same ratio for the worldwide group. This measure did not deal well with co mpanies wit h non-debt liabilities. When a New Zealand group has significant non-debt liabilities, its debt/assets ratio can appear relatively low, even though it has very little equit y contributed by its owners. The thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE have been amended to prevent this, by excluding non-debt liabilities from the definition of assets. The non-debt liabilities change better aligns New Zealand’s thin capitalisation regime with it s core objectives and with other countries’ thin capitalisation rules. Detailed analysis Non-debt liabilities adjustment Section FE 12 has been amended so that in calculating its New Zealand group debt percentage, an entity will be required to measure its assets net of its non-debt liabilities, as defined in section FE 16B. In addition, there are consequential amendments to sections EX 20D and EX 20E to ensure the non-debt liabilities adjustment also applies in relation to the CFC rules where relevant. 35 Section FE 16B has separate, albeit similar, definitions for non-debt liabilities, depending on whether they are being calculated for the New Zealand group (section FE 16B(1)) or the worldwide group (section FE 16B(2)). Non-debt liabilities for New Zealand group – section FE 16B(1) For a New Zealand group, non-debt liabilities are all liabilities shown in the entity or group’s financial statements, except for: • liabilities that are debt under section FE 15; • certain interest-free loans from shareholders; • certain shares held by shareholders; • provisions for dividends; and • certain deferred tax liabilities. This effectively means that non-debt liabilities comprise the liabilities that are not debt, nor shareholder funding that is akin to group equity, and certain deferred tax liabilities. This represents a broad range of liabilities that include, but are not limited to: • trade credits; • GST payable; • provisions and accruals for employee benefits such as wages, bonuses, redundancy and holiday pay and long service leave; • financial liabilities from derivatives such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts; and • current and deferred tax liabilities. The exclusions in paragraphs FE 16B(1)(a) to (c) are covered in more detail below. Debt liabilities Paragraph (a) excludes from non-debt liabilities any liabilities that are counted as debt under section FE 15. This includes, but is not limited to, financial arrangements that provide funds to the entity and give rise to deductions for the entity. Financial arrangements that provide funds include finance leases and some credit sales. This is discussed in the definition of “cross-border related borrowing” above. The primary example of debt liabilities under section FE 15 is interest-bearing debt. Interest-free loans from shareholders Paragraph (b) excludes from non-debt liabilities any financial arrangements providing funding to the entity if either: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; and/or • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. 36 This is because such loans are akin to group equity if they are held pro rata with shareholding, or by a substantial shareholder. This exclusion is targeted at interest-free loans from shareholders. The exclusion does not include related-party agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services (defined in section YA 1 and colloquially known as trade credits), which will therefore be treated in the same way as other non-debt liabilities. Trade credits are treated this way because the price payable for the corresponding goods or services is generally increased by an implicit interest charge for the deferral of payment, and therefore it is not appropriate to treat them as non-interest bearing. As drafted, the exclusion only applies to a loan from a shareholder. Example 8 A Co is owned by two non-resident shareholders in the following proportions: B Co (80%) and C Co (20%). B Co and C Co provide a combination of interest-bearing and interest-free loans in proportion to their shareholdings. The interest-bearing loans are debt under section FE 15 and therefore are not non-debt liabilities under section FE 16B(1)(a). The interest-free loans are not debt under section FE 15 but also are not non-debt liabilities under section FE 16B(1)(b) as the loans are advanced in proportion to shareholding. Therefore, neither the interest-bearing nor interest free loans should be treated as non-debt liabilities for thin capitalisation purposes. This means the interest-bearing loans will have the same effect on A Co’s thin capitalisation calculation as any other third party loan, while the interest free loans will have the same effect as shareholder equity. This exclusion (like those in paragraphs (c) and (d) of section FE 16B(1)), does not apply funding to a trust, other than a unit trust. Preference shares Shares can be treated as liabilities for accounting purposes in some circumstances (for example, if the shares are redeemable at the holder’s option or on a specific date). Paragraph (c) excludes shares held by a shareholder from the definition of a non-debt liabilit y if eit her: • the funding is advanced pro rata with shareholding; and/or • the shareholder (along with any associated persons) holds 10 percent or more of the voting interests in the company. Similar to the exclusion targeted at interest-free loans in paragraph (b) such shares are akin to group equity if they are held pro rata with shareholding, or by a substantial shareholder. Otherwise it is appropriate for them to be excluded in determining the extent of equity funding in a New Zealand group. They are commercially more in the nature of third-party funding, rather than equity. 37 Provisions for dividends Paragraph (d) excludes a provision for dividends from the definition of a non-debt liability. This is because it is similar in substance to an interest-free loan from shareholders. Deferred tax liabilities Paragraph (e) excludes a deferred tax liability from the definition of a non-debt liability if it satisfies three requirements. The general purpose of these requirements is to exclude a deferred tax liability only if it has in effect already been taken into account in the valuation of the relevant asset. The three requirements are as follows: • It arises as a result of the difference between the value of an asset in the financial statements and the amount which remains depreciable or deductible for tax purposes. • It reflects an amount of tax that would not arise if the relevant asset were sold for the value in the financial statement. • The value of the relevant asset in the financial statements takes into account the deduction or depreciation actually available for tax purposes in relation to the asset (rather than the deduction or depreciation recorded in the financial statements), or on the basis that the asset is non-depreciable or depreciable at a rate of zero. The first limb will be met relatively often, due to either a difference between accounting and tax depreciation rates, or asset revaluations. For example, suppose a building acquired in 2011 for $10m. The building is revalued in the 2018 financial statements to $15m. This gives rise to a deferred tax liability of $1.4m. The liability arises as a result of the difference between the building’s value in the financial accounts ($15m) and the depreciable amount for tax purposes ($0). It therefore comes within the first limb of section FE 16B(1)(e). The second limb means that a deferred tax liability relating to a depreciable asset can only be excluded from being a non-debt liability to the extent that it is higher than the tax that would be payable if the asset was sold for its accounting value. This means that a deferred tax liability should be taken into account to the extent it reflects tax that would be paid on depreciation recovery income if the asset was disposed of. The third limb reflects the “no double-counting” purpose of the exclusion. If the valuation of an asset already reflects the limited amount of depreciation available for tax purposes, it is not appropriate for the difference between accounting and tax depreciation to be taken into account again by way of the reduction in the thin capitalisation denominator for non-debt liabilities. For instance, in the case of a building which is revalued after buildings became depreciable at a rate of 0% (i.e. the 2011-12 income year), the accounting value of the building would be expected to recognise there are no depreciation deductions. This means the debt percentage calculation takes into account, through the calculation of the asset amount, the non-depreciable nature of the building for tax purposes. It is not then appropriate to make a further reduction in the debt percentage calculation. Any valuation based on the market value of the building after the 2011- 12 tax year would be expected to reflect its non-depreciability, and therefore to mean that section GC 16(1)(e)(iii) is met with respect to any deferred tax liability in respect of that asset. However, a valuation based on the net present value of future cash flows might not take non- depreciability into account, in which case those requirements would not be met. 38 For the avoidance of doubt, the third limb should not exclude a deferred tax liability relating to a building which was acquired before buildings became depreciable at a rate of 0% (i.e. the 2011-12 income year), if the building has not been revalued in the financial statements since that time. In that case, the value (say, the original cost) of the building in the financial statements reflects an assumption of depreciability, so it is reasonable that the deferred tax liability does reduce the thin capitalisation denominator. Example 9 D Co is currently recognising a deferred tax liability on its buildings of $4.2m calculated as follows: Accounting Base Tax Base Temporary Difference Tax Rate DTA/(DTL) 15m 0 15m 28% (4.2m) D Co purchased the building in 1995 for $20m. It claimed tax depreciation of $8m on the building until the depreciation rate was reduced to 0% from the 2011-12 income year. The building has not been revalued for accounting purposes since that time although accounting depreciation continues to reduce its carrying value which is currently $15m. Because the building is held for use rather than sale, this results in a deferred tax liability of $4.2m which is recognised in the financial statements. Question Can any of the deferred tax liability be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e)? Answer No. The accounting value of $15m has not been revalued to take into account the 0% depreciation on the building for tax purposes. Therefore, the third limb of section FE 16B(1)(e) is not met. Example 10 The facts are the same as above, except that the building has been revalued for accounting purposes post-the 2011-12 income year to $30m. The revaluation was undertaken on a discounted cash flow basis that reflects that there is no tax depreciation shield from the building. Accounting Base Tax Base Temporary Difference Tax Rate DTA/(DTL) 30m 0 30m 28% (8.4m) Can any of the deferred tax liability be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e)? Yes. The first limb is met. The second limb is met to the extent that the deferred tax liability exceeds the tax liability that would arise if if the building was sold for $30m.If the building were sold for $30m, D Co would have a tax liability of $2.24m, being $8m of depreciation recapture income x 28%. The amount of the DTL that is within paragraph (ii) is therefore $8.4m - $2.24m = $6.16m. The third limb is met as the $30m valuation takes into account that tax depreciation on buildings is 0%. This means that $2.8m of the DTL of $6.16m will be excluded from being a non-debt liability under section FE 16B(1)(e). 39 Example 11 Y Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 200 Interest-bearing debt 50 Deferred tax liability\* 30 Provision for dividends 15 Equity 105 5 \*The deferred tax liability may be split into $10 that meets criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e) and $20 that does not. The $10 deferred tax liability may reflect that the accounting value recognised in the financial statements for a particular class of assets already takes into account the level of tax depreciation shield available for those assets. Z Co’s debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is $50. Its total liabilities are $95, but $15 of this is a provision for dividend and $10 of the deferred tax liability meets the criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e). Both of these are excluded from being non-debt liabilities. Its non-debt liabilities are $20 (the non-excluded portion of the deferred tax liability) and its thin capitalisation percentage under section FE 12 is 50 ÷ (200 − 20) = 27.8%. Note that Z Co may not wish to consider whether any component of its deferred tax liability meets the criteria of section FE 16B(1)(e). In such a case, it treats the full quantum of the deferred tax liability as a non-debt liability and it would calculate its thin capitalisation percentage under section FE 12 to be 50 ÷ (200 – 30) = 29.4%. Example 12 Z Co’s balance sheet is as follows: Assets 100 Interest-bearing debt 20 Non-debt liability – trade credits 10 Interest free loan from parent 20 Equity 50 Z Co’s debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is $20. Its total liabilities are $50, but $20 of this is an interest-free loan from Z Co’s parent company and $20 is debt, which are both excluded from being non- debt liabilities. Its non-debt liabilities are therefore $10 (trade credits) and its thin capitalisation debt percentage under section FE 12 is 20 ÷ (100 – 10) = 22.2 percent. Non-debt liabilities for worldwide group – sections FE 16B(2) and FE 18 For a worldwide group, non-debt liabilities means: • all liabilities (as shown in the entity’s financial statements) that are not counted as debt under section FE 18; less • any owner-linked debt that is excluded under section FE 18(3B), as such debt is treated as equity for the purposes of the worldwide group debt test. This is similar to the definition of non-debt liabilities for a New Zealand group, although there are fewer exclusions. 5 There is an error on page 123 of the Tax Information Bulletin Volume 31 Number 3, April 2019. It shows equity as 10 – it should show equity as 105. 40 Consequential amendments to the CFC rules – sections EX 20D and 20E In calculating the net attributing CFC income or loss for a CFC, sections EX 20D and EX 20E outline rules to help determine the deductibility of interest expenditure for excessively-debt funded CFCs. The test for whether a CFC is considered to be excessively debt-funded is whether it has a debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20D(4), of more than 75 percent and also has a relative debt-asset ratio, determined under section EX 20E, of more than 110 percent. Similar to the changes to the thin capitalisation rules in subpart FE, sections EX 20D and EX 20E have been amended to reflect that non-debt liabilities should be deducted from the denominator of the formula in calculating the CFC’s debt-asset ratio and the CFC’s relative debt-asset ratio. The meaning of non-debt liabilities for the purposes of these calculations is the total value of the non-debt liabilities determined under generally accepted accounting practice for the CFC and group respectively, as provided in sections EX 20D(8B) and (6B) respectively. De minimis for inbound thin cap Section FE 6(3)(ac)(i) provides a de minimis which means that a person subject to the outbound thin capitalisat ion rules does not derive an amount of income (equivalent to any disallowed interest) if they have a group finance cost for a year of less than $1 million. The de minimis reduces between $1 million to $2 million of group finance cost. This is achieved by section FE 6(ac)(ii) or (iii), which reduce the amount of income derived by an excess debt entity, but only where paragraph (i) does not apply. Amendments to section FE 6(3)(ac) have extended this de minimis to a person subject to the inbound thin capitalisation rules unless they have owner-linked debt – that is debt from a person with an ownership interest in the entity – under section FE 18(3B). This change is intended to reduce compliance costs for smaller firms. Worldwide debt test for non-residents acting together The inbound thin capitalisation rules were extended with application from the 2015-16 tax year to include New Zealand entities owned by non-residents that act together as a group in relation to the way they fund a New Zealand investment and own 50 percent or more of that entit y (we refer to these New Zealand entities as “group controlled”). The 2015-16 changes also tightened what is known as the “110 percent worldwide debt test” in the inbound rules, which compares the amount of debt in a group’s worldwide operations to the debt in their New Zealand operations. The effect of section FE 18(3B) is that owner-linked debt (as discussed above) is excluded when calculating the worldwide debt percentage. A New Zealand group’s allowable debt percentage under section FE 5(1)(a) is the greater of 60 percent of its assets and 110 percent of its worldwide debt percentage. For a group controlled New Zealand entity, the worldwide group is the New Zealand group itself under section FE 31D, as a company owned or controlled by a group of non-residents acting together has no identifiable parent. As such, the 110 percent worldwide debt test is effectively a measure of the New Zealand group’s total debt relative to its third-party debt. 41 This means that shareholders of group controlled entities wit h high levels o f third-party debt were able to invest in New Zealand predominantly through owner-linked debt. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third-party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity without breaching the thin capitalisation limit. Sections FE 5(1)(ab) and FE 6(3)(e)(iii) require that when a taxpayer has a worldwide group given by section FE 31D, interest deductions will be denied if the ent ity has any owner-linked debt and its total debt level exceeds 60 percent. In effect, this means that its allowable debt level is the greater of 60 percent and 100 percent of its third-party debt rather than the greater of 60 percent and 110 percent of its third-party debt as was previously the case. Grandparenting For relevant entit ies that are above 60 percent total debt and 100 percent of their third-party debt, transit ional provisions have been included in section FZ 8. In determining its allowable debt level, A group-controlled entity can continue using its current percentage of its worldwide group debt percentage up to the 110 percent threshold for up to five years from the rules applying. The borrower’s current percentage of third-party debt can be calculated at either the date of introduction of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill (6 December 2017) or the thin capitalisation measurement date immediately prior to this. Example 13 On 30 June 2018, NZ Co’s worldwide group debt percentage is 70% and its debt percentage is 76.3% which is 109% of its worldwide debt percentage. NZ Co enters into a new loan with a third party in 2019. As a result, its debt percentage as a percentage of its worldwide group debt percentage drops to 105% (because NZ Co’s related-party debt level has not changed since year 2018). NZ Co’s allowable debt level under the transitional provisions will stay at 109% of its worldwide group debt percentage. In 2020, NZ Co repays a number of large loans and, as a result, the debt percentage of its New Zealand group drops to 55%. NZ Co does not need to rely on its grandparented 109% of worldwide debt anymore, but is still covered by the grandparenting provisions for the remainder of the five-year period. This means that NZ Co will not be denied interest deductions if its debt percentage exceeds 60% in 2021 unless its debt percentage also exceeds 109% of its worldwide debt percentage. Asset valuation In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles. Asset valuations reported in financial statements are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than asset valuations that are adopted solely for thin capitalisation purposes. Moreover, there was a concern that taxpayers may be valuing assets for thin capitalisation purposes without seeking an independent valuation. New section FE 16(1BAA) provides that taxpayers can only use the net current value of an asset if they have received a valuation from an independent valuer or the valuation methodology, assumptions and data have been approved by an independent valuer. This provision does not provide guidance on how frequently such a valuation must be undertaken. It would not be practical to expect a valuation to be undertaken for each period; 42 however, times when a valuation may be necessary include where there is an impairment event for financial reporting purposes or if the taxpayer is seeking to increase the value. Anti-avoidance rule around measurement dates Section FE 8 provides a taxpayer’s assets and liabilities can be valued for thin capitalisation purposes on a daily, 3 monthly, or annual basis. An annual measurement date is the simplest and most widely-used of these approaches. Annual valuation means taxpayers can use the annual measurement date to effectively breach the thin capitalisation debt limits for up to one year without facing any interest denial, by partly repaying a loan or converting it to equity on or before their balance date. Previously, section FE 11 prevented taxpayers from benefitting from temporary increases or decreases in values if the change had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the thin capitalisation rules. However, this section only applied to changes between measurement dates and did not cover the initial year when an arrangement was entered into. Section FE 11 has been amended and new section GB 51B reconstructs certain situations, transactions or arrangements where a taxpayer subject to the thin capitalisation rules substantially repays a loan or, more generally, enters into a transaction near a measurement date with the purpose or effect of manipulating the thin capitalisation rules. Owner-linked debt when the borrower is a trust To reduce compliance costs, the owner-linked debt provisions in section FE 18(3B) only count debt as owner-linked if the owner has an ownership interest in a member of the group of companies of 5 percent or more. This test worked correctly when the entity was a company but not if it was a trust as settlements on a trust do not convey ownership interests. Amendments to section FE 18(3B) now count debt as owner-linked if the owner: • has a direct ownership interests in a member of the group of 5 percent or more; or • has made 5 percent or more (by value) of the settlements on the trust. Worldwide group debt percentage and the on-lending concession Existing section FE 13 allows the debt percentage of a New Zealand group and a worldwide group to be reduced to the extent a person subject to thin capitalisation: • has provided funds to an unrelated party or a related party outside the lender’s NZ group; or • is a trust with no property other than financial arrangements and incidental property. This is known as the on-lending concessio n. If a person (or group) who can rely on the on-lending concession has a mixture of funding from related and unrelated parties there was previously no guidance on which debt was reduced or how the reduction was allocated between the two sources of debt. This becomes a problem when the person is controlled by a non-resident owning body or trustee under section FE 31D so that the New Zealand group is the worldwide group. 43 New section FE 18(3B) confirms that when a person applies the on-lending concession the proportion of related and unrelated party debt remains the same as prior to the on-lending concession being applied. 44 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FINANCE Sections CH 10B, FE 4B, FE 7B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Amendments have been made that will provide entities carrying out eligible infrastructure projects a limited exemption from the thin capitalisation rules by allowing them to claim deductions on debt that exceeds the thresholds set out in section FE 5(1). The debt that is allowed to exceed the ordinary thin capitalisation thresholds under this rule is limited to third-party debt (or debt that is from an investor but is made in the capacity of a third- party lender) that only has recourse against the assets associated with the infrastructure project and the income arising from those assets. Background This measure is intended to deepen the market and improve the competitiveness in the bidding process for eligible infrastructure projects by ensuring that investors are subject to similar levels of thin capitalisation restrictions. New Zealand-owned entities have no thin capitalisation restriction on the level of third-party debt they can take on. Similarly, New Zealand entities owned by a group of non-residents (none of which have a controlling interest in their own right) are unrestricted in how much third-party debt they can take on (provided that debt is not guaranteed by the owners). The amendment effectively provides other entities (i.e. New Zealand entities controlled by a single non-resident) involved in eligible infrastructure projects with an exemption from the thin capitalisat ion rules if they only have third party debt. Key features The thin capitalisation rules have been amended to provide entities carrying out eligible infrastructure projects a limited exemption from the thin capitalisation rules by allowing them to claim deductions on debt that exceed the thresholds in section FE 5(1). The debt that can exceed the ordinary thin capitalisation thresholds under the exemption is limited to third-party debt (or debt that is from an investor but is made in the capacity of a third- party lender) that only has recourse against the assets associated with the infrastructure project and the income arising from those assets. Application date The amendments apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. 45 Detailed analysis Public project assets This exemption will apply only to debt that relates to public project assets – defined in section FE 4B(1), which are assets arising from a project performed under a contract that meets the fo llo wing criteria: • The project is established at the request of the New Zealand Government or a public authority. • The project is to provide, upgrade, or create assets in New Zealand and to operate or maintain those assets. • The contract is for a period of at least 10 years. • The public funding relating to the contract is approved by the Minister of Finance. • The contract provides that the assets are owned by the New Zealand Government or the public authority after the completion of the contract. Public project debt The exemption will apply only to public project debt – defined in section FE 4B(2). This debt must meet the following criteria: • The debt is applied to: – a project in order to give rise to public project assets, or income derived from public project assets; or – refinance a loan that was public project debt, including previous refinances of public project debt. • The debt must not be on-lent to a party that is not associated with the performance of the project, unless the on-lending is minor or incidental and the funds are still expected to be applied to the project. This is discussed further below under the heading on-lent funds. • The debt must give rise to interest expenditure that is incurred in New Zealand. Threshold debt amount The threshold debt amount is the amount of debt that an entity carrying on an eligible infrastructure project could have without being required to apportion its interest expenditure under section FE 6. It is calculated by multiplying the value of the public project assets and assets used in performing the project by the threshold debt percentage given by FE 5(1). If the amount of public project debt is less than this amount, all interest on the public project debt will continue to be deductible, even if the debt is of a type that is not intended to receive the benefit of this exemption (public project participant debt and unrestricted debt). If the amount of public project debt exceeds this amount, only interest on debt that is intended to receive the benefit of the exemption will be deductible. 46 Public project participant debt Public project participant debt, defined in section FE 4B(3) and used to define the item “member debt” in the formula in section FE 7B(4)(f), is public project debt issued by a participant in the infrastructure project that is made under an arrangement that has the purpose or effect of funding the project with debt equal to each participant’s interest in the project. Public project participant debt is not intended to get the benefit of the exemption. If this form of debt was able to get the benefit of the exemption, it could result in some private investors being able to allocate more debt to the infrastructure project than is appropriate. Example 14 is an example of where the partners in a partnership that is performing an eligible infrastructure project contract partially fund the project using debt in a way in which the debt is effectively a substitute for equity. Example 14 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered into a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20-year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. In order to carry out the project, ABC Partnership required $100 million. All three partners contributed $5 million of capital contribution. In addition, ABC Partnership received a loan from Bank Co of $70 million at an interest rate of 10% p.a. The final $15 million is provided in equal proportions by A Co, B Co and C Co by way of loans to ABC Partnership at a rate of 10% p.a. All of the $70 million debt from Bank Ltd will be considered public project debt. All of the $15 million from the three partners will also be considered public project debt. However, it will also be considered to be public project participant debt, because it was advanced under an arrangement between the three partners in a way that allowed them to fund the partnership in proportion to their interest in the partnership. Funding that is provided by a participant will not automatically be considered funding that is under an arrangement with a purpose or effect of allowing the participants to fund the project equal to their own ownership interests in the project. Examples 15 and 16 provide two types of situations in which debt from an investor in a project will not be public project participant debt. 47 Example 15 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered into a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand Government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20 year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. In addition to being a direct investor in infrastructure projects in New Zealand, C Co is also in the business of providing debt funding to a variety of New Zealand based projects. As a part of ABC Partnership’s process of procuring adequate debt funding for the project, it was decided that a combination of debt facilities from Bank Ltd and C Co was the best available funding option. Therefore, ABC Partnership obtained debt from Bank Ltd of $60 million at the beginning of the project at a rate of 10% p.a., with terms that gave Bank Ltd recourse solely to assets and income derived from the project. ABC Partnership also obtained debt from C Co of $15 million on the same terms as the debt facility from Bank Ltd. The funds provided under the debt facility from C Co are applied by ABC Partnership to give rise to public project assets, which means that the debt will be public project debt. However, it will not be considered public project participant debt. This is because the debt facility was only provided by one of the three partners (C Co). In addition, there is no evidence that this loan was made with the intent of being a substitute for C Co’s capital contribution to the project. Example 16 A Co, B Co and C Co, all of which are foreign companies, entered in a partnership called ABC Partnership. ABC Partnership entered into a contract with the New Zealand government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20-year period. All three partners have permanent establishments in New Zealand due to the activities of ABC Partnership. The partners agreed that capital contributions would be made once construction of the asset was complete. ABC Partnership obtained debt from Bank Ltd of $60 million at the beginning of the project at a rate of 10% p.a., with terms that gave Bank Ltd recourse solely to assets and income derived from the project. Before Bank Co would provide its debt facility, it required recourse to the capital contributions that all three of the partners would provide as a part of the project contract. Bank Ltd agreed that to secure this, each partner could provide a letter of credit, or provide the funds to ABC Partnership through a convertible debt instrument. At the beginning of the project, B Co and C Co provided letters of credit for the amount of their capital contribution. A Co decided to provide debt funding to ABC Partnership using a convertible debt instrument. That instrument provided for a fixed rate of return at an arm’s length price, and converted into A Co’s partnership interest at the same time that B Co and C Co put in their capital contribution. The convertible debt instrument is an arrangement that provides funding to the project, but it only provides funding from one of the partners (A Co). There is no evidence that the arrangement was designed with the purpose of allowing all of the participants to provide funding in proportion to their interests in the project. Further, rather than being a substitute for partnership interest, the convertible debt instrument is a substitute for the letters of credit provided by the other parties. As such, the convertible debt will not be public project participant debt. 48 On-lent funds A loan will not be considered public project debt if it is on-lent to a third party, unless that on- lending is simply due to a delay in the application of the funds to the project. This is to prevent an excess debt entity that has an interest in an eligible infrastructure project from taking on more debt than is necessary for the project and applying that debt to a separate project, while still getting the benefit of these measures. Depositing funds from a loan with a financial institution will generally be a delay in the application of funds to a project, unless it is intended that those funds will not be applied to the project. Unrestricted debt Unrestricted debt, defined in section FE 7B(4)(c), is public project debt that does not meet the definit ion of “public project participant debt” that is made on terms that give the creditor recourse that is not limited to the project. Recourse over public project assets, income derived from those assets and ownership interests in entities that are only involved in the infrastructure project will be recourse that is limited to the project. Unrestricted debt is not intended to receive the benefit of this concessionary rule. “Public project participant debt” is excluded from this definition to ensure that debt that meets both definitions does not have its interest deductions denied twice, as well as ensuring that an excess debt entity is still allowed an amount of debt that meets the threshold debt amount provided by the ordinary thin capitalisation rules. This principle is illustrated in Example 17. Example 17 X Co, Y Co and Z Co are all foreign companies and are the only shareholders in XYZ Co, a company incorporated in New Zealand. X Co is a majority shareholder with 60% ownership interest, while Y Co and Z Co each have a 20% ownership interest. XYZ Co entered into a contract with the New Zealand Government to provide and maintain an asset for a 20-year period. To carry out the project, XYZ Co required $100 million. All three partners contributed $5 million of equity. XYZ Co also secured a loan from Bank Co of $50 million with an interest rate of 10% p.a. This loan only has recourse against assets and income associated with the project. XYZ Co also secured a separate loan from Bank Co of $20 million with an interest rate of 5% p.a. This loan had a lower interest rate because it was on terms that gave Bank Co recourse over specific assets held by the shareholders of XYZ Co. As this item of debt gave Bank Co recourse that was not limited to the project, it will meet the definition of unrestricted debt. The final $15 million is provided by X Co, Y Co and Z Co in proportion to their ownership interest by way of loans to XYZ Co with an interest rate of 15% p.a. These loans meet the definition of public project participant debt. Over the course of the first year of the project, XYZ Co spends all of the $100 million on constructing the asset for the New Zealand Government. XYZ Co has a $110 million asset in its financial statements, which incorporates the present value of the expected payments from the New Zealand government over the next 20 years. For the purpose of section FE 7B, XYZ Co has a debt percentage of 77% (85 ÷ 110), assuming no non-debt liabilities for simplicity. In addition, XYZ Co has a worldwide group debt percentage of 50%. This means that it will have to apply the apportionment formula in section FE 7B(3). 49 For the purpose of the apportionment formula, the value of public project participant (member) debt is $15 million and member interest is $2.25 million. Member excess is $15 million, because the amount of public project debt that is not public project participant debt is $70 million and the threshold debt amount is $66 million ($110 million × 60%). Unrestricted debt is $20 million and unrestricted interest on this debt is $1 million. Unrestricted excess will not be the whole amount of the unrestricted debt however, as the amount of public project debt that is not either public project participant debt or recourse debt is $50 million, which is less than the threshold debt amount of $66 million. The amount of unrestricted excess is instead $4 million, which is the amount that the public project debt that is not public project participant debt ($70 million) exceeds the threshold debt amount. The result of the formula will be ($1 million × $4 million ÷ $20 million) + ($ 2.25 million × $15 million ÷ $15 million) = $2.45 million of income derived by XYZ Co. Disposing of interest Section FE 4B(1)(b) provides that public project assets cannot be disposed of within 10 years from the beginning of the contract, unless it is to the Crown, a public authority, or another person performing the contract. By allowing public project assets to be disposed of to “another person performing the project”, it is intended that an investor in an eligible infrastructure project will be able to dispose of their investment to a separate investor who will step into their shoes. The intent of this provision is to ensure that the concessionary rules will only apply to projects that cannot be abandoned at the discretion of the private investor(s). It is not intended to prevent an investor from disposing of its interest in the project to a third party that intends to carry on the original investor’s obligations under the project contract. Scope of exemption Section FE 7B(1) provides that this exemption will only apply to entities controlled by a single non-resident, partnerships, and New Zealand resident entities subject to the outbound thin capitalisat ion rules. A similar exemption already applies (in effect) where a separate entity is controlled by a group of non-residents. Where a person has an interest in more than one eligible infrastructure project, each project will be treated separately under section FE 7B(5). This bifurcation will prevent the debt that is related to one infrastructure project that is denied a deduction from mixing with a low debt project. Option of applying the rule Each excess debt entity that is required to apply the thin capitalisation rules in relation to public project debt has the choice of whether to apply the ordinary thin capitalisation rules, or to apply the special rules for eligible infrastructure projects. Section FE 7B(1)(c) allows an excess debt entity to choose whether or not they want to apply the concessionary rule. An election to apply the concessionary rule must be made at the time that the excess debt entity is first able to apply the concessionary rule to public project debt associated with the project. Once an election is made to apply the concessionary rule to a project, the excess debt entity must continue to use that approach for the life of the project. If an excess debt entity applies the ordinary thin capitalisation rules to the first calculation for public project debt that relates to the 50 project, then that entity will be unable to utilise the concessionary rule. However, if the concessionary rule was not in place before the first time in which the thin capitalisation rules are applied to the project, then the concessionary rule can still be applied to the project after the application date for the rule. Each excess debt entity that is applying the thin capitalisation rules for a specific infrastructure project will be able to make its own election. In addition, if an excess debt entity disposes of its interest in an eligible infrastructure project to a new investor, that new investor will have the opportunity to make an election at the time in which it is first required to make a thin capitalisation calculation that relates to the project.
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Base erosion and profit shifting – permanent establishment anti-avoidance rules Introduction This is the final version of the special report on permanent establishment anti-avoidance rules for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The rules were enacted on 27 June 2018 in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This special report was also published in the April 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 31 Number 3).

The rule deems a non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales- related activities for it here under an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance (and the other requirements of the rule are met). This PE is deemed to exist for the purpose of any applicable double tax agreement (DTA), effectively overriding the DTA’s definit io n of a PE, unless the DTA incorporates the OECD’s latest PE article. 1 In addition, the Act inserts further provisions under which an amount of income will be deemed to have a source in New Zealand if that income can be attributed to a PE in New Zealand. If a New Zealand DTA applies to the non-resident, the definition of a PE in that DTA will apply for this purpose. If no New Zealand DTA applies to the non-resident, then a new domestic law definition of a PE will apply. Background PE anti-avoidance rule New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, like those for most other countries, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. A PE is basically a fixed place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes a dependent agent that habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the non-resident. If a PE exists, then under the DTA New Zealand may tax only the income attributable to that PE (unless that income is also subject to another DTA provision). The non-resident must also have a PE in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. The problem the new rule is trying to address is the ability of some multinationals to structure their affairs so they do not have a PE in New Zealand, despite having significant economic activity carried on for them here. This usually involves the non-resident entity establishing a New Zealand subsidiary to carry out local sales related activities (the transfer pricing rules discussed elsewhere in this special report will apply to transactions between the non-resident and the subsidiary in this case). 1 This is contained in Article 12(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures To Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) 4 The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about PE avoidance, and have recommended measures to address it as part of their 15 point base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This includes a new, broader definition of a PE for DTAs. Under this new PE definition, a representative of the non-resident will only need to habitually play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification in order to give rise to a PE for the non-resident. This contrasts with the current PE definition in most DTAs, where the representative must habitually conclude contracts on behalf of the non- resident in order to give rise to a PE. The OECD has prepared the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) to rapidly implement the treaty changes recommended as part of its BEPS Action Plan. New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Under the MLI, the OECD’s new widened PE definition will be included in New Zealand’s DTAs, but only if the other country signs the MLI and elects to adopt that new PE definit ion. This new, widened definition should be effective in addressing the kinds of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. However a majorit y of New Zealand’s trading partners have not elected to adopt the widened PE definition, including some countries from which significant investment into New Zealand is made. Therefore, the practical effectiveness of the OECD’s widened PE definition is curtailed by its failure to be incorporated into many DTAs, and so it will not be sufficient to address the issue of PE avoidance in New Zealand. Source rules Under the current rules, there is a possibility that New Zealand may be entitled to tax a non- resident on its sales income under the PE article of a DTA, but cannot do so under our domestic source rules. There is general international consensus that if income is derived through a PE in a country, then it is sufficiently connected with that country to be taxed there. Accordingly, any income that is attributable to a PE should also have a New Zealand source under our domestic rules. In addition, in order to tax a non-resident on its New Zealand sales income, it is currently necessary to show that the income both has a New Zealand source and is attributable to a PE under a DTA. This increases the compliance and administrative burden of determining a non- resident’s tax liability for its sales to New Zealand customers. Key features PE anti-avoidance rule The Act introduces a new PE anti-avoidance rule in section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act. The rule deems a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the following criteria are met: • The non-resident is part of a large multinational group. The OECD has defined a “large mult inat ional group” as a group with at least EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The same revenue threshold is used for section GB 54. • The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand. 5 • A person (the “facilitator”) carries out an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about that particular supply. • The facilitator is associated with the non-resident, is an employee of the non-resident, or is commercially dependent on the non-resident. • The facilitator’s activities are more than preparatory or auxiliary to the non-resident’s supply. • The non-resident’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA that does not include the OECD’s latest PE article. • A more than merely incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement is to avoid New Zealand tax, or a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax. Where a supply is subject to the rule, the non-resident is deemed to make that supply through the deemed PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply are also attributed to the PE. The deemed PE exists for all the purposes of both the Act and the applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in that DTA. The tax consequences of the deemed PE are determined by the other provisions of the Act and the DTA. For example, New Zealand will have a right to tax the profits attributable to the PE under the business profits article of an applicable DTA (unless that business profits article provides otherwise). Section GB 54 may also apply in the context of a third-party channel provider arrangement. This is a single arrangement under which the non-resident supplies goods or services to a non- associated New Zealand resident and the New Zealand resident on-supplies the goods or services to identified New Zealand customers with the assistance of the facilitator. If the new rule applies in these circumstances, then the facilitator’s activities will give rise to a PE for the non-resident in respect of its supplies to the third-party channel provider. Source rule The Act also introduces a new source rule for PEs. This rule provides that any income attributable to a PE in New Zealand has a source in New Zealand. The Act introduces the fo llo wing definit ions for a PE: • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that has a DTA with New Zealand, the definition will be the same as the definition of a PE in that DTA. Any PE deemed to arise under section GB 54 will also be a PE under the definition (but only if the DTA does not include the OECD’s new PE definition). • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that does not have a DTA with New Zealand, the definition of a PE will be that set out in the new schedule 23 to the Act (domestic PE definit ion). This definit ion is based on New Zealand’s model DTA article 5, which includes the OECD’s new PE definition. The high-level application of all these new rules can be summarised as follows. In determining whether the non-resident has a deemed PE in New Zealand, the new PE anti-avoidance rule: • Applies if the jurisdiction where the non-resident is resident has a DTA with New Zealand, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition. 6 • Does not apply if the non-resident’s jurisdict ion has a DTA with New Zealand, and that DTA does incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition. Instead the OECD’s new PE definition in the DTA applies. • Does not apply if the non-resident’s jurisdiction does not have a DTA with New Zealand. Instead the new domestic PE definition (which incorporates the OECD’s new PE definit ion) applies. In all the above circumstances, if the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand then any income attributable to that PE will have a New Zealand source. Whether income is attributable to the PE will be determined under the standard PE profit attribution methodology applied by New Zealand. The application of these rules is illustrated in the flowchart below (which assumes there is not already a PE in New Zealand in relation to the supplies). Flow chart for application of new rules Is a NZ facilitator undertaking activities to bring about a supply by the non-resident? Not caught by any of the rules Does the non-resident’s home jurisdiction have a DTA with NZ? Does the DTA include the extended PE definition (either under the MLI or via bilateral DTA negotiation)? Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the new domestic PE definition in schedule 23. Is the NZ facilitator associated with, or commercially dependent on, the non-resident? The non-resident will have a NZ PE if either : it has one under the relevant DTA’s PE definition; or if the proposed new NZ PE avoidance rule applies (which, inter alia, requires a more than merely purpose of tax avoidance) Does the non-resident (or its group) have an annual consolidated turnover of more than EUR 750 million? Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the relevant DTA's PE definition. Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the extended PE definition in the DTA. No Yes YesNo No Yes Yes Yes No No 7 Application date(s) The new rules apply for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis PE anti-avoidance rule New section GB 54 deems a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the listed criteria in section GB 54(1) are met. These criteria are discussed below. The non-resident is, or is part of, a large multinational group - paragraph (j) A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 of the Act to require a consolidated accounting group turnover of at least EUR €750m (being the threshold described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines) for the previous period. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The multinational must also have a member in New Zealand (or income with a source in New Zealand) and a member overseas to be a “large multinational group” under the definition. The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand - paragraph (a) The definition of “supply” from the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) will app ly for this purpose. The time of the supply should also be determined under the GST Act for the purposes of section GB 54. In addition the relevant supply may be made by the non-resident either: • directly to a person in New Zealand; or • to another person in New Zealand (the intermediary) under an arrangement that includes the intermediary on-supplying the goods to another person in New Zealand. The intermediary does not need to be associated or otherwise related to the non-resident. The provision for intermediaries is intended to include third-party channel provider arrangements within the scope of the rule. Specifically, the provision is intended to ensure the rule can cover the supply by a non-resident to a third party where that supply is part of an arrangement under which those same goods or services are to be on-sold by the third party to an identified customer, and the non-resident’s facilitator deals with the end-customers to bring about the supply by the intermediary to the third party. Figure 4 illustrates this kind of arrangement (with the “Related party” in figure 4 being the facilitator). 8 Figure 4 N on-res id en t Sa le of go ods Third party channel provider Sa le of go ods Related party 10 0% owner ship Sales p rom otion and ser vices Customer The customer must be known to the facilitator at the time the non-resident makes its supply to the recipient for this rule to apply. This is to ensure that only arrangements involving an identifiable customer are caught by the rule. Third-party channel provider arrangements should be within the potential scope of section GB 54. This is because under such an arrangement, the non-resident, the facilitator, and the third party are working together to sell the particular goods or services to the end customer. Further, the non-resident’s supply to the third party is wholly dependent on the customer agreeing to purchase the goods. This means that the facilitator’s activities are made in relation to the non-resident’s supply to the third party as well as the third party’s on-supply to the end customer (which makes sense given that the facilitator acts for the non-resident, not the third party). Therefore, the activities of the non-resident’s facilitator should still be able to give rise to a PE for the non-resident (provided the other requirements of section GB 54 are met). Where section GB 54 does apply to deem a PE to exist in respect of a third-party channel provider arrangement, only the supply by the non-resident to the intermediary, and the facilitator’s activities, will be attributed to the deemed PE for the purposes of determining the profit attributable to that PE. The supply by the third-party channel provider to the customer, and the activities of the third-party channel provider, will not be attributed to the deemed PE. A person (the “facilitator”) in New Zealand carries out in New Zealand an activity for the purposes of bringing about the supply - paragraph (b) The facilitator must carry on an activity for the purpose of bringing about the supply to the recipient. Where there is an intermediary, the section will also apply if the facilitator carries on an activity for the purpose of bringing about the supply by the intermediary to the recipient. It is intended that only activities designed to bring about a particular supply to an identifiable person should potentially result in a deemed PE. Therefore activities that do not relate to a particular supply, such as advertising and marketing, would not be sufficient to trigger a possible PE under this requirement. After-sales activities, such as technical support, would also not be sufficient to meet this requirement, as they occur after the supply has been made. The kinds of activities that are within the intended scope of this provision primarily include activities designed to convince a particular customer to acquire the supply (as opposed to general marketing and advertising, which are not carried on in relation to particular, identifiable, customers). 9 Paragraph GB 54(1)(b) specifies that the facilitator cannot also be the intermediary. This is to ensure that section GB 54(1)(b) does not cause section GB 54 to apply to an ordinary distributor arrangement. In an ordinary distributor arrangement, the distributor would be carrying out all the particular sales activities on its own behalf, rather than on the non-resident’s behalf (and the non-resident would not have a separate facilitator in New Zealand assisting with the sales of the kind found in 3 rd party channel provider arrangements). Accordingly, in these circumstances the distributor’s activities should not give rise to a PE for the non-resident. The facilitator is associated, an employee, or commercially dependent on the non-resident - paragraph (c) Section GB 54 is aimed at circumstances where the facilitator is part of the same economic or control group as the non-resident. It is these circumstances which allow the multinational to avoid having a PE by splitting its activities between related companies (the non-resident supplier and the facilitator). Accordingly, for the section to apply, the facilitator must be associated with the non-resident under paragraph (c). The same concern also arises where the non-resident’s sales activities are carried out by a New Zealand entity that is not associated with the non-resident, but is commercially dependent on it. In this case, the non-resident is also able to have sales activities carried out by a special purpose entity over which it has significant de-facto control (by virtue of its commercial dependency). Accordingly, paragraph (c) also applies in these circumstances. The concept of “commercially dependent” is subjective. Therefore paragraph (c) instead uses the more precise test of whether the facilitator derives more than eight y percent of its assessable inco me from the non-resident or its associates in both the current and preceding income year. The requirement for the eighty percent test to be met for both years is to protect against the risk of a person unexpectedly falling within the definition for a year, which will give more certainty about when the test applies. It also ensures that a facilitator will not be commercially dependent in its first year of operation, when it is trying to build up its client base and may have a single customer only. For the sake of clarity, paragraph (c) also states that a facilitator includes an employee of the non-resident. This means that section GB 54 could potentially apply to “fly-in/fly-out” arrangements, where a non-resident sends one of its employees to New Zealand to undertake sales related activities. The reason for this is that there is no black letter rule in DTAs providing that fly in, fly out employees or representatives cannot give rise to a PE for a non-resident (in particular, there is no requirement in our DTAs for a dependent agent’s activities to be connected with a fixed and permanent place in New Zealand in order for them to give rise to a PE). Whether a PE arises is always a question of fact and circumstance. There may be some circumstances in which a fly in, fly out employee or representative does give rise to a PE. Fly in, fly out employees and other representatives of the non-resident should therefore not be automatically excluded from section GB 54. Otherwise, a PE could still be avoided in a fly in and fly out arrangement. However, the dependent agent provision in most DTAs requires that the non-resident’s representative (that is, the emplo yee) habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the non- resident. This means that the employee’s activity in New Zealand must be regular to some degree before it can potentially result in the avoidance of any tax under section GB 54(1)(h). For example if an employee of the non-resident only made a short visit to New Zealand in order to promote or negotiate a single supply, we would not expect this to result in the avoidance of 10 any tax under section GB 54(1)(h) (as the employee’s activity would not have given rise to a PE under the DTA even if the employee had executed the contract in New Zealand). Therefore, we would not expect section GB 54 to apply in this case. However if the employee made regular trips each year to conclude contracts, then the employee potentially could be habitually concluding contracts in New Zealand, even if it only concluded a single contract on each trip 2 . As a result of paragraph (c), any sales-related activity carried on by an unrelated independent agent will generally not give rise to a PE under section GB 54. This also reflects the current definit ion o f a PE in New Zealand’s DTAs. The activity is more than preparatory or auxiliary - paragraph (d) As stated above, only activities that are designed to bring about a particular supply should be within the scope of section GB 54. To support this, paragraph (d) provides that any activities that are only preparatory or auxiliary to the non-resident’s supply of goods or services do not trigger the application of section GB 54. An example of preparatory or auxiliary activities is general marketing or advertising of a non-resident’s products. Warehousing and delivery of the supplied goods would also usually be preparatory or auxiliary. However, this would not be the case for example where the main business activity of the non-resident was delivering goods. Paragraph (d) is also intended to incorporate the exception in most DTAs, which provides that preparatory and auxiliary activities do not give rise to a PE. Therefore in interpreting the meaning of “preparatory or auxiliary” in paragraph (d), it is intended that the OECD’s Commentary on the articles of the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (OECD Commentary) will be relevant. The following table sets out examples of when paragraphs GB 54(1)(a) to GB 54(1)(d) (collectively referred to as the “sales test”) would apply. Even if the sales test is met for an example, section GB 54 would apply only if the section’s remaining requirements were met (in particular, the requirement that the relevant arrangement was carried out for a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance). New Zealand activity Application of the sales test in paragraphs GB 54(1)(a)–(d) There is no activity in New Zealand in relation to the supply. The sales test is not satisfied. There is no “facilitator” under paragraph (b). There is an online platform operated by a subsidiary of the non-resident through which New Zealand customers can order goods over the internet. The web-server for the platform is located in Australia and the platform is maintained and run by staff located in Australia. The sales test is not satisfied. Although the platform can be accessed by customers located in New Zealand, all the activity in respect of the platform is carried on by the subsidiary’s employees and assets in Australia. Accordingly, paragraph (b) is not met as the subsidiary does not carry on any activity in New Zealand. 2 See paragraphs 98 and 29 of the OECD Commentary to Article 5 11 New Zealand activity Application of the sales test in paragraphs GB 54(1)(a)–(d) A non-resident operates a website through which customers worldwide can order goods and services. The website is located and maintained outside New Zealand. General advertising and marketing activity is undertaken in New Zealand by a subsidiary of the non-resident to make potential users of the website aware of its benefits and uses. The subsidiary does not deal directly with any particular customers. In this case, there is an activity carried on in New Zealand, however the activity does not facilitate a particular supply to a customer. Accordingly paragraph (b) is not met. In addition the advertising and marketing activities are considered to be preparatory or auxiliary to making a supply. Consequently paragraph (d) also is not met. A non-resident operates an off-shore website, through which it sells directly to customers in New Zealand. The non-resident also has a contract with an unrelated third party in New Zealand to store its goods at the third party’s warehouse. The third party has several similar arrangements with other, unrelated, suppliers. The non-resident does not have any particular part of the warehouse set aside for it, and it does not have the right to access the warehouse without prior arrangement. The third party carries on an activity in New Zealand for the non-resident. However the third party is not associated with the non-resident, or commercially dependant on it. Accordingly section GB 54(1)(c) is not met, and so the sales test is also not satisfied. A non-resident sells technical equipment to New Zealand customers. It has a subsidiary in New Zealand which undertakes technical demonstrations of the equipment to existing or potential customers to make them aware of the equipment’s capabilities. The subsidiary does not discuss any of the sales terms or customise orders for a particular customer. The sales test is not satisfied. The subsidiary’s activity is in the nature of general advertising / marketing and does not relate to a particular supply to a customer. Accordingly paragraph (b) is not met. In addition, the subsidiary’s activities would also be preparatory or auxiliary, so paragraph (d) is not met either. However, if the subsidiary went beyond demonstrating the equipment and instead worked with a particular customer to specify the equipment best suited to the customer’s needs, and/or directly persuade the particular customer to acquire the equipment, then the subsidiary’s activity would relate to any subsequent supply of that specified equipment to the customer, and so paragraph (b) would be met. Such an activity would also be more than preparatory or auxiliary, and so paragraph (d) would be met. Accordingly the sales test would be met in these circumstances. A non-resident company offers an online platform, under which owners of horses in New Zealand can contract to supply their horses to riders for a fixed period. The platform is accessed via a smartphone app, with the server and all staff responsible for maintaining it located outside New Zealand. The non-resident company does have a subsidiary in New Zealand, which assists horse-owners in meeting the requirements to list their horses on the platform. However the subsidiary does not liaise with any horse riders. The sales test is not satisfied. The activity of the subsidiary is essentially technical support for horse owners that have already decided they want to join the platform. Accordingly it is preparatory or auxiliary to the supply of platform services by the non-resident. However, if the subsidiary instead persuaded individual horse-owners to sign up to the platfor m, then the sales test would be met in respect of the platform’s recurring supply of services to the horse owner. 12 New Zealand activity Application of the sales test in paragraphs GB 54(1)(a)–(d) A non-resident supplies photocopiers to New Zealand businesses. Its sale team is located offshore. However the non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand which provides technical support to existing customers. The subsidiary repairs malfunctioning photocopiers as part of the non-resident’s warranty programme and trains new purchasers on how to use the photocopiers. The sales test is not satisfied. The subsidiary’s activity of providing repairs and training is made after the non-resident’s supply has occurred, and therefore is not made for the purpose of bringing about the supply. This is the case even though the promise to provide such repairs and training may have encouraged the New Zealand businesses to acquire the photocopiers. A non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand. The non-resident sells cars to the subsidiary. The subsidiary then markets and sells the cars to customers in New Zealand. Sometimes a customer requests a car with specifications that the subsidiary does not stock. In this case, the subsidiary enters into a contract to sell the car to the customer, and then buys that car from the non-resident for on-supply to the customer. The sales test is not met. The subsidiary is a normal distributor, rather than a facilitator for the sale of cars by the non-resident to New Zealand customers. In particular the subsidiary is not acting as an intermediary for the sale of the cars by the non-resident. This is because there is not a single arrangement under which the non-resident supplies the cars to the subsidiary and the subsidiary on-supplies the cars to the customer. Instead there are two arrangements – one for the sale of the cars to the subsidiary, and another for the sale of the cars by the subsidiary to the customer. It does not matter in this regard whether the subsidiary acquires the car before or after it agrees to sell that car to the customer. A multinational has a New Zealand subsidiary, whose staff have initial and on-going contact with customers. The subsidiary negotiates the contractual terms for the first sale to the customer. However orders after the first are placed directly with the offshore sales representative. The sales test will be met for the first order. Whether the sales test is met for subsequent orders will depend on whether the subsequent sales are part of the same arrangement as the sale that was facilitated by the subsidiary. For example, if the subsidiary negotiated an arrangement under which the New Zealand customer could make repeat orders of paper from the non-resident, then the sales test would be met in respect of any repeat orders even if the customer sent the order directly to the offshore sales representative. However if for example the subsidiary facilitated an order for one product sold by the non-resident, but then the New Zealand customer ordered a completely different product and negotiated the terms of sale for that product with the offshore sales representative directly, then the sales test would not be met for that different product. 13 New Zealand activity Application of the sales test in paragraphs GB 54(1)(a)–(d) A non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand that discusses a potential sale by the non- resident with targeted customers and ensures that the non-resident’s contractual terms for the sale are acceptable to the customer. The sales test is met. The subsidiary is carrying out an activity in respect of a particular supply and the activity is undertaken for the purpose of bringing that supply about. In this case the subsidiary does not need to actually negotiate the contracts with the customers, as its activities are still made for the purpose of bringing a particular supply about. For example if the subsidiary initiated and arranged the sale in all other respects, but left any disagreement over the non-resident’s contractual terms to be negotiated directly between the non-resident and the customers, then the sales test would still be met. This is because the subsidiary would still be carrying on an activity for the purpose of bringing about a particular supply, even though it did not carry on all the activities necessary to bring about that supply. A non-resident does not have a subsidiary in New Zealand. Instead the non-resident sends one of its employees to New Zealand for 4 weeks every year to meet with potential customers. The employee markets the non- resident’s products to potential customers and answers any questions they may have about the operation of the products. However the employee does not discuss contractual terms and does not help customise particular orders for customers. The employee in this case is a facilitator for the non-resident under paragraph (c)(i). However, the employee’s activity does not relate to a particular supply by the non-resident, so paragraph (b) is not met. In addition, the employee’s activities are preparatory or auxiliary, so paragraph (d) also is not met. However if the employee instead worked with a particular customer to specify the products best suited to the customer’s needs and/or negotiated contractual terms for the supply of those products, then the employee’s activity would relate to the subsequent supply of those products to the customer, and so paragraph (b) would be met. Such an activity would also be more than preparatory or auxiliary, and so paragraph (d) would also be met. Accordingly, the sales test would be met. A non-resident supplies home theatre components to custom installers in New Zealand. The custom installers work with customers to design their home theatres, and on- sell the home theatre components to the customers as part of the installation of the agreed design. The non-resident also has a subsidiary in New Zealand. For large projects, the non-resident’s subsidiary works with both the custom installer and the customer to determine the customer’s needs, select the products best suited to those needs, and provide expert technical oversight on their installation. The non-resident still supplies the home-theatre components to the custom-installer, who on- supplies them to the customer. The sales test will be met for large projects (but not for smaller projects that do not involve the subsidiary working with the customer installer and the customer). The non-resident’s subsidiary is the facilitator in this example. The non- resident makes a supply to an intermediary in New Zealand (the custom installer) who in turn on-sells the products to another person in New Zealand (the customer). The facilitator (the subsidiary) carries out an activity for the purpose of bringing about the sale to the recipient (the customer). Finally, the supply by the non-resident to the custom installer, and the supply by the custom installer to the customer, are both part of the same arrangement. 14 The non-resident is relying on a DTA that does not include the OECD’s new PE definition – paragraph (e) As discussed above, the OECD has introduced a new PE definition to counter PE avoidance. This new PE definition has been included in its Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (Model Treaty), and will also be inserted into the DTAs of participating countries under the MLI (provided both jurisdictions elect to include it). The OECD’s new PE definition has several components. The relevant component here is that contained in article 12(1) of the MLI. In particular, the part of article 12(1) providing that a dependent agent PE will arise for a non-resident where a person habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non-resident that are routinely concluded without material modificat ion. The Government’s view is that this amended definition should be sufficient to prevent the kind of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. It is also expected that section GB 54 and the OECD’s new PE definition will apply in broadly similar circumstances. For this reason, paragraph (e) provides that section GB 54 will not apply where the non- resident’s income from its supplies to New Zealand customers is covered by a DTA which incorporates the OECD’s new PE rule. It does not matter for this purpose whether the OECD’s new PE rule is inserted into the DTA by the MLI, or is subsequently agreed by New Zealand and the other party in bilateral treaty negotiations. The new PE rule does not apply automatically to a DTA once the participating countries sign the MLI. Instead each country must first elect to include the new PE rule, then ratify the MLI. The OECD’s new PE rule will then apply to the DTA with effect from the date specified in articles 34 and 35 of the MLI. While article 12(1) of the MLI and section GB 54 are expected to apply in broadly similar circumstances, there may be differences in their application due to their different formulations. In particular paragraphs GB 54(1)(a) to GB 54(1)(d) (referred to in the examples above as “the sales test”) will collectively apply more broadly than the requirement under article 12(1) that a person habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non- resident. On the other hand, section GB 54 also requires the arrangement to have a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance (under paragraphs GB 54(1)(h) and (i)), which article 12(1) does not. Therefore section GB 54 might apply to some circumstances which article 12(1) does not, and vice versa The domestic law definition of a PE does not apply to a non-resident – paragraph (f) New section YD 4B(3) inserts a definition of a PE into the Act for non-residents to whom no DTA with New Zealand applies. This domestic definition includes the OECD’s new PE definit ion. Accordingly, paragraph (f) provides that section GB 54 does not apply if the non- resident is subject to the domestic definition of a PE under section YD 4B(3). The income from the supply is not already attributable to a PE – paragraph (g) This is a mechanical provision. If the non-resident’s income is already attributable to a PE, then there should not be any PE avoidance occurring in respect of that income. Accordingly, paragraph (g) provides that section GB 54 will not apply in these circumstances. 15 The arrangement does not have a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance – paragraphs (h) and (i) In order for section GB 54 to apply, the relevant arrangement must have a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of avoiding tax under paragraphs (h) and (i). This requirement has been inserted for two reasons: • to target the rule’s application at BEPS activities, rather than more ordinary commercial arrangements; and • to make the rule consistent with New Zealand’s DTA obligations. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA (as discussed further below under “other matters”). Tax for this purpose means both New Zealand income tax, and a combination of New Zealand income tax and foreign income tax. This is to prevent any argument that an arrangement’s avoidance of New Zealand tax was only incidental to its avoidance of foreign tax. For income years starting on or after the enactment date of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, sections (h) and (i) will also apply to arrangements that have a purpose or effect of avoiding other types of tax (as specified by section YA 2(3)), such as NRWT. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in section BG 1 also requires that an arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. However, in applying the GAAR, the courts have imposed a further requirement that the arrangement uses the relevant provisions in a manner not contemplated by Parliament (see Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115). This further requirement arises out of the need to reconcile Parliament’s purpose for the specific tax provisions (which may have been intended to confer a benefit in the circumstances) with its purpose for section BG 1 (see Ben Nevis at \[102\]). This further requirement is usually referred to as the ‘Parliamentary contemplation test’. Section GB 54 is a specific anti-avoidance provision, rather than a GAAR. Further, the scope of section GB 54 has been carefully circumscribed. For these reasons, there is no need to reconcile the application of section GB 54 with the intended application of any other provisions. Instead, the intention is for only the more than merely incidental purpose test to be used in determining whether section GB 54 applies. It is not intended for the Parliamentary contemplation test (or the earlier scheme and purpose test) to also apply. Subparagraphs (h) and (i) have been drafted to achieve this. It would not be appropriate to refer directly to the Parliamentary contemplation test in the legislation, as this is a judicial rather than a statutory requirement (and so might change in the future). Instead, the subparagraph has been drafted without reference to the definitions of “tax avoidance arrangement” or “tax avoidance” used by section BG 1. This is to make it clear that the test under subparagraphs (h) and (i) does not import the Parliamentary contemplation test (or the earlier scheme and purpose test) associated with those definitions. Only the case law relevant to whether there is a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance should apply (for example, excluding any Parliamentary contemplation or scheme and purpose component of the test under the GAAR) in determining whether the more than merely incidental purpose test in subparagraphs (h) and (i) is met. 16 There is a significant body of case law on the more than merely incidental test. This case-law has generally required a degree of artificiality or contrivance before the test can apply (see the decision of Woodhouse P in Challenge Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (CA)). In particular, the test has been held not to apply to ordinary commercial arrangements (i.e. arrangements undertaken for commercial purposes only). More information on the application of the merely incidental test is set out in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, paragraphs 395–438. An example of the application of section GB 54 is set out below. The facts of this example are loosely based on the French Valueclick tax case, in which the non-resident was held not to have a PE under the French/Irish DTA (Sté Valueclick Ltd., n° 17PA01538 (CAA Paris, 9e ch., 1 March 2018)). France does not have an equivalent to section GB 54. Example A non-resident (Parent) operates a business of personalised digital marketing, allowing brands to connect with consumers individually. Parent is part of a large multinational group, with consolidated global revenues well in excess of €750 million. Parent is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE article. Parent has a subsidiary in New Zealand (Subsidiary), whose purpose is to promote Parent’s services in the New Zealand market. Subsidiary contractually agrees to provide the following services to Parent: • marketing and sales support, which includes the identification and prospection of potential customers; • ongoing management services and back office support services; and • administrative assistance, including accounting, human resources management, information technology and treasury. Subsidiary’s employees in practice negotiate the terms of the sales agreements and draft certain key terms with the customers. In addition, Subsidiary’s employees behave towards customers as if they were representatives of the Parent. Subsidiary’s employees legally cannot bind or otherwise act in the name of Parent. The acceptance of the customer contract always requires Parent to sign the contract offshore. In practice however, the signature is an automatic validation of the contracts negotiated and developed by the employees of Subsidiary. Applying section GB 54 to this case: • There is a non-resident (Parent) making supplies to a person in New Zealand (the customers). Consequently, paragraph GB 54 (1)(a) is met. • A facilitator (Subsidiary) carries on an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about those supplies under an arrangement with the non-resident (Parent). Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(b) is met. • The facilitator (Subsidiary) is associated with the non-resident (Parent), as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(c) is met. • Subsidiary carries out significant sales activities for Parent. Accordingly, Subsidiary’s activities are more than preparatory for, or auxiliary to, Parent’s supplies. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(d) is met. • Parent’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s latest PE definition (as set out in article 12(1) of the MLI). Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(e) is met. • Section YD 4B(3) incorporates a definition of a PE into domestic law, but only for non-residents that are not subject to a DTA. In this case, Parent’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA, and so section YD 4B(3) does not apply to Parent. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(f) is met. 17 • The non-resident does not already have a PE in New Zealand. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(g) is met. • The arrangement results in the non-resident paying less tax in New Zealand compared to if the non-resident had a PE in New Zealand. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(h) is met. Since section GB 54(2) deems a PE to exist, the relevant counterfactual for this purpose is the non-resident having a PE in New Zealand. However if the existence of a PE would not affect the non-resident’s tax liability, then paragraph GB 54(1)(h) would not be met. • The non-resident is part of a large multinational group, as that term is defined in section YA 1. This is because Parent’s consolidated accounting group has: – over EUR €750 million of revenue for the preceding income year; – a member resident in New Zealand (Subsidiary); and – a member resident overseas (Parent). Therefore, section GB 54(1)(j) is met. As a result, section GB 54 will apply if the reduction in tax for the Parent is a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement between Parent and Subsidiary. In determining whether this test is met, previous case law on the more than merely incidental component of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 will be applicable. The Commissioner’s interpretation of this case law is set out in her Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 Tax Avoidance and the Interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (particularly paragraphs 395–438). However, the Parliamentary contemplation component of the general anti-avoidance rule will not apply. In applying the more than merely incidental test to the arrangement, it is significant that all the sales activity is carried out by Subsidiary in New Zealand. Parent’s only role is the pro-forma execution of the contracts negotiated by Subsidiary. There is no convincing commercial purpose for the non-resident to formally execute the contracts offshore when it was not involved in negotiating the contracts. In addition, the legal form of the arrangement does not reflect its substance. This is because in reality Subsidiary creates the customer contracts in New Zealand. The formal execution of the customer contracts by Parent offshore is thus artificial. It is also this feature that also allows Parent to avoid having a PE in New Zealand, and so allows the non-resident to avoid tax in New Zealand. Accordingly it can be objectively concluded that Parent’s execution of the contracts offshore was inserted into the arrangement for the purpose of avoiding New Zealand tax. Consequently this tax avoidance purpose is not merely incidental to another purpose of the arrangement. Therefore, the arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance, and so paragraph GB 54(1)(i) is met. As a result, section GB 54 will apply to the arrangement. Consequences of application (sections GB 54(2), BH 1(4)) If section GB 54 applies, then under section GB 54(2) the non-resident is treated as having a PE in New Zealand. Supplies made by the non-resident are then treated as being made though that PE – but only if section GB 54(2) applies to those particular supplies. So for example, if the non-resident made some supplies in New Zealand in respect of which a related entity in New Zealand carried out sales activities (and the other requirements of the rule were met), then those supplies would be treated as made through the PE. However, if the non-resident also made other supplies in New Zealand and no related entity in New Zealand carried out any sales related activities in respect of those supplies, then those supplies would not be treated as made through the deemed PE for tax purposes. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supplies will also be attributed to the PE for the purposes of determining the profit attributable to it (and so the taxable income in New Zealand). Other activities of the facilitator (for example activities in relation to another taxpayer’s supplies) will not be attributed to the PE The normal PE profit attribution rules apply to determine the amount of profits attributable to the deemed PE under section GB 54. In this regard, New Zealand follows an earlier version of 18 the OECD’s latest PE profit attribution rules (and not the latest version, which is known as the “authorised OECD approach”, or AOA). This is for two reasons: 1. The AOA only applies to DTAs which incorporate the latest version of Article 7 (business profits) of the Model Treaty. None of New Zealand’s DTAs incorporate this version of Article 7, so the AOA is not relevant to New Zealand’s DTAs. 2. New Zealand does not agree with some aspects of the AOA and has made an explicit reservation against it. DTAs, as international agreements, do not have any legislative effect except to the extent provided for in domestic legislation. DTAs are given legislative effect for tax purposes by section BH 1(4) of the Income Tax Act. This provides that DTAs have effect, despite anything else in the Act (subject to a list of exceptions). To make it clear that section GB 54 overrides any applicable DTA, an amendment to section BH 1(4) adds GB 54 to the list of sections which a DTA cannot override. This means that section GB 54 will deem a PE to exist for all the purposes of the Income Tax Act notwithstanding anything in that DTA. The PE under section GB 54 will also be deemed to exist for the purposes of the other articles of the DTA. This is because those articles only have legal effect as provided for in the Income Tax Act, and section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act provides that the taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. Therefore the Income Tax Act will give legal effect to the other articles of a DTA on the basis that the taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. It is important to note that section GB 54 on its own simply deems a PE to exist. It does not directly impose any tax or deem any assessable income to arise. Instead, the tax consequences of a deemed PE will be determined under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act and any applicable DTA. Example Section GB 54 applies to a non-resident subject to the New Zealand-Australia DTA. Consequently: • The taxpayer is deemed to have a PE for the purposes of New Zealand law. This also means it has a PE for the purposes of giving legal effect to a DTA. • The business profits article of the DTA (Article 7) applies to allow New Zealand to tax the profits attributable to that PE. • The ordinary tax rules apply on the basis that the taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. In particular, new section YD 4(17C) deems the income attributable to the PE to have a New Zealand source. • The PE under section GB 54 exists for the purposes of any other provision of the DTA. For example, it is deemed to exist for the purposes of Article 12(5) of the DTA. This means that New Zealand could impose NRWT on any royalties paid by the non-resident that are borne by or deductible in calculating the profits of the PE. In this regard the Act also inserts new section YD 4(17D), which provides that income has a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax it under an applicable DTA. Accordingly if New Zealand was entitled to impose NRWT on royalties under Article 12(5) in respect of the deemed PE, then those royalties would also have a New Zealand source under article YD 4(17D). This means that the royalties would also be subject to NRWT under the Income Tax Act. • Items of income that are dealt with by other articles of a DTA will continue to be taxed in accordance with those other articles. This is because any conflicts between the tax treatment under a specific article (assuming the existence of a PE) and the tax treatment under Article 7 are dealt with under Article 7(5) of the DTA. Article 7(5) provides that the provisions of the other articles are not affected by the provisions of Article 7. For example, an Australian resident’s profits from shipping and air transport would continue to be dealt with under Article 8 of the DTA (rather than Article 7), even if section GB 54 applied to deem the non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand in respect of that activity. 19 Other matters The Government anticipates that some multinationals may wish to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to section GB 54. One of the policy goals of section GB 54 is to encourage taxpayers to move away from PE avoidance structures. Therefore, the Government is happy for taxpayers to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to section GB 54 by either adopting a formal PE, or by moving to a standard distributor model (where the goods or services are sold by the non-resident to an associated party in New Zealand, who then on-sells the goods to unrelated customers). Section GB 54 applies for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The standard income year for taxpayers starts on 1 April (see the definition of “income year” and “tax year” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). This means that non-residents to whom section GB 54 applies will also have income years starting on 1 April (meaning section GB 54 will apply to them from 1 April 2019), unless they have applied to the Commissioner for a different balance date under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Non-residents to whom section GB 54 applies may wish to change their New Zealand income year to align it with their financial reporting period. The Commissioner’s policy on requests to change balance dates for income years is set out in standard practice statement SPS 18/02 Requests to change a Balance Date. The statement notes that the Commissioner will accept retrospective requests to change balance dates provided certain criteria are met. While section GB 54 will override DTAs, it should not conflict with New Zealand’s obligations under those DTAs. This is because New Zealand’s DTAs are based on the OECD’s Model Treaty. The OECD Commentary is an important part of the context in which these DTAs are internationally understood. Section GB 54 is an anti-avoidance provision, as it only applies to an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that states are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). However, it is important that section GB 54 applies notwithstanding anything in a DTA. This is to simplify the application of the rule. Otherwise it would be necessary to show that the application of section GB 54 was consistent with a DTA in each particular case. This would be a time-consuming and resource intensive exercise. The Government also considers that taxpayers should not be able to rely on DTAs to protect their tax avoidance arrangements. This is the same position that the UK and Australia have taken in respect of their PE anti-avoidance rules. As a result of this, the effect of section GB 54 on a taxpayer will not be reversed under a DTA’s mutual agreement procedure. Several provisions of the Income Tax Act refer to a “fixed establishment”. A “fixed establishment” is conceptually similar to a PE, but they are not the same – for example a fixed establishment does not include a dependant agent of a non-resident. Section GB 54 only apples to deem a PE to exist – it does not also deem a fixed establishment to exist. Therefore provisio ns referring to the existence of a fixed establishment will not be affected by section GB 54. Finally, the Government expects section GB 54 to apply in broadly similar circumstances to the OECD’s new PE definition. However, there will be differences in the application of the two rules, due to their different formulations. 20 PE source rule Section YD 4(17C) Under the new source rule in section YD 4(17C), inco me of a non-resident will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. This is subject to exceptions for certain dividends and income already subject to a specific source rule. Dividends are excluded from section YD 4(17C), provided they are paid on a share in a foreign company that is not revenue account property. The reason for this exclusion is so that income earned overseas by a subsidiary of a non-resident does not become subject to New Zealand tax just because the shareholding of the subsidiary is managed by the New Zealand PE. However where the shares are held for the purpose of resale (or are otherwise on revenue account), then the dividends will be attributable to the New Zealand PE. This is because such shares will be investment property of the PE (rather than part of its operating structure), and so any returns in respect of them should be assessable. Officials plan to consider whether this exclusion for dividends should be limited to active income earned by the foreign company (as determined under the CFC rules). This is to address a concern that non-residents could avoid New Zealand tax by shifting passive income out of the New Zealand PE and into an overseas subsidiary that is still managed by the PE. Officials were aware of this concern when the Act was passed, however there was insufficient time to consult on the fairly complex legislation that would be needed to include an active/passive distinction. Officials will consult on proposals to introduce an active/passive distinction before any further legislative action is taken. Income with a source under section YD 4(17C) has its own apportionment rule under new section YD 5B. However the Income Tax Act currently has specific source apportionment rules for income from sea transport (sections YD 4(15) and YD 6), non-resident general insurers (sections YD 4(16) and YD 8(2)) and non-resident life insurers (sections YD 4(17) and EY 48). The intention is for these specific apportionment rules to still apply to income from these sources, rather than the PE income apportionment rule in section YD 5B. To allow for this, the new source rule in section YD 4(17C) is stated to be subject to sections YD 4(15) to YD 4(17). Section YD 4B Section YD 4(17C) only applies if a taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. New section YD 4B inserts a definition of a PE into the Act for this purpose. Under section YD 4B: • If a New Zealand DTA applies in respect of the taxpayer, then: – The definition of a PE in that particular DTA will be used (section YD 4B(2)). The effect of this will be that where income is attributable to a PE in New Zealand under an applicable DTA, that income will automatically have a New Zealand source under section YD 4(17C). – Any PE arising under section GB 54 will also be a PE, as defined under section YD 4B(2). However section GB 54 only applies if the relevant DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition (section GB 54(1)(e)). • If no New Zealand DTA applies to the taxpayer, then the new definition of a PE in schedule 23 of the Income Tax Act will apply. The PE definit io n in schedule 23 is based on New Zealand’s model PE article, and incorporates the OECD’s new PE definition. 21 New section YD 4B(4) has been inserted to clarify that the OECD Commentary should be used as a guide in interpreting the definition of a PE in schedule 23. However, the OECD Commentary does not itself have legislative effect. Therefore, the guidance in the OECD Commentary should not be applied in contradiction to the words of schedule 23. In particular, the OECD Commentary applies in respect of the OECD’s model PE definit io n, which the definition in schedule 23 departs from in some areas. In addition, New Zealand has made reservations and observations on the Commentary to the PE definition (Article 5). The OECD Commentary should therefore be used as a guide subject to these differences, reservations and observations. It is the OECD Commentary, as amended at the start of the relevant income year, which is to be used as a guide in interpreting schedule 23. This version of the OECD Commentary may be later than the version applying at the commencement of the Act. Section YD 5B Under section YD 4(17C), it is only inco me attributable to the New Zealand PE that has a New Zealand source. New section YD 5B sets out how both the income and the expenses attributable to a PE are to be determined. This section has been drafted to replicate the wording of the business profits articles of most of New Zealand’s DTAs (adjusted to reflect differences in terminology between the Income Tax Act and DTAs). Accordingly, whether income and expenditure are attributable to a PE for the purposes of section YD 5B should be determined under the normal PE profit attribution principles (as applied by New Zealand). As noted above, New Zealand does not follow the AOA for PE profit attribution. The AOA also only applies in respect of the latest version of the business profits article in the OECD’s Model Treaty. Section YD 5B has been deliberately worded to follow the earlier version of the business profits article, and not the latest version in respect of which the AOA applies. Accordingly the AOA should not apply to determine the profit attributable to a PE under section YD 5B. Instead, the earlier version of the OECD’s profit attribution method currently followed by New Zealand should be used. It is important to note that sections YD 4(17C) and YD 5B determine the amount of income and expenditure attributed to the PE. They do not determine whether such income and expenditure are assessable or deductible. This will be determined under the Income Tax Act’s usual assessability and deductibility rules. This is the same tax treatment as for a PE under the DTA. In particular, the deductibility of expenses attributed to a PE under the DTA is also determined under the Income Tax Act’s general deductibility rules (see paragraphs 30–34 of the OECD Commentary to Article 7). Section YD 5(1BA) The Income Tax Act 2007 already contains a source apportionment rule in section YD 5 for income from carrying on business in New Zealand (section YD 4(2)) or making or performing a contract in New Zealand (section YD 4(3)). A PE in New Zealand will also usually derive income from carrying on business in New Zealand or making or performing contracts in New Zealand. Accordingly without amendment, section YD 5 would also apply to apportion the income attributable to a PE. 22 Consequently, section YD 5(1BA) has been inserted to confirm that, where there is a PE, the PE attribution rules in new section YD 5B should be used, rather than the existing apportionment rules in sect ion YD 5. It is not expected that there would be material differences in the amount of income apportioned to New Zealand under section YD 5B and section YD 5. However, one of the purposes of section YD 4(17C) is to simplify the taxation of income attributable to a PE, by not requiring taxpayers and Inland Revenue to apply two sets of rules (the DTA rules and the domestic source rules). Consequently, section YD 5B has been inserted to remove any doubt that the PE profit attribution methodology which applies under the DTA should also be used in the domestic source rules. Example S Co is a company resident in Panama. It carries on a shipping business and has an office in New Zealand through which it enters into contracts to ship goods from New Zealand around the world. It also imports its own goods into New Zealand on its ships and sells them through a retail shop located under its offices. Whether S Co has a PE in New Zealand is determined under section YD 4B. Because Panama and New Zealand do not have a double tax agreement, the permanent establishment definition in schedule 23 will apply (under section YD 4B(3)). S Co should use the OECD Commentary on article 5 as a guide in determining whether S Co has a PE under the definition in schedule 23, as the OECD Commentary was at the beginning of that income year. For S Co’s 2017–18 income year, this means that it should ignore the amendments made to article 5 of the OECD Commentary part way through 2017. It is clear that S Co has two PEs in New Zealand under the schedule 23 definition, as it has two fixed places of business in New Zealand through which it carries on its shipping and its retail businesses. Therefore S Co has a separate PE for each of those separate businesses. Under section YD 5B, S Co should determine the amount of profit attributable to its retail PE using New Zealand’s standard (non-AOA) approach to PE profit attribution. S Co can use the relevant parts of the OECD’s guidance on PE profit attribution for this purpose. In particular, since section YD 5B does not incorporate the wording needed to implement the authorised OCED approach (AOA) to profit attribution, none of the OECD guidance relating to the AOA will be applicable. Inland Revenue will shortly issue guidance on what parts of the OECD’s profit attribution guidance are relevant for New Zealand. Once S Co has determined the profit attributable to the retail PE, the amount of income and expenditure comprising that profit will automatically have a New Zealand source under sections YD 4(17C) and YD 5B. S Co will then need to apply the ordinary tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 for assessability, deductibility, and timing to that income and expenditure in order to calculate its taxable income for the year. In respect of S Co’s income from its shipping PE, the source of this income is specifically dealt with under section YD 4(15) and YD 6. Income with a source under section YD 4(15) is specifically excluded from the application of section YD 4(17C). Therefore section YD 4(17C) will not apply to S Co’s shipping income (with section YD 4(15) applying instead). If S Co was resident in a country with which New Zealand had a DTA, then the tax treatment would be the same as above, except that: – whether S Co had a PE would be determined under the DTA itself (and section GB 54), rather than schedule 23 (see section YD 4B(2)); – S Co’s ability to tax the shipping PE’s income would be restricted by the terms of the DTA. For example, if the New Zealand/Australia DTA applied, article 8 of that DTA would prevent New Zealand from taxing S Co’s shipping activity. 23 DEEMED SOURCE RULE YD 4(17D) The Act inserts new section YD 4(17D) into the Income Tax Act 2007. The new subsection will deem an item of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if New Zealand has a right to tax that item of income under a DTA. There is an exclusion from this rule for dividends from shares in foreign companies that are not revenue account property. The new rules aim to both simplify the test for determining whether an item of income has a source in New Zealand, and ensure that all items of income that New Zealand is entitled to tax under a DTA will be taxable under domestic law. Background Under our domestic law, New Zealand can only tax income if it has a source in New Zealand. Section YD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the types of income that are treated as having a source in New Zealand for income tax purposes. New Zealand has also entered into DTAs, which set out when New Zealand has a right to tax the income of a taxpayer resident in the counterparty to the DTA. These rules override anything in our source rules. This gives rise to two issues: • The DTA may give New Zealand a right to tax income of the non-resident. However that income may not have a New Zealand source under section YD 4. This means that New Zealand is unable to tax the income, despite the other country having agreed in the DTA that New Zealand may tax that income. • It is necessary to apply 2 sets of rules – one in the DTA and one in section YD 4, to determine whether New Zealand may tax an item of income. Australia has a rule deeming income which Australia may tax under its DTAs to have a source in Australia for domestic law purposes. Detailed analysis The Act inserts new subsection (17D) into section YD 4. The subsection deems an item o f income to have a source in New Zealand if we have a right to tax the item of income under a DTA. There is an exclusion from this rule for dividends from shares in foreign companies that are not revenue account property. This is to preserve the exclusion from dividends under section YD 4(17C), discussed above. Section YD 4(17D) also provides that the apportionment rules for shipping in YD 6, non- resident general insurers in section YD 8(2)) and non-resident life insurers in EY 48 will continue to apply in respect of income from those sources rather than new subsection (17D). Application date The amendment applies for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. 24 HYBRID MISMATCH RULE FOR NRWT Sections BH 1(4), RF 11C New section RF 11C inserts a new hybrid mismatch rule allowing New Zealand to charge non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) on payments under certain cross border hybrid financing instruments if New Zealand treats the payment as interest. This rule overrides our double tax agreements (DTAs). Background The Government has identified a further hybrid mismatch issue that arises in the following circumstances. The New Zealand PE of a non-resident company borrows money from another non-resident in the same overseas jurisdiction as the corporate headquarters of the PE. This occurs under a hybrid instrument which New Zealand treats as debt, but the other country treats as shares. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is able to charge NRWT on interest payments made by a non- resident’s New Zealand PE to another non-resident. However, New Zealand is not able to charge NRWT on dividends paid by one non-resident company to another (regardless of whether the dividends are connected with a PE in New Zealand). This means that whether New Zealand can charge NRWT on payments under a hybrid financial instrument in these circumstances depends on whether the payments are classified as interest or dividends for DTA purposes. Inland Revenue’s view has been that New Zealand can charge NRWT on the payments on the basis that the source state’s (that is, New Zealand’s) classification of the payment determines its tax treatment under the DTA. However, a question has recently been raised as to whether this view is correct. If this view is not correct, then the PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments (as the payments are characterised as “interest” under New Zealand domestic law), but the payments would not be subject to NRWT (as the payments are characterised as “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, as outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise (for example, some of our DTAs provide specific exemptions to the sovereign wealth funds of the other country). The hybrid mismatch measures in the Act ensure that payments made under such hybrids cannot be both deductible in New Zealand and non-assessable overseas. This removes the incentive to use these types of hybrids in most, but not all cases. In particular the existing hybrid measures still permit payments under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT in some cases. This tax treatment differs from that applying to either ordinary interest (which is deductible and subject to NRWT) or dividends (which are non- deductible), and could be attractive to some taxpayers. 25 Australia already has a rule effectively providing that outgoing payments are not dividends for DTA purposes (and so are subject to Australian NRWT) if they are treated as interest under Australia’s domestic law. 3 Application date(s) New section RF 11C applies retrospectively from 1 April 2008. A savings provision is available for payments where taxpayers have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable in respect of such cross-border interest payments made prior to the introduction of the Bill (on 6 December 2017). Key features The Act inserts new section RF 11C. Section RF 11C(1) provides that the section applies to a payment of interest (as defined in section YA 1) by a company that is resident outside New Zealand under an applicable DTA to another person who is also resident outside New Zealand under that DTA. Section RF 11C(2) then provides that the payment is treated as interest under the NRWT rules and the DTA, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DTA. The Act also amends section BH 1(4) to clarify that section RF 11C overrides the applicable DTA. The combined effect of the legislation is that New Zealand may withhold NRWT from a cross border payment that is interest under section YA 1, regardless of whether it is treated as a dividend under the applicable DTA. 3 Section 3(2A) of Australia’s International Tax Agreements Act 1953
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Base erosion and profit shifting – transfer pricing rules Sections GC 6 to GC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Introduction This is the final version of the special report on transfer pricing rules for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The rules were enacted on 27 June 2018 in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This special report was also published in the April 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 31 Number 3).

Sections GC 6 and GC 13 have been amended to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. Application date The amendments to the transfer pricing rules generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Arrangements that comply with an Advance Pricing Agreement issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 July 2018 will be grand-parented so they remain subject to the old transfer pricing rules until the Advance Pricing Agreement expires. Key features The Act makes the following amendments to New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation: • In addition to applying to transactions between associated persons, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when there are transactions between members of non-resident owning bodies and companies, and to cross-border related borrowings. (Section GC 6(2) (b)) • Including a reference to using the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the transfer pricing rules are applied. (Section GC 6(1B)) • The economic substance and actual conduct of the parties, along with the legal contract, will inform the transfer pricing analysis. In certain circumstances, the economic substance and actual conduct will have priorit y over the terms of the legal contract. This is achieved by requiring the transfer pricing transaction to be “accurately delineated” using the approach in section D.1 of chapter I of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines. (Section GC 13(1B)) • Where a transfer pricing arrangement is not commercially rational because it includes unrealistic terms that unrelated parties would not be willing to agree to, the approach described in section D.2 of chapter I of the new OECD guidelines may apply to disregard and, if appropriate, replace the transaction. (Section GC 13(1C)) • Requiring the arm’s length amount of consideration to be determined using arm’s length conditions. This clarifies that it may be necessary to adjust some conditions of the arrangement other than the price, in order to determine the arm’s length price. (Section GC 13(1)(b)) • Placing the onus of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence (such as transfer pricing documentation) that their transfer pricing positions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length condit ions). The general onus of proof in section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will now apply to transfer pricing as well as other tax matters. 3 • The time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing posit ion can be increased to seven years, in those cases where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has notified the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four-year time bar. (Section GC 13(6)) Background The OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines were substantially updated in 2017 as part of the OECD’s BEPS project. The updates to chapter I of the guidelines were designed to align transfer pricing outcomes with value creation (BEPS Actions 8–10). The OECD has noted that the new guidance ensures that: • actual business transactions undertaken by associated enterprises are identified, and transfer pricing is not based on contractual arrangements that do not reflect economic realit y; • contractual allocations of risk are respected only when they are supported by actual decisio n-making; • capital without functionality will generate no more than a risk-free return, assuring that no premium returns will be allocated to cash boxes without relevant substance; and • tax administrations may disregard transactions which are commercially irrational. The Act amends New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation to ensure New Zealand’s legislation aligns with the new OECD transfer pricing guidelines and that our rules remain effective at combatting BEPS. Other changes have been made to strengthen Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor and enforce the new transfer pricing rules. These changes include: • Putting the onus of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence (such as documentation) that their transfer pricing positions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length conditions). • Allowing Inland Revenue to extend the time bar for assessing transfer pricing issues to seven years, in those cases where Inland Revenue has notified the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four-year time bar. • Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide Inland Revenue with additional powers to request information from large multinational groups in order to assist a tax investigation of the relevant multinational. These information changes are explained in the special report on administrative measures (see the section on “Requesting information from large multinational groups”). 4 Detailed analysis GC 6(1): Purpose of the transfer pricing rules The purpose of the transfer pricing rules is to substitute an arm’s length amount of consideration if a person’s net income has been reduced by the conditions of a cross-border arrangement with a related party. The purpose statement in section GC 6(1) has been updated so it refers to the special rules for pricing cross-border related borrowing as well as the general transfer pricing rules for pricing the acquisition or supply of goods, services, or anything else. This reflects the fact that the transfer pricing rules now include some special rules for determining how cross-border related borrowing is priced. These rules are in sections GC 6(3B) and GC 15 to 19 and require certain adjustments to be made to the credit rating of the borrower and conditions of the financial arrangement, prior to the general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 being used to price the adjusted financial arrangement. The special rules for cross-border related borrowing are explained in the special report on interest limitat ion (see the section on “Cross-border related borrowing”). GC 6(1B): Applying the OECD transfer pricing guidelines New Zealand has contributed to and applied the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines since they were first published in 1995. As transfer pricing practices have become more sophisticated, the OECD through its BEPS work has updated its guidelines to represent the agreed international best practice. Subsection GC 6(1B) has been added so that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation explicitly refers to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines by requiring the transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 to be applied consistently with these guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are defined in section YA 1 as the guidelines published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as OECD 2017, OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017, OECD Publishing, Paris. This definition refers to the July 2017 edition of the guidelines available on the OECD’s website at http://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing . The general policy intention is that when a taxpayer has correctly applied the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to perform a transfer pricing analysis that demonstrates that their transfer pricing posit ions sat isfy the arm’s length principle, they should have a reasonable degree of certainty that these tax posit ions will also meet the requirements of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. However, the guidelines still need to be applied in conjunction with New Zealand’s legislation as there are some specific rules in New Zealand’s legislation which are additional to the guidance material in the OECD transfer guidelines. For example, the OECD transfer pricing guidelines were developed to provide guidance for how to apply Article 9 of the OECD model double tax agreement to “associated enterprises” as 5 defined in that Article. New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation applies to a wider range of cross-border related party arrangements (as is further explained in section GC 6(2)(b) below). Another area where New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules are more prescriptive is that New Zealand’s legislation has special rules that must be used for determining how cross-border related borrowing is priced. These rules are in sections GC 6(3B) and GC 15 to 19 and can require certain adjustments to be made to the credit rating of the borrower and conditions of the financial arrangement, prior to the general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 (and the OECD transfer pricing guidelines) being used to price the adjusted financial arrangement. The application date for new section GC 6(1B) is income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means transfer pricing positions taken on or after 1 July 2018 must be analysed in a way that is consistent with the July 2017 version of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The July 2017 version of OECD guidelines, or later updates to the guidelines may also be relevant for analysing tax positions taken before 1 July 2018 to the extent that they are not inconsistent with New Zealand’s domestic law at that time (in sections GC 6 to GC 14). The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are periodically updated by the OECD and New Zealand participates in developing the updated guidelines. When these updates occur, New Zealand will consider the revisions to the guidelines with a view to updating the definit io n of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines in section YA 1 so it refers to the latest version of the guidelines. Future taxation bills would be used to include these updates to the definition in section YA 1. If a future taxation Act updates the definit io n of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to refer to a newer version of the guidelines, the rules must be applied in a way that is consistent with the new version of the guidelines from the date that the new Act applies. However, when the relevant updates to the OECD guidelines are not inconsistent with New Zealand’s domest ic law, the latest version of the guidelines may also be relevant in analysing tax positions from a period prior to the guidelines being updated. This is because in most cases updates to the guidelines will clarify or provide further guidance on existing concepts, rather than introducing significant new concepts or practices. In this regard applying the latest version of the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines can aid with the application and interpretation of transfer pricing legislation that was enacted earlier. Inland Revenue and many taxpayers routinely apply the latest versions of the guidelines to assist in analysing cases from earlier years, as the latest guidelines are generally consistent with our existing law. GC 6(2)(b): Defining the related party arrangements to which the transfer pricing rules apply Section GC 6(2) defines the transfer pricing arrangements that the transfer pricing rules apply to. A transfer pricing arrangement is a cross-border arrangement between related parties. The meaning of “arrangement” (which is described in section GC 6(2)(a)) and “cross-border arrangement” (which is defined in section GC 6(3)), are unchanged under the new legislation. However, the concept of “related party” has been expanded under the new legislation. 6 Prior to July 2018, the transfer pricing rules only applied to arrangements between “associated persons” as defined in section YA 1. For example, two companies are associated persons if they have fifty percent or more common ownership. The new rules apply to cross-border arrangements between: • associated persons (as defined in section YA 1); • a company and a member of a non-resident owning body where the members of the non- resident owning body collectively have voting or market value interests in the company of fifty percent or more; and • a non-resident (lender) and another person (borrower) that includes a financial arrangement that is a cross-border related borrowing (as defined in GC 6(3)). Associated persons Associated persons are defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The definition of “associated persons” is unchanged by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This means the set of “associated persons” who were required to apply the transfer pricing rules prior to 1 July 2018, will continue to be subject to the transfer pricing rules after 1 July 2018 (assuming they continue to meet the definition of “associated persons” in section YA 1). Some typical cases where persons are associated include: • Two companies, where the same group of persons own fifty percent or more of the voting interests, market value interests or control by other means in both of the companies. • When a person who is not a company owns twenty five percent or more of the voting interests or market value interests of the company. • A limited partnership and a partner when the partner owns twenty five percent or more in a right, obligation, or other property, status or thing of the limited partnership. • A non-limited partnership and a partner in the partnership. • Natural persons who are close relatives. Many of these tests also include aggregation rules whereby if two persons are associated under another rule their interests are aggregated for determining whether the relevant voting, market value or control thresholds are met. So, for example if a mother owns more than fift y percent of one company and her daughter owns more than fifty percent of another, the companies would be associated with each other. Non-resident owning bodies Section GC 6(2)(b) extends the application of the transfer pricing rules so they also apply when the transfer pricing arrangement is between a company and a person who is a member of a non- resident owning body that has at least fifty percent of the ownership interests in the company. This rule is intended to capture private equity structures where it is common for a group of shareholders to co-ordinate on how to debt fund the New Zealand company. In addition to using debt funding such private equity structures can also use other arrangements such as service fees 7 or royalties to shift profits out of New Zealand in order to reduce the overall tax paid on their investments. The extension of the application of the transfer pricing rules to non-resident owning bodies means that the transfer pricing rules will apply to both debt and non-debt transactions that members of these non-resident owning bodies have with companies in New Zealand. The concept of a “non-resident owning body” is defined in section YA 1. It is used in the non- resident withho lding tax (NRWT) rules as an interest payment to a member of a non-resident owning body is not eligible for a 0% rate of NRWT (when the approved issuer levy has been paid by the borrower). The concept is also used for determining whether the thin capitalisation rules apply as companies which are controlled by a non-resident owing body are subject to thin capitalisation rules. This means that the transfer pricing rules will generally apply to the same set of companies and non-resident investors as the thin capitalisation rules and the NRWT rules for related party interest payments. A non-resident owning body is a group of non-residents or entities (such as trusts settled by non-residents), that have one or more characteristics indicating they are acting together to debt- fund a New Zealand company. These characteristics include: • having proportionate levels of debt and equity among the group. Proportionality is a characteristic of acting together as it generally requires a degree of coordination to achieve; • having an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded with an arrangement between the members of the group concerning debt if the company is not widely held. Widely held is defined in section YA 1 and means a company has at least 25 shareholders (counting any associated shareholders as one shareholder) and is not controlled by five or fewer of these shareholders; and • having an arrangement between the members of the group concerning debt in the company in a way recommended by a person (such as a private equity manager), or implemented on behalf of the members. Because the definition of a non-resident owning body requires the shareholders to hold debt in the company in proportion to their shareholding or for the relevant agreement or arrangement to be a co-ordinated debt funding arrangement, the transfer pricing rules should not apply simply because a company has a typical shareholder’s agreement setting out how shareholders agree to exercise their individual shareholder rights. Ownership interest is defined in YA 1 to mean voting or market value interests. Therefore if the group of members in the non-resident owning body collectively own fift y percent or more of the voting or market value interests of the company, the transfer pricing rules will apply to all debt and non-debt arrangements between the company and a member of the non-resident owning body. Cross-border related borrowings The application of the rules also specifically includes cross-border related borrowings subject to the new transfer pricing rules for debt arrangements. 8 A cross-border related borrowing is defined in section GC 6(3B). This definition is further explained in the special report on interest limitation (see the section on “Cross-border related borrowing”). GC 7 to GC 12 Sections GC 7 to GC 12 are unchanged under the new legislation. These sections go through the various cases where the amount of consideration is substituted with an arm’s length amount of consideration because a person’s net income has been reduced by the conditions of a cross- border arrangement with a related party. GC 13(1): Determining arm’s length amounts Section GC 13(1) outlines the process for determining an arm’s length amount of consideration. This is the amount of consideration that independent parties after real and independent bargaining would have agreed upon as the price for the identified transaction if the identified transaction had occurred under arm’s length conditions. Identifying the related party transaction The first step is to take the transfer pricing arrangement (between the related parties) and apply section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to accurately delineate the transaction. If the accurately delineated transaction is not commercially rational so that there is no price which would be acceptable to independent parties in exchange for the relevant goods or services being supplied, the approach described in section D.2 of chapter I of the guidelines will apply, and can be used to disregard or replace the transaction. Section GC 13(1)(a) defines the term “the identified transaction”. In most cases this will be the accurately delineated transaction found by applying section D.1 of chapter I. However, in cases where section D.2. of chapter I applies to replace the transaction, the “identified transaction” will instead be the replacement transaction. Comparability analysis In order to determine the arm’s length conditions, including the arm’s length price, the identified transaction is benchmarked against comparable transactions between independent parties. This involves the use of a comparability analysis whereby the taxpayer: • identifies the arm’s length conditions which might be expected to be agreed between independent parties operating at arm’s length for comparable arrangements to the identified transaction; and • uses one or more of the approved transfer pricing methods to produce the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount of consideration that would be agreed upon as part of the arm’s length conditions. 9 One of the five approved transfer pricing methods (or a combination of these methods) described in chapter III of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines must be used to perform the comparability analysis. The references in GC 13(1) to the “identified transaction” are not intended to limit the methods that taxpayers may use to perform a comparability analysis – any of the five methods listed in GC 13(2) can be used to perform this analysis. The meaning of “identified transaction”, arm’s length conditions and “arm’s length amount of consideration” are further explained below. GC 13(1)(b): Arm’s length conditions “Arm’s length conditions” are defined in section GC 13(b) as the conditions independent parties after real and independent bargaining might be expected to agree upon for the identified transaction. In the phrase “arm’s length conditions”, “conditions” is not a defined term in the Act but is intended to include financial values such as the price, gross margin, net profit, and the division of profit between the acquirer and supplier as well as other conditions. This is consistent with paragraph 1.7 of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines which refers to “...conditions (including prices, but not only prices).” Conditions may also include features going beyond the financial indicators relevant in applying transfer pricing methods. The insertion of “conditions” is intended to clarify that a wider set of features, other than the price may be relevant when considering if the conditions of the transfer pricing arrangement need to be substituted with the conditions that would apply under comparable arm’s length arrangements. The relevant arm’s length conditions for a transfer pricing arrangement will depend on the specific facts of the arrangement. The conditions will be relevant to the extent to which independent parties would take those conditions into account when evaluating the terms of a similar arrangement. The process of accurately delineating the arrangement using section D.1. of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines will assist in establishing which conditions are relevant. New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation also refers to the concept of an “arm’s length amount of consideration” (and has done so since the rules were first introduced in 1995). The Federal Court in Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation \[2015\] FCA 1092 found that the term “consideration”, which was used in Australia’s transfer pricing rules at the time the disputed transaction took place, had a broader meaning than just the price (interest rate). The Federal Court agreed that the Commissioner could make adjustments to other conditions (security and loan covenants in the Chevron case), that could have an impact on the price. This decision illustrates that the term “consideration” should also be interpreted more widely than price. The insertion of the new term “conditions” helps to clarify the existing policy of considering features in addition to price, rather than creating a different policy for pre-July 2018 and post-July 2018 tax positions. 10 GC 13(1B): Determination of identified transaction The transfer pricing rules require the overall economic substance of the arrangement to be considered. The analysis is not limited to the legal contracts and takes into account the wider economic arrangement and commercial environment. In particular, if the legal contracts do not reflect the actual conduct of the parties, the actual conduct of the parties will be used to apply the transfer pricing rules. New section GC 13(1B) achieves these outcomes by requiring the transfer pricing arrangement to be “accurately delineated using the approach described in section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.” Section D.1 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines describes the process for accurately delineating the transaction. This process involves identifying the economically relevant characteristics. Some broad categories of the economically relevant characteristics are listed in paragraph 1.36 of the guidelines as: • The contractual terms of the transaction (as described in section D.1.1). • The functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction, taking into account assets used and risks assumed, including: – how those functions relate to the wider generation of value by the mult inat ional enterprise group to which the parties belong; – the circumstances surrounding the transaction; and – industry practices (D.1.2). • The characteristics of property transferred or services provided (D.1.3). • The economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate (D.1.4). • The business strategies pursued by the parties (D.1.5). As part of accurately delineating the controlled transaction, the terms of the legal agreement may be disregarded to the extent that they are inconsistent with the actual conduct of the parties. This is explained in paragraphs 1.45 and 1.46 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide several examples that illustrate particular aspects of how to accurately delineate transactions. This includes examples of: • how the terms of the written contract may be clarified or supplemented by examining the actual conduct of the parties (see paragraph 1.44); • how to deal with differences between written contractual terms and conduct of the parties, with the result being that the actual conduct of the parties is used to accurately delineate the transaction (paragraph 1.48); • using the conduct of the parties to identify a transaction where one has not been identified by the multinational (paragraph 1.50); and • how risks should be assumed according to how the parties actually manage and control these risks (see paragraphs 1.83–1.85 and 1.89). 11 GC 13(1C): No transaction or differing transaction Where the transfer pricing arrangements entered into are not commercially rational there is consequently no price which would be acceptable to independent parties in exchange for the relevant goods or services being supplied and acquired. In such cases it is not possible to apply a transfer pricing analysis as transfer pricing relies on being able to identify the arm’s length price which would be agreed between independent parties. To address this problem, section D.2 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides guidance about the circumstances where a transaction can be disregarded, and if appropriate replaced with an alternative transaction that allows for a transfer pricing analysis to be performed. These circumstances are described in paragraphs 1.122-1.125 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. Accordingly, section GC 13(1C) applies when the requirements of paragraph 1.122 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines are met. In summary, this paragraph states that the accurately delineated transaction can be disregarded and potentially replaced, if it would not be commercially rational for independent enterprises to enter into the transaction, because it would not be possible to determine a price which would be acceptable to both of the independent parties at the time that the transaction was entered into. The full text of paragraph 1.122 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines: “1.122 This section sets out circumstances in which the transaction between the parties as accurately delineated can be disregarded for transfer pricing purposes. Because nonrecognition can be contentious and a source of double taxation, every effort should be made to determine the actual nature of the transaction and apply arm’s length pricing to the accurately delineated transaction, and to ensure that non- recognition is not used simply because determining an arm’s length price is difficult. Where the same transaction can be seen between independent parties in comparable circumstances (i.e. where all economically relevant characteristics are the same as those under which the tested transaction occurs other than that the parties are associated enterprises) non-recognition would not apply. Importantly, the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it should not be recognised. Associated enterprises may have the ability to enter into a much greater variety of arrangements than can independent enterprises, and may conclude transactions of a specific nature that are not encountered, or are only very rarely encountered, between independent parties, and may do so for sound business reasons. The transaction as accurately delineated may be disregarded, and if appropriate, replaced by an alternative transaction, where the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner in comparable circumstances, thereby preventing determination of a price that would be acceptable to both of the parties taking into account their respective perspectives and the options realistically available to each of them at the time of entering into the transaction. It is also a relevant pointer to consider whether the MNE group as a whole is left worse off on a pre-tax basis since this may be an indicator that the transaction viewed in its entirety lacks the commercial rationality of arrangements between unrelated parties.” 12 In cases where the accurately delineated transaction is replaced it should be replaced with a new transaction that enables a price that would be commercially rational for independent enterprises to agree to. As noted in paragraph 1.124 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, the replacement transaction should closely adhere to the facts (as accurately delineated) of the original transfer pricing transaction and only diverge from those facts to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a commercially rational outcome: “1.124 The structure that for transfer pricing purposes, replaces that actually adopted by the taxpayers should comport as closely as possible with the facts of the actual transaction undertaken whilst achieving a commercially rational expected result that would have enabled the parties to come to a price acceptable to both of them at the time the arrangement was entered into.” Paragraph 1.128 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides an example where an arrangement is replaced. The example involves a lump sum payment for all future intangibles developed by an associated company over the next 20 years. This arrangement would not be commercially rational for independent parties to agree on as it is not possible to value these future intangibles. In this example, a number of potential replacement transactions could be considered including a financing arrangement, a contract for research services or a licencing agreement for some specific identified intangibles. The transaction will be disregarded and not replaced if the commercially rational deal that independent parties would accept in comparable circumstances is one that involves no supply or acquisit io n. This is provided for by new section GC (13)(1C)(a). If the transaction is disregarded under section GC 13(1C)(a) of the transfer pricing rules it will be null and void for determining the person’s New Zealand income tax liability. Note that there may still be NRWT on the payments as existing section GC 12 means that transfer pricing adjustments do not affect NRWT obligations. Paragraphs 1.126 and 1.127 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide an example of a transaction which is disregarded and not replaced. This example involves a property prone to flooding which an independent insurer would not agree to insure as evidenced by there being no active insurance market for properties in that area. GC 13(2): Approved transfer pricing methods Section GC 13(2) requires the taxpayer to determine the arm’s length amount of consideration under arm’s length conditions by performing a comparability analysis as required by the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, chapter III, using any one or a combination of the five transfer pricing methods that are described in chapter II of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The choice of method that should be used is the method (or combination of methods) which produces the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount of consideration (see section GC 13(1)(c)). Chapter II of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines includes some further guidance on what transfer pricing method should be used, depending on the relevant circumstances of the arrangement and data availability. The requirements under the updated section GC 13(2) are very similar to requirements under the previous section GC 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The main differences are that the names of the transfer pricing methods have been updated to the modern terminology and the 13 updated provision now refers to using the OECD guidelines as guidance for how to perform a comparability analysis using the methods described in those guidelines. In addition to the guidance in chapter III of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, there is some relevant guidance on the factors that a comparability analysis should take into account in section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD guidelines. In particular, paragraph 1.39 of the OECD guidelines notes that “differences in economically relevant characteristics between the controlled and uncontrolled arrangements need to be taken into account when establishing whether there is comparability between the situations being compared and what adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.” The economically relevant characteristics are the same characteristics that were considered when accurately delineating the identified transaction. Some broad categories of what these economically relevant characteristics could include are listed in paragraph 1.36 of the OECD guidelines. Onus of proof shifted to the taxpayer When New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules were introduced in 1995 they placed the onus of proof on the Commissioner. That is, the arm’s length amount of consideration has generally been determined by the taxpayer under section GC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This position has changed with the repeal of sections GC 13(4) and (5). This means that the general onus of proof in section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will place the onus of proof for transfer pricing issues onto the taxpayer. New Zealand’s tax system operates on a self-assessment basis, where the taxpayer is expected to keep sufficient records to support its tax position. This change is therefore consistent with the fact that the onus of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters. It also reflects the practical reality of a transfer pricing analysis. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm’s length transactions, the taxpayer is far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than Inland Revenue. At the time of publication, the onus of proof was on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in Australia, the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany. This means most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the onus of proof for other countries. Putting the onus of the proof onto the taxpayer increases the importance of transfer pricing documentation. A lack of adequate documentation may make it difficult for the company to rebut alternative arm's length conditions proposed by Inland Revenue. 14 Documentation The revised chapter V of the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines recommends a three-tiered approach to transfer pricing documentation: • a master file providing an overview of the multinational's global business operations, transfer pricing policies and global allocation of income and economic activity; • a local file providing detailed information regarding material related party transactions; and • a Country-by-Country report which must be prepared and filed by large multinational groups. New Zealand’s Country-by-Country reporting requirements apply to New Zealand-headquartered multinational groups with EUR €750m of consolidated revenue in the preceding income year. These requirements are further described in the special report on administrative measures (see the section on “Country-by-Country reports” covering the new section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994). New Zealand endorses this approach to transfer pricing documentation. Further guidance on transfer pricing documentation is available in chapter V of the OECD guidelines and the annexes I and II to chapter V which outline the information which should be included in the master file and the local file. To supplement the OECD guidelines, Inland Revenue publishes some short guidance on certain transfer pricing topics on its website at https://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/ . This supplementary guidance includes a topic on Inland Revenue’s view on best practices for preparing useful and suitably focused transfer pricing documentation at https://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/transfer- pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-documentation.html. Seven year time bar for transfer pricing issues in some circumstances Inland Revenue generally has four years from the end of the tax year in which a taxpayer files an income tax return to investigate and amend the tax position taken by the taxpayer in their return. This four year limit is known as the time bar. The general four year time bar has been extended to seven years for the purposes of the transfer pricing rules in limited circumstances. New section GC 13(6) extends the time bar by allowing the Commissioner to amend an assessment of tax, under the transfer pricing rules, within a seven year period after the tax year in which the relevant tax return was originally filed, if the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four year time bar. The notification that a tax audit or investigation has commenced and that the Commissioner is applying GC 13(6) will be provided in writing. If the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (or an officer of Inland Revenue who has been delegated this authority) has not provided the relevant taxpayer with a written notification within four years of the tax return being filed, the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply. 15 The notification requirement means the majority of taxpayers will have the same level of certainty as the general four year time bar as they will know after four years that since Inland Revenue has not provided written notification that the time bar for their transfer pricing positions is being extended that these positions are final. Example In May 2020, Company B files a tax return for their income year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 which includes some transfer pricing positions. In May 2024, four years have passed since the tax return was filed. As Inland Revenue has not notified the taxpayer that their transfer pricing positions are being investigated, the taxpayer will have certainty that their transfer pricing positions (and any other tax positions) taken in their May 2020 tax return can be considered final under the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. In other cases, where Inland Revenue identified a tax risk and notifies the taxpayer within four years of the relevant tax return being filed, Inland Revenue will have seven years from the date the tax return was filed to make a transfer pricing adjustment. The use of the words “despite the time bar...” in section GC 13(6) means the that in those cases where 13(6) applies, the seven year time bar overrides the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The seven year time bar can be applied for all transfer pricing issues that are subject to sections GC 6 to GC 19, including “cross-border related loans” that are subject to sections GC 15 to 19. The ability to extend the time bar for transfer pricing issues to seven years under section GC 13(6) applies from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means that tax positions taken in returns relating to income years that began before 1 July 2018 will continue to be subject to the existing four year time bar. Example In June 2020, Company C files a tax return for their income year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. In 2021, Inland Revenue begins an investigation of Company C’s tax return for their 2019/20 tax year. The investigation involves a series of meetings, site visits, interviews, and requests for information held by Company C and other members of their group as well as procuring expert views on certain issues from independent international specialists. In January 2024 Inland Revenue provides written notification to Company C that they are being investigated for the transfer pricing positions that they have taken in their June 2020 tax return and that the Commissioner is applying section GC 13(6) to extend the time bar for the transfer pricing issues so adjustments can potentially be made up until June 2027. In March 2024, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment to Company C regarding their transfer pricing position in their June 2020 tax return. In this case, the extension of the time bar was not actually required, as an assessment was made within four years of the relevant tax return being filed.

This special report provides information on recently enacted changes to apply Goods and Services Tax (GST) to low value imported goods. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 was enacted on 26 June 2019 and features a number of amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 2. The changes apply GST to imported goods valued at or below NZ$1,000 (such as books, clothing, cosmetics, shoes, sporting equipment and small electronic items) that are imported from offshore merchants by consumers in New Zealand. The new rules will require non-resident merchants, operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers (referred to collectively as “suppliers”) to register and return GST on these supplies if they exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in total over a 12-mont h period. 3. The new rules apply from 1 December 2019 and non-resident suppliers will be able to apply to be registered from 1 September 2019, with the registration taking effect from 1 December 2019. The registration form and information about registering for GST will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). For general enquiries, or to apply for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to exercise various discretions included in the rules, email info.lvg@ird.govt.nz. 4. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation which will be published in the September edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. 5. The new legislation is broadly consistent with the GST rules that have applied to supplies of remote services since 1 October 2016. A special report from May 2016 contains detailed guidance on the GST on remote services rules and is available online at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-sr-gst-cross-border- supplies/overview. 6. Legislation references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) unless stated otherwise. Key features Scope of the new GST rules 7. From 1 December 2019, GST will apply to “distantly taxable goods” – generally low- value imported goods supplied by non-resident merchants to New Zealand consumers. The new rules will require non-resident merchants, operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to register and return GST on these supplies if the 8 supplies in aggregate exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. 8. The new rules apply GST to a wide range of “distantly taxable” goods, 1 consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. “Distantly taxable” goods are generally defined as goods that: • individually have a value of NZ$1,000 or less; • are outside New Zealand at the time of supply; • are supplied by a non-resident; and • are delivered to New Zealand. 9. Suppliers may have the option to also charge GST on their supplies of goods valued over NZ$1,000 to consumers in New Zealand. 10. The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) will continue to collect GST, as well as other duties and cost recovery charges, on consignments with a total value in excess of NZ$1,000. Distantly taxable goods supplied to GST-registered businesses 11. Non-resident suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. 12. A rule requires non-resident suppliers to presume that a New Zealand customer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number or New Zealand Business Number, or otherwise notified the supplier of their status as a GST-registered business. 13. The Commissio ner can also prescribe or agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. The Commissioner will consider the following matters as an indication that the goods are generally only supplied to registered businesses: • The nature of the supply (for example, a product that would only ever be purchased by a business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity). • The value of the supply (for example, the supply is of a value that would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered person in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity, such as a supply of a very large quantity of low-value goods). • The terms and condit ions related to the provision of the goods (for example, whether the supply is of goods that may be licensed for use by a GST-registered person). 14. When a GST-registered recipient is inadvertently charged GST, they will have to seek a refund from the non-resident supplier. The non-resident supplier may make an adjustment in their GST return when it is apparent that a mistake has been made. Alternatively, if the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less, a non- 1 Goods that are already exempt (such as supplies of fine metal) retain their current treatment under the new rules. 9 resident supplier will have the option to provide a tax invoice to the purchaser to allow them to claim a deduction, rather than refunding the GST charged and making an adjustment in their GST return. Special rules for certain businesses Electronic marketplaces 15. When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an online marketplace may be required to register and return GST on supplies of distantly taxable goods made through the marketplace, instead of the underlying supplier. 16. The rules require the operator of an “electronic marketplace”, rather than the non- resident underlying supplier, to register and return GST. An “electronic marketplace” is a marketplace operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of remote services by electronic means, or a supply of distantly taxable goods, through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). 17. Operators of “non-electronic marketplaces” may also register and return GST on behalf of their underlying suppliers, but this requires an agreement with the Commissioner. Redeliverers 18. In some situations, a “redeliverer” may be used to deliver or assist in the delivery of goods to New Zealand, as opposed to the merchant who sold the goods or an operator of a marketplace. When this occurs, the redeliverer may be required to register and return GST on the goods. 19. A redeliverer is required to return GST when, under an arrangement with the recipient, the redeliverer does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. New Zealand agents 20. An amendment to an existing agency rule provides agents acting for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods the ability to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply. Preventing double taxation 21. Special rules apply to prevent double taxation from arising on distantly taxable goods imported into New Zealand with a combined value in excess of NZ$1,000. Since Customs will collect GST and other duties on consignments valued above NZ$1,000, 10 suppliers are required to take reasonable steps to ensure tax information is included on relevant import documents in order for Customs to identify these goods at the border. The following informat ion should be included on import documents: • The name and registration number of the supplier. • Which particular goods in the consignment GST has already been collected on. • Which particular goods in the consignment GST has not been collected on. 22. Suppliers would also need to provide a receipt to consumers if they have charged the consumer GST on some or all of the goods in the transaction. 2 This receipt can then be used as evidence to Customs that GST has already been charged on the goods. The information required to be included on the receipt consists of: • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the date of the supply; • the date of issue of the receipt (if different from the date of the supply); • a description of the goods supplied; • the consideration for the supply and the amount of GST included; • which goods GST has been charged on; and • information indicating the goods for which the amount of GST charged is zero. 23. A special non-double taxation rule also allows a deduction against the supplier’s liability for New Zealand GST to the extent that the same supply is subject to consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Vouchers 24. The GST rules for vouchers have been amended to clarify that the seller of a face value voucher 3 may treat GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher, if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods. 25. A further amendment clarifies that if GST is payable on the redemption of a voucher, the person redeeming the voucher for goods and services is liable for GST. Converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars 26. Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will be able to choose from a range of exchange rates when converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars. 2 The requirement to provide a receipt applies even if the combined value of the goods supplied in the transaction is below NZ$1,000. One reason for this is that goods sold in a foreign currency could have a value of NZ$1,000 or less at the time of supply (so the supplier charges GST) and a value above NZ$1,000 at the time the goods are imported, due to exchange rate movements. 3 A face value voucher entitles the holder to use the voucher to purchase goods and services up to a set monetary value. 11 Currency conversion to determine whether GST applies to a supply of goods 27. For the purpose of determining whether goods are individually valued at or below NZ$1,000 (and, therefore, whether GST should be returned), a supplier may use any one of the following exchange rates: • the rate published by Customs; • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate, or a reference rate published by another central bank; • an exchange rate provided by a foreign exchange organisation or foreign exchange data vendor. 28. Other than the requirement that a supplier’s chosen exchange rate be used consistently (discussed later at \[231\]), there are no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate (sell NZD, buy NZD, or midpoint rate) that suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means that suppliers can choose a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate when converting foreign currency amounts to establish whether GST applies (as well as for the purpose of calculating the amount of GST required to be returned in New Zealand dollars). Currency conversion when determining the amount of GST payable 29. When converting to New Zealand dollars for determining the amount of GST required to be returned, the supplier can use the conversion rate at: • the time of supply; • the end of each taxable period; • the time of filing the return (or at the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); or • another time as agreed with the Commissioner. 30. Once the supplier chooses a method other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of distantly taxable goods returns the GST) 31. To ensure that supplies of distantly taxable goods acquired by GST-registered businesses for a purpose other than making taxable supplies are taxed, the reverse charge has been extended. The reverse charge requires the GST-registered business to return the GST if the percentage intended or actual taxable use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. Administration of the non-resident registration system Registration 32. The new rules will require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on distantly taxable goods supplied to consumers if these supplies exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. Some New Zealand-resident businesses 12 will also be required to return GST on distantly taxable goods that they are deemed to supply. 33. Non-resident suppliers are able to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. 34. Non-resident suppliers may apply to be registered from 1 September 2019 (an application form will be available on that date) with the registration coming into force on 1 December 2019. The registration form will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz . (search keywords: non-resident GST). The application form will ask for the applicant’s name, contact details, country of residence (including any existing tax identification numbers), a description of the business activity and website address. 35. If a supplier (whether resident or non-resident) is already registered for GST because they make taxable supplies under existing GST rules, they do not need to register separately for any distantly taxable goods they supply. Instead, these suppliers should continue to file their usual GST returns and include their supplies of distantly taxable goods. Filing GST returns Simplified “pay only” registration 36. Applicants who indicate on the registration form that they will only return GST and not claim expenses will file a simplified “pay only” GST return. The simplified return would only include fields relevant to returning GST, such as the amount of supplies to New Zealand customers and the amount of GST required to be returned. 37. For the period from 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2020, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that become liable to be registered between 1 December and 31 December 2019 will have a taxable period of four months. After this transit ional period, these suppliers will have mandatory quarterly taxable periods beginning on 1 April 2020. 38. A GST return must be provided setting out the tax payable for the taxable period by the 28th of the month following the end of the taxable period. 4 The end of each taxable period is the last day of the month at the end of the taxable period. The quarterly taxable periods end on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December. Full registration 39. Applicants who indicate that they intend to return GST and claim GST may be asked to provide further information about their business during the registration process to better confirm their ident it y. These applicants will be required to file a full GST return. 40. Both types of GST return will be able to be filed online using Inland Revenue’s myIR. For GST payments, myIR displays payment options available to registrants, and 4 The exceptions to this being when the month following the end of the taxable period is December (in which case the filing and payment due date is 15 January) or April (filing and payment due date of 7 May). 13 provides links and instructions on how to make payments. Information on how to file returns online and make payments will be available to non-resident suppliers when they apply to register for New Zealand GST. Methods for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies 41. As discussed above at \[15\] to \[19\], in certain circumstances the special rules applying to electronic marketplaces and redeliverers would, for GST purposes, treat these businesses as suppliers of distantly taxable goods. This means electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers will need to rely on information provided by merchants or by customers to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. 42. The new legislation includes some default rules (based on objective proxies) that electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers can use to determine how much GST they are required to return on distantly taxable goods. The new rules also provide the Commissioner with discretion to prescribe or agree to alternative methods for electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers to determine if they are treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods and the amount of GST payable. 43. This is intended to minimise compliance costs in situations where it may not be possible to precisely determine the GST treatment of a supply due to insufficient commercially available information. Consumers and underlying suppliers providing false or misleading information 44. The Commissioner will have the discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST if that person provides false or misleading information about themselves resulting in an underpayment of GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 45. Existing “knowledge offences” rules may also apply when a person (being a consumer, or an underlying supplier selling goods through a marketplace) deliberately supplies incorrect information to a supplier by misrepresenting themselves as a GST-registered business or as a resident of another country. This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first- time offence, or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. Optional rules aimed at reducing costs for suppliers Claiming GST deductions for New Zealand expenses 46. An amendment to a pre-existing deduction rule will allow non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and/or remote services to claim GST deductions for New Zealand expenses. Deductions are available regardless of whether the relevant business inputs are used for (or available for use in) making supplies to consumers in New Zealand. This is only available to those suppliers that have registered under the standard registration system as a “pay and claim” registrant. 14 Option to charge GST on high-value goods 47. Suppliers of distantly taxable goods may elect to charge GST on goods valued above NZ$1,000 (“high-value goods”) if those goods are supplied to consumers in New Zealand. This option is available if at least 75 percent of the total value of goods that they supply to customers in New Zealand in the 12-month period starting on the date the election is intended to be effective for are individually valued at NZ$1,000 or less. 48. Alternatively, a supplier will be able to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the Commissioner considers that allowing the supplier to do so will not result in a risk to the integrity of the tax system. Option to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses 49. If certain conditions are met, a non-resident supplier is able to choose to charge GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a GST-registered business and proactively issue the recipient with a tax invoice. This applies when: • the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less; and • the supplier reasonably expects that in the 12 months after the supply is made, more than 50 percent of their supplies to customers in New Zealand will be to persons that are not registered for GST. 50. If a non-resident supplier opts to charge GST on a supply to a GST-registered business they are able to issue a single document that qualifies both as a full tax invoice and as a receipt that the recipient may provide to Customs to prevent any double taxation. Transitional rule for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 51. A transitional provision is provided in the new rules for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 2019 and when the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement. 52. The transitional provision allows suppliers to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successive supplies, and therefore, payments made after 1 December 2019 are not subject to GST. This transitional rule only applies for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. Background 53. In principle, GST should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand, as this ensures that the system is fair, efficient and simple. Under the current rules, however, GST is not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of NZ$60 of duty owing (this typically equates to a parcel with a value of NZ$400 if GST is the only applicable duty). 54. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. 15 55. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. Many are concerned that the current tax settings place New Zealand suppliers of low-value goods at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated to be around NZ$130 million in 2017–18). 56. The new rules are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and from a GST perspective create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low-value goods. The effect will be to reduce the extent to which differences in GST treatment distort consumers’ purchasing decisions. 57. On 1 July 2018 Australia introduced rules requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on their supplies of low-value imported goods to Australian consumers. The amendments broadly follow Australia’s recently introduced rules. Application date 58. The new GST rules come into force on 1 December 2019. Detailed analysis Key terms 59. There are a number of terms that have a specific meaning in respect of these new rules. 60. Supplier – The term “supplier” is used throughout this special report to refer to the person who is the supplier of the goods for GST purposes (that is, required to return and pay GST on the supply to Inland Revenue). The supplier will be the merchant unless another person (such as an electronic marketplace operator, redeliverer or agent) is treated as the supplier of the goods under a specific provision. 61. Merchant – The term “merchant” is used in this special report to refer to the person who actually supplies the goods. A merchant may sell independently – for example, via their own website or by mail order – or they may sell their goods on a marketplace. 62. Marketplace – Refers to a third-party medium that allows consumers and merchants to interact to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods or services. The definitions of “marketplace” and “electronic marketplace” are discussed at \[135\]. 63. Redeliverer – Refers to a person who delivers goods (or arranges or assists delivery) to New Zealand under an arrangement with the recipient of the goods, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; 16 • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; or • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. 64. Consignment – The term “consignment” generally means a single package or parcel of imported goods. However, in some instances, Customs will treat two or more packages arriving on the same day, from the same consignor (supplier) and addressed to the same consignee (importer or recipient) as one consignment. 65. De minimis – Refers to the threshold below which Customs will not collect GST and other duty on a consignment of imported goods. From 1 December 2019, imported consignments valued at NZ$1,000 or less will not have GST and other duty collected at the border (unless a specific exception to the de minimis applies, such as for alcohol and tobacco). 66. Customs value – Refers to the value of imported goods as determined under Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. This is the valuation that Customs uses when determining whether a consignment of imported goods is above the de minimis, and therefore whether Customs collects duty on the goods. 67. Estimated customs value – Refers to the value of an item of goods as determined in accordance with new section 10B of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, discussed later at \[84\]. This valuation (which approximates the customs value of an individual item of goods) is used for the purposes of determining whether a given item of goods is valued at NZ$1,000 or less, and therefore whether GST is required to be charged on the supply of the item. 68. Value of supply – Refers to the (GST-exclusive) value of a supply of goods and services. This is the valuation used for the purpose of calculating the amount of GST, and is determined by reference to the amount of consideration for the supply of goods and services (generally the total price or amount paid by the recipient of the supply of goods and services). Scope of the new GST rules (Sections 2, 4B, 8(3)(ab), 10(7E), 10B, 51(1B) and 77(5)) Place of supply rules 69. The GST Act imposes GST on goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The Act adopts a broad set of rules to determine whether a good or service is considered to be supplied in New Zealand in the first instance. The place of supply rules are accompanied by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt rather than taxed at the normal 15% rate. 70. If a non-resident person supplies goods, the starting point is that the supply will be treated as having been made outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST. However, under section 8(3)(a), goods are treated as having been supplied in New Zealand if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply. Section 8(4) provides that if a supply is made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity, the goods are considered to be supplied outside New Zealand, and therefore are not subject to GST, unless the parties agree that GST will apply. 17 Distantly taxable goods supplied by non-residents 71. New section 8(3)(ab) has been inserted into the place of supply rules, which treats supplies of “distantly taxable goods” (as defined) supplied by a non-resident to a person providing a delivery address in New Zealand as a supply made in New Zealand, and therefore subject to GST. 72. Like section 8(4), new section 8(4E) provides that if distantly taxable goods are supplied to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity, the goods are treated as having been supplied outside New Zealand. The goods are therefore not subject to GST, unless the non-resident supplier chooses to treat the goods as being supplied in New Zealand. More information on this option is provided later in this special report at \[311\] to \[318\]. Distantly taxable goods supplied by New Zealand residents 73. Goods treated as having been supplied by a New Zealand-resident person, such as an electronic marketplace operator, redeliverer or agent domiciled in New Zealand, would be treated as supplied in New Zealand by existing section 8(2). This treatment would apply even if the goods are supplied to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on its taxable activity. 74. A comprehensive explanation of the special rules applying to electronic marketplaces, redeliverers and New Zealand-resident agents is provided later, with each section beginning at \[134\], \[168\] and \[183\], respectively. Exempt and zero-rated supplies 75. Supplies of goods that are already exempt fro m GST (such as supplies of fine metal), or zero-rated under a specific rule, would retain that treatment under the new rules. 18 Figure 1: Summary of the new place of supply rules for non-resident suppliers of goods Are the goods distantly taxable goods?

Under the GST Act, “goods” are defined as all kinds of real or personal property; but do not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. 77. New section 4B sets out that “distantly taxable goods” would generally be defined as goods that: • are supplied by a non-resident; • are outside New Zealand at the time of supply; • are delivered to a place in New Zealand by the supplier, or the supplier arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • are low-value goods (that is, individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less). 78. As discussed in later sections of this special report, the definition of distantly taxable goods also includes goods treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as being supplied by a marketplace operator or redeliverer, regardless of the residency of the marketplace operator or redeliverer. 79. Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products that are exempted from regulations made under section 406(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 2018 are not distantly taxable goods. At present, Customs collects GST and other duty including excise- equivalent taxes on these goods. This will not change. Goods outside New Zealand at the time of supply 80. A non-resident merchant supplying low-value goods that are delivered to an address in New Zealand will be considered to have made a supply of distantly taxable goods if the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply. 81. The time of supply for distantly taxable goods will be determined by the general rule in section 9(1), which sets out that the time of supply is the earlier of any payment being received by the supplier or an invoice being issued by the supplier. In the case of goods purchased online by consumers, this will generally be the same as the time the consumer purchases the goods. 82. If eit her a redeliverer or an operator of a marketplace is treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as the supplier of the goods, the location of the goods at the time of supply will not be relevant for determining if the goods are distantly taxable goods. Any goods that are treated by one of those sections as having been supplied by a marketplace operator or a redeliverer will be distantly taxable goods, regardless of where the goods are located at the time of supply. 5 5 While not necessarily likely, it is possible that the time of supply for imported goods could be after the goods are already in New Zealand. As discussed later, goods that are not imported but are actually sourced from within New Zealand are distantly taxable goods if they are supplied through a marketplace by a non-resident merchant and the marketplace operator is treated by section 60C or 60D as the supplier. 20 Goods individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less 83. In order for an “item of goods” to be distantly taxable, it must have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. Suppliers will be required to determine a reasonable estimate of the item’s customs value using information available to them at the time of supply (new section 10B(3)). 84. For the sole purpose of determining whether an item is an item of distantly taxable goods (and, therefore, whether GST is charged on the supply of the item), section 10B(2) provides that the value of an item will be the amount of consideration, 6 less any amounts included in the consideration for: • GST charged on the supply of the item under section 8; • any duty payable by the supplier under the Customs and Excise Act 2018; 7 and • the cost of transport and insurance of the item between leaving its country of export and being delivered in New Zealand. Any amounts charged for transport and insurance of the item which relate to domestic transport and insurance within the country of export should not be subtracted from the amount of consideration. Suppliers may make a reasonable estimate of the amount relating to transport and insurance within the country of export for this purpose. 85. This is broadly consistent with the valuation that Customs will use (the “customs value”) when determining if a consignment of imported goods is above or below the NZ$1,000 de minimis. However, as explained below at \[94\] to \[96\], the approximation of the customs value outlined above is different to the valuation that is used for calculating the amount of GST required to be returned on distantly taxable goods. 86. Note that “an item of goods” may be a single good or multiple goods, depending on how the “item” is presented for sale. For example, an item o f goods could be one pair of socks or a pack of ten pairs of socks. 6 “Consideration” is a term commonly used in contract law to refer to what a party to a contract agrees to provide under the contract. In the case of a supply of goods and services by a business to a consumer, the consideration for the supply will typically be a sum of money that the consumer pays to the supplier in order to receive the goods and services. 7 A merchant may include an amount in the price of an item to cover any duty payable under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 if it is selling goods on a delivered-duty-paid basis (that is, will pay the customs duties to Customs on behalf of the recipient). 21 Example 1 – high value item shipped in two different boxes for assembly by the recipient Kathryn, a consumer in New Zealand, buys a bicycle from a merchant in China for NZ$1,200 (excluding GST and delivery). For ease of packaging and handling and to minimise the risk of damage in transit, the bicycle parts are shipped to Kathryn in two separate boxes to be assembled when Kathryn receives the packages. It is clear from the advertisement on the Chinese merchant’s website that the nature of what is being supplied is a single item of goods (being an unassembled bicycle) and not multiple items. On this basis, the Chinese merchant does not charge Kathryn GST on the supply of the bicycle, as the bicycle is not considered distantly taxable (the estimated customs value of the bicycle is NZ$1,200, exceeding the de minimis of NZ$1,000.) The two boxes arrive in New Zealand on the same flight and are treated by Customs as a single consignment. Assuming that the customs value of the consignment is above NZ$1,000 at the time of importation, Customs will charge Kathryn GST, along with the Import Entry Transaction Fee and Biosecurity System Entry Levy and any other duties. Example 2 – learn to play electric guitar starter pack Jared decides that he wants to learn to play guitar and orders a ‘learn to play electric guitar starter pack’ from an online music retailer based in Japan for NZ$1,500 (excluding GST and delivery). The starter pack has everything that Jared needs to get started, including a lead, strap, tuner, guitar bag, amplifier, picks, whammy bar and an instructional DVD. It is clear from the advertisement on the Japanese merchant’s website that what is being offered for sale is a package for a single price of NZ$1,500. Although Jared provides a delivery address in New Zealand at the online checkout, he is not charged GST because the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply and the goods are not distantly taxable goods (as the estimated customs value of the item, being the starter pack, is NZ$1,500). 87. Under the rules for electronic marketplaces and “approved” marketplaces, some distantly taxable goods may not actually be imported into New Zealand by the recipient, but may instead be sourced from within New Zealand. 8 This would occur when a non-resident uses an electronic marketplace to sell low-value goods that are already in New Zealand to a customer providing a New Zealand delivery address. In this situation, the value of an item of goods would be the amount of consideration the item is sold for, less any amounts included in the consideration for: • GST charged on the supply of the item under section 8; and • the cost of transport and insurance of the item. 9 Currency conversion to determine the estimated customs value 88. To determine whether an item has an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, currency conversion to New Zealand dollars may be required if the item is sold in a 8 This is because whether the marketplace operator is treated as the supplier is based solely on the residency status of the merchant. This is to avoid further compliance costs for marketplace operators in determining whether the goods are already in New Zealand or will be shipped from outside New Zealand. 9 There will be no customs duty payable as the goods are sourced from within New Zealand, rather than being imported. 22 currency other than New Zealand dollars. 10 Currency conversion for this purpose will only be necessary if: • it is unclear whether an item of goods that is sold in another currency has an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000; and • the supplier has not elected to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods (discussed later at \[293\]). 89. Under new section 77(5), a supplier may convert foreign currency amounts into New Zealand dollars using either: • the spot exchange rate for the foreign currency applying at the time of supply; or • a currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 90. The currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner is set out later in this special report at \[227\] to \[232\]. Which goods would be included in a supply of distantly taxable goods? 91. In some cases, a single transaction will involve one or more items that each have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less and, at the same time, one or more other items that each have an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000. In this situation, section 4B(2) splits the transaction into two separate supplies: • a supply of distantly taxable goods, consisting of all the goods that are low-value goods (that is, individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less); and • a second supply consisting of the remaining goods supplied in the transaction. 92. The supplier can however elect to treat its supplies of high-value goods as distantly taxable, in which case there will generally be a single supply of distantly taxable goods. In this situation, section 4B(2) will only split the supply into two separate supplies if some of the goods are not distantly taxable goods because they are alcoholic beverages, tobacco or tobacco products (or, if a non-resident merchant is the supplier for GST purposes, because some of the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply). 93. Further explanation of the special rules allowing suppliers to treat their supplies of high-value goods to consumers as distantly taxable goods is provided in a later section of this special report at \[293\] to \[310\]. 10 As the estimated customs value is worked out by using a reasonable estimate at the time of supply, the date or time of supply will be the date or time of the currency conversion (if required). 23 Example 3 – separate supplies of distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods bought in the same transaction Brenda decides to treat herself by buying a new television and home entertainment system. She orders a 50” flat screen television for NZ$800 (excluding GST and delivery), as well as a stereo/home entertainment system for NZ$1,100 from the catalogue of an Australian-based mail order company. The Australian merchant charges Brenda GST on the television but not on the stereo/home entertainment system. This is because the estimated customs value of the television is less than NZ$1,000 (NZ$800) – meaning that the supply of the television is a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods. However, the estimated customs value of the stereo/home entertainment system is above NZ$1,000 (NZ$1,100) and, therefore, the stereo/home entertainment system is not supplied as a taxable supply because the item is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is not an item of distantly taxable goods. Calculating GST on distantly taxable goods 94. To calculate the amount of GST on distantly taxable goods, suppliers need to determine the value of the supply. It should be noted that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods is not the same as the estimated customs value of distantly taxable goods (as the estimated customs value is only used for the purpose of determining whether a given item is distantly taxable). 95. Instead, the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods is determined by the amount of consideration for the supply (section 10(2)), 11 which – unlike the estimated customs value – will typically include amounts paid by the recipient for related services such as freight and insurance. 96. The amount of GST required to be returned on a supply of distantly taxable goods is 15% of the value of the supply. For goods that are priced inclusive of GST, the amount of GST that should be returned will be equal to the amount of consideration for the supply multiplied by 3 ÷ 23. An example of how this applies is provided in example 4. Treatment of amounts paid by the recipient for delivery and other related services 97. Under ordinary GST principles, the amount of consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods will typically include amounts paid by the recipient for services relating to the goods, such as delivery and insurance. This is because these services are generally either: • ancillary or integral to the supply of the goods (such as in the case of freight and insurance); or • merely incidental to the goods, or are a means of better enjoying the goods. 11 Section 10(2)(a) provides that, to the extent that the consideration for a supply of goods and services is in money, the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the amount of consideration in money. To the extent that the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods is not in money, section 10(2)(b) provides that the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the open market value of the non- monetary consideration. 24 98. Where this is the case, the services will typically form part of the supply of distantly taxable goods, even if a separate fee is charged for the services. This applies even if the services would be zero-rated if they were supplied separately – for example, international transportation of goods (including ancillary activities such as handling) and insurance associated with the international transportation are zero-rated. 12 99. However, in limited situations, it is possible that there may be a separate zero-rated supply if the recipient contracts separately for the supply of these services. 100. To avoid doubt and ensure consistent treatment, new section 10(7E) provides that the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods includes the amount of consideration for a supply of related services to the recipient of the distantly taxable goods if: • the consideration for the related services is determined by reference to the items included in the supply of distantly taxable goods; 13 • the supply of related services is made, arranged or facilitated by the supplier of the distantly taxable goods (or by the underlying supplier, if the supplier for GST purposes is a marketplace operator); • the supply of related services is directly in connection with the distantly taxable goods or is of insurance of the goods; 14 • the supply of related services would be zero-rated in the absence of this rule; and • the supply of related services and the supply of distantly taxable goods do not form a single supply. 101. This means that amounts paid by the recipient for a separate zero-rated supply (such as international transportation that is contractually supplied to the recipient by a third party) may still be included as part of the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods that is subject to GST at the rate of 15%. Example 4 – calculating amount of output tax based on GST-inclusive price Wendy purchases a fascinator from Wild Hats, an e-commerce business based in Australia that ships novelty party hats from its warehouse in Melbourne. Wild Hats is registered for GST in New Zealand. The price of the fascinator is NZ$23 including GST if any. To get the hat to her address in New Zealand, Wendy also pays a shipping fee of NZ$11.50 (also inclusive of GST). Therefore, the total amount paid by Wendy including GST is NZ$34.50. The amount of GST returned on the supply by Wild Hats is NZ$4.50 (NZ$34.50 × 3/23 = NZ$4.50). This includes the NZ$1.50 of GST included in the shipping fee. 12 For more information on when multiple goods and services supplied in a single transaction will form a single supply or multiple supplies, see the Interpretation Statement, IS 18/04 Goods and Services Tax – Single supply or multiple supplies, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/2/2/229901d1-77a8-410e-a005- 933a9904455e/is1804.pdf. 13 For example, this means that a subscription where a consumer is paying for the transport of many supplies of goods over a period of time is excluded from the scope of the rule. 14 The “directly in connection with” wording is intended to apply broadly to services that have a direct physical intervention with the goods, including (but not limited to) transportation and handling of the goods. For example, services such as gift-wrapping would meet the “directly in connection with” test. 25 Example 5 – calculating amount of output tax based on GST-exclusive price Chris buys a new suit from a non-resident merchant based in Hong Kong for NZ$900 plus GST if any. The merchant charges Chris an additional NZ$50 plus GST if any for delivery to New Zealand. The merchant charges Chris NZ$142.50 of GST (NZ$950 × 15% = NZ$142.50). The full amount paid by Chris is therefore NZ$1,092.50 (NZ$950 + NZ$142.50 in GST). Example 6 – application of section 10(7E) to separate zero-rated supply of international transport Jan, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a fishing rod from an American merchant on the A Co. marketplace for NZ$20 (excluding GST). The merchant does not provide shipping to addresses outside the United States. However, to make goods on its marketplace available to a global market, A Co. allows customers outside the United States to purchase shipping to the destination country from a freight forwarder. Using the A Co. marketplace, Jan purchases shipping of the fishing rod to her home in New Zealand for NZ$10 excluding GST. Under the rules applying to electronic marketplaces, A Co. is treated as making the supply of the fishing rod to Jan, meaning that A Co. is responsible for GST on the supply of the fishing rod. However, neither A Co. nor the American merchant supply the shipping to Jan, as the contract for the supply is between the freight forwarder and Jan. This means that the supply of shipping is separate to the supply of the fishing rod. Consequently, the supply of shipping is zero-rated under the rules applying to international transportation. However, section 10(7E) treats the shipping fee as part of the consideration for a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods because: • the shipping fee is determined by reference to the supply of the fishing rod to Jan; • the shipping was purchased by Jan through the A Co. marketplace, which is sufficient to meet the test that either A Co. or the American merchant facilitated the supply of the shipping; • the shipping is supplied directly in connection with distantly taxable goods, as it involves the physical handling and transport of the fishing rod; • in the absence of section 10(7E), the shipping would be zero-rated as a supply of international transportation services; and • the supply of shipping and the supply of distantly taxable goods do not form a single supply (as mentioned above, the supply of shipping is a separate supply to the supply of the fishing rod). This means that A Co. is required to return GST of NZ$4.50, made up of NZ$3 in GST on the fishing rod (NZ$20 × 15% = NZ$3) and NZ$1.50 in GST on the shipping (NZ$10 × 15% = NZ$1.50). Apportionment of GST on freight and insurance charges 102. In some situations, a consumer may purchase goods that are distantly taxable goods as well as goods that are not distantly taxable goods in a single transaction. In this situation, the consumer may be charged a single delivery fee for the transportation of all the goods. Where this is the case, apportionment of GST on the amount paid for transportation will usually be required. 26 103. The supplier may use any fair and reasonable method of apportioning GST on delivery charges. For example, apportionment based on the weight of the distantly taxable goods relative to the weight of other goods would be a fair and reasonable apportionment method, as would apportionment based on the value of the goods. If feasible, it would be in the supplier’s interest to use the same method for apportioning GST on delivery charges at the point of sale as that used to apportion delivery charges for customs purposes. 104. However, apportionment of GST on a single delivery charge relating to both distantly taxable goods and other goods will not be required if: • the delivery services are a separate zero-rated supply; and • section 10(7E) does not apply to treat the amount of consideration relating to delivery services as part of the consideration for the supply of distantly taxable goods (so GST will not apply at all to the amount paid for delivery). Example 7 – apportionment of delivery fee relating to distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods based on value Scott purchases a gold watch for NZ$1,100 along with two shirts at NZ$40 each (all priced excluding GST) from a merchant in Germany for delivery to his address in New Zealand. The shirts are both distantly taxable goods – each of these items has an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less – so the German merchant (who is registered for GST in New Zealand) is required to return GST on each of these items. However, the watch is not distantly taxable, as it has an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000 (NZ$1,100), so the German merchant is not required to return GST on the watch. The merchant charges Scott an NZ$30 fee for the transportation of all the goods purchased and ships the goods to Scott in a single package. The merchant apportions the GST on the transportation fee based on the value of the respective items in the package. The apportionment ratio used by the merchant is 6.78% ((40 + 40) ÷ (40 + 40 + 1,100) = 0.06779). The merchant charges Scott NZ$12.31 in GST, comprising NZ$12 in GST on the distantly taxable goods ((NZ$40 + NZ$40) × 15% = NZ$12) and NZ$0.31 in GST on the transportation fee (NZ$30 × 6.78% × 15% = NZ$0.31). Example 8 – apportionment of delivery fee relating to distantly taxable and non-distantly taxable goods based on weight Aroha purchases a number of items (all priced excluding GST) from a merchant in the United States (US) for delivery to her address in New Zealand: • two shirts at NZ$50 each; • a ball dress at NZ$300; and • a wedding dress at NZ$1,200. The shirts and ball dress are all distantly taxable goods, so the US merchant (who is registered for GST in New Zealand) is required to return GST on each of these items. However, the wedding dress is not, so the US merchant is not required to return GST on the wedding dress. 27 The US merchant charges Aroha an NZ$80 fee for the transportation of all the goods purchased and ships the goods to Aroha in a single package. The US merchant apportions the GST on the transportation fee based on the weight of the respective items in the package. The combined weight of the distantly taxable goods is 2kg, and the wedding dress also weighs 2kg (half the weight of the package). The US merchant charges Aroha NZ$66 of GST, comprising NZ$60 in GST on the distantly taxable goods ((NZ$50 + NZ$50 + NZ$300) × 15% = NZ$60) and NZ$6 in GST on the transportation fee (NZ$80 ÷ 2 × 15% = NZ$6). Special valuation rule for supplies treated as made by redeliverers 105. New section 10(7C) contains a special rule for determining the amount of output tax (GST payable) on a supply of distantly taxable goods treated by section 60E as being made by a redeliverer. The special rule is explained later in this special report at \[178\]. Discounts, returns and refunds 106. Section 25(1) provides a list of situations where a GST-registered supplier may return too much or too little GST as a result of either a mistake, subsequent alteration to, or cancellation of the supply. This list includes the following events: • The supply of goods and services has been cancelled. • The nature of the supply of goods and services had been fundamentally varied or altered. • The previously agreed consideration for the supply of goods and services has been altered, for instance through the offer of a discount. • The goods and services or part of the goods and services have been returned to the supplier. 107. In the situation where a merchant has returned too much or too little GST as the result of an event referred to in section 25(1) (such as the events listed above), section 25(2) provides that the merchant may make an adjustment in its GST return when it is apparent that too much or too little output tax has been returned. Example 9 – goods returned to merchant Aroha from the previous example decides that the ball dress she bought is too small. The US merchant agrees to provide Aroha with a full refund of the price of the dress if Aroha returns it. The US merchant receives the returned dress and refunds the GST-inclusive amount paid for the dress of NZ$345 (NZ$300 + NZ$45 in GST). By the time that the US merchant received the returned dress, they had already filed their GST return for the taxable period in which the supply to Aroha was made. The US merchant is entitled to make a reduction of NZ$45 in their output tax in the GST return for the current taxable period. 108. A special valuation rule applies in the specific situation where an operator of a marketplace (who is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods or remote services by section 60C or 60D) provides a discount to the recipient of the supply. This rule is explained later at \[162\]. 28 GST registration threshold 109. As a result of the changes to the place of supply rules, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will be required to register for GST if the total value of supplies in New Zealand exceeds NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. This is equivalent to the existing registration threshold for resident suppliers, as well as non-resident suppliers of remote services. 110. As these suppliers will be subject to the rules contained in section 51, non-resident suppliers will be required to register if: • the total value of their supplies in New Zealand in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • the total value of their supplies in New Zealand in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. 111. The total value of supplies in New Zealand by a non-resident includes the following: • the total value of supplies of distantly taxable goods 15 to consumers, including amounts charged for services such as delivery and insurance; • the total value of supplies to consumers of goods that are located in New Zealand at the time of supply (not including any distantly taxable goods); • the total value of supplies to consumers of services physically performed in New Zealand; and • the total value of remote services supplied to consumers (not including any services physically performed in New Zealand). 112. As goods and services supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand GST-registered business are generally treated as not being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST), these supplies will not count towards the registration threshold. 113. If a non-resident makes supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers and their total supplies in New Zealand fall below the NZ$60,000 threshold, they will be able to voluntarily register for GST. 15 “Distantly taxable goods” in this specific context being just those items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 29 Example 10 – non-resident supplier below the registration threshold Jersey Co., a non-resident company based in the United States, sells clothing to customers across the world. Jersey Co. also makes and supplies businesses with staff uniforms. Each year, Jersey Co. makes supplies valued at NZ$50,000 to New Zealand customers who are not GST-registered. It makes supplies valued at NZ$20,000 to New Zealand GST-registered customers. Jersey Co. is not required to register and return GST on any of its supplies in New Zealand, as it has not exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. 114. Section 51(1B) allows non-resident suppliers to use a “fair and reasonable” method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. This includes converting amounts to New Zealand currency as at the time of supply, using the current exchange rate at the time of testing the threshold, or using an average exchange rate over the period. Any o f these methods would be regarded as fair and reasonable as long as they were used on a consistent basis. Example 11 – non-resident supplier above registration threshold Tool Warehouse, a non-resident company, supplies power tools to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Over the past two years, Tool Warehouse has supplied NZ$10,000 of power tools that each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, each month, to New Zealand individual consumers and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Tool Warehouse will be expected to register for New Zealand GST from 1 December 2019 as it is reasonably expected that their supplies in New Zealand to individual consumers will exceed NZ$60,000 in the 12 months following 1 December 2019 (the date the new rules apply from). Effect of the new legislation on suppliers’ residency and income tax obligations 115. Although these amendments treat certain goods supplied by non-residents as “supplied in New Zealand”, there is no intention that this will affect whether a supplier is a resident of New Zealand for GST or income tax purposes, or whether a supplier has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. 116. The GST Act largely adopts the Income Tax Act 2007’s definit io n of “resident”. Solely for GST purposes, a person is also considered to be a resident of New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, and has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. The amendments do not affect the extent to which a person carries on an activity in New Zealand, despite making certain supplies taxable for GST purposes. 117. Double tax agreements (DTAs) primarily deal with whether a resident of one country is subject to income tax on income derived in another country. The concept of “permanent establishment” is used in DTAs between New Zealand and other countries. Under DTAs, a company that does not have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand will have no New Zealand income tax. The fact that a supplier is registered for New Zealand GST under the new rules should not affect whether or not they have 30 a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand for DTA purposes, or the application of the definition of resident used for GST purposes. Distantly taxable goods supplied to GST-registered businesses (Sections 8(4E), 8BB, 20(4C), (4D), 24 and 25(1)(aab) to (abb)) 118. New section 8(4E) applies to supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents to GST-registered businesses and treats these as being made outside New Zealand (not subject to GST). However, as discussed later at \[311\] to \[318\], a limited exception will in certain circumstances allow a non-resident supplier to treat these supplies as being made in New Zealand (subject to GST). Example 12 – business-to-business exclusion Consider Tool Warehouse in the previous example. If the New Zealand businesses that Tool Warehouse sells power tools to are not registered for GST, the power tools that each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less will be subject to GST under section 8(3)(ab), as these power tools are distantly taxable goods that are supplied to a person providing a delivery address in New Zealand who is not a GST- registered business. If the New Zealand business customers are registered for GST, then under section 8(4E) the power tools will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand. 119. Section 8BB(1) requires non-resident suppliers to treat distantly taxable goods as being supplied to a consumer who is not GST-registered, unless the recipient notifies the supplier that they are GST-registered or provides their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods should not identify themselves as a GST-registered business, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the goods wholly for non-taxable purposes. 120. It may not be practical for all suppliers to ask for evidence that a customer is GST- registered. Therefore, to provide flexibility, section 8BB(3) allows the Commissioner to prescribe or agree an alternative method to determine whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. Section 8BB(4) outlines the factors that the Commissioner will consider when exercising the discretion: • The nature of the supply (for example, a product that would only ever be purchased by a business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity). • The value of the supply (for example, the supply is of a value that would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered person in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity, such as a supply of a very large quantity of low-value goods). • The terms and condit ions related to the provision of the goods (for example, whether the supply is of goods and services that may be leased or licensed for use by a GST-registered person). 121. Suppliers who have already agreed an alternative method with the Commissioner for supplies of remote services may want to use the same method to determine whether 31 supplies of distantly taxable goods are to GST-registered businesses. In this situation, the supplier should apply to the Commissioner to agree an alternative method for their supplies of distantly taxable goods. This could be as simple as requesting the Commissioner’s approval for them to use their existing method for distantly taxable goods. Example 13 – alternative method of determining supplies are to a GST-registered business Discount Crazy is a non-resident that supplies a wide range of products to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Factors such as the quantity or volume of goods purchased in a single transaction and the overall value of the transaction mean that in some cases it is quite clear that low-value items are being purchased in bulk by a business and not an individual consumer. Businesses that purchase goods in bulk are likely to be GST-registered businesses. Discount Crazy has a large number of customers and it is impractical to ask for evidence to identify their customers as GST-registered. Discount Crazy is able to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use an alternative method for identifying whether their customers are GST- registered persons. Evidence such as the nature of the supplies, licensing terms and other conditions could be used, as well as a sample of their customer base that supports the likelihood that future customers will be GST-registered. GST inadvertently charged to a GST-registered recipient 122. There may be instances when a non-resident supplier inadvertently treats a GST- registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the business GST. In this situat ion, the GST-registered recipient should seek a refund from the non- resident supplier and not claim an input tax deduction for the inadvertently charged GST (see the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C)). There is, however, an exception to the deduction prohibition for supplies valued at NZ$1,000 or less 16 if the supplier has provided the recipient with a full tax invoice (discussed below). 123. Amendments to section 25(1) will allow a supplier to make adjustments to its output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This applies if the supply is treated as made in New Zealand (subject to GST) when in fact it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see section 25(1)(aab)). 124. Note that an adjustment will be required only if the non-resident supplier has already filed a return and has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as a result of the mistake (see existing section 25(1)(e)). If the mistake becomes apparent before the relevant return has been filed, the mistake can be rectified before the return is filed. 125. Since non-resident suppliers are not required to provide a tax invoice under the amendment to section 24(5), they do not have to issue a credit note under section 25(4). However, if a non-resident supplier opts to charge GST on business-to-business supplies and provide a tax invoice under the special rule in new section 8(4F) (discussed later at \[311\] to \[318\]), the supplier will be required to issue a credit note if the amount of consideration for the supply is subsequently reduced or if the supply is cancelled. 16 Meaning that the value of the overall supply is NZ$1,000 or less (as opposed to all of the items in the supply each having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less). 32 Supplies of NZ$1,000 or less 126. An exception to the above rules applies when the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less at the time of supply. In this situation, when the supplier inadvertently charges a GST-registered business GST, the supplier can choose to provide a tax invoice to the GST-registered business. This option is intended to be a compliance cost-saving measure for non-resident suppliers in relation to low-value supplies, when the compliance cost of issuing a refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. Note that if the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice, it must be a full tax invoice, even if the payment for the supply (including GST) is less than NZ$50 (see the amendments to section 24(4)). 127. The tax invoice must be a full invoice as set out in section 24(3), and therefore must contain the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity of the goods and services supplied; • and either: – the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or – where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in relation to the tax. 128. The exception to the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C) (discussed above) allows the GST-registered business purchasing the goods to claim an input tax deduction under the normal deduction provisions to the extent to which the goods are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. 129. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice: • the supplier is not required to make an adjustment to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii)); and • the supplier and recipient are treated as having agreed that the supply is made in New Zealand (and therefore subject to GST) under section 8(4). 17 130. These provisions turn a supply that should not have been taxed into a supply that is taxed at the standard rate of 15%. In this situation, the correct amount of GST is returned by the supplier and therefore an adjustment to the supplier’s GST return, under section 25, is not required. 17 Note that the reference in section 24(5D) to the supplier and recipient being treated as agreeing that section 8(4) will not apply to the supply is incorrect (as section 8(4) would not apply in the first place if the supply is of distantly taxable goods). Officials will seek to correct this error in a future omnibus tax bill. 33 131. Figure 2 summarises how these rules will apply. Figure 2: When GST is incorrectly charged A n on-resident has made a supply of distantly taxab le go o ds to a G ST- registered person and charged GST Is the valu e of th e su pp ly equal to or less than $1,000?

The GST -registered recipient is able to claim an input tax deduction The non -resident supplier w ill n ot m ake an adjustment The supplier must make an adjustment of tax payable in the period when the incorrect treatment becomes apparent No AB Special rules for certain businesses (Sections 2, 10(7C), 10(7D), 11(1)(jb), 11A(1D), 26AA, 60(1A), 60(1C), 60C, 60D and 60E) 132. GST is normally payable by the merchant who sells the goods or services. However, the GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods may be payable by either an operator of a marketplace, the merchant who sold the goods, a “redeliverer” who brings the goods to New Zealand, or a New Zealand resident acting on behalf of a non-resident principal. 34 133. To determine who is liable to return the GST, the new legislation establishes the following hierarchy: • if an operator of a marketplace is liable to return the GST on a supply, the merchant will not be responsible for the GST; 18 • if an operator of a marketplace or the merchant is liable to return the GST on a supply, a redeliverer will not be responsible for the GST; and • if a New Zealand-resident agent makes supplies of distantly taxable goods on behalf of a non-resident principal, the agent will be responsible for the GST instead of the principal if the agent and principal have an agreement to this effect. Marketplaces 134. A marketplace is a medium that allows consumers and merchants to interact to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods or services. When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an electronic marketplace instead of the merchant (referred to as the “underlying supplier”) may be required to register and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace. Under the new rules, electronic marketplaces are required to register and return GST, and non-electronic marketplaces can register subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. 135. The definition of “marketplace” in section 2 means an electronic marketplace or a marketplace approved under section 60D as a supplier of remote services or distantly taxable goods. An electronic marketplace is further defined under section 2 as requiring the following: • The marketplace enables underlying suppliers to supply goods or remote services through the marketplace to customers. • The marketplace is operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace. • Supplies of remote services made through the marketplace must be made by electronic means, but this requirement does not apply to supplies of tangible goods made through the marketplace. 136. Providers that solely process payments are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace” as these providers merely facilitate the exchange of money between the supplier and consumer, rather than the sale and purchase of the goods or services. 137. Section 2 defines an “underlying supplier” as the person that would be the supplier of the goods and services in the absence of the marketplace rules. Given that a marketplace is at the top of the hierarchy of collection entities (with a redeliverer only being responsible for GST if neither a marketplace operator nor the merchant who sold the goods is liable to return the GST), the “underlying supplier” would be the merchant who sold the goods. 18 As discussed later in this special report, a limited exception to this may apply in the situation where an operator of an electronic marketplace is provided with incorrect or misleading information by the merchant, which leads the marketplace operator to conclude that it is not responsible for GST on the supply (or otherwise results in the marketplace operator underpaying GST to Inland Revenue). 35 Electronic marketplace rule 138. Section 60C has been amended so that it treats the operator of an electronic marketplace as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity when: • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the electronic marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • the goods individually have estimated customs values of NZ$1,000 or less. 139. However, the operator of the electronic marketplace will not be considered to have made the supply if they do not control any of the key elements of the supply, and the liability of the underlying supplier is made clear in the documentation relating to the transaction. Accordingly, under section 60C, an operator of an electronic marketplace would not be treated as the supplier if all the following conditions are satisfied: • the electronic marketplace does not authorise the charge to the recipient, or make or authorise the delivery of the supply, or directly or indirectly set any of the terms and condit ions under which the supply is made; • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; and • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed that the underlying supplier is liable for GST. 140. If they are treated as making the supply, the operator of the electronic marketplace will be responsible for returning GST. The operator of the electronic marketplace will include these supplies in their turnover for the purpose of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded and, if it is exceeded, will be liable for the GST. The operator would also make any adjustments arising from the supply, for example, when incorrectly charged GST is refunded to a GST-registered business. Meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” 141. The meaning of “authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient” is broad, covering the situation where the marketplace authorises the charge on behalf of the merchant or as a processing agent for the merchant. However, as mentioned earlier, providers that only process payments are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace”. 142. An electronic marketplace would authorise the charge to the recipient if it communicates the liability to pay to the customer, or otherwise influences whether or when the customer pays for the supply. This may be done by initiating the process through which the recipient is charged and includes situations where the marketplace connects the recipient to a third-party payment processor who receives the marketplace operator’s instruction. To authorise the charge, it is not necessary for the marketplace operator to collect or receive the payment, or that it is involved in each of the steps in the payment authorisation process. 36 Example 14 – marketplace that authorises the charge to the recipient When using the A Co. marketplace to purchase goods, Virginia chooses to pay using Pay Global, a third party payment processor. A Co. connects Virginia to Pay Global’s website, and provides data to Pay Global that allows them to process the payment. A Co. authorises the charge to Virginia. This is because it has communicated Virginia’s liability to pay for the goods. Example 15 – marketplace that does not authorise the charge Thomas is an underlying supplier who sells goods using the E-Z Trades marketplace. His profile advertises the fact that he has an active account on Pay Global, a third party payment processor. Thomas uses the messaging function to provide customers with his account details. E-Z Trades does not communicate the customer’s liability to pay, or influence whether or at what time the customer pays for the supply. It does not authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient. Meaning of “make or authorise the delivery of the supply to the recipient” 143. An electronic marketplace makes or authorises the delivery of the supply to the recipient if the operator of the marketplace itself delivers the goods, or if the marketplace sends approval to commence delivery or instructs the underlying supplier or a third party to make the delivery. Example 16 – marketplace that authorises delivery Consider Virginia and A Co. in Example 14. Once A Co. receives confirmation from Pay Global that payment was made, A Co. notifies the underlying supplier, and provides delivery instructions. A Co. authorises the delivery of the supply to Virginia. Example 17 – marketplace that does not authorise delivery Sports Stuff is an underlying supplier selling sporting gear through Persimmon’s website. Steve contacts Sports Stuff through Persimmon’s messaging service and buys a set of shin guards. Sports Stuff, and not Persimmon, authorises delivery of the item, given the arrangements for the order and delivery of the goods are made directly with Sports Stuff. Meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” 144. The meaning of “directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made” is very broad. This concept looks beyond the formal contractual relationship to the influence exercised by the marketplace operator. The marketplace operator does not need to have any direct involvement in determining the contractual arrangements between underlying suppliers and buyers using the marketplace in order to be responsible for GST on supplies. 145. A requirement for underlying suppliers to comply with the marketplace’s listing policies will in many cases mean that the marketplace does (at least indirectly) set a 37 term or condition under which the supply is made, meaning that the marketplace operator will be responsible for GST on the supply. However, this may not be true in all cases and will depend on what the marketplace’s specific listing policies are. 146. For example, a requirement in a contract between the marketplace operator and the underlying supplier that goods sold on the marketplace must comply with New Zealand laws and regulations will not in itself mean that the marketplace “directly or indirectly sets a term or condition under which the supply is made”. This is because the “directly or indirectly” test is a proxy for the level of control or influence the marketplace operator has over the sale and any post-sales processes, such as returns, refunds and customer complaints. A mere requirement that listings comply with New Zealand’s regulatory requirements or, for example, that listings do not contain offensive language is not sufficient to meet this test. 147. However, there are several marketplace listing policies that will meet this test, including: • the offer, acceptance, payment for the goods or delivery information is to be communicated through the marketplace; • the underlying supplier must accept one or more specific payment methods, or shipping or delivery methods to be used in fulfilling the sale; • the marketplace operator provides the types of packaging to be used by the underlying supplier; • underlying suppliers will match the prices of goods which are sold cheaper elsewhere (price match guarantee); • the marketplace operator has the right to withhold the buyer’s payment from the underlying supplier until the buyer confirms they are satisfied with the product; • use of the marketplace’s grievance or dispute management procedures for underlying suppliers and buyers; • the marketplace operator has the right to set the price for which goods are sold, such as by offering a discount through a customer loyalty programme; • underlying suppliers are required to meet particular performance requirements, such as those relating to the quality of the goods or requiring them to maintain a particular customer rating to sell products on the marketplace; or • underlying suppliers are required to display a rating based on stipulated behaviours relating to that underlying supplier’s conduct on the marketplace. 148. In practice this means there will be very limited circumstances where an electronic marketplace operator will not be responsible for GST on sales made by a non-resident underlying supplier though the marketplace. 38 Example 18 – marketplace that directly or indirectly sets any of the terms and conditions Tangerine (an electronic marketplace) offers features and imposes requirements on underlying suppliers and buyers, each of which mean that it directly or indirectly sets some of the terms and conditions under which the supplies through it are made. Tangerine: • requires underlying suppliers to conclude the transaction through its marketplace, and prohibits them from directly transacting with buyers outside of its marketplace. This ensures that Tangerine can collect the correct fee amount, which is based on the value of the sale; • requires underlying suppliers to accept at least one of the specific payment methods listed on its website; and • provides a rating of the underlying supplier’s performance on the platform, using ratings from buyers. This rating system influences the underlying supplier’s conduct when selling items through Tangerine. Example 19 – marketplace that does not directly or indirectly set any of the terms and conditions XYZ Marketplace Co. (XYZ) operates an electronic marketplace. However, the only requirements that it places on merchants and buyers using its website are that restricted or prohibited items (such as firearms) cannot be listed for sale, and that listings and other communications between merchants and buyers cannot contain offensive language. XYZ does not directly or indirectly set any of the terms or conditions under which the supply is made. Priority rule where multiple electronic marketplaces are involved in a supply 149. Where multiple electronic marketplaces are liable for GST on a single supply of distantly taxable goods or remote services, a priority rule in section 60C(3) provides that the first operator that authorises a charge or receives payment for the supply is treated as the supplier. If none of the marketplaces involved meet this requirement, the first operator that authorises delivery would be treated as the supplier. Approved marketplace rule 150. Amended section 60D allows non-electronic marketplaces for goods to register as a marketplace subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. The operator, and not the underlying supplier, would then be treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 151. New section 60D(2)(c) sets out that an approved marketplace for goods will be treated as making a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity in circumstances where: • the Commissioner approves an application made by the operator of the marketplace under subsection (2); • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and 39 • the goods individually have estimated customs values of NZ$1,000 or less (if the marketplace operator has not elected to charge GST on high-value goods – discussed later in this special report). 152. When exercising this discretion to approve a marketplace under section 60D, subsection (3) provides that the Commissioner may take the following into account: • whether the marketplace is best placed to determine whether the recipient of the supply of goods is a registered person; and • whether the number of non-resident underlying suppliers selling low-value goods through the marketplace means that return requirements are better satisfied by the marketplace rather than the individual underlying suppliers. Residency of underlying suppliers 153. As mentioned above, a marketplace operator will only be treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. This is in contrast with the existing marketplace rules for remote services, which (as illustrated in Table 1) apply to supplies made by both resident and non-resident underlying suppliers. 154. The marketplace rules for goods do not require the marketplace operator to distinguish between goods that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply versus those that are already in New Zealand. This is because all goods that are treated by section 60C or 60D as supplied by a marketplace operator are included in the definition of “distantly taxable goods”, regardless of where the goods are situated at the time of supply. 155. Table 1 is a summary of the differences between the GST rules applying to goods individually valued at NZ$1,000 or less (“low-value goods”) and remote services before and after 1 December 2019, in the situation where those low-value goods or remote services are supplied over a marketplace by a non-resident underlying supplier. Table 1: Pre-1 December 2019 treatment of different types of supplies and application of the marketplace rules to these supplies from 1 December 2019 Remote services Low-value goods in New Zealand at the time of supply Low-value goods outside New Zealand at the time of supply Previous treatment Marketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. Underlying supplier is responsible for GST. Supply not subject to GST. New treatment No change. Marketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. Marketplace operator is the supplier for GST purposes. 156. The existing treatment of remote services supplied through non-resident electronic marketplaces will continue to apply. This means that the non-resident marketplace operator is responsible for returning GST on these supplies, regardless of whether the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident or a non-resident. 40 Specific rule for underlying suppliers 157. Non-resident underlying suppliers that sell goods and/or remote services over marketplaces may already be registered for GST under existing rules. It is also possible that some non-resident underlying suppliers may become liable to register in their own right under the new rules for distantly taxable goods if they also make non-marketplace supplies to consumers in New Zealand (for instance, through their own website or mail order). 158. Some of these underlying suppliers may incur GST on inputs purchased from New Zealand businesses for making supplies to customers in New Zealand. Amended section 60(1C) ensures that such underlying suppliers (whether they are non-resident, or resident in New Zealand) can claim input tax deductions for their expenses in making supplies through electronic marketplaces. 159. The provision allows the underlying supplier to treat the supply as two separate supplies – a supply of goods or remote services from the underlying supplier to the operator of the marketplace, and a supply of those same goods or services from the operator to the recipient. The first supply to the marketplace operator is zero-rated under either section 11A(1)(jc) or new section 11(1)(jb), thus enabling the underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. Example 20 – zero-rated supply of remote services from underlying supplier to marketplace operator Games Pty Ltd., an Australian app developer that is registered for GST in New Zealand, contracts with App Store Co., an operator of an app store, to distribute its smartphone games. App Store Co. collects payments from customers and authorises delivery of the app. App Store Co. is treated as the supplier under section 60C, and is therefore responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of section 60C, App Store Co. makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of remote services that are made through its marketplace to New Zealand-resident consumers. Even though section 60C means App Store Co. is treated as the supplier of the app, Games Pty Ltd. can treat its supply of the app as a zero-rated supply to App Store Co. (as a separate supply to the supply that App Store Co. is treated as making). This will allow Games Pty Ltd. to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of the app through App Store Co. 41 Example 21 – zero-rated supply of distantly taxable goods from underlying supplier to marketplace operator Page Turners, a US-based book seller that is registered for GST in New Zealand, uses Books Marketplace, an electronic marketplace, to advertise and sell its books to customers in New Zealand. Books Marketplace sets some terms and conditions and collects payments from customers. Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier under section 60C, and is therefore responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of section 60C, Books Marketplace makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of goods that are made through its marketplace to customers with a delivery address in New Zealand. Even though Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier, under section 60(1C) Page Turners can treat its supply as a zero-rated supply to Books Marketplace (as a separate supply to the supply that Books Marketplace is treated as making). This will allow Page Turners to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of books through Books Marketplace. Repeal of residency rule for marketplace operators 160. Sections 60C(1)(b) and 60D(1)(b), which restrict the application of the marketplace rules to marketplaces operated by non-residents, have been repealed. This means that, from 1 December 2019, the marketplace rules for distantly taxable goods and remote services will apply to marketplaces operated by residents, in addition to those operated by non-residents. 19 Example 22 – supply of distantly taxable goods through New Zealand-resident marketplace Frances, a non-resident merchant, sells some books to Anna over an online marketplace. The entity which operates the online marketplace, NZ Marketplace, is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. Because the books each individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less, are to be delivered to an address in New Zealand and the underlying supplier of the books (Frances) is a non-resident, NZ Marketplace is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods under section 60C. This means that NZ Marketplace (instead of Frances) is required to return GST on the supply to Anna. The same outcome would also apply if NZ Marketplace was a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. However, if Frances was a New Zealand resident, NZ Marketplace would not be responsible for GST on the supply to Anna. Discounts provided by marketplace operators 161. New section 10(7D) contains a special valuation rule to deal with the situation where an operator of a marketplace provides discounts for remote services or distantly taxable goods that it is treated as supplying under section 60C or 60D. 19 An implication of this is that the electronic marketplace rules will technically apply in the situation where a resident underlying supplier makes a supply of remote services through a resident marketplace, thus having the unintended effect of affecting some domestic commercial arrangements that are already covered by existing agency rules. Officials will seek to correct this in a future omnibus tax bill, so that a New Zealand-resident operator of an electronic marketplace will only be treated by section 60C as making a supply of remote services if the underlying supplier is a non-resident. The application date of the planned amendment would be 1 December 2019. 42 162. Section 10(7D) provides that where an operator of a marketplace is deemed to make a supply of remote services or distantly taxable goods to a recipient who accepts an offer of a discount by the operator, the supply is made for the discounted price. This means that the amount of GST that the marketplace operator would be required to return on the supply would be 3/23 of the total GST-inclusive amount paid by the recipient. Example 23 – marketplace provides discount for distantly taxable goods sold by underlying supplier Trev, a non-resident supplier, sells a rugby league jersey to Mali, a consumer in New Zealand. The jersey is listed on the A Co. marketplace for NZ$50 plus GST if any with free shipping. The GST-inclusive price of the jersey is therefore NZ$57.50 (NZ$50 + NZ$7.50 in GST). A Co. offers a discount of NZ$5 on the price of the jersey, which Mali accepts at the checkout before paying for the goods. The final (GST-inclusive) price paid by Mali is therefore NZ$52.50. However, A Co. pays for the discount, so Trev still receives the GST-exclusive price of NZ$50. A Co. is required to calculate the amount of GST on the price paid by Mali (NZ$52.50). A Co. returns NZ$6.85 in GST on the supply (being 3/23 × NZ$52.50). Bad debt deduction rule 163. An operator of a marketplace may collect GST on a supply it is deemed to make in one of two ways: • The marketplace operator arranges for the payment from the customer to be split when the payment is processed, with the amount of GST and the marketplace’s facilitation fee or commission remitted to the operator, and the sale price (net of GST and the amount of the marketplace’s fee or commission on the sale) remitted to the underlying supplier of the goods or services. • The customer may pay the underlying supplier directly, and the marketplace operator collects the GST along with its fee or commission from the underlying supplier. 164. In the second scenario, the marketplace operator may at times be unable to collect the GST from the underlying supplier. To prevent marketplace operators in this situation from being liable for GST that they are unable to collect, new section 26AA will allow them to claim a bad debt deduction if: • the underlying supplier fails to pass on the GST paid to them for the supply; and • the operator of the marketplace has written off all amounts for the supply as a bad debt, including its fee or commission on the sale. 165. Section 26AA(1) specifies that the rule would apply to a marketplace operator that is treated by section 60C or 60D as making a taxable supply of goods or services if the underlying supplier of the goods is not an associated person, and the marketplace operator: • charges the underlying supplier a fee for making the supply through the marketplace; 43 • accounts for GST on the supply and files a return for the taxable period during which the supply was made; • has an agreement with the underlying supplier under which the underlying supplier is required to pay, from the consideration the underlying supplier receives from the customer, an amount that includes the GST on the supply that the marketplace operator has accounted for; and • the marketplace operator writes off as a bad debt the entire amount that the underlying supplier is required to pay (along with the entire amount of the marketplace’s fee, if not already included in this amount). 166. Section 26AA(2) provides that the marketplace operator may deduct input tax (or account for a reduction in its output tax, if the marketplace has registered under the simplified “pay only” system, discussed at \[36\]) equal to the amount of GST charged on the supply. 167. In the situation where the marketplace operator recovers an amount of the bad debt that was written off in an earlier taxable period, section 26AA(3) will require the operator to account for an amount of output tax that is a fraction of the amount of the input tax deduction (or output tax reduction) claimed earlier. This fraction would be calculated by dividing the amount recovered by the total amount written off. Example 24 – marketplace writes off amount owed by underlying supplier as a bad debt Derek, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a vinyl record listed on the A Co. online marketplace from Retro Audio, a non-resident supplier. The price of the record, including shipping (but excluding GST) is NZ$40. At the online checkout, Derek provides an address in New Zealand for the goods to be delivered. Consequently, A Co. is deemed to be the supplier of the vinyl record for GST purposes. The supply of the record is a supply of distantly taxable goods subject to GST at the rate of 15%. The GST-inclusive price of the record is therefore NZ$46 (NZ$40 + NZ$6 in GST). Instead of paying by a method that would provide A Co. with some control over the processing of the payment (such as by credit card), Derek opts to pay Retro Audio directly by internet banking transfer. A Co. has an agreement with Retro Audio that if a customer pays Retro Audio directly, Retro Audio is required to pay A Co. the amount of GST on the sale, along with A Co.’s commission of five percent on the total sale price. The amount of the debt that Retro Audio owes A Co. is therefore NZ$8.30 (NZ$6 in GST, plus commission of NZ$46 × 5% = NZ$2.30). Retro Audio defaults in paying the debt to A Co, so A Co. writes off the full amount of NZ$8.30 as a bad debt. As A Co. returned the NZ$6 in GST on the supply to Inland Revenue in a previous GST return, A Co. is entitled to claim a bad debt deduction of NZ$6 in its GST return. If A Co. subsequently recovered any of the debt in a later taxable period, it would be required to return output tax in its GST return for that taxable period, to the extent of the amount of the recovery. For example, if A Co. managed to collect NZ$4.15 from Retro Audio, the fraction given by section 26AA(3) would be 4.15 ÷ 8.30 = ½. A Co. would therefore be required to return NZ$3 in output tax (½ × NZ$6 = NZ$3). If, instead of writing off the full amount as a bad debt, A Co. only wrote off a fraction of the amount as a bad debt, A Co. would not be able to claim a bad debt deduction in relation to the supply. 44 Redeliverers 168. Some non-resident merchants do not provide shipping of goods to New Zealand. New Zealand consumers can, however, use a redeliverer to ship or arrange the shipment of goods to New Zealand. 169. A redeliverer may be a person that provides a “mailbox” service, meaning that they provide the use of an overseas delivery address for consumers purchasing goods from offshore suppliers. These types of redeliverers would receive or collect the goods from the overseas address and deliver the goods to the consumer’s address in New Zealand, or arrange the collection and delivery of the goods to the customer in New Zealand. 170. In some instances, the definition of “redeliverer” may also cover a person that provides personal shopping services to consumers in New Zealand. 171. When consumers use a redeliverer, it is likely that the merchant (or both the merchant and the marketplace operator, if the supply is made through a marketplace) is unaware of the goods’ ultimate destination, and therefore cannot be expected to return GST on the supply. The new rules therefore require redeliverers to collect and return GST in this situat ion. Definition of “redeliverer” 172. The definition of “redeliverer” requires that the person who is acting as a redeliverer has an arrangement with the recipient of the goods. Under this arrangement, the person either delivers the goods to New Zealand, or arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to New Zealand, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; or • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. 173. Personal shoppers that re-sell goods to consumers in New Zealand (as opposed to purchasing goods as an agent of the customer) are not covered by the redeliverer rules as they are considered to be merchants. Redeliverer rule 174. New section 60E sets out that a person acting as a redeliverer will be treated as supplying distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity if all the fo llowing condit io ns are satisfied: • no operator of a marketplace is treated as the supplier of the goods; • the merchant who sold the goods does not deliver, nor arrange or assist the delivery of the goods to New Zealand; and • when the redeliverer is treated as the supplier of the goods, the goods that the redeliverer is treated as supplying are distantly taxable goods (meaning that the 45 goods individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less 20 or, as discussed later at \[293\] to \[310\], the redeliverer has elected under new section 10C to charge GST on items with an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000). 175. This means that a redeliverer will only be treated as the supplier if neither the merchant, nor an operator of a marketplace, delivers or assists in delivering the goods to New Zealand. If either does deliver or assist in delivering the goods to New Zealand, one of these entities will be responsible for GST on the supply instead of the redeliverer. This is consistent with the policy intent that the redeliverer provisions apply in limited circumstances, where the other entities are unaware that the goods will be sent to New Zealand. Priority rule where multiple redeliverers are involved 176. In some circumstances, more than one person may meet the definition of a redeliverer in relation to a single supply of distantly taxable goods. This would occur when more than one redeliverer is involved in an arrangement to deliver goods to a place in New Zealand. For example, one entity acting as a redeliverer may contract with another entity to purchase the goods as an agent of the consumer. 177. Section 60E(2) contains a priority rule to deal with the situation where multiple redeliverers may be liable for GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer in New Zealand. Under this provision, the redeliverer that first enters into an arrangement with the recipient of the goods is treated as making the supply. If no such arrangement exists, the first redeliverer to enter into an arrangement with any other person acting on the recipient’s behalf is treated as the supplier and therefore responsible for GST. Special valuation rule for redeliverers’ deemed supplies of goods 178. New section 10(7C) is a special valuation rule for supplies of goods treated by section 60E as being made by a redeliverer. Section 10(7C) provides that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods by a redeliverer equals the consideration paid by the recipient for the goods before the addition of GST. 179. This rule means that the amount of GST on the supply of goods that the redeliverer would be required to return is equal to 15% of the price paid by the recipient to the supplier for the goods. This recognises that the price charged by the supplier of the goods did not include GST. Amendment to zero-rating rules for international transportation services 180. Under the existing rules in section 11A(1) of the GST Act, the supply of international transportation and associated insurance services is zero-rated, as are services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. This generally means that services provided by redeliverers (which would largely consist of international transportation 20 In the situation where some of the goods in the transaction have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less while other goods in the transaction are valued above NZ$1,000, the supply would be treated as two separate supplies in the manner described earlier in this special report at \[91\] if the redeliverer has not made an election to treat items valued above NZ$1,000 as distantly taxable goods. 46 and handling, storage and logistics provided in relation to goods that are located offshore, or the arranging or facilitation thereof) are effectively not taxed, as the supply of these services would typically be subject to GST at the rate of 0% under existing rules. 181. New section 11A(1D) provides an exception to this general rule. Section 11A(1D) sets out that paragraphs (a), (c), (cb), (d) and (f) in section 11A(1) do not apply to a supply of services provided by a GST-registered redeliverer if those services are provided in relat ion to distantly taxable goods that are treated as being supplied by the redeliverer. This means that the redeliverer’s services would be taxed in the same way as the goods the redeliverer brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand (as any transportation or associated facilitation services provided by the redeliverer would be taxed at the rate of 15% if they are supplied in connection with a supply by the redeliverer of distantly taxable goods). 182. The value of a supply of distantly taxable goods and related transport and facilitation services by a redeliverer will therefore be equal to: • the consideration paid by the recipient for the distantly taxable goods before the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the goods is 15% of the price paid by the recipient for the goods, including any additional charges by the merchant for transport and insurance); plus • the consideration for the supply of the redeliverer’s services with the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the supply of the redeliverer’s services is 3/23 of the GST-inclusive price paid by the recipient). Example 25 – redeliverer providing a mailbox service Matt, a consumer in New Zealand, contracts a redeliverer called C Co. to pick up a laptop bag from a UK address that C Co. provided to Matt and deliver it to his home address in Wellington. Matt paid NZ$40 for the bag including the amount charged by the merchant for shipping from its retail store in London to C Co.’s UK address. When arranging for the goods to be redelivered to his Wellington address, Matt tells C Co. that he paid NZ$40 for the goods. C Co. charges NZ$15 plus GST if any for its services as redeliverer in bringing the goods to New Zealand. As the estimated customs value of the laptop bag is less than NZ$1,000, the laptop bag is considered distantly taxable. C Co. charges Matt NZ$23.25, comprising: • NZ$6 in GST, which is 15% of the NZ$40 Matt paid the UK supplier for the goods; • NZ$15 for C Co.’s redelivery services; and • NZ$2.25 in GST, which is 15% of C Co.’s GST-exclusive fee for its services. C Co. returns NZ$8.25 in GST to Inland Revenue when it files its GST return. 47 Example 26 – redeliverer providing a personal shopping service Marie is a redeliverer who regularly purchases clothes as an agent for Carolyn. Marie facilitates the delivery of the goods into New Zealand by arranging for a freight company to deliver the clothes to Carolyn’s address in Oamaru. The USA merchants that sell the clothes have no role in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Carolyn paid NZ$720 for a dress that Marie purchased as her agent. This included NZ$20 for the cost of shipping from the USA merchants to Marie’s address overseas. Marie charged Carolyn NZ$40 (exclusive of GST) for her services as a redeliverer in bringing the dress to New Zealand. As the estimated customs value of the dress is less than NZ$1,000 (being NZ$720), the dress is an item of distantly taxable goods. Marie is registered for GST and determines the supply is a taxable supply. Marie charges Carolyn NZ$874, made up of: • NZ$720 to reimburse Marie for the purchase of the dress (including the NZ$20 charge for delivery to Marie’s USA address); • NZ$108 in GST, which is 15% of the NZ$720 Carolyn paid for the dress; • NZ$40 for Marie’s facilitation and delivery services; and • NZ$6 in GST, which is 15% of Marie’s NZ$40 GST-exclusive fee for her services. Marie returns NZ$114 in GST to Inland Revenue when she files her GST return. New Zealand-resident agents 183. Amended section 60(1A) and 60(1AB) allows New Zealand-resident agents acting for non-residents that supply distantly taxable goods to consumers to agree with the non- resident principal to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them. 184. If this option is exercised, the agent would be required to register and return GST on the supplies of distantly taxable goods. Since the agent is a New Zealand resident they would be treated as any other resident supplier of goods and services and, therefore, would be required to return GST on both supplies to New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. Example 27 – New Zealand-resident agent treated as making supply of distantly taxable goods Agent Co., a New Zealand resident, sells low-value imported goods to consumers in New Zealand on behalf of Principal Co., a non-resident merchant. Agent Co. and Principal Co. agree that Agent Co. will be treated as making the supplies of distantly taxable goods. Assuming the supplies made by Agent Co. exceed the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, Agent Co. is now required to register and return GST on behalf of Principal Co. in relation to supplies to both New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. 48 Preventing double taxation (Sections 12(1B), (1C), 12B, 20(3)(dd), 24BAB, 24BAC and 25(1)(bb)) Changes to the customs de minimis 185. To simplify border processes and reduce the risk of potential double taxation occurring under the new legislation applying to distantly taxable goods, the Government is proposing changes to the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996. The changes consist of: • increasing the de minimis (the threshold below which GST and other duties are not collected by Customs at the border) from NZ$60 of duty owing to a consignment with a customs value over NZ$1,000; and • removing the Import Entry Transaction Fee (IETF) and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy (BSEL) from consignments with a customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 186. This means that from 1 December 2019, Customs will collect GST and other duties, as well as the IETF and associated BSEL on imported consignments valued above NZ$1,000, but will not collect these charges on consignments valued at or below NZ$1,000. 21 187. However, requiring merchants, marketplaces and redeliverers to collect GST on imported goods individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less – while Customs collects GST on consignments valued over NZ$1,000 – nonetheless creates the potential for double taxation to occur in some situations. For example, a single consignment could be valued over NZ$1,000, but contain an item or items that, individually, have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 188. Double taxation could also potentially arise if goods are sold in a foreign currency and the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply to determine whether the goods are distantly taxable goods differs from that used by the customs broker when completing the import entry. Rules and processes, including requirements for suppliers to provide certain information about GST, are therefore required to prevent double taxation, as well as relieve double taxation in the rare event that it occurs. This section of this special report explains how these rules and processes will operate. Exception to the collection of GST on importation 189. Under new section 12(1B) and (1C), Customs will not collect GST on items imported in consignments with a combined value over NZ$1,000 if GST has been charged on the item at the point of sale – provided that Customs is notified that GST has already been paid. Customs will still collect other duty, such as tariff duty, and the IETF and associated BSEL on consignments over NZ$1,000 if GST has already been charged on all the goods in the consignment at the point of sale, including GST applying to the tariff duty, IETF and BSEL. 21 As mentioned earlier, consignments containing alcohol and tobacco products are not subject to the de minimis, so Customs will continue to collect GST and excise taxes on these products regardless of their value. 49 190. Section 12(1B) sets out that for Customs’ purposes of collecting GST on imported goods at the border, the value of distantly taxable goods does not include the following: • the value of the goods determined in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018; • the amount paid or payable for transport of the goods to New Zealand and associated insurance; and • the amount of levy paid or payable on goods under the Climate Change Response Act 2002. 191. This means that if GST was charged on an item at the point of sale, Customs will not collect GST again on the value of the item or on the amount charged for freight and insurance, but will collect GST on any tariff duty applying to the item if the item is imported in a consignment valued over NZ$1,000. 192. In order for Customs to identify whether GST has already been charged on an item, the information available to Customs at the time the goods are imported needs to sufficiently identify the items in the consignment on which tax was charged at the point of sale, as well as the name and GST registration number of the registered person who is responsible for returning GST on the supply to Inland Revenue. Example 28 – consignment of distantly taxable goods with total value above NZ$1,000 Jason purchases a phone for NZ$900 and noise cancelling headphones for NZ$200 (excluding GST) from Kim’s Phone Warehouse, a GST-registered non-resident supplier. As both items individually have an estimated customs value below NZ$1,000, Kim’s Phone Warehouse treats the goods as distantly taxable and charges Jason GST on both the phone and the headphones. The phone and headphones are sent to Jason in a single package with a customs value of NZ$1,100. As the consignment is over NZ$1,000, Customs will stop the consignment for revenue collection and collect the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy (total fees of NZ$55.71). However, provided that evidence is made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Kim’s Phone Warehouse on both the phone and the headphones, Customs will not collect GST on either of the two items in the consignment. 50 Example 29 – distantly taxable goods subject to tariff duty imported in consignment over NZ$1,000 Fi purchases two designer label dresses from Snazzy Dresses, a non-resident merchant offering free shipping for orders over NZ$1,000. One dress is priced at NZ$400 while the other is priced at NZ$1,100 (plus GST if any). Snazzy Dresses is registered for GST and charges GST on the supply of the NZ$400 dress to Fi (as the supply of the NZ$400 dress is a taxable supply of distantly taxable goods, but the NZ$1,100 dress is not an item of distantly taxable goods). The dresses are sent to Fi in a single package with a customs value of NZ$1,500. As the consignment is over NZ$1,000, Customs will stop the consignment for revenue collection and collect the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy of NZ$55.71. Evidence is made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Snazzy Dresses on the NZ$400 dress, so Customs only collects GST on the NZ$1,100 dress of NZ$165 (NZ$1,100 × 15% = NZ$165). However, because both dresses are subject to tariff duty of 5%, Customs will also collect tariff duty (including GST applying to the tariff duty) on both dresses. The amount of the tariff duty excluding GST is NZ$75 (NZ$1,500 × 5% = NZ$75) and the amount of GST applying to the tariff duty is NZ$11.25 (NZ$75 × 15% = NZ$11.25). The total amount that Fi will pay to Customs is NZ$306.96 (NZ$55.71 in cost recovery charges + NZ$165 in GST on the NZ$1,100 dress + NZ$75 in tariff duty excluding GST + NZ$11.25 in GST on the tariff duty). Example 30 – difference in exchange rate used by supplier and that used by Customs Fi later purchases a 60” ultra-high definition television for AU$950 from Earl’s Electronics, a non-resident merchant. At the time of sale, Earl’s Electronics estimates that the customs value of the television is NZ$998.41, based on a “buy NZD” exchange rate of AU$0.9515 / NZ$1. As the estimated customs value at the time of supply is below NZ$1,000, Earl’s Electronics charges Fi GST at the point of sale. When completing the import documentation, the customs broker converts the AU$950 figure to New Zealand dollars using the exchange rate published by Customs of AU$0.9307 / NZ$1. Based on this exchange rate, the customs broker calculates the customs value to be NZ$1,020.74 and enters this as the value in the import entry. As the customs value of the consignment is above NZ$1,000, Fi is required to pay the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy of NZ$55.71. However, as evidence was made available to Customs in the approved form that GST was already collected by Earl’s Electronics, Customs will not collect GST. Receipt requirement 193. New section 24BAB requires suppliers to issue receipts for supplies of distantly taxable goods if the supplier has charged GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The purpose of this requirement is to provide the recipient of the supply with a document that they can provide to Customs as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale, so that Customs does not collect GST again when the goods are imported into New Zealand. 194. The requirement to provide a receipt is not the sole mechanism for preventing double taxation under the new rules. Rather, it serves as a back-up safeguard against double 51 taxation in the situation where the primary mechanism (discussed below at \[204\] to \[211\]) either fails or, in some cases, may not be feasible under current systems. Particulars required to be included in the receipt 195. Unless alternative particulars are agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, section 24BAB requires that the receipt contains the following: • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the date of the supply; • the date of issue of the receipt (if different from the date of the supply); • a description of the goods supplied; • the consideration for the supply and the amount of tax included; • information indicating the items for which tax has been charged; and • information indicating the items that have not had tax charged. 22 196. If GST has been charged on all of the goods included on the receipt, the last two requirements can be met by including the total GST-inclusive price and stating that this price includes GST (or alternatively by including the amount of GST for each of the goods). However, if GST was charged on only some of the goods supplied, these requirements can be met by including the amount of GST for each of the goods. 197. The amounts shown on the receipt are not required to be in New Zealand dollars. Option to issue a document that meets the requirements of both a receipt and a full tax invoice 198. Under the special rule in new section 8(4F) (explained later at \[311\] to \[318\]), some non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods may opt to proactively issue a full tax invoice for all supplies of distantly taxable goods that they make, regardless of whether the customer is a private consumer or a GST-registered business using the goods in its taxable activity. 199. The benefit of this is the non-resident supplier can issue a single document to its New Zealand customers that meets the requirements of both a full tax invoice and a receipt required to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods, provided the conditions of section 8(4F) (including the requirement that the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less) are met. 200. The requirements of a full tax invoice are broadly similar to those set out in section 24BAB(2) for a receipt required to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods – the main differences being the requirements for a tax invoice to include the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place, the name and address of the recipient and the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied. 22 Officials will seek to include an amendment in a future taxation bill so that the supplier is not required to state the amount of tax included on the receipt, as this requirement does not appear to be necessary given the last two requirements in this list. The suggested amendment would be retrospective to 1 December 2019. 52 201. Table 2 sets out the respective requirements of a full tax invoice under section 24(3) and of a section 24BAB receipt. Table 2: Requirements for receipts and full tax invoices Item Section 24BAB receipt Tax invoice Words “tax invoice” No Yes Name of the supplier Yes Yes Registration number of the supplier Yes Yes Name and address of the recipient No Yes Date of supply Yes No Date of issue Yes Yes Description of goods Yes Yes Quantity or volume of goods supplied No Yes Amount of consideration Yes Yes Amount of tax included Yes – but see footnote 22 Yes – unless the total amount of tax is 3/23 of the consideration, in which case a statement that the consideration includes a charge in respect of tax is sufficient Indication of which items had GST charged Yes No 10-day requirement for issue of receipt 202. Section 24BAB requires that a receipt (or combined tax invoice and receipt) as described above is issued to the recipient at the time of supply. However, if the supplier has not issued a receipt at the time of supply and the recipient requests a receipt, the supplier would be required to issue one within 10 business days after the request. 203. Under new section 143A(1)(fb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier who knowingly fails to issue a GST receipt within ten business days of such a request commits a knowledge offence, for which penalties (both civil and criminal) may apply. GST information to be included on import documents 204. In addition to the requirement outlined above to issue GST receipts, new section 24BAC requires suppliers of distantly taxable goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that relevant GST informat ion is available to Customs at the time of importation of the goods. 205. That information consists of: • the name and registration number of the supplier; 53 • information indicating which items in the consignment have had GST charged at the point of sale at the rate of 15%, if applicable; and • information indicating the items in the consignment for which the amount of GST is zero. 206. If GST was not charged on some items in the transaction, these items must be identified to meet the above requirements. This would allow the new rules in section 12 that prevent double taxation to operate effectively, as GST on importation will only be “switched off” if GST has been charged on the item at the point of sale. What “reasonable steps” means for merchants and marketplaces that fulfil orders, and redeliverers 207. For non-mail items (goods brought to New Zealand through the freight channel), a supplier who is either the merchant that sold the goods, a redeliverer, or an operator of a marketplace undertaking the fulfilment 23 of the order from the customer, would meet the requirement to take reasonable steps by: • providing the GST information listed above to the transporter or customs broker in the country of export (one way that the supplier could do this is by including the receipt or tax invoice for the goods in the commercial documentation provided to the transporter or customs broker); and • asking the transporter or customs broker in the country of export to make sure the information is provided to the transporter or customs broker in New Zealand that will complete the import documentation on behalf of the importer. What “reasonable steps” means for marketplaces that do not fulfil orders 208. The “reasonable steps” requirement differs somewhat for an operator of a marketplace who is treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the situation where the order is fulfilled by the underlying supplier. In this situation, the marketplace operator would meet the reasonable steps requirement by including GST information on commercial documentation and instructing the underlying supplier to pass this information through the logistics chain on their behalf. As above, this requirement would only apply in relation to non-mail items. Role of transporters and customs brokers 209. The transporter or customs broker completing the import documentation would report the GST information provided by the supplier or merchant into the Trade Single Window. Transporters and customs brokers only need to report this information into the Trade Single Window if it is provided to them. If this information is not provided, they are not required to take extra steps to source this information and will still be able to report the goods into the Trade Single Window for customs clearance. 210. A field for the supplier’s GST registration number will be added into the Trade Single Window. The required format of the number is nine digits as a single string without separators. 23 “Fulfilment” of an order is used here in reference to the party (merchant or marketplace operator) that ships or arranges the shipping of the goods to the customer. 54 211. The information about which goods have and have not had GST charged at the point of sale will be reported into the Trade Single Window by way of a “GST paid” indicator. The format of this indicator is a “Yes” (Y) or “No” (N) response. Goods brought to New Zealand by international post 212. Current systems may not fully accommodate the transmissio n of informat ion relat ing to goods delivered to New Zealand by international post. Therefore, issuing the customer a receipt (as required under section 24BAB) will be sufficient in the meantime to meet the reasonable steps requirement. 24 213. In the situat ion where the value of the consignment is over NZ$1,000, the consumer should hire a customs broker to complete the import documentation and arrange the clearance of the goods. To ensure that GST is not paid twice on the same goods, the consumer should provide their receipt to the customs broker as evidence that GST was charged at the point of sale. 25 Penalties for knowingly failing to take reasonable steps 214. Under new section 143A(1)(fc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier would commit a knowledge offence if they knowingly fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that tax information is available to Customs at the time the goods are imported. Administrative penalties under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 may also apply in relation to an error or omission in an import entry that has been lodged with Customs. 24 What will constitute reasonable steps in relation to mail items might change in the future, owing to the increased availability of electronic advance data in the international postal network that is expected to occur over the next few years. 25 This recommendation also applies in the situation where GST information required to be provided by the supplier in relation to goods imported by freight has not been passed on to the person completing the import documentation. In other words – assuming the consumer was charged GST by the supplier and obtained a receipt – the consumer should provide their receipt to the carrier or customs broker when they are contacted by the carrier or broker to arrange clearance of the goods to avoid paying GST twice. 55 Figure 3: Interaction of the new legislation with border processes Interaction of the new legislation with border processes Freight forwa rder / carrier / customs broker Supplier Customs New Zealand consumer Co nsig nm ent valued above $1,000?

Applicable tariff duty will be collected, even on items that had GST charged at the point of sale. However, the consumer will only pay GST on goods that did not have GST charged at the point of sale. Clear goods collecting GST, customs duties or levies 56 Refunds when double taxation occurs 215. Where the relevant GST information is not available to Customs, GST will be collected on importation by Customs on the entire value of a consignment over NZ$1,000 (as determined in accordance with existing section 12(2)). If some or all the goods in the consignment have already had GST charged at the point of sale, the consumer will need to request a refund of the GST from the supplier. 216. If a consumer requests a refund of the GST charged by the supplier, and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or some other confirmation that GST was paid on importation, the supplier will be required to issue a refund of the GST that was charged on the supply (new section 12B). If the supplier complies with this requirement, new section 25(1)(bb) allows the supplier to subtract the amount of GST refunded from its output tax (GST payable) in its GST return. Mistakes where GST has been incorrectly charged on a supply 217. New sections 12B and 25(1)(bb) would also apply in the situation where a supplier has incorrectly charged GST on a supply of imported goods that is not a supply of distantly taxable goods (for example, because the goods individually have estimated customs values above NZ$1,000). This means that a supplier in this situation will be required to refund the GST they charged if the recipient has requested a GST refund and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient (or some other confirmation that GST was paid on the importation of the goods). 218. As above, the supplier will only be entitled to make the adjustment under section 25(1)(bb) if: • they have reimbursed the recipient for the GST charged; and • the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or other confirmation that GST was paid to Customs on importation. Non-double taxation rule 219. New section 20(3)(dd) prevents double taxation from arising on supplies of distantly taxable goods by allowing a deduction that offsets the supplier’s liability for GST in New Zealand, to the extent that the supply is subject to a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. 220. Section 20(3)(dd) provides a deduction for the New Zealand GST charged when: • there is a supply of distantly taxable goods to a person in New Zealand who is not a GST-registered person; and • the supplier has, in relation to the supply, incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. 221. The deduction is limited to the GST paid on the supply in New Zealand (15%) and to the extent tax is returned and paid in the other country. 57 Example 31 – non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) Mike, a consumer in New Zealand imports some shirts from a supplier based in Country A, who ships the goods from its warehouse in Country A. The supplier is registered for VAT in Country A and is also registered for GST in New Zealand. In order for the supplier to charge Country A’s VAT at a rate of zero percent on the supply to Mike, VAT legislation in Country A requires the supplier to export the goods within 21 days of the date of the supply. The supplier does not manage to export the goods within this timeframe and is therefore required to charge Country A’s VAT at the rate of 20%. In addition, the goods are all distantly taxable goods, so the supplier is also required to charge New Zealand GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) allows the supplier to make an input tax deduction up to the amount of New Zealand GST returned on the supply (15%) if the supplier has returned and paid VAT to Country A. If Country A’s VAT rate was instead 10%, the supplier would only be entitled to an input tax deduction of 10%. Vouchers (Section 5(11G)) 222. In the situation where a face value token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for distantly taxable goods or remote services, new section 5(11G)(a) clarifies that the supplier of the token, stamp or voucher may treat the supply of goods and services that the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for as the relevant supply for GST purposes. This means that the seller of a face value voucher would have the option of treating GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher, if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods. This option to treat the supply as arising on the redemption of the voucher would apply regardless of whether the issuer or seller of the voucher is a different person to the supplier of the goods and services that the voucher is redeemed for. 223. The introductory wording of section 5(11G) has been amended to clarify that if GST is payable on the redemption of a voucher, the party redeeming the voucher for goods and services (or treated as making the supply of goods and services) is responsible for returning the GST. 58 Example 32 – seller of voucher opts to use redemption basis Wendy purchases a voucher with a face value of NZ$50 from A Co. as a gift for her son Karl who lives in Dunedin, New Zealand. The voucher can be redeemed with any merchant on the A Co. marketplace. A Co. chooses to treat the supply for GST purposes as arising on the redemption of the voucher (instead of the sale of the voucher). This means that GST will apply when Karl redeems the voucher for goods and services, and not on the sale or issue of the voucher itself. Karl redeems the voucher with a non-resident merchant on the A Co. marketplace by purchasing NZ$50 worth of distantly taxable goods. Because A Co is treated by section 60C as the supplier of the goods, it is required to return NZ$6.52 in GST (3/23 × NZ$50 = NZ$6.52) on the redemption of the voucher. If A Co. was not treated as the supplier, the underlying supplier would (if registered for GST or required to register for GST) instead be required to return GST on the supply. Converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars (Sections 77(2), (3) and (5)) 224. Generally, the GST Act requires all amounts to be expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. This means that if a supply is paid for in a foreign currency, the value of the supply must be expressed as the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. 225. Section 77(2) has been amended to provide non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods with the option of expressing amounts in a foreign currency at the time of supply. Currency conversion to determine whether GST applies 226. In accordance with new section 77(5), suppliers of distantly taxable goods may use the spot exchange rate applying at the time of supply, or a currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when determining the value of goods under section 10B. The method approved by the Commissioner for this purpose is set out below. Exchange rates that may be used 227. Under the approved method, a supplier may use any one of the following exchange rates: • the rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service; • the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) rate, or a reference rate published by another central bank; 26 26 “Another central bank” refers to a central bank or monetary authority outside New Zealand that exercises functions that correspond with, or are similar to, the RBNZ. This would include organisations such as the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. 59 • an exchange rate provided by a foreign exchange organisation 27 or foreign exchange data vendor. 228. “Exchange rate” for these purposes means the unit of foreign currency per New Zealand dollar, which has been published within 30 calendar days of the conversion time. If a rate other than the most recently published rate is used, the practice for sourcing the rate must be consistent. 229. Other than the requirement that a supplier’s chosen exchange rate be used consistently (discussed below), there are no restrictions on the specific type of exchange rate (sell NZD, buy NZD, or midpoint rate) that suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means that suppliers would have a choice of using a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate when converting foreign currency amounts to establish whether GST applies. Currency conversion formula 230. In working out the estimated customs value of goods, suppliers can convert foreign currency to New Zealand dollars using the following formula: (Amount expressed in a foreign currency) ÷ (the supplier’s chosen exchange rate on the conversion day) Sourcing exchange rates and updating business systems 231. A supplier may adopt a practice of updating their business systems with the particular rate they have chosen from the source data according to a schedule set by them. This schedule must be consistent in terms of the frequency and time of setting the rate. The maximum period permitted under such a schedule is 30 calendar days. A supplier cannot test and select a more favourable exchange rate at other times, or decide not to accept the published rate at the scheduled time of setting. 232. A supplier may only change their exchange rate or their schedule for sourcing and updating the exchange rate in their systems if they have sound commercial reasons for doing so. For instance, if a supplier changes the exchange rate they use with the purpose of affecting whether goods are distantly taxable, the supplier will not have used the rate consistently and, accordingly, will not have followed the currency conversion method approved by the Commissioner. However, different exchange rates may be used for distinct parts of the supplier’s business, provided the exchange rate chosen for each respective part of the business is used consistently within that part. 27 A “foreign exchange organisation” means an organisation that provides exchange rates publicly. 60 Example 33 – supplier using exchange rate published by New Zealand Customs Pilko’s Phones & Electronics (Pilko) is a non-resident merchant that supplies consumer electronics such as tablets and mobile phones. It prices goods in USD. Pilko is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules applying to supplies of distantly taxable goods. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Pilko has its point of sale systems set up to convert USD to NZD using the exchange rate published by the New Zealand Customs Service. Customs publishes its exchange rates fortnightly, 11 calendar days in advance of when they come into effect. Pilko has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems seven days after the exchange rate was published on the Customs website. This currency conversion method is Commissioner-approved. The schedule set by Pilko for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate. The time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 14 calendar days (within the 30-day maximum). Under Pilko’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 21 calendar days. This is within the 30-day maximum. Example 34 – supplier using midpoint exchange rate published by retail bank Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) is a non-resident merchant that supplies high-end clothing. It prices goods in AUD. Witte is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules applying to supplies of distantly taxable goods. To determine the estimated customs value of an item at the time of sale, Witte has its point of sale systems set up to convert AUD (being the currency the goods Witte sells are priced in) to NZD using a mid-point rate published by a bank. The bank publishes the close-of-trading foreign exchange rates from the previous day each morning (except for Saturdays and Sundays). Witte has a practice of sourcing the most recently published exchange rate and updating the exchange rate in its point of sale systems once every four weeks on a Tuesday. This currency conversion method is Commissioner-approved. The schedule set by Witte for sourcing the exchange rate and updating its systems is consistent in terms of its frequency and time of setting the rate, and the time between setting the previous rate and updating the rate is 28 calendar days (within the 30-day maximum). Under Witte’s schedule, the maximum possible length of time between the publication date and the time of conversion is 28 calendar days. This is within the 30-day maximum. Example 35 – currency conversion to determine whether goods are distantly taxable Consider Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) in the previous example. Witte sells a suit valued at AU$880 to Gordon, plus AU$50 for shipping to Gordon’s address in Wellington, New Zealand. At the time of the sale, the midpoint exchange rate used in Witte’s systems for estimating the customs value of items sold is AU$0.9270 to NZ$1. Based on this, Witte determines that the estimated customs value of the suit in New Zealand dollars is NZ$949.30 (AU$880 / AU$0.9270 = NZ$949.30). As the estimated customs value is less than NZ$1,000, the suit is distantly taxable. Witte charges Gordon GST of AU$139.50 (AU$930 × 15%). 61 Currency conversion when determining the amount of GST payable 233. When converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to determine the amount of GST required to be returned, section 77(3) provides that a supplier can use the conversion rate applying on either: • the last day of the relevant taxable period; • the date the supplier files their return for the relevant period (or the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); or • another date as agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 234. If the supplier elects to use an option other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at the time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Example 36 – currency conversion to determine amount of GST to be returned in New Zealand dollars Consider Witte Fashion Co. (Witte) again. At the time of preparing its GST return, Witte determines that the total amount of GST it charged for the most recent taxable period is AU$9,000. Witte has elected to use the exchange rate applying on the date that it files its GST return to determine the amount of GST to be returned to Inland Revenue in New Zealand dollars. The exchange rate applying on the date that Witte files its return is AU$0.9294 / NZ$1. The amount of GST returned by Witte in its GST return is NZ$9,683.67 (AU$9,000 / AU$0.9294 = NZ$9,683.67). Witte must use this method for 24 months. It must convert GST from AUD to NZD on the date it files each GST return (or the due date if a return is filed late). Methods for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies (Sections 60F and 60G) 235. As discussed earlier at \[138\] and \[174\], new sections 60C and 60E treat operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers as supplying goods that are actually sold by third party merchants, but only if the goods are destined for a delivery address in New Zealand, and – in the specific case of marketplace operators – if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. 236. In some situations, an electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer may not have the precise information that is required to determine the GST treatment of a supply of goods, as this information may only be available to the underlying supplier and/or the recipient. In these situations, the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer will need to rely on information collected from the underlying supplier or the recipient to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. 62 237. New section 60G sets out a range of methods for redeliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces to use when determining if they are the supplier of distantly taxable goods under section 60C, and/or the amount of GST required to be returned on a supply of distantly taxable goods. These methods (which are all based on information that may be commercially available to redeliverers or operators of electronic marketplaces) are explained below. Electronic marketplaces – methods for determining residency of underlying suppliers 238. An operator of an electronic marketplace that does not know the residency of an underlying supplier 28 is required by section 60G(3) to treat the underlying supplier as a non-resident, unless the marketplace operator has any of the following: • information that the underlying supplier is a company that is incorporated in New Zealand or has its centre of management in New Zealand (see section 60G(3)(b)(i)); • a New Zealand business number for the underlying supplier (see section 60G(3)(b)(ii)); or • at least two of any of the following items of information that support the conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident (see section 60G(3)(b)(iii) and (6)): – an address of a physical location for the underlying supplier, such as a mailing or billing address; – a New Zealand GST registration number for the underlying supplier; – bank details (including the account the underlying supplier uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the underlying supplier); – the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the underlying supplier or another geolocation method; – the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the underlying supplier; – the location of the underlying supplier’s fixed land line; – the location from where the goods are shipped; or – other commercially relevant information. 239. It might be the case that neither of the first two proxies indicate that the underlying supplier is resident in New Zealand, but the evidence under the third proxy is mixed 28 In some cases, a marketplace operator may already know with absolute certainty the residency status of an underlying supplier, or may otherwise have good reasons to consider that the underlying supplier is very unlikely to be a tax resident of New Zealand. In such cases, the marketplace operator will not need to take steps to determine the underlying supplier’s residency status. For example, some marketplaces may only list goods offered for sale by merchants based in a particular geographic region. In other cases, the underlying supplier may be a related entity of the marketplace operator, or there may be publicly available information about the underlying supplier from which a clear conclusion about the tax residency status of the underlying supplier can be drawn (for example, the underlying supplier is a company that was incorporated in New Zealand, and therefore will be a New Zealand resident under the GST Act). 63 (that is, the marketplace operator has more than one set of information listed under section 60G(6), where one set indicates that the underlying supplier is resident in New Zealand and the other set indicates that the underlying supplier is a non-resident). In this situation, the marketplace operator is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Which specific items of evidence are considered to be more reliable will depend on the circumstances. Example 37 – methods for determining residency of underlying supplier Gardening Tools Co. sells a pair of gardening gloves to Maraina over the A Co. marketplace. Maraina provides a New Zealand delivery address at the checkout. A Co. does not have any information that would suggest that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. The mailing and billing address, IP address and bank details that A Co. has for Gardening Tools Co. all suggest that Gardening Tools Co. is resident in the United States. A Co. also has information that the goods are shipped from China. Without there being any information that would lead A Co. to conclude that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand tax resident using any of the three proxies listed under section 60G(3), A Co. is required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a non-resident (meaning that A Co. is responsible for returning GST on supplies made on its marketplace by Gardening Tools Co. to consumers in New Zealand, including the supply of gardening gloves to Maraina). If A Co. had either a New Zealand business number for Gardening Tools Co. or information that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand-incorporated company, A Co. would be required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a New Zealand resident (meaning that A Co. would not be responsible for returning GST on supplies made by Gardening Tools Co). Alternatively, if Gardening Tools Co. had at least two pieces of non-contradictory information listed under section 60G(6) (such as a mailing or billing address or bank details) indicating that Gardening Tools Co. is a New Zealand resident, and did not have two or more pieces of information leading to the opposite conclusion and which are considered to be more reliable, A Co. would be required to treat Gardening Tools Co. as a New Zealand resident. Exception to electronic marketplace rule for underlying suppliers that are both resident and non-resident 240. New section 60C(2C) contains a limited exception to the electronic marketplace rule in section 60C. Section 60C(2C) provides that an operator of an electronic marketplace will not be treated as the supplier of goods sold by a non-resident underlying supplier if all the following conditions are met: • the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident for income tax purposes that has a branch in New Zealand; • the operator of the marketplace treats the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply (meaning that the operator does not return GST on the supply); and • in treating the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident, the operator of the marketplace relies on a method for determining the underlying supplier’s residency that is set out in section 60G, or on an alternative method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner under section 60G(7) (discussed at \[249\]). 241. This exception ensures that the underlying supplier is liable for GST where the marketplace operator has used a section 60G method to determine that it is not the supplier of the goods for GST purposes. 64 Example 38 – non-resident underlying supplier with New Zealand branch treated by marketplace as resident Clothes ‘N’ Stuff Pty Ltd is an Australian-incorporated company that is non-resident for income tax purposes. It sells goods in New Zealand through its retail outlet in Auckland. Because it has a retail outlet in Auckland through which it carries on a taxable activity, Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is treated as a New Zealand resident for GST purposes to the extent of the activity carried on through the Auckland retail outlet and accordingly is registered for GST in New Zealand. Clothes ‘N’ Stuff also sells goods to customers in Australia and New Zealand through the A Co. online marketplace. In most cases the goods are shipped directly from a warehouse in Sydney, but in some cases goods sold to a New Zealand customer may instead be sourced from the retail outlet in Auckland in order to provide faster delivery times. A Co. has on record a New Zealand GST registration number for Clothes ‘N’ Stuff, as well as the physical address of the Auckland retail outlet and the fixed landline number for the Auckland retail outlet. On the basis of the information that it holds and in accordance with the requirements in section 60G, A Co. determines that Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is a New Zealand resident for GST purposes. A Co. therefore does not collect and return GST on Clothes ‘N’ Stuff’s supplies to consumers in New Zealand. Although Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is likely to be a non-resident in relation to most of the supplies it makes through the A Co. marketplace (insofar as this sales activity is unrelated to the Auckland retail outlet), the liability for New Zealand GST on any supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers in New Zealand would remain with Clothes ‘N’ Stuff. This is because section 60C would not apply to treat A Co. as the supplier of the goods (owing to the exception in section 60C(2C)). Electronic marketplaces – proxies for determining if delivery address is in New Zealand 242. While it is expected that operators of electronic marketplaces will generally have information about the delivery address for a supply of goods, there may be some instances where the recipient of the goods does not provide the delivery address through the marketplace but instead communicates with the underlying supplier through another medium. In this situation, the best that an operator of an electronic marketplace may be able to do is to rely on proxies for determining the country or territory that the recipient’s delivery address is most likely to be in, based on the information that it does have. 243. Under section 60G(4) and (6), an electronic marketplace operator that does not know the address to which the goods are to be delivered is required to determine whether a supply of goods is made to the recipient at a place in New Zealand on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence (similar to the rule in section 60G(3)(b)(iii) for determining the residency of an underlying supplier and in section 8B(2) for remote services). 244. Section 60G(6) provides a list of indicators that can be used for these purposes: • an address of a physical location for the recipient, such as a mailing or billing address; • bank details (including the account the recipient uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the recipient, if applicable); 65 • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the recipient or another geolocation method; • the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the SIM card used by the recipient; • the location of the recipient’s fixed land line; • other commercially relevant information. 245. Electronic marketplace operators can use one or more pieces of other commercially relevant information to determine whether a person is located in New Zealand, rather than using the specific indicators listed. This information may include the recipient’s trading history (such as a previous billing address) or the product purchased if it is linked to a geographic location (for example, some vouchers may only be used in a particular country). Information provided by a third party, such as by a payment service provider, may also be used. 246. Section 60G(4)(a)(ii) contains a tie-breaker rule to address the situation where the marketplace operator has more than one set of evidence that meets this test, where one set supports the conclusion that the recipient is located in New Zealand and the other supports the opposite conclusion. In this situat ion, the marketplace operator is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Example 39 – method for determining location of recipient Dave purchases a GPS from an Australian merchant over the Electronic Marketplace Co platform. Dave has not provided his delivery address to the merchant through the Electronic Marketplace Co platform, but instead provided his delivery address to the merchant via email. Electronic Marketplace Co collects two pieces of evidence that support the conclusion that Dave is located in New Zealand – his credit card information and the records of his delivery addresses from his purchase history on Electronic Marketplace Co over the past year. Electronic Marketplace Co also has two pieces of evidence that suggest Dave is located in the United States – his IP address and a landline phone number (the latter of which has not been updated in Dave’s trader profile since 2016). Section 60G(3) requires Electronic Marketplace Co to use the set of evidence that is more reliable to determine whether GST applies in New Zealand. Electronic Marketplace Co has implemented system rules that give priority to its customers’ transaction history and credit card information, as these indicators are more reliable in the context of their business. On this basis, Electronic Marketplace Co charges New Zealand GST on the supply. Redeliverers – default method for determining estimated customs value of goods 247. Section 60G(5) contains a default rule for redeliverers to determine the estimated customs value of goods that they bring or assist in bringing to New Zealand. The default rule applies to a redeliverer who is not responsible for the purchase of goods that it brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand in its capacity as a redeliverer. This rule requires the redeliverer to: • prior to the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand, obtain a declaration from the recipient of the amount paid for the goods; and 66 • obtain a receipt or invoice issued by the merchant or other confirmation by the merchant of the amount paid for the goods. 248. The second requirement above is not intended to require the redeliverer to have any interaction with the merchant who sold the goods. If the merchant has included an invoice in the package in which the goods were shipped to the redeliverer, checking the amount of consideration shown on the invoice against the amount declared by the recipient would be sufficient to satisfy the second requirement. Similarly, this requirement would also be met if the redeliverer requires the recipient to provide the receipt or invoice issued by the merchant. Commissioner discretion to agree or prescribe alternative methods 249. In some instances, a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace may not have sufficient commercially available information to apply the default methods described above. In other cases, another potential method for determining the GST treatment which is not covered by the default rules may be more reliable than the default method, or may reduce compliance costs without resulting in a material under- or overpayment of GST. 250. To provide more flexibility, new section 60G(7) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe or agree to methods for marketplace operators and redeliverers to make conclusions relevant to whether they are treated by section 60C or 60E as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, and/or determine the amount of GST payable. 251. An agreement with the Commissioner under section 60G(7) may cover requirements for the amount of information that the marketplace operator or redeliverer is required to obtain, as well as methods for checking the accuracy of the information and the conclusio ns drawn fro m the informat ion. 252. Allowing the Commissioner to prescribe or agree on alternative methods minimises compliance costs for marketplace operators and redeliverers while also assuring Inland Revenue that the methods used to determine the GST treatment of supplies broadly achieve the correct result. The intention is not that marketplace operators and redeliverers should have to collect extra information beyond what is already commercially available to them under their existing business processes. To the extent possible, an agreed or prescribed method should instead be based on information that is already collected by the person under existing commercial arrangements, and/or on processes that are to some extent already part of the person’s existing business practices. Information that should be included in an application for an alternative method 253. Section 60G(8) allows the Commissioner to take the following factors into account when exercising the discretion: • Commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator or redeliverer and the reliability of this information. • Compliance costs of the marketplace operator or redeliverer in complying with the requirements of the default method. 67 • The existing mechanisms the marketplace operator or redeliverer has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. 254. Ideally, an application for an agreed method would briefly cover all the points listed above, along with an explanation of why the proposed method is fair and reasonable. Specifically, the application would ideally outline how the proposed method reflects the outcome that would be reached under the default method – or, if the alternative method is being proposed because it is considered more reliable than the default method, why it is more reliable than the default method. 255. For example, a redeliverer may wish to rely on the value declared by the recipient rather than being required in all cases to obtain an invoice or receipt issued by the merchant to confirm the value of the goods. In this case, the application for an agreed method would ideally include some analysis showing that the outcome reached by relying on the value declared by the recipient is not materially different from the outcome that would be obtained if documentation issued by the merchant was instead used to confirm the value. 256. Alternatively, an application by a redeliverer might propose some mechanisms for preventing and (to the extent feasible) correcting any mistakes arising from undervaluation by consumers. What can feasibly be done in terms o f discouraging or identifying undervaluation will be dependent on the redeliverer’s business processes, which would be taken into account by the Commissioner when considering the proposed method. Liability for GST if person has relied on a section 60G method 257. Under new section 60F, a marketplace operator or redeliverer that has relied on a default method set out in section 60G (or that has a safe harbour agreement with the Commissioner under section 60G(7)), cannot be held liable for GST that should have been returned if they have underpaid GST to Inland Revenue solely as a result of relying on incorrect or misleading information provided by another party. 258. Section 60F applies when a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace returns a deficient amount of output tax for a taxable period as a consequence of relying on inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the recipient of a supply of goods or by the merchant or underlying supplier of the goods. 259. In this situation, section 60F(2) provides that the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has a reduction in its total output tax allocated to the relevant taxable period that is equal to the amount of the deficiency, provided that the requirements of section 60G are met. 260. This means that in the situation where the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has relied on information provided by a third party and discovers there is a shortfall in the amount of output tax returned, the marketplace operator or redeliverer would not be liable to account for the output tax shortfall – provided that the reliance on information provided by a third party was in good faith and on reasonable grounds (see section 60G(1)(c)) and, if applicable, is consistent with a method prescribed in the legislation or agreed with the Commissioner. 68 Example 40 – agreed method for determining residency of underlying suppliers A Co. is a marketplace operator, whose underlying suppliers may be resident in New Zealand or in other countries. A Co. agrees with the Commissioner on the method it will use to determine the residency of underlying suppliers, based on the information that is commercially available. As part of the agreement, A Co. has governance mechanisms to prevent mistakes, which include: • deploying technology to detect when underlying suppliers provide incorrect information relevant to their residency; • educating underlying suppliers on the consequences of providing incorrect information (which include tax penalties that may apply); • taking actions to remove the underlying supplier from its marketplace where incorrect information has been provided, if necessary; and • in agreed circumstances where a significant amount of tax is at stake, providing information to the Commissioner about underlying suppliers that have provided incorrect information, to allow the Commissioner to use her powers to collect GST from the underlying supplier. This agreement means that A Co. can rely on certain information to support conclusions that it is not responsible for GST on a supply because the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident. If it is later discovered that the underlying supplier is not a New Zealand resident, A Co. will not be exposed to additional GST liability (as the amount of the output tax reduction given under section 60F(2) would offset the amount of output tax that should have been returned). Example 41 – agreement allowing redeliverer to rely on value declared by recipient Redeliverer Co. is a redeliverer which provides a US postal address to consumers in New Zealand and brings goods from US merchants to New Zealand. The US merchant is unaware that the consumer has engaged Redeliverer Co to bring the goods to New Zealand. Redeliverer Co charges a facilitation fee to the consumer based on the weight and size of the parcel. The receipt issued by the US merchant to the recipient is generally not a piece of information that is commercially available to Redeliverer Co, unless it asks for proof of the value of the goods because the recipient is also purchasing insurance. Rather than changing its systems to require a receipt to be submitted, Redeliverer Co agrees with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that it can use the amount declared by the customer to determine how much GST to collect from the consumer, provided that it puts certain governance mechanisms in place to prevent mistakes. Such mechanisms may include the following: • Warning recipients about the consequences of undervaluing goods, including penalties that may apply under the tax legislation and under the Customs and Excise legislation. • Using the value on a receipt from the merchant if this is commercially available (for example, where it is included with the goods when they arrive at Redeliverer Co’s warehouse in the US or when provided by the recipient if they buy insurance). • Taking a random sample of goods regularly to identify any undervaluation, and correct it if possible. • In agreed circumstances where a significant amount of tax is at stake, providing information to the Commissioner about consumers that have underdeclared values, to allow the Commissioner to use her powers to collect GST from the consumer. 69 Reliance on other types of information resulting in underpayment of GST 261. In some cases, information that a marketplace operator or redeliverer might use to determine the GST treatment of a supply of goods may be completely unrelated to the residency of an underlying supplier and the delivery address for the supply (if the supply is made through an electronic marketplace) or the amount paid by the recipient for the goods (if the goods are brought to New Zealand by a redeliverer). 262. In situations where reliance on such information results in the marketplace operator or redeliverer underpaying GST, the marketplace operator or redeliverer will be relieved from the liability to return and pay the output tax that should have been paid if the reliance on information provided by the third party was in good faith and on reasonable grounds. Example 42 – misclassification of item by underlying supplier resulting in treatment as exempt supply An item of gold jewellery is listed for sale on the A Co. marketplace. On the basis of the classification of the item by the underlying supplier, A Co. is led to believe that the item is fine metal as defined in section 2(1), and concludes that the supply of the item is exempt from GST. However, it turns out that the item is not fine metal, and therefore GST should have been returned on the supply. Section 60F applies to relieve A Co. from being required to return output tax on the supply, provided that A Co. has relied on the information in good faith and on reasonable grounds (meaning that A Co. did not know that the information relied on was incorrect, nor could have reasonably been expected to know the information was incorrect). Generally speaking, a marketplace operator that does not actually have the goods could not reasonably be expected to know if the classification of an item of gold jewellery by an underlying supplier as “fine metal” is incorrect. However, if a marketplace operator was aware that a particular underlying supplier had a history of misclassifying items for sale, then this may affect whether the marketplace operator had relied on the information on reasonable grounds. Example 43 – reliance on information by marketplace operator not on reasonable grounds DG Book Supplies, a non-resident supplier, sells some university textbooks to Jan (a consumer providing a New Zealand delivery address) over the A Co. marketplace. DG tells A Co. that supplies of educational books are zero-rated for New Zealand GST purposes, which A Co. relies on when determining the GST treatment of the supply to Jan. It is later discovered that the supply to Jan should have been treated as standard-rated (subject to GST at the rate of 15%) and that, as a consequence of relying on the incorrect information provided by DG, A Co. has underpaid GST to Inland Revenue. A Co. does not have a reduction in its output tax under section 60F(2), as it should have known that the information provided by DG was not reliable. A Co. is therefore required to return and pay 3/23 of the consideration for the supply as output tax to Inland Revenue. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of remote services) (Sections 8(4B), 20(4D) and 25AA) 263. An amendment to the reverse charge rule in section 8(4B) will require GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods (that are treated by section 8(4E) as not being 70 supplies in New Zealand) to return output tax if the percentage of intended or actual taxable use of the goods is less than 95 percent of the total use. 264. The amendment also extends the reverse charge to business-to-business supplies of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply (which are treated by section 8(4) as not being supplied in New Zealand). 29 Example 44 – application of reverse charge to distantly taxable goods Melissa is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a phone from a non-resident supplier for NZ$400. At the time of purchase, she identifies herself as a GST- registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the phone fifty percent for her taxable project management services and fifty percent for private use. Under the reverse charge, Melissa is treated as making a taxable supply to herself of NZ$400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of NZ$60 (NZ$400 × 15%). If Melissa’s taxable use of the phone had been 95 percent or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. 265. An exception (amended section 20(4D)) to the prohibition on input tax deductions in section 20(4C) allows a recipient of distantly taxable goods, that is required to return output tax under the reverse charge, to claim a deduction of input tax (GST paid on goods and services purchased) to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example 45 – input tax on goods subject to the reverse charge Consider Example 44 where Melissa acquires a phone from a non-resident supplier for NZ$400. Melissa can claim an input tax deduction for the portion of her total use of the phone that is for taxable purposes (fifty percent). The amount of the input tax deduction is NZ$30 (NZ$60 of GST × fifty percent). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of NZ$30 (NZ$60 output tax minus NZ$30 input tax). Reverse charge for supplies of NZ$1,000 or less 266. There may be instances when a GST-registered recipient applies the reverse charge and the non-resident supplier also inadvertently charges the recipient GST. In this situation, GST would be returned twice on a single supply (by the non-resident supplier and the GST-registered recipient). This issue will likely be resolved if the non-resident supplier subsequently refunds the GST charged to the GST-registered recipient and makes an adjustment under section 25 as described previously. Note that an adjustment may still be necessary under section 25AA(1)(a)(iii) to ensure the correct amount of tax is accounted for under the reverse charge in section 8(4B). 29 As this amendment has been inadvertently drafted too widely, officials will seek to include a retrospective amendment in a future taxation bill so that the reverse charge (as it applies to goods) only applies to goods imported by the recipient of the supply in a consignment valued below NZ$1,000, where the recipient did not pay GST to Customs nor to the supplier. A savings provision to protect tax positions taken on the basis of the amendment would be optional for taxpayers to apply. 71 267. To ensure the correct amount of tax is paid in the alternative scenario where the supplier provides a tax invoice under section 24(5B), existing section 25AA would allow the GST-registered recipient to correct the amount of output tax returned and input tax deductions claimed. The recipient would then be able to claim, in the normal manner, a deduction for the portion of the GST that was charged by the non-resident supplier, to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example 46 – supplier inadvertently charges GST on supply to registered person and recipient applies the reverse charge Consider the earlier example again, where Melissa has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). However, she subsequently finds out that the price for the phone included GST at the standard rate of 15% (3/23 × NZ$400 = NZ$52.17). Melissa contacts the non-resident supplier and requests a refund for the incorrectly charged GST. Instead of providing a refund, the supplier issues Melissa with a full tax invoice, since the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less. The tax invoice enables Melissa to claim an input tax deduction to the extent the phone is used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies, which means she can deduct NZ$26.09. The non-resident supplier is also not required to make any adjustments under section 25. Under section 25AA(1)(a)(v), Melissa makes an adjustment in the return for the taxable period in which it is discovered that a mistake has been made to correct the amount of output tax and input tax deductions claimed as a result of applying the reverse charge in section 8(4B). Melissa claims a deduction under section 20(3) for the output tax that she accounted for (NZ$60 – section 25AA(2)) and returns output tax for the input tax deduction she claimed earlier (NZ$30 – section 25AA(3)). Administration of the supplier registration system (Sections 5(27), (28), 15(7), 51B(7), 51B(8) and 75(3F) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Sections 24BA(1B) and 143A(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Taxable periods 268. Under amended section 15(6), non-resident suppliers that only supply distantly taxable goods and/or remote services will have calendar quarterly taxable periods (1 April to 30 June, 1 July to 30 September, 1 October to 31 December, and 1 January to 31 March). This is intended to align with these suppliers’ filing obligations in other jurisdictions. 269. However, for the period beginning 1 December 2019 to 31 March 2020, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods will have a taxable period of four months (see new section 15(7)). This init ial four-month taxable period will apply to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that become liable to register for GST in the period 1 December to 31 December 2019 – including non-residents who also supply remote services to New Zealand-resident consumers but did not register for GST before 1 December 2019 due to being below the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. 72 Commissioner discretion to agree alternative taxable period end date 270. Section 15E(2) provides that a supplier may apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to have an alternative taxable period end date. Under this provision, the Commissioner may approve an end date that is not more than seven days before or after the last day of a month. Example 47 – alternative taxable period end date Retro Audio is registered for GST as a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods and, from 1 April 2020, will be required to have quarterly taxable periods. Retro Audio does an accounting cut off on 29 March, 28 June, 28 September and 30 December. These accounting periods are all quarters but do not end on the last day of the typical calendar quarter, and it would be expensive for Retro Audio to re-run periods outside of this accounting cycle. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue approves Retro Audio to have an initial four-month taxable period of 1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020, and from 30 March 2020, the following quarterly taxable periods on an ongoing basis: • 30 March to 28 June; • 29 June to 28 September; • 29 September to 30 December; and • 31 December to 29 March. Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English 271. Currently, a GST-registered person must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Amended section 75(3F) provides an automatic exception to this requirement for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods or remote services that are subject to GST under either section 8(3)(ab) or (c). Exception from the bank account requirement 272. Section 24BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 generally requires an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. However, subsection (1B) provides an exception to this requirement for a non-resident supplier who requires an IRD number solely because they are a non- resident supplier of goods and services. Consumers and underlying suppliers providing false or misleading information 273. Sections 5(27), 5(28), 51B(7) and 51B(8) provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with discretion to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged, when: • the person (being the recipient of the supply or a non-resident underlying supplier) knowingly provides altered, false or misleading information which has resulted in GST being underpaid; and • the amount of GST is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 73 274. In the situation where a consumer provides false or misleading information that results in an underpayment of GST, section 5(27) only applies if the consumer made the misrepresentation with the purpose of avoiding being charged GST or to reduce the amount of GST charged. 275. In addition to the situations where a consumer makes a misrepresentation to a non- resident merchant, marketplace operator or redeliverer, or where a non-resident underlying supplier makes a misrepresentation to a non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace, the provisions cover the situation where a consumer or a non- resident underlying supplier deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information to a New Zealand-resident resident agent, redeliverer or marketplace operator. 276. In cases where discretion is exercised by the Commissioner to require the consumer or underlying supplier to register and pay the GST shortfall, section 5(27)(b)(iii) and (28) set out that the consumer or underlying supplier would be treated as making a supply charged with GST at the rate of 15%. Under amended section 51B, the person is treated as being registered from the date on which the first supply the discretion is exercised for is made (see subsections (7) and (8)). 277. The existing “knowledge offences” also apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business or as a resident of another country (section 143A(1)(c) and (g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. Example 48 – consumer makes misrepresentation that they are registered for GST Luke purchases a number of distantly taxable goods and remote services online, including clothing, nutritional supplements, online dating services, music and movie content. Luke is not registered for GST. To avoid paying GST, Luke continually informs suppliers he is GST registered and provides suppliers with a false GST registration number. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to register Luke from the time the first supply of goods was made or the services were physically performed (whichever is earlier), and requires him to pay the GST that was not charged, plus penalties and interest. Remote services – consumer misrepresents residency status or location 278. Section 5(27)(a) has been amended so that it may apply in the situation where a consumer purchasing a remote service deliberately provides false, altered or misleading information pertaining to his or her location or residency status to avoid being charged GST. Under the former drafting of section 5(27)(a), the provision only applied in the situation where a consumer made a misrepresentation that they were registered for GST in order to avoid having GST charged. 279. If a customer has provided incorrect or misleading information to access content that is geographically restricted, and this consequentially results in GST not being charged, the reverse charge rule in section 5(27) and the existing knowledge offences would not be expected to apply. However, in cases where it is clear that the person made the 74 misrepresentation to avoid being charged GST, the amendment to section 5(27)(a) means that the Commissioner will be able to exercise her discretion to require the person to pay GST if the amount of GST at stake is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. Interaction with safe harbour rules for electronic marketplaces and redeliverers 280. Where distantly taxable goods are treated by section 60C or 60E as having been supplied by an electronic marketplace operator or a redeliverer, the Commissioner’s discretion to require the underlying supplier or the consumer to pay the GST shortfall will only apply if the marketplace operator or redeliverer used a method set out in section 60G or a method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner under section 60G(7). 281. This is intended to ensure there is a clear hierarchy where the marketplace operator or redeliverer is the supplier for GST purposes, and therefore incentivises the person to take reasonable precautions to prevent an incorrect GST treatment from arising. 282. Unlike section 5(27), new section 5(28) (which applies to an underlying supplier providing incorrect or misleading information to an operator of an electronic marketplace) does not require the incorrect information to have been provided for the purpose of avoiding GST applying to the supply. This is because the underlying supplier’s intention may be difficult to establish in practice. Example 49 – non-resident underlying supplier makes misrepresentation that they are resident in New Zealand Jave Dordan, a non-resident underlying supplier on the NZ Marketplace website, deliberately provides false information about himself (including using a VPN to fake a New Zealand IP address, providing a false mailing address in New Zealand and falsely stating that the goods are shipped from New Zealand) with the intention of misleading potential customers in New Zealand. The fact that NZ Marketplace will not charge GST on the supply as a result of Jave’s deception is not Jave’s primary objective in making the misrepresentations, but is merely a secondary benefit from Jave’s perspective. After a crackdown on non-resident underlying suppliers misrepresenting themselves as New Zealand businesses, NZ Marketplace discovers that Jave is not a New Zealand tax resident but is in fact a non-resident. As NZ Marketplace previously had no knowledge of Jave’s residency status and had relied in good faith on the information provided by Jave in accordance with the methods prescribed in section 60G(3) to determine Jave’s residency status, NZ Marketplace will not be liable to return GST on supplies made by Jave to consumers in New Zealand prior to Jave’s dishonesty being discovered. NZ Marketplace has an agreement with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that it will provide the Commissioner with the details of underlying suppliers that misrepresent their location or residency status resulting in a significant amount of tax being underpaid. NZ Marketplace provides Inland Revenue with information about Jave, including the value and volume of sales made by Jave on NZ Marketplace. As Jave has deliberately misrepresented his residency status over a long period of time, resulting in a substantial amount of GST due not being returned to Inland Revenue, the Commissioner registers Jave for GST, makes an assessment of the GST due and requires Jave to pay the GST that should have been returned. The fact that Jave did not make the misrepresentations with the purpose of avoiding having GST charged on his sales has no impact on the Commissioner’s ability to apply her discretion. 75 Optional rules aimed at reducing costs for suppliers (Sections 8(4F), 10C, 20(3L), 20(3LB) and 85C) Claiming GST deductions for New Zealand expenses 283. Special rules applying to non-resident businesses that do not make any supplies in New Zealand were introduced in 2014 to allow these businesses to claim refunds of GST incurred on business expenses. For the purposes of claiming input tax (GST on purchases), a deduction rule in section 20(3L) allows non-resident businesses registered under section 54B to claim back input tax relating to their worldwide taxable activity (for example, GST incurred in sending employees to a conference in New Zealand). 284. Section 20(3L) has been amended to allow non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and remote services to claim back New Zealand GST incurred on business expenses. 285. Amended section 20(3L) provides that a non-resident person who is registered under section 54B or who is a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services may deduct input tax to the extent to which the relevant goods and services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies, treating all the supplies made by the person as if they were made and received in New Zealand \[emphasis added\]. 286. This means non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and remote services that have registered under the standard GST registration system as a “pay and claim” registrant will be able to deduct GST they have paid on business inputs sourced from New Zealand suppliers, without being required to “trace” the use of these inputs to making taxable supplies to consumers in New Zealand. 287. This will generally enable these suppliers to deduct GST incurred on inputs used in making supplies to other non-residents or to GST-registered New Zealand businesses. However, input tax cannot be deducted to the extent that the relevant inputs are applied to a private (rather than business) use or are used in making supplies that would be exempt if those supplies were made and received in New Zealand (such as supplies of financial services). Attribution rule for GST paid to Customs 288. A special “attribution rule” will apply in the situation where a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods or remote services imports goods into New Zealand for delivery to another person in New Zealand and pays GST to Customs on the importation of the goods. In this situation, amended section 20(3LB) provides that subsection (3LC) will treat the recipient of the goods as having paid the import GST to Customs, and the non-resident supplier as not having paid the GST to Customs. This prevents the non-resident supplier from being able to make an input tax deduction for the GST paid to Customs. 289. The attribution rule will only apply in the situation where the goods are delivered to a person in New Zealand other than the supplier. If the supplier is the person in New 76 Zealand who receives the goods and is not delivering the goods to another person in New Zealand, the supplier will be able to make an input tax deduction for the GST paid to Customs. Example 50 – application of the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) where the non-resident supplier pays the import GST Gordon buys an NZ$1,200 bicycle from Moving Parts, a non-resident bicycle and cycling accessories shop that is registered for GST in New Zealand under the rules for distantly taxable goods. Moving Parts supply the bicycle to Gordon on delivered-duty-paid terms, so that they pay the GST to Customs on Gordon’s behalf. Under the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC), Moving Parts is not able to claim an input tax deduction for the import GST paid to Customs. 290. The attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) aims to prevent non-taxation, which would arise if a non-resident making a non-taxable supply of imported goods to a consumer in New Zealand claimed an input tax deduction for the GST paid on importation of the goods to Customs. The following example illustrates this scenario. Example 51 – non-taxation where non-resident supplies high-value imported goods to consumer and pays the import GST Consider the scenario in the previous example, except this time assume that the attribution rule in section 20(3LB) and (3LC) does not exist. The supply of the bicycle by Moving Parts to Gordon is not a taxable supply, as the bicycle is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is not an item of distantly taxable goods (because the estimated customs value of the bicycle is NZ$1,200 and Moving Parts has not made the election to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, discussed later in this special report). Gordon paid NZ$50 to Moving Parts for freight and insurance of the bicycle. Moving Parts pays import GST to Customs of NZ$187.50 (15% of the full landed value of the goods, being NZ$1,250). Moving Parts claims an input tax deduction in its GST return of NZ$187.50 for the import GST under section 20(3L), resulting in non-taxation of a supply to a consumer in New Zealand. Pre-existing zero-rating of supplies of remote services to GST-registered businesses 291. Section 11A(1)(x) – which has applied since the start of the GST on remote services rules in October 2016 – currently allows non-resident suppliers to zero-rate their supplies of remote services to GST-registered New Zealand businesses. This allows non-resident remote services suppliers to claim back GST on inputs used for making supplies to GST-registered businesses. 292. Section 11A(1)(x) has been retained as a legacy provision, so that non-resident suppliers of remote services who are accustomed to zero-rating these supplies and wish to continue what they are doing at present may do so. However, if they wish to, non- resident suppliers of remote services can use the input tax deduction rule in section 20(3L) as an alternative to zero-rating their business-to-business supplies of remote services. 77 Option to charge GST on high-value goods 293. Distinguishing between low-value goods (items individually having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less) and high-value goods (items with an estimated customs value above NZ$1,000) may create complexity for suppliers. To minimise compliance costs, suppliers who are required under the new rules to charge GST on low-value goods supplied to consumers in New Zealand will be able to elect to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable if certain conditions are met. These requirements are outlined below. Self-assessed 75 percent test – reasonable grounds requirement 294. New section 10C provides that a supplier (referred to in the section as the “electing supplier”) may elect to treat goods that individually have an estimated customs value exceeding NZ$1,000 as distantly taxable goods if all the following conditions are met: • the Commissioner has not before the date the election is made by the supplier cancelled a previous election by the supplier to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable goods (see subsection (1)(a)); • the supplier notifies the Commissioner of the election before the start of the first taxable period that it is intended to be effective for (see subsection (1)(b)); and • at the time of the election, there are reasonable grounds for believing that 75 percent or more of the total value of distantly taxable goods that the supplier will supply in the 12-month period, starting on the first day that the supplier intends the election to be effective for, will consist of items having an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less (see subsection (2)(a)). 295. The “reasonable grounds” test described above implicitly requires an electing supplier to firstly assume that it will have made an effective election for the initial year – meaning that for the purposes of determining whether the 75 percent threshold is met, the supplier should include high-value goods supplied to customers in New Zealand (both consumers and GST-registered businesses) in the “total value of distantly taxable goods supplied by the electing supplier to places in New Zealand”. 296. Having made the above starting assumption, the test then requires the electing supplier to determine whether it is reasonable to believe that the total value of its low-value goods supplied to customers in New Zealand during the 12-month period will be at least 75 percent of the total value of the distantly taxable goods that it will supply in the initial year. 297. The reasonable grounds requirement referred to above means different things for different types of electing suppliers: • For an electing supplier who is a merchant, or an electing supplier who is a redeliverer treated by section 60E as the supplier of low-value goods that it brings to New Zealand: The reasonable grounds requirement means the electing supplier has a reasonable belief that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods that it will bring (or assist in bringing) to New Zealand in the initial year of the election will consist of items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 78 • For an electing supplier who is an operator of a marketplace (and who is treated by either of sections 60C or 60D as the supplier of low-value goods sold through its marketplace by non-resident underlying suppliers): The reasonable grounds requirement above means the marketplace operator has a reasonable belief that 75 percent or more of the total value of goods that would be purchased on the marketplace in the initial year of the election, and supplied by non-resident underlying suppliers to customers in New Zealand, will consist of items that individually have an estimated customs value of NZ$1,000 or less. 298. In either case, the electing supplier should not include alcohol or tobacco products for the purposes of assessing whether the 75 percent test is met. Example 52 – merchant making election under self-assessed 75 percent test Big Ben’s Bikes, an online British bike, bike parts and bike accessories store, sells and ships goods from its warehouse in London to customers around the world. Big Ben’s Bikes wishes to treat its high value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers as distantly taxable from the start of their first taxable period, being 1 December 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes sold £78,000 worth of low-value imported goods to customers in New Zealand in the year 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes also sold £22,000 worth of high-value imported goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, 78 percent of the total value of goods that Big Ben’s Bikes sold to customers in New Zealand that year consisted of goods individually valued at or below NZ$1,000. This percentage is typical of Big Ben’s Bikes’ annual sales to New Zealand customers (in previous years, Big Ben’s Bikes’ sales of goods valued at or below NZ$1,000 as a proportion of its total sales to New Zealand customers have been within the range of 76 percent to 80 percent). Based on this historical information and without any information to suggest that this percentage is likely to be less than 75 percent for the 12-month period beginning 1 December 2019, it is reasonable to assume that Big Ben’s Bikes meets the 75 percent test. On this basis, Big Ben’s Bikes self-assesses that it is eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on supplies of high-value goods under the self-assessed test. Example 53 – marketplace operator making election under self-assessed 75 percent test A Co. is an operator of an electronic marketplace who wishes to make the election to charge GST on high-value goods supplied by non-residents through its marketplace. Data from previous years shows that, low-value goods make up well over 80 percent of the total value of goods sold by non-resident underlying suppliers on the A Co. marketplace to customers in New Zealand (including goods that are shipped from a location within New Zealand if A Co. has determined that the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident). A Co. has no reason to expect that this percentage will drop below 75 percent for the period 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. On this basis, A Co. determines that they are eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on supplies of high-value goods under the self-assessed test. 79 Example 54 – redeliverer making election under self-assessed 75 percent test Redeliverer Co. wishes to make the election under section 10C to charge GST on the high-value goods they bring to New Zealand from overseas. Based on data from previous years, Redeliverer Co. estimates that approximately 90 percent of the value of the goods that they brought to New Zealand in a typical year (including any amounts for freight and insurance charged by the overseas merchant) consisted of low-value goods. Redeliverer Co. has a reasonable expectation that they will easily exceed the 75 percent threshold for the 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020 year. Redeliverer Co determines that they are eligible to make the election and notifies Inland Revenue that they will be charging GST on high-value goods under the self-assessed test. 299. Suppliers making the election under the self-assessed test will need to notify Inland Revenue. Operators of marketplaces that decide to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods will also need to let their underlying suppliers know (as some non- resident underlying suppliers might already be returning GST on their sales if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply). 300. An electing supplier who is a non-resident that is not already registered for GST in New Zealand may notify Inland Revenue of the election by answering “yes” to the question in the IR994 registration form about whether they intend to make the election to charge GST on high-value goods and meet the 75 percent test. 301. An electing supplier that is already registered for GST (under the ordinary GST rules or under the GST rules applying to remote services) may notify Inland Revenue of the election by emailing info.lvg@ird.govt.nz with “Election” in the subject line of the email. Commissioner discretion to allow suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods 302. Section 10C(2)(b) provides that the Commissioner may allow a supplier to make an election to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, even if the self- assessed 75 percent test outlined above is not met. 303. The Commissioner will exercise this discretion if she considers that doing so will not undermine the integrity of the tax system, taking the following factors into account: • whether the electing supplier and any associated persons have a good history of previous compliance with New Zealand tax legislation and the tax laws of countries and territories outside New Zealand; • the total value of high-value goods supplied by the electing supplier to New Zealand consumers; and • any other relevant factors. 304. The ability for the Commissioner to allow suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods supplied to consumers recognises that the costs to a supplier in configuring their point-of-sale systems to distinguish between low-value and high-value goods may be disproportionate to any potential revenue risk from allowing the supplier to charge GST on high-value goods (effectively replacing the collection of GST on these goods by Customs), even if the 75 percent test is not met. 80 305. In this situation, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to allow the supplier to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the supplier has a good tax compliance history. Alternatively, if the supplier does not have a tax compliance history that the Commissioner is aware of, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise the discretion if the value of the supplier’s sales of high-value imported goods to consumers in New Zealand is not significant. 306. In practice, there will be a general presumption in favour of exercising the discretion unless there is information available to Inland Revenue which suggests that allowing a particular supplier to charge GST on its high-value goods may result in a revenue risk. Example 55 – exercise of Commissioner’s discretion Dapper Menswear is a non-resident supplier of designer European menswear. Dapper Menswear wishes to treat their supplies of high-value goods to consumers in New Zealand as distantly taxable, and intends that this election be effective from the start of their first taxable period, being 1 December 2019. Dapper Menswear undertakes some analysis of the composition of their sales to customers in New Zealand over the past year. They find that they sold NZ$70,000 worth of low-value goods to customers in New Zealand in the past year. They also sold NZ$30,000 worth of high-value goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, only 70 percent of Dapper Menswear’s supplies of goods in that year were low-value goods. Given that Dapper Menswear expects the composition of its sales to New Zealand customers to be much the same in the period 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020, Dapper Menswear does not have a reasonable expectation that the 75 percent test will be met. Dapper Menswear applies to the Commissioner to be allowed to charge GST on their supplies of high-value goods. In considering the application, the Commissioner looks at whether Dapper Menswear (including any associated entities) has a compliance history for New Zealand tax purposes and finds there is none. However, according to information that the Commissioner has obtained under double tax agreements from overseas jurisdictions that have similar rules, Dapper Menswear has registered for VAT/GST in those other jurisdictions. There is no evidence available to the Commissioner to suggest that Dapper Menswear is not fully compliant with the tax laws in those other jurisdictions, so the Commissioner does not consider that Dapper Menswear poses any significant compliance risk. Further, the total value of supplies of high-value goods made to New Zealand customers annually by Dapper Menswear (approximately NZ$30,000) is relatively small. On this basis, the Commissioner exercises her discretion to allow Dapper Menswear to make the election to charge GST on supplies of high- value goods to consumers. Cancellation of election 307. Under section 10C(2), an election to treat high-value goods as distantly taxable is effective from the first day of the initial taxable period that the supplier intends the election to be effective for until the election is cancelled. 308. Cancellation of an election may be initiated upon request by the supplier or, if certain conditions are met, the Commissioner may unilaterally cancel a supplier’s election. 309. If a supplier who has made an election requests that the election be cancelled, new section 10C(5)(a) provides that the Commissioner may cancel the election by notifying the supplier of the date on which the election ends. 81 310. In the situation where the Commissioner unilaterally cancels an election by a supplier (in cases of non-compliance by the supplier), section 10C(5)(b) provides that the Commissio ner is required to: • notify the electing supplier of the date of the proposed cancellation and the reasons for the proposed cancellation; • consider any arguments against the proposed cancellation that are provided by the electing supplier within 30 days from the date of notification, or within a shorter or longer period if the Commissioner considers that period is appropriate in the circumstances; and • notify the supplier of the date on which the election is cancelled. Option to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses 311. Under new section 8(4F), a non-resident supplier will be able to elect to treat a supply of distantly taxable goods to a GST-registered business as a supply made in New Zealand, provided that: • at the time of the election, the non-resident supplier reasonably expects that more than 50 percent of the value of the supplies they make to customers in New Zealand during the 12-month period from the election will be made to persons who are not GST-registered; and • the value of the supply (excluding GST) is NZ$1,000 or less. 312. Under new section 24(5BB), a non-resident supplier is required to provide a tax invoice if the supplier has chosen to apply section 8(4F) to the supply so that the supply is treated as made in New Zealand. 30 313. These amendments are aimed at allowing non-resident suppliers to simply charge GST on low-value supplies (regardless of the business-to-consumer or business-to-business nature of the supply) and issue a tax invoice to the customer at the time of supply or shortly after. As discussed earlier at \[198\] to \[201\], non-resident suppliers exercising this option will be able to issue a single document that meets the requirements of both a full tax invoice and a receipt required under section 24BAB to be issued to a consumer for a supply of distantly taxable goods. Relationship with rule in section 24(5B) 314. While non-resident suppliers are able to choose to provide a tax invoice for a supply of distantly taxable goods under section 24(5B) if the value of the supply is NZ$1,000 or less, this only applies in the situation where GST is inadvertently charged on the supply – meaning that the tax invoice would be issued to the recipient following a request for a tax invoice or a refund of the GST (as opposed to the supplier being able to proactively issue the recipient with a tax invoice in anticipation of the possibilit y that the recipient may be GST-registered). 30 Although the intention is that the tax invoice issued by the supplier should meet the requirements of a full tax invoice, the legislation as enacted does not require this. Officials will seek to include an amendment to section 24(4)(g) in a future tax bill so that a tax invoice issued under new section 24(5BB) is required to be a full tax invoice, consistent with the rule in section 24(5B). 82 315. Therefore, the ability to elect to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST-registered businesses may reduce compliance costs for both non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods and New Zealand businesses making low-value purchases from these suppliers, as the GST-registered recipient would be able to use the tax invoice to support an input tax deduction without needing to interact with the supplier any further. 316. Given the amendments allow non-resident suppliers to charge GST on low-value supplies and issue a tax invoice to the customer at the time of supply if they decide that works best for them, there is no requirement for the non-resident supplier to inform Inland Revenue of the election or to keep records that the election was made. The amendments merely validate the supplier’s treatment of a low-value supply in the situation where the supplier has charged GST and proactively issued a tax invoice, and it transpires that the supply was to a GST-registered business using the goods in its taxable activity. 317. Consistent with the rule in section 24(5B), if the value of the supply exceeds NZ$1,000, the non-resident supplier should not issue a tax invoice, and the recipient of the supply will not be entitled to make an input tax deduction. This means that, if the value of the supply is above NZ$1,000, the receipt or invoice issued to the recipient should not include the phrase “tax invoice”. In this situation, the supplier’s only option is to refund the GST charged, if it transpires that GST was charged on a supply to a GST-registered business using the goods and services in its taxable activity. Example 56 – non-resident supplier elects to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST- registered businesses under section 8(4F) Good Books is an online book retailer resident in Hong Kong. Good Books is registered for GST in New Zealand as a supplier of distantly taxable goods to consumers. Good Books’ sales to customers in New Zealand total around NZ$10 million a year, excluding GST, of which it estimates that around NZ$2 million a year are to GST-registered businesses. Based on this historical average of around 80 percent of the value of its sales to New Zealand customers being to persons who are not registered for GST (which Good Books expects will continue going forward), Good Books has a reasonable expectation that more than 50 percent of the value of the sales it will make to customers in New Zealand in the next 12 months will be to customers who are not GST-registered. Good Books sells two books valued at NZ$40 each (excluding GST) to a customer providing a delivery address in New Zealand and charges NZ$20 plus GST for shipping. As the estimated customs value of each item (NZ$40) is less than NZ$1,000, Good Books determines that the supply is of distantly taxable goods and charges GST of NZ$15, based on the value of the supply of NZ$100 (2 books at NZ$40 each + NZ$20 shipping = NZ$100, 15% of NZ$100 = NZ$15). In the event that the supply is to a GST-registered business, Good Books intends that the goods are treated as supplied in New Zealand under section 8(4F) (subject to GST). Since the value of the supply excluding GST (NZ$100) is less than NZ$1,000, the treatment of the sale as a taxable supply is correct (even if the customer is a GST-registered business, as section 8(4F) will apply in this scenario). Good Books issues the recipient with a receipt at the time of supply containing the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place (see section 24(3)(a)); • Good Books’ name and GST registration number (see sections 24(3)(b) and 24BAB(2)(a)); • the name and address of the recipient (see section 24(3)(c)); 83 • the date the receipt was issued (which in this case is the same as the date of supply – see sections 24(3)(d) and 24BAB(2)(b) and (c)); • a description of the goods and services supplied, along with the quantity or volume (see section 24(3)(e) and (f), and section 24BAB(2)(d)); • the consideration for the supply excluding tax (NZ$100), the amount of tax included (NZ$15), and the consideration inclusive of tax (NZ$115) (see sections 24(3)(g)(i) and 24BAB(2)(e); and • information indicating the items for which the amount of tax included is zero or more than zero (in this example, GST was charged on all the items in the supply, so information indicating that tax was included for all the items will suffice – see section 24BAB(2)(f) and (g)). The receipt meets the requirements of section 24(3) for a full tax invoice, so if the recipient of the supply is a GST-registered business intending to use the goods and services purchased for making taxable supplies, they will be able to make an input tax deduction in their GST return. The receipt also meets the requirements of section 24BAB(2) for a receipt required to be issued for the purposes of preventing double taxation on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer. Example 57 – prohibition on issuing a tax invoice for a high-value supply of distantly taxable goods Consider Good Books in the previous example again. Good Books sell 20 items valued at NZ$50 each (excluding GST) to a recipient providing a delivery address in New Zealand and charges NZ$40 plus GST for shipping. As the estimated customs value of each item (NZ$50) is less than NZ$1,000, Good Books determines that the supply is of distantly taxable goods and charges GST of NZ$156, based on the value of the supply of NZ$1,040 (20 books at NZ$50 each + NZ$40 shipping = NZ$1,040, 15% of NZ$1,040 = NZ$156). As the value of the supply excluding GST (NZ$1,040) is over NZ$1,000, Good Books issues a receipt to the recipient with the words “tax invoice” omitted. Because the document is not a valid tax invoice (and because of the deduction prohibition rule for supplies valued over NZ$1,000 in section 20(4C)), the recipient cannot make an input tax deduction even if they are registered for GST and will use the supply in their taxable activity. The recipient is registered for GST and intends to use the goods wholly for making taxable supplies. However, because the document issued by Good Books is not a valid tax invoice (and because of the deduction prohibition rule for high-value supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents), the GST-registered recipient contacts Good Books to ask for a refund of the GST. Questions to consider when deciding whether the election might be a useful option 318. In deciding whether the election to charge GST on low-value supplies to GST- registered businesses might be a useful option, non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods may want to consider the following questions: • Is it reasonably likely that at least 50 percent of the value of the sales that you will make to New Zealand customers in the next 12 months will be to customers that are not registered for GST? • In the context of your business, is it likely that any given sale of goods to a customer in New Zealand will always have a value below NZ$1,000 (excluding GST)? If not, are your business systems capable of issuing different 84 documentation for supplies valued at NZ$1,000 or less, versus supplies valued above NZ$1,000? Transitional rule for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 December 319. Section 85C contains a new transitional provision similar to the transitional rule under section 85B, which was provided for the introduction of GST on remote services in 2016. The new transitional provision applies: • to contracts for distantly taxable goods that are for a fixed term and entered into before 1 December 2019; and • to periodic payments made under the contract that are treated under section 9(3)(a) as successive supplies; 31 and • if the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement (this covers contracts that are entered into during a month and end a year later at the end of the month); and • if the non-resident supplier elects that the transitional provision applies. 320. The transit ional provisio n allows a non-resident supplier to treat distantly taxable goods provided under the contract as not being successively supplied under section 9(3), and therefore, those payments made after 1 December 2019 would not be subject to GST. This transitional rule would only apply for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. After that time, section 9(3) would usually apply and treat periodic payments as being successive supplies when the payments become due or are received, whichever is earlier. Example 58 – contract for magazine subscription entered into before 1 December 2019 Rosalie purchases a subscription to a Canadian model train collectors’ magazine for a 12-month period on 15 August 2019 and opts to pay the subscription in monthly instalments. The non- resident supplier is able to treat those monthly instalments as not being successively supplied under section 9(3) and, therefore, payments made after 1 December 2019 will not be subject to GST up until the 12-month contract ends. 31 The transitional provision should also apply to periodic payments made under the contract that are treated under section 9(3)(aa) as successive supplies. Officials will seek to correct this cross-referencing error in a future taxation bill.
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Simplifying tax administration – individuals’ income tax The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 has introduced changes that will simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and will help people to use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. This special report provides early information on the new rules and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the May 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. The following items are covered in this special report: • The year-end income tax obligations of individuals. • Refunds and tax to pay. • Pro-active actions. • Tailored (special) tax codes. • The administration of donations tax credits. 2 OVERVIEW Subpart 3B, sections 24B, 24D, 24DB, 25A, 33,41, 41A, 89C, 89D 92, 106, 108, 108B, 110, 111, ,120C, 141JA, 143, 173L, 184A, 227G and schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Sections LB 7, RM 2, RM 4, RM 5, RZ 15, RZ 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New rules have been introduced to simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and to help people use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. The key changes: • enable Inland Revenue to proactively help individuals to use the most appropriate tax rates or codes; • enable the use of tailored tax codes to improve the way that secondary sources of income and irregular patterns of income earning are taxed; • simplify the year-end income tax obligations of individuals; • enable the automation of refunds of tax and amounts of tax to pay; and • improve the administration of donations tax credits. Other miscellaneous amendments have also been made to ensure the individuals’ income tax changes are integrated smoothly into the tax system. These include changes to the refund provisions and the time bar. Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2019 and the end of year processes apply to the tax year ended 31 March 2019 and later income years. 3 THE YEAR-END INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS Subpart 3B, sections 33, 37, 41, 89C, 89D, 92, 106, 108, 108B, 110, 111, 143, 173L, 184A, 227G and schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of amendments have been made that will simplify the end of year income tax obligations of individuals and some of the processes that Inland Revenue performs. All section references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background In previous tax years, the year-end processes for individuals required Inland Revenue to determine whether or not individuals who earn PAYE income should be issued with a personal tax summary (PTS) containing their PAYE income information or whether they ought to be filing a tax return. If an individual was not sent a PTS by Inland Revenue, they could request one. If an individual did not get a PTS or did not file a tax return, their tax position would not be squared up. This meant that any refund available or amount of tax payable would not be calculated, and the amount of tax the individual had to pay for the tax year would simply be based on what had already been withheld. When a PTS was issued, if the refund amount was less than $600, it was treated as confirmed after two months and the refund would be paid out. If the refund was greater than $600, the taxpayer was required to confirm the PTS as correct before the refund would be paid. As the PTS only includes salary and wage information, individuals were required to add in income from other sources, such as interest income or dividend income. Sometimes an individual would need to gather this information from several payers even though these payers may have also provided this information to Inland Revenue directly. An IR3 tax return was required where the individual had other types of income such as business income or foreign sourced income, or if they wished to claim deductions or tax credits. As a result, a large number of individuals would choose to interact with Inland Revenue through PTS intermediaries, perhaps because of a lack of awareness of how to directly claim any available refund directly from Inland Revenue. PTS intermediaries assist taxpayers with refund claims and typically charge a percentage of the refund or a fixed fee for the service they offer. If an individual instead applied directly to Inland Revenue, they would receive the full amount of their refund. It was also possible for an individual to work out whether they were due a refund or had tax to pay by requesting a summary of earnings before they requested a PTS. Generally, taxpayers who had requested a summary of earnings were not then required to request a PTS, with the result that a PTS was typically only requested when refunds were due. Key features The end of year income tax process changes will mean that more individuals will have an end of year square up, with more refunds or bills of tax to pay being issued as applicable. Under the new rules, Inland Revenue will do most of the work by pre-populating as much information about an individual’s income and tax credits as possible into the individual’s pre-populated account. This account will contain income information for all the types of income that are subject to regular reporting to Inland Revenue, such as PAYE income, which is referred to as “reportable income”. 4 This pre-populated account forms the basis for the calculation of the individual’s tax position (refund or tax to pay). If the Commissioner is satisfied that an individual’s income information as set out in their pre-populated account is correct and complete, Inland Revenue may finalise the individual’s account for the tax year. Some individuals will be required to provide additional information on their “other income” (income other than their reportable income) which may not be contained in the pre-populated account and will be able to provide information on deductions and tax credits when relevant. This additional information will be added to the individual’s pre-populated account and will form part of the individual’s self-assessment. This means that, generally, individuals who only earn reportable income will not have to do anything, and Inland Revenue will automatically issue them with a refund or tax bill once the account is finalised. Only individuals who earn other income or have deductions that Inland Revenue does not already know about will have to provide further information to Inland Revenue and file tax returns. New error correction provisions and processes provide simpler ways for individuals and Inland Revenue to adjust the information if they become aware that an account is incorrect. This can be done before an assessment has occurred or after subject to the time-bar rules. The key changes are as follows: • Inland Revenue will make pre-populated accounts available to individuals containing the relevant income information for the tax year. • If the Commissioner is satisfied that the information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records the individual’s income for the year, Inland Revenue will calculate the refund or tax to pay without the individual needing to provide any additional information. • Inland Revenue will pay out refunds without the individual having to confirm the tax position that Inland Revenue has calculated. • Individuals who earn other income will be required to provide income information other than reportable income to Inland Revenue subject to de minimis rules before an assessment can be completed. • Individuals will be able to provide other relevant information such as deductible expenses and relevant tax credit information to Inland Revenue. • Individuals will be required to provide or correct reportable income if they know, or might reasonably be expected to have known, that the reportable income amount should properly be included in their final account. • An individual’s tax assessment will arise once they have confirmed the tax information is complete, when the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is correct and complete, or if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete and issues a default assessment. • Individuals and Inland Revenue will be able to make corrections to the information held if they become aware that it is incorrect or incomplete and there will be error correction processes for adjustments made before and after an assessment has occurred. 5 • Qualifying individuals, being those who only earn reportable income, will be able to amend their assessment at any time up until their terminal tax date without being exposed to penalties or interest. • The end of year income tax process will replace the current PTS process and will replace the IR3 tax return immediately for online filers and over time for any paper filers as the paper IR3 is phased out. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 tax year. Detailed analysis Key terms – Section 22D Inland Revenue will make a pre-populated account available for an individual for the tax year which will include the relevant income information that Inland Revenue holds about the individual. The individual’s tax assessment will crystallise once this pre-populated account becomes a “final account” in accordance with these new rules. Individuals will be grouped based on the type of income they earn. Whether an individual is a “qualifying individual” or not influences the way in which the individual’s tax posit ion is finalised, their obligations and the concessions they may be eligible for. The key terms below are defined in section 22D. Individual The new individuals’ income tax changes apply to “individuals” as defined only. New section 22D(1) defines an individual as a natural person. This definition includes a natural person who is non-resident, unless their only inco me is non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. This is necessary to exclude individuals who are not New Zealand taxpayers under existing law. Deceased natural persons are also excluded from the date of their death. Legal persons, such as companies, are not subject to the new provisions and must fulfil their tax obligations under existing law. Income definitions The income earnt by individuals is categorised as either “reportable income” or “other income”. Reportable income Reportable income is defined in new section 22D(3). Reportable income is income that Inland Revenue receives regular information about, typically from third party payers such as employers, during the income year or by 31 May following the end of the relevant tax year. This includes PAYE income payments, along with resident and non-resident passive income. Importantly, new section 22D(3)(b) states that income will not be “reportable income” if the payer of the income, for example an employer or bank, does not have the individual’s tax file number. Where recipients of reportable income do not ensure that their payers have their tax file number, they will be obliged to provide Inland Revenue with the relevant income information. 6 Example 1: Roger Roger gets his first job at the local library in his town. His new employer tells him he needs to obtain an IRD number. Roger applies for and receives an IRD number but forgets to give it to his employer. The payroll staff at the library do not follow up with Roger about his IRD number and pay him his wages and account for the PAYE to Inland Revenue. Roger decides he does not like working at the library and resigns from his job after a month. He then starts work at a local café and provides his new employer with his IRD number. At the end of the tax year, Inland Revenue will prepare a pre-populated account for Roger but cannot include his wages from the library. That income, although paid to Roger and reported to Inland Revenue, may not be able to be allocated to him without an IRD number. The account therefore only contains his wages from the café. In this case, although Roger only earns PAYE income, which is generally a type of “reportable income”, the wages he earned from the library are treated as “other income as the requirement to provide the employer with his IRD number was not met. This means Roger is obliged to contact Inland Revenue to provide this information. An exception to this rule exists for income which is earned jointly, such as interest income of holders of joint bank accounts, if the Commissioner is able to allocate the amounts as between the individuals. This could be the case where two individuals own a bank deposit investment in equal shares, and the Commissioner is made aware that the interest earned from the deposit is to be allocated on that basis. Other income Per section 22D(4), “other income” is an individual’s income other than their reportable income. Schedule 8, Part A, table 1 lists the types of “other income” that must be reported to Inland Revenue. These include: • income from a New Zealand estate or trust; • income with a foreign source; • income from a partnership; • inco me fro m a look-through company; • income from rents; • inco me fro m self-employment; • employee share scheme income that is not reportable income; and • other income, including income from a disposal of property that is not otherwise included in reportable income. In accordance with new section 22K(1) an individual has no obligation to provide information for a tax year if they derive $200 or less of other income in the corresponding income year. Qualifying individual The distinction between the types of income an individual earns is important because it determines obligations under the new individuals’ income tax process. Section 22D(2) introduces the term “qualifying individual” which means an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be 7 provided to Inland Revenue. Qualifying individuals have different obligations from other individuals and are eligible for certain concessions. These concepts will be explained in greater detail later in this special report. Pre-populated account New section 22D(5) defines a pre-populated account as one provided by Inland Revenue to an individual for a tax year containing the reportable information held by the Commissioner, including any income information provided by the individual; and quantifying the amount of reportable income and other income derived by the individual for the income year. New section 22E(1) requires Inland Revenue to include in the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year the information that Inland Revenue holds with respect to reportable income and other income that the Commissioner considers has been derived by the individual for the tax year. This requirement is limited to the extent that the information is both available and relevant to the individual’s assessment for the tax year (section 22E(2)). Section 22E(3) provides that an individual who has no reportable income for a tax year may ask the Commissioner to make a pre-populated account with a zero balance available so that they can provide their income information for the tax year. In practice, an individual can go into their income summary online via myIR and add their income type (for example, self- emplo yment income) and select a start date. Once the individual has updated their income sources the account will be created for them to complete. Section 22M requires Inland Revenue to establish an electronic form and means of communication as well as a non-electronic form or mode of delivery to allow an individual to provide other income information to Inland Revenue. This will enable taxpayers to submit informat ion either electronically or by post which will be populated into the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. Final account Section 22D(6) defines a final account as a pre-populated account that has been finalised under section 22HB. Section 22I(1) provides that a final account is treated as a return of income and an income tax assessment. In accordance with 22I(2), the assessment is treated as being made on the date on which the individual’s pre-populated account is finalised for the tax year. The way in which a pre-populated account is “finalised” will be discussed in greater detail later on in this special report. An individual’s income tax assessment (sections 22F, 22H and 22I) The purpose of this section is to explain how an individual’s income tax assessment arises, and to explain the obligations an individual may have in relation to this assessment. This section will consider: • an individual’s obligations to provide information (section 22F); and • finalising accounts and the assessment process (sections 22H and 22I). 8 Information requirements – Section 22F Before an individual’s tax position can be finalised, it is important to ensure that the individual’s pre-populated account accurately records the individual’s income for the tax year. Section 22F outlines the circumstances in which an individual must provide income information to Inland Revenue. This explains to individuals what their obligations are and when they do not have to do anything. Qualifying individual A “qualifying individual” is generally not required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue and in most cases their tax position will be squared up automatically without them having to do anything. Example 2: John John earns a salary of $70,000 per annum. His employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. John does not earn any other income. Per section 22E, the Commissioner includes this income information in John’s pre-populated account for the tax year. As Inland Revenue has no information that suggests John might be earning other income or reason to suspect the reportable income is incorrect, the Commissioner is satisfied that the information set out in John’s pre-populated account correctly and completely records his income for the tax year and, at the end of the tax year, finalises his account in accordance with section 22H(1). John is not required to do anything and will receive an email notification informing him that his notice of assessment is available via myIR. The notice of assessment informs John that Inland Revenue has calculated his assessment and that, in his case, he has no further tax to pay and is not due a tax refund as the correct tax was withheld by his employer. Although in most cases a qualifying individual will not be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue, section 22F(2) provides an exception for an individual who knows or might reasonably be expected to have known that an amount of income should properly be included in their final account for the tax year, but it is not. In that case the individual will be obligated to provide that information to Inland Revenue. 9 Example 3: Adam Adam works part-time at the local supermarket, and as he really loves cars and is a keen mechanic, in his spare time he fixes cars for his friend Brad’s auto garage. Adam gave Brad his IRD number and tax code when he first started at the garage, but he is not sure whether Brad accounts properly for any PAYE on his earnings as Brad is not an accountant and he’s never seen a pay slip. But since he gets such a good wage and Brad is a mate, he just never asks Brad about it. In July Adam mentions his recent tax refund to Brad, as he was so impressed it was sorted for him by IR, and Brad tells him that he doesn’t account for any PAYE on what he pays Adam for his work at the garage. When he gets home that day Adam is worried that not enough tax is being paid, so he logs in to his myIR account to check his earnings for the previous tax year. Sure enough he can see his supermarket earnings are correctly recorded, but the account does not show any of his income from the garage. In this case the income he has earned as a mechanic is untaxed reportable income, and Adam knows that there is income missing (the earnings from the garage) section s22F(2) applies. This puts an obligation on Adam to tell IR about his missing income. If he does not tell IR Adam would be breach of s22F(2) as he knows, or might reasonably be expected to have known, that an amount of income should properly be included in his final account for the tax year but is not. In this situation, Adam should inform Inland Revenue of the income information that is missing from his account. It is an absolute liability offence under section 143(1)(b) to not provide the Commissioner with information when required by law. Accordingly, Adam will be subject to penalties and interest on this undisclosed income if he does not inform Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue later finds out about the income. If the Commissioner considers an individual’s account is incorrect or incomplete despite containing all the relevant reportable income information, for example because the Commissioner believes the individual has other income which needs to be included, she would not finalise the account. Instead, the individual’s assessment will be “suspended” for a period of time and the Commissioner will contact the individual to ask them to provide this further information. This will be discussed in greater detail later in this special report. “Other income” earner If an individual earns “other income”, section 22F(1) requires that individual, subject to the $200 de minimis threshold in section 22K(1), to provide to the Commissioner their “other inco me” information for the tax year. This applies irrespective of whether the individual also has “reportable income” or not. This information is then included in the individual’s pre- populated account for the tax year. Income that a person receives under an employee share scheme which their employer has correctly recorded in their relevant employment income information is not treated as other income. Example 4: Ian Ian works part-time as a mechanic. To supplement his income, Ian starts his own lawn mowing business on 1 March 2019. For the first month, Ian only earns $188 in income from this venture. This means that, for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, Ian has less than $200 of “other income” and is therefore not required to provide this information to Inland Revenue. If Ian’s lawn mowing business grew in the following tax year, and he earned $8,000. The entire amount would need to be reported to Inland Revenue in his account for the year. 10 Finalising accounts and the assessment process (section 22H and 22I) As previously mentioned, new section 22I(1) provides that a final account is treated as a return of income and an income tax assessment. In accordance with 22I(2), the assessment is treated as being made on the date on which the individual’s pre-populated account is finalised for the tax year. The finalising of accounts is governed by the process set out below. When an account is finalised, section 22I(4) requires the Commissioner to notify an individual that their assessment is treated as having been made. Assessments for qualifying individuals (section 22H(1) and 22H(3)) For qualifying individuals, section 22H(1) provides that the Commissioner may finalise the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year when the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year. If the Commissioner requests information from a qualifying individual, the individual may when providing that information also correct any errors in their reportable income before finalising the account by confirming the correctness of their pre-populated account (22H(3)). From an operational standpoint, the Commissioner intends to finalise the assessments of qualifying individuals in batches, starting from early May and running through June. When an individual’s income tax assessment is finalised, Inland Revenue will notify the individual accordingly. Example 5: Lauren Lauren earns a salary as an accountant. This is the only “reportable” income information that Inland Revenue has received for Lauren. Inland Revenue considers Lauren’s activity for previous tax years and notes that she has never filed an IR3 return and has never earned “other income”. There is no other information that Inland Revenue holds that suggests Lauren has any other earnings or that the reportable income received is incorrect or incomplete. On this basis, Inland Revenue is satisfied that the income information set out in Lauren’s pre-populated account correctly and completely records her income for the corresponding income year. Inland Revenue therefore finalises Lauren’s pre-populated account on 15 May 2019 for the tax year ending 31 March 2019. Lauren is not required to do anything and will receive an email notification informing her that her notice of assessment is available via myIR. The notice of assessment informs Lauren that Inland Revenue have calculated her assessment and that, in her case, she has no further tax to pay and is not due a refund as her employer withheld the correct amount of tax on her behalf. Assessments for other individuals (section 22H(2)) Section 22H(2) provides that an individual other than a qualifying individual, may adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct errors at any time prior to 7 July following the end of the tax year, or later if they have an extension of time to file their return. The individual may also then finalise their account by confirming that the income information in the account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding tax year. 11 Example 6: Roman Roman studies at a university in Wellington and works part time at a local supermarket earning wages. When university is over for the year, Roman goes back home to Christchurch. For the last few years, Roman has operated a car washing business over the holiday period which nets him about $1,800 in additional income. Roman has filed an IR3 return for the previous tax years to account for this additional income. On 1 April 2019, Roman’s pre-populated account only includes his supermarket wages which have been reported to Inland Revenue. Based on Roman’s past returns, he has been an earner of “other income” in past tax years so Inland Revenue does not automatically finalise Roman’s account and instead prompts Roman to provide the additional information about his business earnings for the year. On 15 June 2019 Roman logs into myIR and updates his pre-populated account to include his business income. Roman then confirms that his pre-populated account is complete and correct. Roman’s account is finalised and his tax assessment crystallises, he is sent a notice of assessment which sets out the amount of tax he has left to pay. Assessments when Inland Revenue is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete If an individual does not provide the required information relating to their “other income”, the Commissioner can make an assessment of the amount of income that the Commissioner considers ought to be subject to tax by issuing a default assessment under section 106(1). This is because an individual who failed to provide the required information is treated as having failed to file their return. Similarly, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information provided in a final account for a tax year is not likely to be correct, the Commissioner may raise a default assessment per section 106(1A). Section 106(1B) provides that tax assessed under section 106(1A) is payable by the individual unless the individual disputes the assessment under section 89D. Section 89D(2B) requires an individual to first amend their final account before disputing the assessment as described in 22I(3). Default assessments will be discussed in greater detail under the ‘Disputes resolution and error correction’ section for both qualifying and other individuals. Proportionate extension of time for taxpayers due to system issues (amended section 37) Section 37 has been amended to provide an additional extension of time to a date advised by the Commissioner if a systems issue arises for an Inland Revenue digital platform that results in a taxpayer being prevented from, or being otherwise hindered or disadvantaged in, providing the required return or income information. This proportionate extension of time applies to “a person or class of persons” and therefore extends outside the scope of the individuals’ rules (that is it applies to entities such as companies as well). If such a systems issue arises, the Commissioner will make the extension available, as appropriate. Assessments for non-resident individuals Non-resident individuals with New Zealand sourced income have an obligation to pay tax in New Zealand on that income, under existing laws. The new individuals’ end-of-year process does not alter these obligations. 12 For non-resident individuals who have New Zealand reportable income, Inland Revenue will follow the standard pre-population process and will generate an account containing income information for the New Zealand sourced amounts. An example is employment income with a source in New Zealand, which is subject to PAYE irrespective of the residence of the individual. Non-residents, who earn other income and would ordinarily have been required to file an IR3NR, will continue to have an obligation to provide this information to Inland Revenue and to complete the required assessment to account for tax due on New Zealand sourced “other inco me”. Disputes resolution and error correction This section sets out how an individual can correct errors in their income information at different stages throughout the process and how the dispute resolution rules apply within the context of the new individuals’ income tax rules. The main way in which the approach to disputes is different under the new individuals’ income tax rules is that there are now mechanisms in the law that allow for an assessment, and for errors in general, to be amended more easily and without going through the formal disputes process. The following section will set out the new error correction rules and outline how they are integrated within the disputes resolution process. Qualifying individuals A qualifying individual can amend their assessment, or have their assessment amended by the Commissioner, under the new error correction provisions and the existing dispute resolution process. This section will cover the following in relation to qualifying individuals: 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the individual; 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner; 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual; 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner; 5. Default assessments; 6. Formal disputes process commencing with a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) issued by the taxpayer; 7. Later requests for changes by individuals. New section 22G sets out the process for correcting errors in respect of a taxpayer’s account for a tax year when information is either missing or incorrect. 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by individuals (section 22G) Section 22G(2) provides that an individual can amend income information in their pre- populated account at any time before it is finalised under section 22H. This provision applies to both “reportable” and “other income” earners. It is noted that the mechanism through which an account becomes finalised differs between “reportable” and “other income” earners and therefore the timeframes for pre-assessment error correction may differ from taxpayer to taxpayer. 13 Individuals will be able to view their income information, which will be used to pre-populate their account after year end, at any point during the year by logging into the their MyIR. Any errors in this income information can be corrected by contacting Inland Revenue. Section 22H(2) provides that an individual other than a qualifying individual may adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct errors any time prior to 7 July following the end of the tax year, or longer if they have an extension of time (being the due date by which they should file their return). Example 7: Alyssa and Zane Alyssa and Zane are both reportable income earners. Alyssa works in marketing and Zane works in journalism. Alyssa’s assessment for the 2018–19 tax year is finalised on 15 May 2019 and Zane’s on 1 June 2019. This means that Zane has an additional two weeks to correct any errors in his pre-populated account under 22G(2) than Alyssa. Due to the post-assessment error correction provisions for qualifying individuals, all qualifying individuals may amend their assessment up until their terminal tax date without being exposed to penalties or interest. If Alyssa didn’t have a chance to make an amendment to her pre-populated account before it is finalised, she will have time to do so afterwards with the same effect. As neither Alyssa or Zane are obliged to check their pre-populated accounts unless they know, or might reasonably have known, that the account will be incorrect or will omit information, the difference in timing is not likely to affect the correctness of their assessments. 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner (Section 22G) Section 22G(5) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre- populated account to correct errors. The Commissioner must notify the individual of any amendment. This provision applies to both reportable and other income earners. During the year, the Commissioner will update income information contained in the pre- populated account as it is received. Changes that the Commissioner makes to income information before the end of the tax year (and before an assessment arises) will be available to view online during the year and will be included in the pre-populated account prepared at the end of the year. Inland Revenue is unlikely to issue additional paper notifications to non-digital customers each time additional income information is received during the year, as that would result in undue administrative and compliance costs. Post year-end changes will need to be separately communicated to individuals, particularly for other income earners who must provide additional income information to Inland Revenue. That is because any changes to the reportable income information contained in the pre-populated account would need to be checked by the individual as the assessment can only arise, per section 22H(2), if the individual considers the account to correctly and completely record their income for the year. For this reason, changes made after the end of the tax year, for example to reflect updated information in employment income information will be notified more directly. 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by qualifying individuals (Section 22G) Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. The amended information forms a new assessment and any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. This means that when a taxpayer, who is a qualifying individual or is mistakenly treated as such, amends their assessment under section 22G(3) prior to their terminal tax date, they will 14 not be subject to penalties or interest (unless they are subject to the provisional tax regime). The changes are treated as the initial assessment rather than an amendment to the original assessment which the Commissioner finalised. Changes made to section 120C, which governs the day that interest starts for the purposes of the Use of Money Interest (UOMI) rules, ensure that interest does not start until the day after the payment of tax is due. The due date for terminal tax is generally 7 February following the end of the tax year for taxpayers with a standard balance date (tax year 1 April – 31 March). If a taxpayer with a standard balance date is linked to a tax agent, the terminal tax date will be 7 April of the following year. This applies even if the initial Commissioner finalised assessment results in a refund being paid to a taxpayer and the subsequent assessment results in tax to pay. Any disbursed refund that has to be repaid will be treated as due on the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. Notwithstanding a taxpayer’s ability to correct their income information under section 22G(3), section 22G(4) clarifies that if the Commissioner has reason to believe the amended information is incorrect, the Commissioner can decide not to accept the taxpayer’s amendment and issue a default assessment under section 106. This process protects the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that the Commissioner’s assessment is not immediately displaced with an incorrect assessment. Instead disputed amendments of this nature are processed under the existing rules, discussed further below. Example 8a: Lauren Lauren, as mentioned in a previous example, is an accountant earning a salary. The only income information Inland Revenue has received in relation to Lauren for the tax year is her salary income, and her earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue has no reason not to be satisfied that the information in Lauren’s pre-populated account is correct and complete and her account is therefore finalised on 15 May 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue does not know is that Lauren earnt $2,000 during the 2018–19 tax year regularly babysitting for a friend. On 1 November 2019 Lauren logs into her myIR to add this “other income” information. Although by virtue of adding this “other income” information into her final account Lauren is no longer a “qualifying individual”, she was treated by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual and therefore still falls within section 22G(3) for the correction of post-assessment errors by qualifying individuals. This means that when Lauren logs in on 1 November 2019 to add additional income information, this is not treated as an amended assessment but rather as a new assessment. The assessment that resulted when Inland Revenue finalised her account on 15 May 2019 is regarded as not having been made. Lauren will now have until her terminal tax date to pay any resultant tax bill and will not be subject to any penalties or interest provided that the amount due is paid on time. In the following year she is likely to be prompted to provide additional income information so that Inland Revenue can confirm whether she has continued to earn other income from babysitting. 15 Example 8b: Olivia Lauren’s sister, Olivia, works at the same accounting firm and earns a salary. Olivia purchased a rental property in 2015 which Inland Revenue are aware of due to Olivia’s IR3 returns for the preceding tax years showing a return of rental income. As such, Inland Revenue categorises Olivia as an “other income” earner who is required to provide more information to Inland Revenue. This means that Olivia will not be subject to the automatic process that applies to reportable income earners. New section 22H(2) requires an “other income” earner to adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct any errors by no later than 7 July following the end of the tax year. This means that, for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, a taxpayer with a standard balance date who earns “other income” has to provide this information by no later than 7 July 2019. In the event that the information is not provided by this date, Inland Revenue can issue a default assessment in accordance with section 106. What Inland Revenue does not know is that Olivia sold the rental property in March 2018, prior to the commencement of the 2018–19 tax year. Olivia’s only income for the 2018–19 tax year is her salary as an accountant, which means she is actually a reportable income earner for the 2018–19 tax year. Based on the above, Olivia does not provide “other income” information and finalise her account by 7 July 2019 as expected by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue does not issue Olivia with a default assessment immediately, although it has the scope to do so under section 106, and instead contacts Olivia to request further information. What happens next depends on what Olivia decides to do: (i) Olivia contacts Inland Revenue and finalises the assessment If Olivia responds to Inland Revenue and provides the required information, telling Inland Revenue that she has sold the property and has no rental income this year, she can finalise the account. The finalisation is late and, as such, Olivia may be charged a late filing penalty per section 139A, for failing to complete her final account (provide her return) on time. As Olivia has sold the property, she will no longer be an “other income” earner, so for the following tax year she is likely to have her assessment finalised by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual. (ii) Olivia does not respond: default assessment issued by Inland Revenue If Inland Revenue decides to issue Olivia with a default assessment prior to her terminal tax date 7 February 2020, the assessment can include an amount of rental income that the Commissioner considers, based on available information, that Olivia has earned in the tax year. Tax on this amount will be payable per section 106(1B), as noted above. As the Commissioner is unaware of the sale Olivia can contact Inland Revenue and ask for an amendment to her assessment by providing the required information to correct the account. In this case she can demonstrate that she had no rental income as she sold the property. The Commissioner would therefore amend the assessment per section 113. If there was disagreement between the Commissioner and Olivia as to whether any rental income ought to be included in Olivia’s assessment, Olivia would need to raise a dispute to change the assessment. Section 89D(2B) requires an individual to first amend the assessment by making an adjustment to their final account for the tax year before they are able to commence a dispute by issuing a NOPA. This is consistent with the previous rules which required an individual who had been issued a default assessment because they failed to file their tax return on time, to first file the missing return before being able to commence a dispute. Olivia must make the adjustment to her final account by no later than the time of filing the NOPA and both of these actions must be completed within the response period (four months from the issue of the default assessment). 16 Usuall y a taxpayer will discuss the correctness of the default assessment with the Commissioner before making an adjustment to their final account or engaging in the disputes process. However, a taxpayer is required to adjust their final account and issue a NOPA if the Commissioner does not accept the taxpayer’s proposed changes to their assessment within the response period. As noted above, in this case the Commissioner is unlikely to decline Olivia’s request to amend her assessment, as it is clear she has sold the property and has no rental income, therefore a dispute is unnecessary. Example 8c: Ruairi When Olivia sold her rental property in March 2018, she sold it to her brother, Ruairi. The sale and purchase was settled on 2 March 2018. Ruairi, unsurprisingly, is also an accountant who works at the same firm as his sisters. The only income information that Inland Revenue has received in relation to Ruairi for the 2018–19 tax year is his salary income. – His earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue has no reason to consider that the information in Ruairi’s pre-populated account is incorrect so finalises his account on 20 May 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue does not know however, is that by virtue of his rental property purchase on 2 March 2018, Ruairi has a month of rental income that he needs to return. Ruairi is therefore an “other income” earner for the 2018–19 tax year. Ruairi does not have an extension of time and his return filing due date is therefore 7 July 2019 for the 2018–19 tax year. Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Ruairi has been treated as a qualifying individual by Inland Revenue and therefore can rely on section 22G(3). Ruairi can amend his return and provide what he considers to be his correct and complete income for the 2018–19 income year at any point before 7 February 2020. This will be treated as a new assessment, and he has until 7 February to pay the additional taxes due. Although in most cases a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual, may amend the income information in their final account before the terminal tax date, there are limited circumstances in which a provisional taxpayer will be subject to UOMI. 17 Example 9: Jeff Lauren, Olivia and Ruairi have a brother called Jeff who also works at the accounting firm and earns salary and wages. On 1 April 2018, Jeff also commences a start-up technology venture, which he operates in his own capacity. Although Jeff is only working on his venture part time, it is successful and he earns an additional $200,000 for the 2018-19 tax year. Inland Revenue reviews Jeff’s income information at the end of the 2018–19 tax year and based on the information held for Jeff, the Commissioner is satisfied that the information contained in his pre-populated account correctly and completely records Jeff’s income for that tax year. Inland Revenue therefore finalises Jeff’s pre-populated account and it becomes an assessment on 15 May 2019. New section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual, or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual, may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Although Jeff clearly has “other income” that he needs to provide, he has been treated as a qualifying individual and therefore has until his terminal tax date (7 February 2020) to provide any additional information and amend his tax position for the year. Jeff logs into myIR on 1 February 2020 and updates his tax position to include an additional $200,000 in income and finalises his account for the tax year. Although this is treated as a new assessment for the purposes of section 22G(3), Jeff is liable to pay provisional tax as he derived untaxed income during the tax year which caused him to have residual income tax (RIT) of more than $2,500 at year-end. Due to his level of untaxed income, Jeff’s RIT exceeds $60,000 and therefore he does not qualify for the provisional tax safe harbour in section 120KE. This means that provisional tax instalments were due for one third of his RIT on each of the missed instalment dates (being 28 August 2018, 15 January 2019 and 7 May 2019 for Jeff (as he has a standard 31 March balance date). As Jeff did not pay these instalments when they were due, he is subject to UOMI. For the sake of completeness, for the 2019–20 income tax year, because Jeff has filed his 2018–19 tax return after the first two provisional tax instalment dates for that year, he can pay provisional tax equalling his 2020 RIT on the third instalment date, being 7 May 2020 and not have to pay UOMI in that year. 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner for qualifying individuals Section 22G(6) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in a qualifying individual’s final account for the tax year to correct errors in the information at any time before the end of the time bar period per section 108(1), notifying the individual of the amendment. The time bar prevents the Commissioner from amending an assessment to increase the tax payable if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. This does not apply if a return is fraudulent or misleading. Section 22G(6) allows the Commissioner to correct finalised assessments in cases when the reportable income information provided to Inland Revenue is corrected after the end of the tax year, resulting in incorrect individual assessments. The Commissioner can correct the final accounts without first having to issue a NOPA due to amended section 89C(1) which references amendments made per section 22G(6). This section is limited to qualifying individuals because it reflects the way in which qualifying individuals’ assessments are finalised by the Commissioner. This means that if the Commissioner sought to amend information contained in the account of an individual with other income who finalises their own assessment per section 22H(2), the usual NOPA process would need to be followed. 18 Example 10: Rachel Rachel is a qualifying individual earning salary and wages. Her tax position is automatically calculated by Inland Revenue for the 2018–19 tax year and it is determined that she has tax payable of $100. Rachel pays this amount prior to her terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. On 1 March 2020 Inland Revenue realises that a mistake has been made in calculating Rachel’s tax position for the 2018–19 tax year because her employer contacts Inland Revenue to correct several periods of employment income information. Instead of having $100 tax payable, Rachel actually had $300 of tax payable, because her employment income information has been incorrectly reported. Section 22G(6) means that Inland Revenue can amend Rachel’s return and issues her with a tax bill for the additional $200. Rachel is given an additional 30 days, commencing on 2 March 2020, to pay this additional $200 (see section 142AB). 5. Default assessment A qualifying individual’s income tax assessment is typically automated. In most cases, the Commissioner will satisfy herself that the information in an individual’s pre-populated account, which will have been provided to her by way of third-party reporting during the year, is correct and complete. Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete, she can request that the individual provides more information under section 22H(3). The individual can then simply finalise the account by confirming that the income information is correct and complete or correct any errors in their reportable income and finalise the account by confirming that the corrected income information is correct and complete. Section 22G(4) provides that where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the amended information is incorrect, she can decline to accept the information and issue a default assessment under section 106. Amended section 89D(2B) provides that an individual can only dispute a default assessment by making an adjustment to their final account for the tax year. It is therefore expected that default assessments will only occur for qualifying individuals in limited circumstances. These include where an individual has been miscategorised as an “other inco me” earner, or where Inland Revenue is unsure about some of the individual’s information and has requested further clarifying information but the individual has failed to provide an adequate response. Example 11: Pamela Pamela is a salary earner who works in a large corporate office as an accountant. Inland Revenue knows that in previous tax years, Pamela has claimed a deduction of $1,000 for income protection insurance. Inland Revenue therefore has reason to believe that Pamela may intend to claim this deduction for the current (2018– 19) tax year as well. Instead of immediately finalising Pamela’s income tax assessment, since she is a qualifying individual, Inland Revenue sends Pamela a letter noting that she has previously claimed income protection insurance and gives her a period of time to respond and provide the deduction information if it is again relevant to this tax year. When Pamela responds confirming that she has this information, her assessment will be finalised based on the information she provides and confirmed as her complete and correct position for the tax year as set out in section 22H(3). If she does not respond in the given time period, Inland Revenue can progress the assessment on the basis that Pamela must not have any income protection insurance to claim for the 2018–19 tax year, otherwise she would have responded to the letter as she has done in the past. 19 For the 2018–19 income year, Pamela does not make a deduction claim for the usual $1,000 for income protection insurance, but instead, when prompted by Inland Revenue, claims a deduction for $100,000. She then confirms this as her correct and complete tax position for the tax year. As the $100,000 claim is far more than Pamela has claimed previously, Inland Revenue may ask Pamela whether this is a mistake. Pamela is on holiday and does not receive the correspondence from Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has reason to believe that the amended information is incorrect. This is because in previous years Pamela has only claimed $1,000 in income protection insurance and her salary has remained roughly the same. Because Inland Revenue cannot get a hold of Pamela, the Commissioner issues a default assessment correcting the deduction claimed to $1,000 and issues a NOPA detailing the change. When Pamela returns from her holiday she sees the correspondence, realises that she made a mistake and agrees to the proposed adjustment. 6. Formal disputes process commencing with a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer or Commissioner As a starting point, it is noted that the Commissioner is unlikely to issue a NOPA in respect of a qualifying individual. As previously discussed, the Commissioner is not required to issue a NOPA to amend a qualifying individual’s tax position post-assessment. Under section 22G(6) the Commissioner can amend a qualifying individual’s final account for a tax year to correct errors in the reportable income information at any time before the end of the time bar period, notifying the individual of the amendment. Although a qualifying individual is able to commence the formal disputes process by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, it is expected that this will happen rarely due to the qualifying individuals having up to their terminal tax date under the new error correction provisions to amend their assessments. Section 22G(3) allows a qualifying individual until their terminal tax date to correct any information in their final account, treating any earlier assessment as not having been made. This provides the taxpayer with a longer period of time to ensure they get their assessment right and allows them to amend their assessment in a much more flexible way than was provided for previously. In the event that a qualifying individual wishes to commence the formal dispute process, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89DA of the TAA. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable “response period” as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner finalised the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. However, this four-month period can change due to the application of section 22G(3), which allows a qualifying individual to amend their assessment at any time up until their terminal tax date, treating any earlier assessment as not having been made. 20 Example 12: Rangi and Siobhan Example 1: Rangi’s pre-populated account was finalised on 15 May 2019 (assessment date) for the 2018–19 tax year. Rangi did not make any amendments to his assessment under section 22G(3) prior to his terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. This means that, if Rangi realised some of his income information was incorrect on 8 February 2020, Rangi would be unable to commence a formal dispute by issuing a NOPA. This is because section 89AB requires the NOPA to be issued within the four-month period starting on the date of assessment, which in Rangi’s case ended on 15 September 2019. It is noted that Rangi is not precluded from requesting an amendment to his assessment under section 22G(8) and section 113. Section 22G(8) provides that, after their terminal tax date, an individual may ask the Commissioner to amend information contained in their final account for the tax year under section 113. This will be discussed on the following pages under the heading “later requests for changes by individuals”. Example 2: Siobhan’s pre-populated account was also finalised on 15 May 2019 (assessment date) for the 2018–19 tax year. Siobhan noticed an error in her income information and therefore made an amendment to her assessment under section 22G(3) on 1 February 2020, which is prior to her terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. This is treated as a new assessment . This means that, if Siobhan realised that further income information was incorrect on 8 February 2020, she would be able to commence a formal dispute by issuing a NOPA. Because her assessment was deemed to occur on 1 February 2020, the applicable response period for issuing a NOPA under section 89D(1) would not expire until 1 June 2020. However, due to the complexity of the formal disputes process, it would be easier for Siobhan to simply ask the Commissioner to amend her assessment using sections 22G(8) and 113. The application of the error correction provisions means that it is unlikely that a qualifying individual will need to use the formal disputes process and issue a NOPA. Should a qualifying individual issue a NOPA, then the disputes process that follows is left unchanged by the transition from the previous rules to the new individuals’ income tax rules. Section 89F governs the information required to be included in a taxpayer’s NOPA. The remaining stages of the disputes resolution process remain unchanged. If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s proposed adjust ment, then the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer as such and issue a notice of response (section 89G(1)). The process then continues as under existing law, and the stages of the disputes resolution process include an administrative phase, disclosure, a potential adjudication and then, potentially, an amended assessment. For a more in depth look at the dispute resolution process see SPS 16/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer, SPS 16/05, Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. 7. Later requests for changes by individuals When an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. Section 113 provides the Commissioner with a discretionary power. The Commissioner will, subject to the time bar, generally agree to amend assessments that are requested when the result can be clearly shown to be correct. In determining whether to exercise the discretion, the Commissioner will evaluate an amendment request using the care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A. For more information see SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. As has already been noted, a taxpayer can amend the information in their final account prior to their terminal tax date by amending their assessment under new section 22G(3) where they are a qualifying individual. If a qualifying individual wishes to amend their assessment after that 21 date, they must request the Commissioner make an amendment under section 113. Although a qualifying individual is not permitted to issue a NOPA after four months post-assessment, they are given a longer period of time, up until their terminal tax date, to amend any errors and the corrected information will constitute a fresh assessment. This provisio n provides more flexibility to the taxpayer by avoiding the highly structured disputes process. Other individuals An individual will fall into the category of “other income” earner where they earn “other inco me” above the $200 de minimis threshold. This means they will be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. This section will cover the following in relation to individuals who earn “other” income: 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the individual 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual (formal disputes process) 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner (formal disputes process) 5. Default assessments 6. Later requests for changes by individuals 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by individuals (Section 22G) Individuals who earn other income can amend income information in their pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised (22G(2)). An individual who earns other income is required to finalise their account by 7 July of the following tax year, or longer if they have an extension of time. 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner (Section 22G) Section 22G(5) provides that pre-assessment the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre-populated account to correct errors. The Commissioner must notify the individual of any amendment and this will typically be done by providing them with the updated informat ion online and in their pre-populated account at the end of the year. 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual Section 22G(8) applies to an individual who is an “other income” earner and has finalised their account per section 22H(2), and wishes to amend their assessment after the account has been finalised. This means that they must either request an amendment from the Commissioner per section 113, or they may choose to issue a NOPA if they are still within the applicable response period. Therefore, to change the assessment, the taxpayer can request that the Commissioner amend their assessment under section 113. Under section 113 the Commissioner has a discretionary power to amend assessments. When a requested amendment can be clearly shown to be correct, such as a simple arithmetic error, the Commissioner will generally agree to the amendment. For more informat ion see SPS 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments. 22 Alternatively, the individual can issue a NOPA but must do so within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that their assessment was made (this occurs when they finalised their pre- populated account under section 22H(2)). The standard dispute resolution procedures then apply. 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner: other individuals (Section 22H) When the Commissioner wishes to make an adjustment in relation to an individual other than a qualifying individual, section 22G(2) requires the Commissioner to issue a NOPA under section 89B (subject to the exceptions set out in section 89C, such as if the taxpayer provides a return with a simple mistake or obvious oversight). The new individuals’ income tax rules therefore make no change to what would have applied under the old rules for the correction of post- assessment errors. For more in-depth guidance regarding the disputes resolution process as commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, see Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/05. Example 13: Ben Ben is a lawyer earning a salary. Ben also owns a rental property and therefore earns rental income as well as his salary. Ben is classified as an “other income” earner for the purposes of the individuals rules. As Ben is not a qualifying individual, if Inland Revenue wished to amend his tax return to increase the amount of tax payable, in most cases a notice of proposed adjustment would need to be issued. 5. Default assessments Section 22I(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that if an individual does not satisfy the Commissioner that the income information in their pre-populated account for the tax year correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year, the date on which the assessment is treated as being made is the date on which the Commissioner provides a default assessment under section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where a default assessment has been made, an “other income” earner can dispute this by: • adjusting their final account under section 89D(2B); and • issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment. The standard disputes resolution process then applies. As advised previously, for a more in depth look at the dispute resolution process see SPS 16/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer, SPS 16/05Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. 6. Later requests for changes by individuals As is applicable to a reportable income earner, where an “other income” individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their applicable response period has expired, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. 23 Categorising individual income earners This section sets out the various groupings that an individual taxpayer may fall into and then, using the above framework as a base, provides a walk-through of what an individual needs to do to meet their obligations in various fact scenarios, and what will happen for them automatically under these new processes. Individuals will be put into one of three groupings which they may move between over time as their income profile changes. The groupings are: • Group A (automated process) – the individual earns “reportable income” and IR determines whether the income information it holds for the person is correct. In these cases, the refund or tax to pay will automatically be calculated, assessed and progressed accordingly (that is – refund or tax bill issued). • Group B – the individual earns reportable income, but IR considers, based on previous returns and other information, that the individual may have other income information that they may need to provide, deductions for example. In these circumstances, the individual will be asked to provide the additional information or confirm that the inco me informat io n held is correct. • Group C – while the individual may have reportable income, it is expected that these individuals will also have other income. Individual’s that fall into this category will then be required to provide income information – similar to the current IR3 process where a return of income is required. This special report will deal with each grouping in turn and provide a walk-through of how the new individual’s income tax proposals will apply to a taxpayer in each respective grouping, drawing on examples to illustrate how the rules will apply. From the outset, it is important to note that where an individual has a tax agent, communication will be sent directly to the tax agent. If the individual wishes to receive communication from Inland Revenue directly, they must change their mail preferences from their agent to themselves either through MyIR or by contacting Inland Revenue. The individuals’ income tax changes for a “Group A” individual This section explains how the new individuals’ income tax changes will apply to a person who falls within “group A”. A “group A” individual is a person who earns reportable income only, for whom Inland Revenue considers that the income information contained in their pre- populated account is correct and complete. This section will cover the following scenarios: 1. Assessment results in a net zero position at year-end 2. Assessments results in a small amount of tax payable that is written off resulting in a net zero position at year-end 3. Assessment results in a tax refund 4. Assessment results in tax to pay 5. Individual amends their pre-populated account pre- assessment 6. Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment 7. Individual amends their final account post-assessment 24 8. Commissioner amends individual’s account post-assessment 9. The individual requests to amend their assessment after terminal tax 10. Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the individual should be in. Scenario 1: “Group A” taxpayer when tax has been withheld correctly and the year-end tax position is a net zero Example 14: Natalia Natalia is on a salary of $70,000 per annum. Her employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. Natalia does not earn any other income. Under new section 22E the Commissioner is obliged to include this income information in Natalia’s pre- populated account for the tax year. Based on the information Inland Revenue holds, the Commissioner is satisfied that this is all of Natalia’s income and finalises Natalia’s tax position in accordance with section 22H(1) at the end of the tax year. Natalia is not required to do anything and is notified of her assessment automatically. The notice of assessment informs Natalia that Inland Revenue has finalised her assessment and that, in her case, she has no further tax to pay and is not due a tax refund. The above example is the most simple under the new individual income tax rules and is the ideal outcome for a taxpayer that solely earns reportable income. The taxpayer has paid the correct amount of tax throughout the year and has not been left with a tax bill or a refund due at year-end. The tax position has been completed for the individual by the Commissioner and a notice of assessment issued accordingly, without the taxpayer having to interact with Inland Revenue to make this happen. When will a “Group A” individual’s assessment be finalised? For most taxpayers with a standard 31 March tax year end, assessments are likely to be finalised between May and June. A notice of assessment will be sent out to the taxpayer when their assessment is calculated, whether electronically or by post. Scenario 2: Assessment for a “Group A” taxpayer results in a small amount of tax payable that is written off resulting in a net zero position at year-end A taxpayer can also reach a net zero position at year-end where they have a small amount of tax payable that is written off under the new write off rules. This will occur automatically without the taxpayer having to do anything. The write off rules will be discussed in greater detail under the “refunds and tax to pay section” of this special report. 25 Example 15: Kaylor Kaylor is a butcher who earns a salary. Kaylor is paid weekly and his employer deducts PAYE each pay day. Last year, Kaylor’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Kaylor earned $1,500 from which Kaylor’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-day. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Kaylor received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Kaylor has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Although Kaylor has a tax shortfall of $175, this will be written off under the write off rules (discussed later). Therefore, just like Natalia in scenario 1, Kaylor is also not required to do anything and will receive a notice of assessment automatically. The notice of assessment will inform Kaylor that Inland Revenue has calculated his assessment and that, in his case, he has no further tax to pay and is not due a refund. Scenario 3: “Group A” taxpayer due a refund at year-end As scenario 1 demonstrates, a qualifying individual’s income tax assessment will be completed without them having to do anything. Example 16: Sophie Sophie earns $35,000 from her main job and $18,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will pay $10,545 in tax. The $10,545 that Sophie pays in tax is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001–$35,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $18,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $5,400. The total tax payable on $53,000 of income is actually $8,920 meaning that Sophie is due a refund of $1,625. Because Inland Revenue has Sophie’s current bank account details, once Sophie’s tax position is finalised at year-end, her refund will be direct credited to her account and her notice of assessment will inform her of the refund that has been paid out to her automatically. If Inland Revenue did not have bank account details for Sophie, the refund would be unable to be direct credited. For this reason, it is important that taxpayers keep their bank account details up to date with Inland Revenue to enable any refund due to be paid out automatically. For the sake of completeness, it is noted that under the new individuals’ income tax rules Inland Revenue could proactively recommend that Sophie adopt a tailored tax code to help fix the over taxation caused by the secondary tax code. Had Sophie accepted this and her pattern of earnings remained the same throughout the year, then she would not have been owed a refund at year-end. This is because the tailored tax code would have ensured that the correct amount of tax was withheld during the year, enabling Sophie to have more money throughout the year. Both “pro-active actions” and “tailored tax codes” have their own sections later in this special report. It is also noted that under the previous personal tax summary rules, a tax payer was required to confirm the correctness of their income statement (PTS) under section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before a refund exceeding $600 could be issued to the taxpayer. Under the new rules there is no refund confirmation threshold and refunds of any amount will be paid out automatically. This means that the $1,625.00 owing to Sophie in the above scenario will be paid out to her without her having to do anything specific to request it (providing that she has updated her bank account details with Inland Revenue). 26 Scenario 4: “Group A” taxpayer with tax to pay at year-end Example 17: Robert Robert is an employee earning wages. His tax position is finalised by Inland Revenue for the 2018–19 tax year and it is determined that he has tax payable of $200 that has arisen due to being on an incorrect tax code for a portion of the tax year. Inland Revenue sends Robert a notice of assessment and also informs him that he has $200 of tax to pay. Robert will have until the terminal tax date of 7 February 2020 to pay this additional amount of tax without incurring any penalties or interest. If Robert has not paid this amount by the terminal tax date, he will be sent a statement of account which will include a late payment penalty and interest owing on the outstanding tax. The above four examples deal with the most common situations that reportable income earners can expect to experience. Although they outline the experience that the majority of “Group A” individuals will have, there are some situations where these individuals will have further interactions with Inland Revenue in order to ensure the correctness of their income tax assessment. Scenario 5: Individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment There are times when, due to an error, an individual’s pre-populated account may not accurately reflect their income position for a tax year. Individuals are therefore encouraged to log into their myIR account during the year to take a look at the information that has been included and make any corrections when necessary. To enable that the new individuals’ income tax rules allow an individual to amend their pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised. Example 18: Charles Charles logs into his pre-populated account for the 2018–19 tax year and notices that there is some income for a job he does not recognise. What has likely occurred is that an employer has input a wrong IRD number when calculating their payroll, resulting in the income incorrectly being attributed to Charles. Under new section 22G(2) Charles is able to amend his pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised, so he contacts Inland Revenue and proposes a correction to the information in his pre-populated account to delete this unknown income source. Scenario 6: Commissioner amends an individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment Although a Group A individual is encouraged to log in to myIR during and after the tax year to review their information, the Commissioner is also able to correct any errors to ensure the correctness of the individual’s income information. New section 22G(5) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre-populated account for a tax year to correct errors. The Commissioner is required to notify the individual of any amendment made. Example 19: Charles Using the example of Charles above, let’s assume that Charles did not log into his pre-populated account and notice the incorrect income information, and instead Inland Revenue became aware of the error. In these circumstances, Inland Revenue would amend Charles’s pre-populated account to correct the error and then send Charles a letter to notify him of the amendment. 27 Scenario 7: Individual amends their account post-assessment A qualifying individual’s pre-populated account will become a final account for a tax year once it is finalised by the Commissioner. New section 22H(1) provides that the Commissioner may finalise the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year once the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year. As previously discussed, when a “Group A” individual amends their final account prior to their terminal tax date, any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. The individual will have until terminal tax to pay any resultant tax bill without being subject to penalties or interest. Example 20: Charles Again, carrying on with the example of Charles, let’s assume that neither Charles nor Inland Revenue noticed that some income information had been incorrectly attributed to Charles and his assessment is finalised for the tax year. Charles logs into myIR to view his income information for the 2018–19 in July 2019, which is after his income tax assessment for the year has been finalised. Charles notices that some income has been attributed to him for a job that he has never worked for. In accordance with new section 22G(3), Charles is able to amend his assessment at any time prior to his terminal tax date. This amendment will be treated as a new assessment and he will have until his terminal tax date to pay any tax outstanding without being subject to penalties or interest. Charles amends his assessment to remove the income information. Inland Revenue contacts the employer in question to seek out the correct IRD number for the employee whose income was mistakenly added to Charles’ account. It turns out the extra income should have been paid to Amelia, one of Charles’s colleagues. She has also had her account finalised by the Commissioner in June. Using new section 22G(6), the Commissioner amends Amelia’s final account to correctly include the missing employment income and withheld PAYE and notifies Amelia of the change made which results in a small refund to Amelia. Scenario 8: The Commissioner amends the individual’s account post-assessment Under new section 22G(6), the Commissioner may amend information in a qualifying individual’s final account for a tax year to correct errors at any time before the end of the time bar period in section 108(1). An amendment made to section 89C(1) ensures that the Commissioner can amend information in the individual’s final account without first having to issue a NOPA. As the time bar period extends for 4 years from the end of the tax year in which the return is furnished, the Commissioner can rely on this provision to amend the taxpayer’s assessment after their terminal tax date. 28 Example 21 On 1 March 2021 Inland Revenue discovers, following an audit, that a large employer had been incorrectly accounting for PAYE since the introduction of pay-day filing rules in April 2019. The mistakes resulted from an error in the coding of the payroll software that the employer uses. Inland Revenue works with the employer over the next few months to identify the extent of the error and finds that, in total, approximately $7.5 million was mistakenly misreported during the period April 2019–March 2021. The company employs 325 staff across New Zealand and Inland Revenue sets about checking the assessments for the affected employees. Upon reviewing the assessments, Inland Revenue discovers that the vast majority of the company’s employees are qualifying individuals for whom assessments for the year ended March 2020 had been finalised. To correct the errors made in each of the finalised accounts for these employees, Inland Revenue recalculates the corrected tax positions and amends the final accounts as per section 22G(6). Some employees receive additional refunds which are immediately direct credited, and others small tax bills for which the employees are given additional time to pay as per section 142AB. For the remaining minority of affected employees who have “other income” and therefore filed returns for the March 2020 year-end, the Commissioner relies on section 22G(8) instead. To amend the assessments, the Commissioner contacts each employee and provides proposed adjustments. Finally, because the March 2021 assessments have not yet been finalised the Commissioner, uses section 22G(5) to correct the pre-populated accounts of all of the employees and to reverse the mistake in the reported employment income information. Scenario 9: The individual requests an amendment to their assessment after the terminal tax date There are some circumstances where a qualifying individual can utilise the formal disputes process to request an amendment to their assessment after their terminal tax date. As previously discussed, this could occur where a taxpayer has amended their assessment under section 22G(3) at some point prior to their terminal tax date and, by virtue of this action resulting in a fresh assessment, the taxpayer may still be within the relevant response period to issue a NOPA. The above will only occur in rare cases. Usually where an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, they can do so under section 22G(8). Section 22G(8) allows the individual to ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. The Commissioner will accept the amendment where she is satisfied that the suggested amendment is clearly correct. There are instances where the Commissioner would refuse to exercise her discretion to amend an assessment under section 113. This could include where the proposed adjustment is merely arguable or involves disputed facts or statutory interpretation or where a taxpayer is attempting to circumvent the disputes process. For further information please consult SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 29 Example 22: Caleb Caleb works as a mechanic and earns wages. For the last pay period of the 2018–19 tax year, Caleb received an end of year bonus of $800. This bonus is treated as a lump sum payment and is taxed in accordance with the extra pay rules. Although the payment was only $800, an error occurs which results in the payment being remitted to Inland Revenue as a $900 payment. This means that, as far as Inland Revenue is concerned, Caleb has been undertaxed. His employer withheld tax based on an $800 payment when, according to the information remitted to Inland Revenue, Caleb was paid $900. Caleb is not aware of this error. When his tax position is finalised on 1 June 2019, Caleb has a small amount of tax payable. This amount is under $50 and therefore written off under section 22J. Caleb becomes aware of the error on 15 March 2020, which is after his terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. Although the error has not had any material effect on the amount of tax Caleb had to pay for the tax year, Caleb wants his tax position to be accurate. Under section 113 Caleb requests that the Commissioner makes an adjustment to Caleb’s tax return for the 2018–19 tax year. The Commissioner uses her discretion under section 113 to correct this error. Scenario 10: A taxpayer with “other income” is miscategorised as a “Group A” Inland Revenue uses the information it knows about a taxpayer to determine which grouping that taxpayer is put into. It is acknowledged that in some situations Inland Revenue may not get this completely right. Example 23: Keith Keith earns a salary of $70,000 per annum. This is the only type of income he has earnt for several years. On 1 March 2019 he buys a rental property but does not tell Inland Revenue. Sometime in May 2019, Inland Revenue automatically finalises Keith’s tax position. This is because Inland Revenue is satisfied, based on the information held for Keith, that he is solely a reportable income earner. The income Keith earns from the rental property is “other income” and will need to be included in Keith’s end of year income tax assessment. Keith has been treated as a qualifying individual by Inland Revenue. This means that under new section 22G(3) Keith has until his terminal tax date (generally 7 February of the following year) to amend his assessment without being subject to penalties or interest. When Keith receives notification from Inland Revenue in May that his end of year tax position has been finalised, he promptly logs into his myIR and amends his assessment to include the rental income information and confirms this as his final tax position for the year. Under section 22G(3) this is treated as a new assessment and Keith has until terminal tax to pay any outstanding tax. Example B Drawing on the example above, if we assume that Keith informed Inland Revenue about his rental property prior to Inland Revenue finalising his assessment, then Keith would be recategorised as a “Group C” person for the purposes of the individual’s income tax rules. In accordance with section 22H(2), this means that Keith would have until 7 July 2019 to provide other income information, correct any errors and finalise his account as correct and complete. If Keith has not finalised his account by this date, then he will be subject to a late filing penalty and Inland Revenue may eventually issue a default assessment under section 106. 30 Walkthrough of the individual’s income tax changes for a “Group B” individual This section sets out some common scenarios that a “Group B” individual may find themselves in and explains how the new law applies. A “Group B” taxpayer is a qualifying individual who earns reportable income and who may have provided additional information in prior years’ assessments, such as claiming an allowable deduction. For Group B individual, Inland Revenue considers, based on previous returns and the other information it holds about the individual, that they may have other income information to provide. In these circumstances, the taxpayer’s assessment will not be immediately finalised by the Commissioner but will be “suspended” for a period of time to give the individual an opportunity to provide this further information if applicable. Scenario 1: When a pre-populated account may be temporarily suspended to give the individual an opportunity to provide additional information The types of information that would result in an individual being subject to a suspended process are set out in section 22F(3) and the relevant table in schedule 8. As per that section, an individual may provide information for a tax year on amounts set out in schedule 8, part A, table 2. Table 2 provides that an individual may provide additional information on the following: 1. A deduction. 2. A tax credit carried forward under section LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. A tax loss balance, or tax loss component, other than a tax loss component under section LE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4. A donations tax credit. 5. An amount of income protection insurance. Inland Revenue will contact an individual if it appears that the individual may have some additional information to provide. This will be informed by whether the taxpayer may have had or claimed expenses, credits or losses in prior tax years and any other relevant information that Inland Revenue holds in respect of the taxpayer. This means that if an individual wishes to claim expenses but has not done so in the past, the onus will be on the individual to contact Inland Revenue or update their pre-populated account before it is finalised to include this information. If they fail to do this prior to their assessment being finalised by the Commissioner, they would have to apply the relevant error correction processes in order to include the additional information. When an individual provides a valid expense claim or deduction, this will lower the individual’s liability for the tax year. Therefore, there is an incentive for the individual to respond to the Commissioner’s query about additional information. Although there are limited deductions available to individuals earning reportable income, Inland Revenue intends to provide an opportunity for taxpayers who it considers likely to have such deductions an opportunity to claim them before their account is finalised for them. Inland Revenue will therefore utilise what it knows about an individual to make it easier for the individual to provide the relevant expense information, when applicable, rather than having to use post-assessment correction provisions to add this in after the account is finalised. 31 Example 24: Rohit Rohit is a salary earner who works as a scientist. Inland Revenue knows that in previous tax years, Rohit has claimed a deduction for income protection insurance. Inland Revenue therefore has reason to believe that Rohit may intend to claim this deduction for the current tax year as well. Instead of automatically calculating Rohit’s income tax assessment, Inland Revenue notifies Rohit via myIR that he has previously claimed income protection insurance and may wish to do so again this year. Inland Revenue give him a period of time to respond. If Inland Revenue has not heard from Rohit at the conclusion of the given period, Inland Revenue will progress on the basis that Rohit does not have any income protection insurance to claim for this tax year and will finalise his assessment based on the information in his pre-populated account. If Rohit responds confirming that he has this information, his assessment will be calculated using the information he provides and confirms as his complete and correct position for the tax year. Certain types of other income, such as ACC attendant care payments and expense information in relation to schedular payments, will also be subject to this suspended auto calculatio n process. For example, where an ACC beneficiary is receiving personal service rehabilitation payments and on paying that to their personal carer (known as an ACC attendant care payment), Inland Revenue would require the ACC beneficiary to provide information regarding how much was passed on to the caregiver. Individuals may also have to provide additional income information to Inland Revenue on an interim basis until the changes in the recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Emplo yment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 take full effect. These changes introduced in that Act will require investment income payers to provide detailed information to Inland Revenue about the income paid to individuals from these sources (“reportable income”). During the transit ional period, if Inland Revenue records indicate that qualifying individuals have in the past returned dividends or Maori authority distributions, then these individuals may also initially be prompted to provide this additional information in order to complete their assessments. Walkthrough of the individuals’ income tax changes for a “Group C” individual This section explains how the new individual’s income tax changes will apply to a person who falls within “group C”. A “group C” individual is a person who, although they may have some reportable income, is expected to have other income. Individuals that fall into this category will not be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. This section will cover the following scenarios: 1. A standard assessment for a group C individual 2. Individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment 3. Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment 4. Individual wishes to amend their final account post-assessment 5. Commissioner amends individual’s final account post-assessment 6. The individual requests to amend their assessment after terminal tax 7. Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the income earner should be in. 32 Scenario 1: A standard assessment for a group C individual Example 24: Mike Mike is a doctor on a salary of $200,000 per annum. His employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. Mike also owns a portfolio of rental properties which provides him with additional rental income of $100,000 per annum. This represents all of the income Mike earns for the 2018–19 tax year. As rental income comes under the definition of other income in section 22D(4) and Schedule 8 Part A table 1, Mike is categorised as an “other income” earner. This means that, under section 22H(2) Mike must, as an “other income” earner, provide his other income information to Inland Revenue. Mike is then required to review the information in his pre-populated account and finalise his account for the tax year by confirming it as correct and complete by the due date in section 22H(4) (usually 7 July unless Mike is entitled to an extension of time). Mike logs into myIR on 15 May 2019, provides his other income information, and then finalises his account as correct and complete. By finalising his account, Mike has filed his tax return for the 2018–19 tax year. Mike would have until the terminal tax date to pay any applicable tax due, or if in a refund position would receive his refund shortly after his account is finalised. The above example sets out the assessment process for an “other income” earner. All of the “reportable income” that an individual earns will be provided to Inland Revenue by way of third-party reporting and will be included in the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year. If an individual earns income that falls under the definition of “other income” in section 22D(4) and Schedule 8 Part A table 1, they are required to provide this information and finalise their tax position themselves. An individual who earns both “reportable” and “other income” must ensure that the information included in their pre-populated account is correct and complete before they confirm their end of year assessment. If the individual wishes to file their return shortly after the end of the tax year, and before Inland Revenue will have received all reportable income information from the relevant third parties, they must ensure that they include this information in their tax return. It follows then that it may be easier for an “other income” earner who also earns “reportable inco me” to wait until Inland Revenue has complete “reportable income” information before filing their return. “Reportable income” information will likely be completed by shortly after 15 May following the end of the tax year. Example 25: Mike Let’s assume that instead of logging into myIR on 15 May 2019 to provide his other income information and finalise his tax position for the tax year, Mike logs into myIR on 1 April 2019 to provide his “other income” information and finalise his tax position. In this situation, it is unlikely that the last few pay periods from Mike’s salary as a doctor will have been pre-populated. This means that, if Mike wishes to finalise his tax position for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 April 2019, Mike will need to provide this information himself. Mike provides his other income information and then commences a review of all of the information that is included in his pre-populated account for the tax year. As expected, Mike realises that the last few pay periods of salary and wage income are missing. Mike logs out of myIR and sets a reminder in his Calendar to log back in on 15 May 2019 to review and confirm his income information for the tax year. 33 Scenario 2: How an individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment An individual who earns other income can amend their income information in their pre- populated account at any time before it is finalised (section 22G(2)). As above, an individual who earns other income is required to finalise their account by 7 July of the following tax year, or later if they have an extension of time. Example 26: Mike Let’s assume a further variation of example 25 above which deals with Mike as a salary earner who also has rental income. Under this variation, Mike does the following: 15 May: Mike logs into myIR and provides his rental income for the tax year. Mike does not finalise his account at this point as he had some repairs done on his property during March 2019. Mike is waiting for the invoice for this work so that he can claim a deduction against this income. 20 May: Mike receives an invoice from the builder who performed the repair work on his property for $8,000. Mike logs into myIR and claims this as an expense against his income. Mike then finalises his return accordingly by confirming his income information as correct and complete under section 2H. Scenario 3: Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment As is applicable to individuals who earn reportable income, section 22G(5) also allows the Commissioner to amend information in an “other income” earner’s pre-populated account for the tax year to correct errors. This must be done prior to the account being finalised and the Commissioner is required to notify the individual of any amendment made. Example 27: Sally Sally is 17 years old and still at school. She is passionate about animals so works part time at a local charity that rehomes stray dogs. Sally earns a salary of $10,000 per annum. Sally is so passionate about animals that she decides to donate $12,000 to her local charity. She makes this donation on 15 March 2019. Sally logs into myIR on 1 May 2019 to add a donation tax credit claim of $12,000. Sally also runs a lemonade stand at her local netballing club and updates her pre-populated account to include the additional $2,000 income that she earnt from that during the tax year. Sally does not yet confirm her income information as complete, as she wants her dad, who is an accountant, to check that she has inputted the information correctly. Sally’s dad is on holiday in India so is unable to check over the information until he returns on 1 June 2019. In the meantime, Inland Revenue notices that Sally has claimed donation tax credit for $21,000, despite the receipt provided stating that a $12,000 donation was made. In these circumstances, Sally has clearly made a typing error. The amount claimed is incorrect. Inland Revenue make a provisional amendment to Sally’s donation tax credit claim to ensure that the claim is $12,000 and matches the receipts provided. Inland Revenue notify Sally of the update via myIR. When Sally’s dad returns from India he checks over her pre-populated account for the tax year and confirms that the information is correct. Sally finalises her account accordingly. Scenario 4: Individual amends their final account post-assessment When an “other income” earner wishes to amend their final account post-assessment, they must request that the Commissioner makes an amendment as per section 113, as discussed above. Alternatively, they may be able to issue a NOPA if the applicable timeframes have not lapsed. The taxpayer’s NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that 34 the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). Example 28: Mohammed Mike’s cousin, Mohammed, runs an online business selling vintage clothes. He sells items through his personal website and also through a Trade Me account. When Mohammed finalised his account for the 2018–19 tax year, he included $5,000 worth of sales on his Trade Me account that were his own personal items, a second- hand TV and a leather lounge suite. Mohammed’s Trade Me account lists thousands of items for sale per year and when filing his return Mohammed had forgotten he had used his business account to sell these personal items which led to the items being included in his return by mistake. Mohammed finalised his account for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 June 2019. Mohammed realised he had made a mistake on 15 September 2019. This is still within the valid response period as set out in section 89AB. Mohammed wishes to make an adjustment to his tax return. He completes a NOPA requesting that $5,000 be excluded from his taxable income as assessed for the 2018–19 tax year and sends it to Inland Revenue. Scenario 5: Commissioner amends individual’s final account post-assessment Section 22G(7) requires the Commissioner to issue a NOPA under section 89B (subject to the exceptions set out in section 89C, such as when the taxpayer provides a return with a simple mistake or obvious oversight) before amending an assessment for an “other income” earner. This is consistent with the settings in place prior to the new rules being introduced. Example 29: Ben Ben is a salary earner who owns a large amount of rental property. Ben also claimed some expenses against his income for the 2018–19 tax year for repairs carried out on one of his rental properties. Ben finalised his tax position for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 June 2019. On 8 August 2019, Inland Revenue does an audit on one of Ben’s accounts and discovers that he has incorrectly categorised the installation of insulation in one of his properties as a repair and has claimed that amount as an expense. As the property was previously uninsulated, the amount should have been treated as an improvement and capitalised. In accordance with the requirements in section 22G(7), the Commissioner issues Ben with a NOPA under section 89B. Scenario 6: The individual requests an amendment to their assessment after the terminal tax date If an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. The Commissioner will progress the amendment if she is satisfied that the suggested amendment is clearly correct. The purpose of this provision is to clearly signpost to the taxpayer what mechanisms will exist under the law for an individual earner to amend their assessment after the terminal tax date. Section 22G(8) does not limit the use of section 113 more generally. The Commissioner may consider a request under section 113 at any time (such as after the expiration of the time period for issuing a NOPA but prior to a taxpayer’s terminal tax date, for example). 35 Example 30: Mike Mike got a builder in to do repair work on one of his properties and the builder sent Mike a bill for $8,000 in May 2019 for the work he had quoted for and completed in March 2019. Mike had accrued this cost but had accidentally keyed in $5,000 instead of $8,000. He didn’t notice this when he was providing his tax information for the year so he only claimed a $5,000 expense, but he paid the builder the $8,000 in May. Mike discovered his earlier error when he was reconciling his accounts for the 2019–20 year. As this was an expense that related to the 2018–19 income year, Mike asks the Commissioner to amend his assessment in accordance with section 22H(4). As the amendment is clearly correct, the Commissioner agrees to use her discretion to make the change. Scenario 7: Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the income earner should be in There are two ways in which Inland Revenue can miscategorise which “group” an individual income earner should be in. The first is where the Commissioner treats the taxpayer as a qualifying individual in circumstances where the individual actually earns “other income”. The second is where the Commissioner treats an individual as a person who earns “other income” when they are actually a “qualifying individual”. An individual who is actually a qualifying individual will always be able to take advantage of the rules that apply to qualifying individuals. However, section 22G(3) also provides that an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. Extending this to miscategorised “other income” earners ensures that they are not disadvantaged by any miscategorisation. Example 31: Ousmane Ousmane works for a florist earning wages. The only income information Inland Revenue has received in relation to Ousmane for the 2018–19 income tax year is this wage income, and his earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information in Ousmane’s pre-populated account is correct and complete. His account is therefore finalised on 1 June 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue do not know is that in February 2019 Ousmane started his own business creating and selling gift baskets. For the 2018–19 tax year, Ousmane earnt an additional $3,000 income from this side business. This is classified as “other income”. As an “other income” earner with a standard balance date, Ousmane is required to finalise his account by confirming that the income information in his pre-populated account is correct and complete by 7 July of the following tax year (section 22H(4)). However, by virtue of being treated by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual, Ousmane can, under section 22G(3), provide this information by as late as his terminal tax date of 7 February. As previously advised, Inland Revenue auto calculated Ousmane’s tax position on 1 June 2019. As long as Ousmane logs into his myIR to provide his “other income” information and finalise his account before 7 February 2020, this will be treated as a fresh assessment for the purposes of the individuals’ rules. The assessment that resulted when Inland Revenue finalised Ousmane’s account on 1 June 2019 will be regarded as not having been made. Ousmane will have until his terminal tax date to pay any resultant tax bill and will not be subject to any penalties or interest (this means that if he finalises his account right before terminal tax, the payment date will be almost immediate). 36 REFUNDS OF TAX AND AMOUNTS OF TAX TO PAY Sections 22F, 22J, 22IB and Schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sections RM 2, RM 4, RM 5, RZ 15 and RZ 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Sections MD 1, MD 1B and MD 1C of the Income Tax Act 2004. Sections MD 1, MD 1B and MD 1C of the Income Tax Act 1994. Several amendments have been introduced to improve the process for issuing refunds and advising individuals that they have tax to pay or are due a refund. New write-off rules have also been introduced to reduce compliance costs and improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system. Together, these changes will simplify the rules so that more individuals can understand their obligations and meet those with minimal effort. Changes have also been made to the refund provisions for back years. As the law previously limited Inland Revenue’s ability to refund some credits, these amendments will allow for these amounts to be managed and refunded. Background Under the previous law, individuals were responsible for determining whether they were required to file a return, or whether they needed to take any action to finalise their tax position. 1 Taxpayers who were not required to file returns did not have their tax positions squared up automatically. If these taxpayers wanted to determine whether they had tax to pay or were due a refund, they were required to interact with Inland Revenue (by requesting a personal tax summary, for example). Non-filing taxpayers could be selective and, based on their summary of earnings, request a personal tax summary only in years in which a refund was due. This approach did not accord with the Government’s objective of making tax simpler for individuals, and there was an integrity concern with taxpayers being able to choose to obtain refunds but not be obligated to crystallise amounts of tax to pay. Under the new rules, if an individual who is not required to provide additional information is due a refund or has tax to pay, then Inland Revenue will complete this process for them. Refunds will be paid out without an individual having to interact with Inland Revenue to request them and Inland Revenue will contact individuals and inform them of any amounts of tax to pay. To improve the integrity and fairness of the system, new write-off rules have also been introduced. The objective behind these write off rules is to reduce compliance costs and ensure that individuals who have done everything they reasonably could to meet their obligations are not surprised by a tax bill at year-end. 1 A person was not required to file a return if they, in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria, derived $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax had not been withheld or had been withheld incorrectly (see section 33AA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). 37 Key features The changes are as follows: New individuals’ income tax changes • Inland Revenue will determine whether individuals who are not expected to be required to provide information to Inland Revenue are entitled to a refund or have tax to pay. • Refunds will be paid out without individuals having to request them. • Inland Revenue will issue income tax refunds by direct credit (provided customer bank account information is up to date), but not if that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable. • Write-off rules have been introduced that will be reversible if the taxpayer no longer meets the requirements to receive the write-off. These rules provide that when an individual has only earnt reportable income: − Amounts of tax payable that do not exceed $50 will not have to be paid. − Amounts of tax payable that arise due to an extra pay period where that income has been taxed at the correct rate will not have to be paid (subject to exclusions). − Amounts of tax payable that arise at year-end when an individual’s income is derived solely from an income tested benefit, education grant or payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension will not have to be paid. • An amendment has also been made to allow a list of prescribed persons to supply income and expense information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer if no executor or administrator is appointed. Changes to allow refunds to be made for back years • The refund provisions have been amended for back years to ensure that they are clear and unambiguous, that there is consistency across time periods and to allow previously time barred refunds to be paid out. • An amendment has been made to ensure that there are mechanisms in the law to allow for credits owed to deceased taxpayers under the previous law, to be refunded. • Inland Revenue will allow certain prescribed persons to provide “other income” information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer from 1 April 2019 to ensure assessments can be completed on behalf of deceased taxpayers in the year of their death. 38 Application date(s) The individuals’ income tax proposals apply from 1 April 2019, with the exception of the write- off rule for income derived from an extra pay period which applies from 1 April 2020. The amendment to the refund provisions to ensure consistency for back years applies retrospectively for the period 1 October 2004 until 31 March 2013. The amendment to allow a list of prescribed persons to confirm an income statement on behalf of a deceased taxpayer applies retrospectively for the period that the law on income statements was in force, being 1 April 2000 until 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis No obligations to provide information: de minimis and certain other amounts New section 22K sets out the circumstances in which an individual will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue. 22K(1) provides that an individual will not have to provide information for a tax year if the individual derives other income below a $200 de minimis threshold. Example 1: Max Max works in an office as an analyst, earning $70,000 per annum. Max’s first anniversary with his girlfriend is coming up, and Max really wants to buy her a necklace. Unfortunately for Max, their anniversary falls shortly after they have been away on holiday and Max has spent all of his money. Max visits the beach on the weekend and sees a bunch of people riding about and having fun on Feijoa scooters. Max enquires further and finds out that he can make some additional money as a Feijoa scooter recharger. The task involves collecting Feijoa scooters that are running low on battery, recharging them at home and taking them back to a designated area. Max loves the beach and lives just across the road from a Feijoa “drop off” point. Max eagerly signs up as a recharger, hoping to make enough money for the necklace and have some fun in the sun at the same time. After a weekend of recharging Feijoa scooters, Max checks his Feijoa app and finds that he has earned $188 for his weekend of work. Max goes out and buys the necklace and lets Feijoa know that he will no longer be recharging for them anymore. As the amount of other income Max has earned is under $200, and this is the only additional income Max has earned during the tax year that has not been subject to withholding, Max does not have to return this income in accordance with new section 22K. Example 2: Jamie Jamie works as a ranger at the local wild life park, earning $50,000 per annum. His best friend, Bateson, is going away for three months and pays Jamie $250 to keep his lawns and garden in shape while he is away. As this amount is above $200, Jamie will need to provide this income information to Inland Revenue and pay tax on this income. 39 Threshold for refunds or tax payable It was initially proposed that the $5 refund threshold in section 174AA(b) would be removed. This threshold meant that refunds lower than $5 did not have to be paid out and removing the threshold would require all refunds to be paid out regardless of amount. This change was not enacted and the existing $5 threshold in section 174AA(b) will remain. While the intention is to move to issuing tax refunds by direct credit, there will still be a need to issue cheques in the short term. Although the $5 threshold will be retained legislatively, Inland Revenue are currently expecting to refund amounts lower than $5 but will not yet refund very small amounts. Write-off rules for individuals In accordance with new section 22J and new schedule 8, an individual who only earned reportable income will be able to qualify for a write off in certain prescribed circumstances. These are: • if the amount of tax payable is no more than $50; • if the amount of tax payable is derived solely from certain income tested benefits; or • if the amount of tax payable is derived solely from an extra pay period. Example 3: Max and Jamie Drawing on our two examples above: Max: Although Max’s Feijoa scooter earnings fall under the definition of “other income”, the amount is less than $200. Because this is below the de minimis threshold, Max is deemed to be an individual who only earns “reportable income” and therefore will qualify for a write off where he meets the criteria. Jamie: Jamie has $250 of “other income”. This means that Jamie is no longer an individual who only earns “reportable income” and is therefore discounted from the write off rules. New section 22J(2) also provides that these write-offs will be reversible where a taxpayer no longer meets the requirements to receive the original write off, whether that be through a subsequent reassessment or otherwise. 40 Example 4: Dan Dan is a prison warden and earns $50,000 per annum. When his father died, he was left an inheritance of $20,000. Dan has this in a low risk term deposit with his local bank and earns 5% interest per year. When Dan set the term deposit up he used the most appropriate RWT rate for his expected income, which was 30%. On 1 April 2018, Dan is promoted at work to senior warden, and now earns $70,000 per annum. This means that Dan’s marginal tax rate is now 33% and therefore, 33% is the appropriate RWT rate for Dan to be on to ensure that his interest income is taxed correctly. Dan remains on the 30% RWT rate for the entire 2018–19 tax year. It follows that the $1,000 in interest that he earns from his term deposit would have been under withheld by $30, leaving him with tax to pay of $30. When the new individuals’ income tax changes kick in on 1 April 2019, Dan, as a reportable income earner who has never had any other income, has his assessment finalised by the Commissioner. This leaves Dan with a $30 tax bill, but this is written off automatically as it is under $50. After Dan’s tax position has been squared up, Dan realises that he fixed his neighbour’s car in March and was paid $1000 for his handy work. Dan logs onto myIR and makes an amendment to submit the $1,000 of other income. Dan’s tax position is recalculated, and he has a tax bill of $360.00. This is comprised of 33% tax on $1000 at Dan’s marginal rate (or $330) and, because Dan is now no longer an individual who solely earns reportable income, Dan no longer meets the requirements for the $30.00 write off he received. The write off is therefore reversed as per new section 22J(2). The following flowchart provides a brief overview of how the write off rules operate. The write off rules, and the number of exceptions that apply to them, will be discussed in greater detail over the following pages. 41 42 a. Where an individual only earns reportable income and tax payable is not more than $50 (Schedule 8, Part B, clause 1(a)). Part B clause 1(a) in new schedule 8 provides that when an individual who only earns reportable income has tax payable at year-end that is no more than $50, that amount of tax will not be required to be paid. If the amount of tax payable is greater than this amount, the entire amount payable must be paid unless another one of these rules applies. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that individuals who have had about the right amount of tax deducted will not have a tax bill at year-end. As interest income will now be included in a taxpayer’s income and tax calculation, the addition of the $50 write off essentially maintains the position where undertaxed interest income was not required to be reported provided it was less than $200. Example 5: Sarah Sarah works part time at a local café for 20 hours per week while she is at school. Sarah finishes school in December and carries on working part time over the summer. When summer ends, Sarah asks to increase her hours to full time. As the café is unable to offer Sarah full time hours, Sarah obtains another job at a local childcare centre, also for 20 hours per week. Both jobs pay her $25.00 per hour. Sarah commences her job at the childcare centre on 22 March and elects an “M” tax code. This now means that both Sarah’s job at the café and her job at the childcare centre are on the M tax code, instead of adopting a secondary code. When an M tax code is used for concurrent sources of income, there will be multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates and therefore tax to pay at year-end due to this overuse of the lower tax brackets. This is an incorrect tax code for Sarah to be on. In Sarah’s case, as both jobs are on the M tax code she is paying $68.65 in tax from each job (excluding ACC earner’s levy) per week. This amounts to $137.30 and less than the $165.76 that she should be paying if she were taxed at the right rate. As Sarah is being taxed at the incorrect rates for only one week, being the last week of the tax year, she will have tax to pay at year-end of $28.46. As this not more than $50, the tax will not be required to be paid as per schedule 8 clause b part 1(a). For the sake of completeness, it is also worth pointing out that, as Inland Revenue receives information by wa y of pay day reporting, Sarah’s use of incorrect tax codes will be picked up early in the following income year. As the income she receives from her two jobs crosses an income tax threshold, a tailored tax code would be more appropriate for her as opposed to a secondary tax code. Inland Revenue would therefore contact Sarah and recommend she selects a tailored tax code. If Sarah did not consent to this, Inland Revenue would instruct her second employer to adopt a secondary code – as using two M codes is an incorrect use of tax codes. In Sarah’s case she would be better off accepting a tailored tax code as this will ensure about the right amount of tax is deducted during the year. (b) All income from income-tested benefits When an individual receives all of their inco me from an inco me tested benefit, education grant or a payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension (or a combination of these), and an amount of tax payable arises at year-end, then this amount will not have to be paid by the individual. The purpose of this rule is to deal with an apparent under-withholding of PAYE in the situation where a person may receive a payment for a back-year entitlement. 43 Example 6: Cameron Cameron is a 64-year-old beneficiary and is in receipt of a benefit for part of the 2018–19 tax year. Cameron turns 65 on 1 November 2018 and begins receiving NZ Superannuation from that date. It transpires that Cameron is owed a back-paid benefit entitlement due to being underpaid in a previous tax year. In the event that the calculation of the tax payable on this back payment led to a tax bill at year-end, that tax would not need to be paid by Cameron. This is because, for the purposes of schedule 8, part B, clause 1(b) of the TAA, this constitutes an amount of tax that relates to reportable income derived solely from income sources in clause 1(b). For the purposes of this rule, it does not matter that Cameron derived income from a combination of the sources listed in clause 1(b) (in his case a benefit and NZ superannuation). (c) Extra pay period in the corresponding income year If an individual who only earns reportable income which has been taxed at the correct rate has tax payable at year-end that has arisen solely because of an extra pay period, then that amount of tax owing will not need to be paid. Example 7: Sam Sam is an employee earning salary income which is paid weekly and from which his employer deducts PAYE each pay day. Last year Sam’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Sam earned $1,500 from which Sam’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-day. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Sam received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Sam has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Sam would not be required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what it knows about Sam. There would be no reason to suggest that Sam needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue, as Sam only earns reportable income which has been taxed at the correct rate, he will not have to pay the extra tax that has arisen due to the extra pay period. Exclusions (Schedule 8, part B, clause 2) As mentioned above, there are three categories under which a reportable income earner may be eligible for a write off. These are: • if the amount of tax payable does not exceed $50; • if the income is derived solely from certain income tested benefits; or • an amount of tax to pay on income derived from extra pay period in the income year The purpose of schedule 8, part B, clause 2 is to set out the exclusions that apply to these write off rules. If the amount of tax payable does not exceed $50 As per Schedule 8 Part B clause 1(a), tax payable that does not exceed $50 will be written off. This applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer has complied with any other obligations. The 44 purpose of this rule is to ensure administrative efficiency and to ensure consistency with the de minimis threshold for the provision of other income information (currently set at $200). There are no exceptions to this rule. If the income is derived solely from certain income tested benefits In order to qualify for a write-off under this rule, a taxpayer’s income must be derived solely from an income tested benefit, education grant or a payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension. It is acknowledged that there may be instances when an individual who qualifies under this rule may earn a small amount of additional income which should not necessarily disqualify them fro m a write-off. Schedule 8 Part B clause 3 provides that, despite the rule, the Commissioner may write off an amount of tax if the amount is not substantial and represents an underpayment of tax that is attributable to a function or operation of the tax collection rules. Example 8: Cameron As mentioned in example 6, Cameron is a beneficiary and receives $250 per week (gross), or $13,000 pa. Cameron received a call from MSD informing him that they had miscalculated his entitlement for the 13–14 tax year and that he was owed $3,000. As Cameron’s income was derived solely from an income-tested benefit, it was concluded that Cameron’s $210 tax bill would be written off. Consider a modification to that scenario whereby, instead of solely deriving his income from an income tested benefit, Cameron also had a small amount of money in an interest-bearing bank account. In that situation, although Cameron’s income is no longer solely derived from an income-tested benefit, Schedule 8 Part B Clause 3 would kick in to ensure that Cameron still received the write off. The threshold set under Schedule 8 Part B Clause 3 will be set administratively. The other exception that applies to the write off rule for income derived solely from certain benefits, is the Working for Families Tax Credit (WfFTC) exception under Schedule 8 Part B Clause 2(1). This means that, if the taxpayer receives WfFTC, they will be unable to receive a write off under this rule. If the income is derived from an extra pay period in the income year As with the two above rules, if a taxpayer receives WfFTC, the taxpayer will not be eligible for a write-off of income derived from an extra pay period (see Schedule 8 Part B Clause 2(1). The application date for this extra pay rule is deferred until 1 April 2020. 45 Example 9: Sophia Sophia works at a meat processing plant and earns $38,000 per annum. She has 5 kids and her husband stays at home to look after them. Sophia is also a recipient of WfFTC. Because of the day on which she is paid, Sophia receives 53 weekly pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days for weekly earners). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days in a tax year, Sophia has a tax shortfall of $28.88 from her PAYE income at year-end. (She received $38,731 salary income in the tax year, but her weekly PAYE was based on $38,000). Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) provides that an amount of tax that arises solely because an individual has an extra pay period will be written off. However, the exclusion in clause 2(1) of this Part provides that a taxpayer will not qualify for an extra pay write off where the taxpayer has been assessed as receiving an entitlement and tax credit under the family scheme (receives working for families). This means that Sophia would ordinarily have to pay the $28.88 shortfall that arose as a result of the extra pay. However, in this case, because the amount is still under $50.00, it will be written off as per Schedule 8 Part B clause 1(a). A taxpayer will also not qualify for a write off under this rule if, for the types of income referred to in Schedule 8, Part B, clause 2(3): • the Commissioner has recommended, and the individual has consented to a change to a higher tax code or rate; or • the individual has used a tailored tax code. The types of income listed in Schedule 8, Part B, clause 2(3) are: • any income where the obligations of the individual under the PAYE rules are not met; • investment income where RWT is withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate; • schedular income, income from employment that is an extra pay or secondary employment where tax has been withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate; • an amount of income derived from a Maori authority distribution or derived using the EDW or CAE code where the individual’s gross annual income is more than $48,000; and • employee share scheme income where the employer has not elected to withhold tax 46 Example 10a: Thomas Thomas works as an accounting intern and earns $40,000 per annum. Thomas also has a $100,000 inheritance which he has invested in a term deposit with his local bank yielding him 4% interest pa. At the time Thomas deposited the money, 17.5% was the most suitable RWT rate for his interest income. Thomas leaves his intern position and takes up a position at another accounting firm as an analyst, starting 1 April 2019. Thomas’s new salary is $78,000 per annum. Although Thomas’s marginal tax rate for the 2018– 19 income year will be 33% due to his new job, Thomas forgets to update his RWT rate with the bank. Inland Revenue notices that Thomas’s salary has increased and that 33% is a more appropriate RWT rate for him to be on for his interest income. Inland Revenue picks this up by way of a proactive action and on 20 April suggests that Thomas consents to an increased RWT rate. Thomas consents to the change. Because of the day on which Thomas gets paid for his new job, he receives 53 weekly pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days for weekly earners). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days in a tax year, Thomas has a tax shortfall of $175 from his PAYE income at year-end (he received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) provides that an amount of tax that arises solely because an individual has an extra pay period will be written off. However, the exclusion in clause 2(2) of this Part provides that a taxpayer will not qualify for an extra pay write off when the Commissioner has recommended, and the individual has consented to, a change in tax code or rate to a type of income in clause 2(3). The Commissioner recommended a change to Thomas’s RWT rate and Thomas accepted this change. RWT on investment income that is withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate is listed in clause 2(3). This means that Thomas will have to pay the $175 shortfall that arose as a result of the extra pay. He will also have some tax payable on his interest income to account for the period of time where he commenced his higher paying job but was still on the unsuitable RWT rate of 17.5% for his interest income. For the sake of completeness, it is also noted that if Thomas had rejected the proactive action and had remained on the 17.5% interest rate for his investment income he would still have the same amount of tax payable at year- end. This is because Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) requires the amount of tax payable to arise solely from the extra pay period in order for it to be eligible for a write off. In Thomas’s case, there is also an amount of tax payable that has arisen due to the use of an unsuitable RWT rate at a time where his taxable income has increased (by virtue of the new job). Thomas is therefore not eligible for any form of write off. 47 Example 10b: Paul Paul works two days per week as an engineering consultant for a small technology start up and is paid $35,000 per year. Paul starts another job for two days per week, on 1 April, as a project manager on a large building site and earns $25,000 per year. Because Paul’s secondary income crosses an income tax threshold, Paul should ideally be on a tailored tax code for his project manager salary to ensure that about the right amount of tax is withheld during the year. Paul initially elects an “M” tax code when he starts his job as a project manager. If an M tax code is used for concurrent sources of income, there will be multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates resulting in tax to pay at year-end due to this overuse of the lower tax brackets. This is an incorrect tax code for Paul to be on. Inland Revenue notice that Paul is on an incorrect tax code, and by way of a proactive action, suggest that he adopt a tailored tax code for his second job. Paul adopts the tailored tax code after 4 weeks. Because of the day on which Paul is paid by the technology start up, Paul will have 53 pay periods in the year. Paul will therefore receive some income that has not been subject to the correct withholding and will have a tax shortfall at year-end. Paul will also have a small amount of tax payable to account for the period of time during which his second job (project manager) was also using the lowest tax rate. Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) requires the amount of tax payable to arise solely from the extra pay period in order for it to be eligible for a write off. Although Paul has some tax to pay that has arisen due to his extra pay, he also has a small amount of tax to pay due to being on an “M” tax code for part of the year for his project manager salary. Paul is therefore denied the write off. Example 10c: Paul (variation) If we consider a variation of the above example with Paul, but instead of Paul selecting an “M” tax code when he starts his second job as a project manager, Paul sets up a tailored tax code from the outset. This means that a more appropriate amount of tax will be withheld from his project manager salary throughout the year. Although Paul will receive an extra pay from the technology start-up which will not be subject to withholding, he will be eligible for a write-off of this amount. This is because the amount of tax payable has arisen solely due to the extra pay period. Moreover, although Paul has used a tailored tax code, the tailored tax code was not applied to secondary employment earnings from which tax was withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate. In this case, the tailored tax code was applied to the secondary employment earnings from the beginning of the tax year and was therefore always withheld at the correct rate. Schedule 8 Part B clause 3 provides that, despite the exceptions, the Commissioner may write off an amount of tax if the amount is not substantial and represents an underpayment of tax that is attributable to a function or operation of the tax collection rules. Order in Council amending schedule 8 – 22J(3) New section 22J(3) provides that amounts of tax may be added to or removed from schedule 8 part B, clause 1 and 2 by Order in Council. Schedule 8 Part B clause 1 sets out the types of tax payable that must be written off under the individual’s write off rules. Clause 2 sets out when an amount of tax does not qualify for a write off under clause 1. In accordance with section 22J(4), appropriate consultation must be undertaken on the proposed amendments before a Minister recommends a change by Order in Council. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that there is flexibility in the law to deal with any unforeseen or changing circumstances in a timely manner without having to go through the full legislative 48 process to make a change. As consultation is a requirement under 22J(4), this will ensure that differing views are considered adequately on any given proposal. Changes to the refund provisions for back years This section of this special report outlines changes made to the refund provisions for back years. Although these changes are not part of the substantive proposals under the new individuals’ income regime, these changes are important to ease the transition between the previous law on income statements and the new rules for individuals. Amendments to section RM 2 and its predecessors for refunds of overpaid tax Section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and its prior equivalents (MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) have been amended to simplify the section and to alleviate an ambiguity regarding the application of the time bar to various tax types (for example – income tax vs ancillary taxes and approved issuer levy). An amendment has also been made to section RM 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which deals with overpayments on amended assessments, to ensure that the time bar application is unambiguous in this section as well. More significantly, the Act inserts section RZ 16 into the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MD 1C into the 2004 and 1994 Income Tax Acts. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that RM 2 and its predecessors apply consistently for back years. The way that section RM 2 currently applies limits a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund from an amended assessment to a four-year period, but the ability to claim a refund from the original return is unlimited. This is consistent with the policy intent. There is a period during which this section and its predecessors restricted a taxpayer’s ability to claim from an original return to four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. The purpose of the amendments, which are retrospective in nature, is to ensure that the section applies consistently across all time periods and allow for previously time barred refunds to be paid out. Example 11: Adam Adam is due a tax refund of $40 for the 2007–08 tax year. Inland Revenue does not have any contact details or a bank account for Adam and is unable to pay out the refund. Inland Revenue sends a letter to Adam’s last known address advising him of the refund and asking him to contact Inland Revenue with bank account details. Adam eventually receives the letter via a forwarding service six years later and calls Inland Revenue for the refund. The refund is time barred and is unable to be paid out to Adam. This is because the law that applied for the 2007–08 tax year restricted a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund to a four-year period. It is noted that had the same situation occurred for the 2003–04 tax year, Adam would be able to claim the refund at any point in the future. This is because the restrictive application of the provision did not apply at this time. The amendments made to these refund provisions ensures that refunds are treated consistently across all periods. This enables old refunds, such as the one in Adam’s situation, to be paid out. 49 Repeal of section RM 5 and new provisions to govern the treatment of certain refunds made on income statements for back years This Act repeals section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, along with all other law pertaining to income statements. Section RM 5 required a refund over a certain threshold to be confirmed as correct by the taxpayer before it could be paid out. The application of section RM 5 meant that, when a taxpayer died, and no administrator or executor had been appointed, nobody could legally confirm the deceased’s income statement as correct. This meant that the refund would sit in Inland Revenue’s system indefinitely and could not be refunded. New section RZ 15 has been added into the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MD 1B into the 2004 and 1994 Income Tax Acts to address this issue. These amendments allow for someone to act on behalf of a deceased person to confirm the refund when that person has died, no executor or administrator has been appointed and the refund amount is less than $15,000. Example 12: Juliet Juliet is due a tax refund of $800 for the 2015–16 tax year. In accordance with the requirements in section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, Inland Revenue sends Juliet a letter requesting that she confirm the correctness of her income statement. This is necessary before the refund can be paid out. Juliet dies before receiving the letter. Juliet dies intestate (without a will). Her estate is not worth much money, so there is not a sufficient incentive for her relatives to apply for letters of administration to deal with her estate (this can be costly and time consuming). The law that applied prior to these amendments meant that nobody could legally confirm the correctness of Juliet’s income statement. This meant that the refund could not legally be released. The amendments in this Act allow for relatives to confirm the correctness of an income statement to ensure that refunds owing to a deceased taxpayer are able to be paid out. Provision of income information for deceased taxpayers In order to ensure that the new individuals’ income proposals work effectively, new subsections 22F(5) and (6) provide a mechanism through which certain prescribed persons can provide income information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer. Similar to the situation set out above in the example with Juliet (which exists under the old law), under the new individuals’ income tax rules it is important to ensure that income information is provided to Inland Revenue for a deceased taxpayer so that the taxpayer’s tax posit ion can be finalised. The inclusion of these new provisions makes it easier for Inland Revenue to finalise the account of a deceased person. 50 Example 13: Adam Adam works in an office and earns salary and wages. He also has three rental properties and has previousl y filed IR3 returns. Upon the introduction of the individuals’ income tax changes for the 2018–19 tax year, Adam starts providing this “other income” to Inland Revenue so that his tax position can be can be finalised at year- end. In 2022 Adam sadly passes away without a will. As there is no executor, no one can step into Adam’s shoes and officially deal with his affairs. To ensure that his tax position can be resolved, new section 22F(5) and (6) allow the Commissioner to accept income information from a prescribed list of persons, such as relatives, to finalise Adam’s tax position. 51 PROACTIVE ACTIONS Sections 24DB and 25A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to enable Inland Revenue to take proactive actions during the year to help people use appropriate tax rates or codes to minimise year-end debts and refunds. Background Previously, if an individual was using a tax code which they were not entitled to use, Inland Revenue would contact their employer and instruct that the code be changed. If an individual was using a code that was not wrong per se, but did not reflect their likely year-end tax liability, Inland Revenue lacked the relevant information to suggest corrective action. This would result in a debt or a refund at the end of the year when the individual squared up their tax position. One of the key objectives of the changes to individuals’ income tax is to ensure that individuals pay about the right amount of tax during the year, thereby minimising instances where there is a large debt or refund at year-end. To support this objective, Inland Revenue will utilise the more frequent employment and investment income information it receives to suggest corrective action where projections suggest that an individual is likely to end up with a material under or overpayment of tax because of the withholding rate they are using. This means that Inland Revenue will now contact an individual who is either on an incorrect or an unsuitable rate or code. The difference is that an individual can choose not to accept the change when their current code or rate is merely an unsuitable one. Suggesting that individuals adopt more appropriate rates will improve how secondary and irregular sources of income are taxed and strengthens the overall perception that the tax system operates fairly throughout the year. Key features The changes are as follows: • Inland Revenue will monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify when they may be using an incorrect or unsuitable tax code or rate. • Inland Revenue will contact individuals who use an incorrect or unsuitable code or rate and recommend they change it. • If the individual consents to the change in code or rate, Inland Revenue will notify the employer or payer to update the code or rate. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis In order to understand what these amendments aim to achieve, it is important to appreciate the distinction between an “incorrect” tax code and an “unsuitable tax code”. An individual’s tax 52 code will be deemed incorrect when they are using a tax code that they are not entitled to use (for example – if a taxpayer has a student loan but is on an “M” tax code instead of “M SL”). The current position under the law will remain unchanged for incorrect tax codes and Inland Revenue will continue to contact the individual’s employer and instruct that the code be changed. An “unsuitable” tax rate or code is used to describe situations where an individual is using a code they are eligible to use, but when projections suggest that the individual is likely to end up with an under or overpayment of tax. Use of unsuitable tax codes – Section 24DB Under this section, if an individual who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, Inland Revenue may recommend a prospective change to the tax code and, with consent of the individual, notify the employer of the change. Example 1: Susanna Susanna earns a salary of $42,000 per annum. Her current tax code is “M”, which is a code that she is entitled to use. Given that Susanna earns below $44,000, she is entitled to the full independent earner tax credit of $520 per year. In order to obtain this tax credit Susanna would need to be on an “ME” tax code or, if she has a student loan “ME SL”. As a result of the changes, Inland Revenue would contact Susanna and let her know that an “ME” tax code would be a more appropriate code for her to be on. If Susanna consents to the change, Inland Revenue will instruct her employer to update her tax code to “ME”. The new tax code would apply to PAYE income earned after the employer has been instructed to change the tax code or rate. Use of unsuitable RWT rates – Section 25A Section 25A provides that Inland Revenue may contact an individual regarding their use of an unsuitable tax rate for their investment interest income and recommend a prospective change to a more suitable RWT rate. If the taxpayer consents to the change, Inland Revenue will notify the investment income payer. Once notified of the rate change, the investment income payer must update this as soon as reasonably practicable. If the taxpayer subsequently notifies the income payer of a different rate, the payer must apply the rate notified by the taxpayer. 53 Example 2: Thomas Thomas set up an interest-bearing bank account ten years ago. He selected the 17.5% tax rate, which was right at the time. Thomas earns more now than he did ten years ago, so in order to have tax deducted at the most appropriate tax rate he should have increased the tax rate, but he didn’t think of this. Thomas earned $1,000 of interest this year, from which his bank withheld $175 of tax. Because Thomas’ marginal tax rate has increased to 33%, $330 would have been a more appropriate amount to withhold (33% tax rate). As his tax rate was not updated, Thomas will be required to pay $155 of outstanding tax ($330 - $175) at the end of the year because less tax was withheld from his interest income than is ultimately due on that interest income. Due to the changes, Inland Revenue could contact Thomas and let him know that 33% is likely to be a more appropriate tax rate for his interest income. If Thomas consents to the change, Inland Revenue will instruct the bank to change the rate to 33%. 54 TAILORED (SPECIAL) TAX CODES Sections 24D and 24DB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to enable Inland Revenue to help individuals use tailored tax codes to ensure that the rate of withholding tax on their income, including secondary sources of income, is appropriate during the year. Background A special tax code, now referred to as a tailored tax code, applies a tailored rate of withholding to a taxpayer’s income. When a person is working multiple jobs or working while receiving a benefit from the Ministry of Social Development, a tailored tax code can help ensure that the individual pays about the right amount of tax during the year and is not left with a large tax bill or refund at year-end. Although secondary tax codes and special tax codes were available to individuals under previous law, there were several limitations with that system that are rectified by this Act. Secondary tax codes Secondary tax codes are intended to ensure that income from a subsequent job is taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Example 1: George and Mary George has one job with a salary of $53,000 on which he will pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 of tax paid on the first $14,000 of income at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001-$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and $1,500 from $48,001–$53,000 taxed at 30%. Mary earns $48,000 from her main job and $5,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will also pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001–$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $5,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $1,500. The above example demonstrates that secondary tax codes will work as intended when an income tax threshold has not been crossed. However, as we have a progressive personal tax scale, secondary tax codes can result in more tax being withheld during the year than is necessary to satisfy the individual’s tax liability. This occurs when income from a second job takes a person’s total income over a tax threshold. Example 2: Sophie Sophie earns $35,000 from her main job and $18,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will pay $10,545 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001–$35,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $18,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $5,400. Sophie will be owed a refund of $1,625 at the end of the tax year. Example 2 above results in an overpayment of tax because, by taxing the entire $18,000 that Sophie earns from her second job at her marginal tax rate of 30%, the secondary tax code 55 operates to deny Sophie the full use of the middle tax band. In her case, only income from $14,000 – $35,000 was taxed at 17.5%, as opposed to income from $14,000 – $48,000. Secondary tax codes are set at a taxpayer’s marginal rate to prevent multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates for people with multiple sources of PAYE income. If it weren’t for secondary tax codes, taxpayers may receive an unexpected tax bill at the end of the year. Consider example 3 below: Example 3: Sophie If Sophie used an “M” tax code for both of her jobs, then the following would apply: Job 1 (salary of $35,000): $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001-$35,000 taxed at 17.5% = $5,145. Job 2 (salary of $18,000): $1,470 paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5% and $700 tax paid on income from $14,000- $18,000 taxed at 17.5% = $2,170 Total tax paid = $7,315 (compared with $8,920 that should be paid by somebody earning $53,000). Sophie will have tax to pay of $1,605 at the end of the tax year. As example 3 demonstrates, Sophie would have a tax bill of $1,605 at year-end if she used the M tax code for both of her jobs. Secondary tax codes are a somewhat blunt instrument designed to prevent over and under deductions from arising as they can only apply at a taxpayer’s marginal rate. This works where the secondary income doesn’t cross a tax threshold but causes the taxpayer to overpay tax if it does cross a threshold. Secondary tax codes are still used as the default option as they work in the majority of cases and because a more blended or tailored rate cannot be applied by default without knowing a taxpayer’s pattern of earnings. In order to limit instances of incorrect withholding, individuals who work multiple jobs and are able to estimate their likely annual income could opt for a tailored tax code, which gives a withholding rate that is tailored to their personal circumstances. Tailored (special) tax codes Although the previous system allowed an individual to apply for a special tax code to help ensure that the correct amount of tax was withheld during the year, special tax codes were not easily accessible to all individuals. This was because: • an individual first needed to know about special tax codes; • they needed to realise that using one could benefit them; and • they needed to be able to estimate their likely annual inco me. The process for obtaining a special tax code was also administratively burdensome and required an individual to fill out an application and post it to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would then calculate the appropriate withholding rate and grant the individual a special tax code and a certificate that was only valid until the end of the tax year. The individual was then required to advise their employer that they wanted the special tax code applied to their income. As a consequence of all of this, only approximately 8,000 individuals used a special tax code for the 2016 year (approximately 570,000 people were using secondary tax codes and a larger proportion of these people could have benefitted from using a special tax code if their secondary income took them over a tax threshold). 56 Key features The newly enacted provisions make tailored tax codes more accessible and customer centric. The changes are as follows: • The process of applying for a tailored tax code has been simplified (including being able to apply online). • Inland Revenue will monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify when a person may benefit from using a tailored tax code. • Inland Revenue will proactively contact individuals who may benefit from using a tailored tax code and recommend that they consider changing their code. • When an individual has consented to a change to a tailored tax code, Inland Revenue will notify an individual’s employer of their updated tax code. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Tax codes provided by the Commissioner – Section 24D Section 24D has been amended to allow the Commissioner to recommend a tailored tax code to an employee. The amendment to this provision ensures that Inland Revenue can recommend tailored tax codes as part of the proactive actions it undertakes. That is, where the information Inland Revenue receives about an individual suggests that the individual may end up with an under or overpayment of tax because of the withholding rate they are using, the Commissioner can recommend a tailored tax code to help the taxpayer to pay the right amount of tax during the year. Use of unsuitable tax codes – Section 24DB As previously mentioned under “proactive actions”, when a taxpayer who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, section 24DB allows Inland Revenue to recommend a prospective change to that code, and with the consent of the individual, notify the employer of the change. A change to a more suitable code includes a change to a tailored tax code. 57 Example 4: Sophie The following example demonstrates how a proactive action could be used to assist Sophie in selecting a tailored tax code. As per the previous example, Sophie earns $35,000 per annum from her main job and $18,000 per annum from her second job. The secondary tax code that applies to her second job means that all income she earns from this source is taxed at her marginal tax rate of 30%. Sophie’s tax year commences 1 April 2019. Inland Revenue receives Sophie’s salary and tax information by way of pay day reporting and, after a few weeks, notices that Sophie has a regular pattern of earnings that is currently being overtaxed. As set out in the initial example with Sophie, if the current rate of taxation continues, Sophie will be owed a refund of $1,625 at year-end. This is money that Sophie could be using during the year. Inland Revenue writes to Sophie to advise her that she may benefit from a tailored tax code. The aim behind the tailored code is to ensure that, where possible, there is no refund due or tax to pay at year-end. This means that the tailored rate of tax required to be applied to Sophie’s secondary income will vary slightly based on the point during the tax year at which it is adopted. This is because the tailored tax code should take into account any under or over withholding that occurs at any point during the tax year to try to reach a net zero position at year-end. Consider the following variations: Example 4a Inland Revenue writes to Sophie twelve weeks after the commencement of the tax year and Sophie immediately consents to a tailored tax code. Assuming Sophie is paid weekly, in this situation Sophie would have received twelve pays from her second job from which tax had been over withheld, representing an over withholding of $375. To ensure that Sophie has no tax to pay or refund due at year-end, the tailored tax code that would need to be applied to Sophie’s second source of income going forward will be approximately 18%. As Sophie has consented to this rate, Inland Revenue will instruct the employer at her second job to update the rate. Example 4b Although Sophie receives Inland Revenue’s letter suggesting she accept a tailored tax code twelve weeks into the tax year, Sophie does not get in contact with Inland Revenue to set up a tailored tax code for a further six weeks. This means that Sophie will have received 18 pays from her second job from which tax had been over withheld, representing an over withholding of $562.50. For Sophie to have no tax to pay or refund due at year- end, the tailored tax code that would need to be applied to Sophie’s second source of income going forward will be approximately 16%. Example 4 above demonstrates that, in order to ensure that a taxpayer pays about the right amount of tax during the year, a tailored tax code needs to not only consider pay periods going forward, but also needs to consider any under or over withholding that occurred earlier in the tax year. It is noted that there are some situations where it may not be appropriate to use a tailored tax code to ensure a “net zero” position at year-end. For example, a tailored tax code that fully recovers the underpaid tax would be unsuitable if a taxpayer has had their tax under withheld and there are not enough pay periods left until the end of the year to correct the under withholding without putting the taxpayer into hardship. Inland Revenue will take this into account when deciding whether it’s appropriate to recommend a tailored tax code to a taxpayer. This should prevent any hardship caused by imposing a very high tailored rate for any remaining pay periods for the tax year. 58 THE ADMINISTRATION OF DONATIONS TAX CREDITS Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been introduced to simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits. Inland Revenue will now accept donation receipts which are submitted electronically via myIR and submitted during the year. There is the option to file a separate donation tax credit claim if the payer chooses to do so. Background Previously, credits for donations could be claimed at the end of the tax year by filling in a tax credit claim form (IR526), or during the year through Payroll Giving, where the credits would be received immediately. An IR526 is a paper-based form, and paper versions of receipts had to be saved and submitted with this form at the end of the year. These changes simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits and make it more flexible. Under the changes, they have the option to submit receipts electronically when they receive them, which reduces the risk that they could be forgotten or lost before being able to be submitted. The tax credit claim process (the IR526) will be retained as an option for those who prefer to file their donation tax credit claim separately. At year-end, if a person has submitted donation receipts during the year and Inland Revenue considers the person is entitled to the donation tax credit, the refund will be issued without the need to submit a tax credit claim request. Key features The key changes are as follows: • Donations receipts can be submitted during the year and can be submitted electronically. • Donations tax credits can be claimed as part of the income tax year-end process. • If an individual has already submitted receipts during the year, these will automatically be taken into account without the individual having to fill in a separate claim form. Application date These amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Returns by persons with tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts (section 41A amended) Section 41A(1) prescribes the ways in which a person may apply to have their tax credit refunded. In practice, a person may: • upload donation receipts through myIR during the year; • complete the relevant donation section when providing other income information through the pre-populated account; 59 • complete a separate return online through myIR (that is – if done after other income information is provided); or • complete a paper form. Example 1: Olivia Olivia is crazy about animals and always donates money each week to a local animal charity that campaigns outside her office building. Olivia is tax savvy and always ensures that she receives a receipt with each donation. Under the changes, Olivia does not have to wait until the end of the year to submit her receipts with the paper based IR526 form at the end of the year. Each time she donates, Olivia uploads her receipts electronically on myIR. At year-end Olivia receives the refund automatically without having to do anything. Section 41A(6B) ensures that donation tax credit claims are subject to the same time bar rules that apply to income tax returns. This means that the Commissioner cannot amend a tax credit claim (either adjust up or down) after 4 years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer submits the donation tax credit claim.
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Simplifying tax administration – individuals’ income tax The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 has introduced changes that will simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and will help people to use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. This special report provides early information on the new rules and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the May 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. The following items are covered in this special report: • The year-end income tax obligations of individuals. • Refunds and tax to pay. • Pro-active actions. • Tailored (special) tax codes. • The administration of donations tax credits. 2 OVERVIEW Subpart 3B, sections 24B, 24D, 24DB, 25A, 33,41, 41A, 89C, 89D 92, 106, 108, 108B, 110, 111, ,120C, 141JA, 143, 173L, 184A, 227G and schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Sections LB 7, RM 2, RM 4, RM 5, RZ 15, RZ 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New rules have been introduced to simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and to help people use more appropriate rates of withholding during the year. The key changes: • enable Inland Revenue to proactively help individuals to use the most appropriate tax rates or codes; • enable the use of tailored tax codes to improve the way that secondary sources of income and irregular patterns of income earning are taxed; • simplify the year-end income tax obligations of individuals; • enable the automation of refunds of tax and amounts of tax to pay; and • improve the administration of donations tax credits. Other miscellaneous amendments have also been made to ensure the individuals’ income tax changes are integrated smoothly into the tax system. These include changes to the refund provisions and the time bar. Application date The changes apply from 1 April 2019 and the end of year processes apply to the tax year ended 31 March 2019 and later income years. 3 THE YEAR-END INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS Subpart 3B, sections 33, 37, 41, 89C, 89D, 92, 106, 108, 108B, 110, 111, 143, 173L, 184A, 227G and schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of amendments have been made that will simplify the end of year income tax obligations of individuals and some of the processes that Inland Revenue performs. All section references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background In previous tax years, the year-end processes for individuals required Inland Revenue to determine whether or not individuals who earn PAYE income should be issued with a personal tax summary (PTS) containing their PAYE income information or whether they ought to be filing a tax return. If an individual was not sent a PTS by Inland Revenue, they could request one. If an individual did not get a PTS or did not file a tax return, their tax position would not be squared up. This meant that any refund available or amount of tax payable would not be calculated, and the amount of tax the individual had to pay for the tax year would simply be based on what had already been withheld. When a PTS was issued, if the refund amount was less than $600, it was treated as confirmed after two months and the refund would be paid out. If the refund was greater than $600, the taxpayer was required to confirm the PTS as correct before the refund would be paid. As the PTS only includes salary and wage information, individuals were required to add in income from other sources, such as interest income or dividend income. Sometimes an individual would need to gather this information from several payers even though these payers may have also provided this information to Inland Revenue directly. An IR3 tax return was required where the individual had other types of income such as business income or foreign sourced income, or if they wished to claim deductions or tax credits. As a result, a large number of individuals would choose to interact with Inland Revenue through PTS intermediaries, perhaps because of a lack of awareness of how to directly claim any available refund directly from Inland Revenue. PTS intermediaries assist taxpayers with refund claims and typically charge a percentage of the refund or a fixed fee for the service they offer. If an individual instead applied directly to Inland Revenue, they would receive the full amount of their refund. It was also possible for an individual to work out whether they were due a refund or had tax to pay by requesting a summary of earnings before they requested a PTS. Generally, taxpayers who had requested a summary of earnings were not then required to request a PTS, with the result that a PTS was typically only requested when refunds were due. Key features The end of year income tax process changes will mean that more individuals will have an end of year square up, with more refunds or bills of tax to pay being issued as applicable. Under the new rules, Inland Revenue will do most of the work by pre-populating as much information about an individual’s income and tax credits as possible into the individual’s pre-populated account. This account will contain income information for all the types of income that are subject to regular reporting to Inland Revenue, such as PAYE income, which is referred to as “reportable income”. 4 This pre-populated account forms the basis for the calculation of the individual’s tax position (refund or tax to pay). If the Commissioner is satisfied that an individual’s income information as set out in their pre-populated account is correct and complete, Inland Revenue may finalise the individual’s account for the tax year. Some individuals will be required to provide additional information on their “other income” (income other than their reportable income) which may not be contained in the pre-populated account and will be able to provide information on deductions and tax credits when relevant. This additional information will be added to the individual’s pre-populated account and will form part of the individual’s self-assessment. This means that, generally, individuals who only earn reportable income will not have to do anything, and Inland Revenue will automatically issue them with a refund or tax bill once the account is finalised. Only individuals who earn other income or have deductions that Inland Revenue does not already know about will have to provide further information to Inland Revenue and file tax returns. New error correction provisions and processes provide simpler ways for individuals and Inland Revenue to adjust the information if they become aware that an account is incorrect. This can be done before an assessment has occurred or after subject to the time-bar rules. The key changes are as follows: • Inland Revenue will make pre-populated accounts available to individuals containing the relevant income information for the tax year. • If the Commissioner is satisfied that the information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records the individual’s income for the year, Inland Revenue will calculate the refund or tax to pay without the individual needing to provide any additional information. • Inland Revenue will pay out refunds without the individual having to confirm the tax position that Inland Revenue has calculated. • Individuals who earn other income will be required to provide income information other than reportable income to Inland Revenue subject to de minimis rules before an assessment can be completed. • Individuals will be able to provide other relevant information such as deductible expenses and relevant tax credit information to Inland Revenue. • Individuals will be required to provide or correct reportable income if they know, or might reasonably be expected to have known, that the reportable income amount should properly be included in their final account. • An individual’s tax assessment will arise once they have confirmed the tax information is complete, when the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is correct and complete, or if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete and issues a default assessment. • Individuals and Inland Revenue will be able to make corrections to the information held if they become aware that it is incorrect or incomplete and there will be error correction processes for adjustments made before and after an assessment has occurred. 5 • Qualifying individuals, being those who only earn reportable income, will be able to amend their assessment at any time up until their terminal tax date without being exposed to penalties or interest. • The end of year income tax process will replace the current PTS process and will replace the IR3 tax return immediately for online filers and over time for any paper filers as the paper IR3 is phased out. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 tax year. Detailed analysis Key terms – Section 22D Inland Revenue will make a pre-populated account available for an individual for the tax year which will include the relevant income information that Inland Revenue holds about the individual. The individual’s tax assessment will crystallise once this pre-populated account becomes a “final account” in accordance with these new rules. Individuals will be grouped based on the type of income they earn. Whether an individual is a “qualifying individual” or not influences the way in which the individual’s tax posit ion is finalised, their obligations and the concessions they may be eligible for. The key terms below are defined in section 22D. Individual The new individuals’ income tax changes apply to “individuals” as defined only. New section 22D(1) defines an individual as a natural person. This definition includes a natural person who is non-resident, unless their only inco me is non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. This is necessary to exclude individuals who are not New Zealand taxpayers under existing law. Deceased natural persons are also excluded from the date of their death. Legal persons, such as companies, are not subject to the new provisions and must fulfil their tax obligations under existing law. Income definitions The income earnt by individuals is categorised as either “reportable income” or “other income”. Reportable income Reportable income is defined in new section 22D(3). Reportable income is income that Inland Revenue receives regular information about, typically from third party payers such as employers, during the income year or by 31 May following the end of the relevant tax year. This includes PAYE income payments, along with resident and non-resident passive income. Importantly, new section 22D(3)(b) states that income will not be “reportable income” if the payer of the income, for example an employer or bank, does not have the individual’s tax file number. Where recipients of reportable income do not ensure that their payers have their tax file number, they will be obliged to provide Inland Revenue with the relevant income information. 6 Example 1: Roger Roger gets his first job at the local library in his town. His new employer tells him he needs to obtain an IRD number. Roger applies for and receives an IRD number but forgets to give it to his employer. The payroll staff at the library do not follow up with Roger about his IRD number and pay him his wages and account for the PAYE to Inland Revenue. Roger decides he does not like working at the library and resigns from his job after a month. He then starts work at a local café and provides his new employer with his IRD number. At the end of the tax year, Inland Revenue will prepare a pre-populated account for Roger but cannot include his wages from the library. That income, although paid to Roger and reported to Inland Revenue, may not be able to be allocated to him without an IRD number. The account therefore only contains his wages from the café. In this case, although Roger only earns PAYE income, which is generally a type of “reportable income”, the wages he earned from the library are treated as “other income as the requirement to provide the employer with his IRD number was not met. This means Roger is obliged to contact Inland Revenue to provide this information. An exception to this rule exists for income which is earned jointly, such as interest income of holders of joint bank accounts, if the Commissioner is able to allocate the amounts as between the individuals. This could be the case where two individuals own a bank deposit investment in equal shares, and the Commissioner is made aware that the interest earned from the deposit is to be allocated on that basis. Other income Per section 22D(4), “other income” is an individual’s income other than their reportable income. Schedule 8, Part A, table 1 lists the types of “other income” that must be reported to Inland Revenue. These include: • income from a New Zealand estate or trust; • income with a foreign source; • income from a partnership; • inco me fro m a look-through company; • income from rents; • inco me fro m self-employment; • employee share scheme income that is not reportable income; and • other income, including income from a disposal of property that is not otherwise included in reportable income. In accordance with new section 22K(1) an individual has no obligation to provide information for a tax year if they derive $200 or less of other income in the corresponding income year. Qualifying individual The distinction between the types of income an individual earns is important because it determines obligations under the new individuals’ income tax process. Section 22D(2) introduces the term “qualifying individual” which means an individual who only earns reportable income for an income year and has no other income information that must be 7 provided to Inland Revenue. Qualifying individuals have different obligations from other individuals and are eligible for certain concessions. These concepts will be explained in greater detail later in this special report. Pre-populated account New section 22D(5) defines a pre-populated account as one provided by Inland Revenue to an individual for a tax year containing the reportable information held by the Commissioner, including any income information provided by the individual; and quantifying the amount of reportable income and other income derived by the individual for the income year. New section 22E(1) requires Inland Revenue to include in the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year the information that Inland Revenue holds with respect to reportable income and other income that the Commissioner considers has been derived by the individual for the tax year. This requirement is limited to the extent that the information is both available and relevant to the individual’s assessment for the tax year (section 22E(2)). Section 22E(3) provides that an individual who has no reportable income for a tax year may ask the Commissioner to make a pre-populated account with a zero balance available so that they can provide their income information for the tax year. In practice, an individual can go into their income summary online via myIR and add their income type (for example, self- emplo yment income) and select a start date. Once the individual has updated their income sources the account will be created for them to complete. Section 22M requires Inland Revenue to establish an electronic form and means of communication as well as a non-electronic form or mode of delivery to allow an individual to provide other income information to Inland Revenue. This will enable taxpayers to submit informat ion either electronically or by post which will be populated into the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. Final account Section 22D(6) defines a final account as a pre-populated account that has been finalised under section 22HB. Section 22I(1) provides that a final account is treated as a return of income and an income tax assessment. In accordance with 22I(2), the assessment is treated as being made on the date on which the individual’s pre-populated account is finalised for the tax year. The way in which a pre-populated account is “finalised” will be discussed in greater detail later on in this special report. An individual’s income tax assessment (sections 22F, 22H and 22I) The purpose of this section is to explain how an individual’s income tax assessment arises, and to explain the obligations an individual may have in relation to this assessment. This section will consider: • an individual’s obligations to provide information (section 22F); and • finalising accounts and the assessment process (sections 22H and 22I). 8 Information requirements – Section 22F Before an individual’s tax position can be finalised, it is important to ensure that the individual’s pre-populated account accurately records the individual’s income for the tax year. Section 22F outlines the circumstances in which an individual must provide income information to Inland Revenue. This explains to individuals what their obligations are and when they do not have to do anything. Qualifying individual A “qualifying individual” is generally not required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue and in most cases their tax position will be squared up automatically without them having to do anything. Example 2: John John earns a salary of $70,000 per annum. His employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. John does not earn any other income. Per section 22E, the Commissioner includes this income information in John’s pre-populated account for the tax year. As Inland Revenue has no information that suggests John might be earning other income or reason to suspect the reportable income is incorrect, the Commissioner is satisfied that the information set out in John’s pre-populated account correctly and completely records his income for the tax year and, at the end of the tax year, finalises his account in accordance with section 22H(1). John is not required to do anything and will receive an email notification informing him that his notice of assessment is available via myIR. The notice of assessment informs John that Inland Revenue has calculated his assessment and that, in his case, he has no further tax to pay and is not due a tax refund as the correct tax was withheld by his employer. Although in most cases a qualifying individual will not be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue, section 22F(2) provides an exception for an individual who knows or might reasonably be expected to have known that an amount of income should properly be included in their final account for the tax year, but it is not. In that case the individual will be obligated to provide that information to Inland Revenue. 9 Example 3: Adam Adam works part-time at the local supermarket, and as he really loves cars and is a keen mechanic, in his spare time he fixes cars for his friend Brad’s auto garage. Adam gave Brad his IRD number and tax code when he first started at the garage, but he is not sure whether Brad accounts properly for any PAYE on his earnings as Brad is not an accountant and he’s never seen a pay slip. But since he gets such a good wage and Brad is a mate, he just never asks Brad about it. In July Adam mentions his recent tax refund to Brad, as he was so impressed it was sorted for him by IR, and Brad tells him that he doesn’t account for any PAYE on what he pays Adam for his work at the garage. When he gets home that day Adam is worried that not enough tax is being paid, so he logs in to his myIR account to check his earnings for the previous tax year. Sure enough he can see his supermarket earnings are correctly recorded, but the account does not show any of his income from the garage. In this case the income he has earned as a mechanic is untaxed reportable income, and Adam knows that there is income missing (the earnings from the garage) section s22F(2) applies. This puts an obligation on Adam to tell IR about his missing income. If he does not tell IR Adam would be breach of s22F(2) as he knows, or might reasonably be expected to have known, that an amount of income should properly be included in his final account for the tax year but is not. In this situation, Adam should inform Inland Revenue of the income information that is missing from his account. It is an absolute liability offence under section 143(1)(b) to not provide the Commissioner with information when required by law. Accordingly, Adam will be subject to penalties and interest on this undisclosed income if he does not inform Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue later finds out about the income. If the Commissioner considers an individual’s account is incorrect or incomplete despite containing all the relevant reportable income information, for example because the Commissioner believes the individual has other income which needs to be included, she would not finalise the account. Instead, the individual’s assessment will be “suspended” for a period of time and the Commissioner will contact the individual to ask them to provide this further information. This will be discussed in greater detail later in this special report. “Other income” earner If an individual earns “other income”, section 22F(1) requires that individual, subject to the $200 de minimis threshold in section 22K(1), to provide to the Commissioner their “other inco me” information for the tax year. This applies irrespective of whether the individual also has “reportable income” or not. This information is then included in the individual’s pre- populated account for the tax year. Income that a person receives under an employee share scheme which their employer has correctly recorded in their relevant employment income information is not treated as other income. Example 4: Ian Ian works part-time as a mechanic. To supplement his income, Ian starts his own lawn mowing business on 1 March 2019. For the first month, Ian only earns $188 in income from this venture. This means that, for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, Ian has less than $200 of “other income” and is therefore not required to provide this information to Inland Revenue. If Ian’s lawn mowing business grew in the following tax year, and he earned $8,000. The entire amount would need to be reported to Inland Revenue in his account for the year. 10 Finalising accounts and the assessment process (section 22H and 22I) As previously mentioned, new section 22I(1) provides that a final account is treated as a return of income and an income tax assessment. In accordance with 22I(2), the assessment is treated as being made on the date on which the individual’s pre-populated account is finalised for the tax year. The finalising of accounts is governed by the process set out below. When an account is finalised, section 22I(4) requires the Commissioner to notify an individual that their assessment is treated as having been made. Assessments for qualifying individuals (section 22H(1) and 22H(3)) For qualifying individuals, section 22H(1) provides that the Commissioner may finalise the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year when the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year. If the Commissioner requests information from a qualifying individual, the individual may when providing that information also correct any errors in their reportable income before finalising the account by confirming the correctness of their pre-populated account (22H(3)). From an operational standpoint, the Commissioner intends to finalise the assessments of qualifying individuals in batches, starting from early May and running through June. When an individual’s income tax assessment is finalised, Inland Revenue will notify the individual accordingly. Example 5: Lauren Lauren earns a salary as an accountant. This is the only “reportable” income information that Inland Revenue has received for Lauren. Inland Revenue considers Lauren’s activity for previous tax years and notes that she has never filed an IR3 return and has never earned “other income”. There is no other information that Inland Revenue holds that suggests Lauren has any other earnings or that the reportable income received is incorrect or incomplete. On this basis, Inland Revenue is satisfied that the income information set out in Lauren’s pre-populated account correctly and completely records her income for the corresponding income year. Inland Revenue therefore finalises Lauren’s pre-populated account on 15 May 2019 for the tax year ending 31 March 2019. Lauren is not required to do anything and will receive an email notification informing her that her notice of assessment is available via myIR. The notice of assessment informs Lauren that Inland Revenue have calculated her assessment and that, in her case, she has no further tax to pay and is not due a refund as her employer withheld the correct amount of tax on her behalf. Assessments for other individuals (section 22H(2)) Section 22H(2) provides that an individual other than a qualifying individual, may adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct errors at any time prior to 7 July following the end of the tax year, or later if they have an extension of time to file their return. The individual may also then finalise their account by confirming that the income information in the account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding tax year. 11 Example 6: Roman Roman studies at a university in Wellington and works part time at a local supermarket earning wages. When university is over for the year, Roman goes back home to Christchurch. For the last few years, Roman has operated a car washing business over the holiday period which nets him about $1,800 in additional income. Roman has filed an IR3 return for the previous tax years to account for this additional income. On 1 April 2019, Roman’s pre-populated account only includes his supermarket wages which have been reported to Inland Revenue. Based on Roman’s past returns, he has been an earner of “other income” in past tax years so Inland Revenue does not automatically finalise Roman’s account and instead prompts Roman to provide the additional information about his business earnings for the year. On 15 June 2019 Roman logs into myIR and updates his pre-populated account to include his business income. Roman then confirms that his pre-populated account is complete and correct. Roman’s account is finalised and his tax assessment crystallises, he is sent a notice of assessment which sets out the amount of tax he has left to pay. Assessments when Inland Revenue is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete If an individual does not provide the required information relating to their “other income”, the Commissioner can make an assessment of the amount of income that the Commissioner considers ought to be subject to tax by issuing a default assessment under section 106(1). This is because an individual who failed to provide the required information is treated as having failed to file their return. Similarly, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information provided in a final account for a tax year is not likely to be correct, the Commissioner may raise a default assessment per section 106(1A). Section 106(1B) provides that tax assessed under section 106(1A) is payable by the individual unless the individual disputes the assessment under section 89D. Section 89D(2B) requires an individual to first amend their final account before disputing the assessment as described in 22I(3). Default assessments will be discussed in greater detail under the ‘Disputes resolution and error correction’ section for both qualifying and other individuals. Proportionate extension of time for taxpayers due to system issues (amended section 37) Section 37 has been amended to provide an additional extension of time to a date advised by the Commissioner if a systems issue arises for an Inland Revenue digital platform that results in a taxpayer being prevented from, or being otherwise hindered or disadvantaged in, providing the required return or income information. This proportionate extension of time applies to “a person or class of persons” and therefore extends outside the scope of the individuals’ rules (that is it applies to entities such as companies as well). If such a systems issue arises, the Commissioner will make the extension available, as appropriate. Assessments for non-resident individuals Non-resident individuals with New Zealand sourced income have an obligation to pay tax in New Zealand on that income, under existing laws. The new individuals’ end-of-year process does not alter these obligations. 12 For non-resident individuals who have New Zealand reportable income, Inland Revenue will follow the standard pre-population process and will generate an account containing income information for the New Zealand sourced amounts. An example is employment income with a source in New Zealand, which is subject to PAYE irrespective of the residence of the individual. Non-residents, who earn other income and would ordinarily have been required to file an IR3NR, will continue to have an obligation to provide this information to Inland Revenue and to complete the required assessment to account for tax due on New Zealand sourced “other inco me”. Disputes resolution and error correction This section sets out how an individual can correct errors in their income information at different stages throughout the process and how the dispute resolution rules apply within the context of the new individuals’ income tax rules. The main way in which the approach to disputes is different under the new individuals’ income tax rules is that there are now mechanisms in the law that allow for an assessment, and for errors in general, to be amended more easily and without going through the formal disputes process. The following section will set out the new error correction rules and outline how they are integrated within the disputes resolution process. Qualifying individuals A qualifying individual can amend their assessment, or have their assessment amended by the Commissioner, under the new error correction provisions and the existing dispute resolution process. This section will cover the following in relation to qualifying individuals: 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the individual; 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner; 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual; 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner; 5. Default assessments; 6. Formal disputes process commencing with a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) issued by the taxpayer; 7. Later requests for changes by individuals. New section 22G sets out the process for correcting errors in respect of a taxpayer’s account for a tax year when information is either missing or incorrect. 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by individuals (section 22G) Section 22G(2) provides that an individual can amend income information in their pre- populated account at any time before it is finalised under section 22H. This provision applies to both “reportable” and “other income” earners. It is noted that the mechanism through which an account becomes finalised differs between “reportable” and “other income” earners and therefore the timeframes for pre-assessment error correction may differ from taxpayer to taxpayer. 13 Individuals will be able to view their income information, which will be used to pre-populate their account after year end, at any point during the year by logging into the their MyIR. Any errors in this income information can be corrected by contacting Inland Revenue. Section 22H(2) provides that an individual other than a qualifying individual may adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct errors any time prior to 7 July following the end of the tax year, or longer if they have an extension of time (being the due date by which they should file their return). Example 7: Alyssa and Zane Alyssa and Zane are both reportable income earners. Alyssa works in marketing and Zane works in journalism. Alyssa’s assessment for the 2018–19 tax year is finalised on 15 May 2019 and Zane’s on 1 June 2019. This means that Zane has an additional two weeks to correct any errors in his pre-populated account under 22G(2) than Alyssa. Due to the post-assessment error correction provisions for qualifying individuals, all qualifying individuals may amend their assessment up until their terminal tax date without being exposed to penalties or interest. If Alyssa didn’t have a chance to make an amendment to her pre-populated account before it is finalised, she will have time to do so afterwards with the same effect. As neither Alyssa or Zane are obliged to check their pre-populated accounts unless they know, or might reasonably have known, that the account will be incorrect or will omit information, the difference in timing is not likely to affect the correctness of their assessments. 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner (Section 22G) Section 22G(5) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre- populated account to correct errors. The Commissioner must notify the individual of any amendment. This provision applies to both reportable and other income earners. During the year, the Commissioner will update income information contained in the pre- populated account as it is received. Changes that the Commissioner makes to income information before the end of the tax year (and before an assessment arises) will be available to view online during the year and will be included in the pre-populated account prepared at the end of the year. Inland Revenue is unlikely to issue additional paper notifications to non-digital customers each time additional income information is received during the year, as that would result in undue administrative and compliance costs. Post year-end changes will need to be separately communicated to individuals, particularly for other income earners who must provide additional income information to Inland Revenue. That is because any changes to the reportable income information contained in the pre-populated account would need to be checked by the individual as the assessment can only arise, per section 22H(2), if the individual considers the account to correctly and completely record their income for the year. For this reason, changes made after the end of the tax year, for example to reflect updated information in employment income information will be notified more directly. 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by qualifying individuals (Section 22G) Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. The amended information forms a new assessment and any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. This means that when a taxpayer, who is a qualifying individual or is mistakenly treated as such, amends their assessment under section 22G(3) prior to their terminal tax date, they will 14 not be subject to penalties or interest (unless they are subject to the provisional tax regime). The changes are treated as the initial assessment rather than an amendment to the original assessment which the Commissioner finalised. Changes made to section 120C, which governs the day that interest starts for the purposes of the Use of Money Interest (UOMI) rules, ensure that interest does not start until the day after the payment of tax is due. The due date for terminal tax is generally 7 February following the end of the tax year for taxpayers with a standard balance date (tax year 1 April – 31 March). If a taxpayer with a standard balance date is linked to a tax agent, the terminal tax date will be 7 April of the following year. This applies even if the initial Commissioner finalised assessment results in a refund being paid to a taxpayer and the subsequent assessment results in tax to pay. Any disbursed refund that has to be repaid will be treated as due on the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. Notwithstanding a taxpayer’s ability to correct their income information under section 22G(3), section 22G(4) clarifies that if the Commissioner has reason to believe the amended information is incorrect, the Commissioner can decide not to accept the taxpayer’s amendment and issue a default assessment under section 106. This process protects the integrity of the tax system by ensuring that the Commissioner’s assessment is not immediately displaced with an incorrect assessment. Instead disputed amendments of this nature are processed under the existing rules, discussed further below. Example 8a: Lauren Lauren, as mentioned in a previous example, is an accountant earning a salary. The only income information Inland Revenue has received in relation to Lauren for the tax year is her salary income, and her earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue has no reason not to be satisfied that the information in Lauren’s pre-populated account is correct and complete and her account is therefore finalised on 15 May 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue does not know is that Lauren earnt $2,000 during the 2018–19 tax year regularly babysitting for a friend. On 1 November 2019 Lauren logs into her myIR to add this “other income” information. Although by virtue of adding this “other income” information into her final account Lauren is no longer a “qualifying individual”, she was treated by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual and therefore still falls within section 22G(3) for the correction of post-assessment errors by qualifying individuals. This means that when Lauren logs in on 1 November 2019 to add additional income information, this is not treated as an amended assessment but rather as a new assessment. The assessment that resulted when Inland Revenue finalised her account on 15 May 2019 is regarded as not having been made. Lauren will now have until her terminal tax date to pay any resultant tax bill and will not be subject to any penalties or interest provided that the amount due is paid on time. In the following year she is likely to be prompted to provide additional income information so that Inland Revenue can confirm whether she has continued to earn other income from babysitting. 15 Example 8b: Olivia Lauren’s sister, Olivia, works at the same accounting firm and earns a salary. Olivia purchased a rental property in 2015 which Inland Revenue are aware of due to Olivia’s IR3 returns for the preceding tax years showing a return of rental income. As such, Inland Revenue categorises Olivia as an “other income” earner who is required to provide more information to Inland Revenue. This means that Olivia will not be subject to the automatic process that applies to reportable income earners. New section 22H(2) requires an “other income” earner to adjust their pre-populated account to provide other income information and correct any errors by no later than 7 July following the end of the tax year. This means that, for the tax year ending 31 March 2019, a taxpayer with a standard balance date who earns “other income” has to provide this information by no later than 7 July 2019. In the event that the information is not provided by this date, Inland Revenue can issue a default assessment in accordance with section 106. What Inland Revenue does not know is that Olivia sold the rental property in March 2018, prior to the commencement of the 2018–19 tax year. Olivia’s only income for the 2018–19 tax year is her salary as an accountant, which means she is actually a reportable income earner for the 2018–19 tax year. Based on the above, Olivia does not provide “other income” information and finalise her account by 7 July 2019 as expected by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue does not issue Olivia with a default assessment immediately, although it has the scope to do so under section 106, and instead contacts Olivia to request further information. What happens next depends on what Olivia decides to do: (i) Olivia contacts Inland Revenue and finalises the assessment If Olivia responds to Inland Revenue and provides the required information, telling Inland Revenue that she has sold the property and has no rental income this year, she can finalise the account. The finalisation is late and, as such, Olivia may be charged a late filing penalty per section 139A, for failing to complete her final account (provide her return) on time. As Olivia has sold the property, she will no longer be an “other income” earner, so for the following tax year she is likely to have her assessment finalised by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual. (ii) Olivia does not respond: default assessment issued by Inland Revenue If Inland Revenue decides to issue Olivia with a default assessment prior to her terminal tax date 7 February 2020, the assessment can include an amount of rental income that the Commissioner considers, based on available information, that Olivia has earned in the tax year. Tax on this amount will be payable per section 106(1B), as noted above. As the Commissioner is unaware of the sale Olivia can contact Inland Revenue and ask for an amendment to her assessment by providing the required information to correct the account. In this case she can demonstrate that she had no rental income as she sold the property. The Commissioner would therefore amend the assessment per section 113. If there was disagreement between the Commissioner and Olivia as to whether any rental income ought to be included in Olivia’s assessment, Olivia would need to raise a dispute to change the assessment. Section 89D(2B) requires an individual to first amend the assessment by making an adjustment to their final account for the tax year before they are able to commence a dispute by issuing a NOPA. This is consistent with the previous rules which required an individual who had been issued a default assessment because they failed to file their tax return on time, to first file the missing return before being able to commence a dispute. Olivia must make the adjustment to her final account by no later than the time of filing the NOPA and both of these actions must be completed within the response period (four months from the issue of the default assessment). 16 Usuall y a taxpayer will discuss the correctness of the default assessment with the Commissioner before making an adjustment to their final account or engaging in the disputes process. However, a taxpayer is required to adjust their final account and issue a NOPA if the Commissioner does not accept the taxpayer’s proposed changes to their assessment within the response period. As noted above, in this case the Commissioner is unlikely to decline Olivia’s request to amend her assessment, as it is clear she has sold the property and has no rental income, therefore a dispute is unnecessary. Example 8c: Ruairi When Olivia sold her rental property in March 2018, she sold it to her brother, Ruairi. The sale and purchase was settled on 2 March 2018. Ruairi, unsurprisingly, is also an accountant who works at the same firm as his sisters. The only income information that Inland Revenue has received in relation to Ruairi for the 2018–19 tax year is his salary income. – His earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue has no reason to consider that the information in Ruairi’s pre-populated account is incorrect so finalises his account on 20 May 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue does not know however, is that by virtue of his rental property purchase on 2 March 2018, Ruairi has a month of rental income that he needs to return. Ruairi is therefore an “other income” earner for the 2018–19 tax year. Ruairi does not have an extension of time and his return filing due date is therefore 7 July 2019 for the 2018–19 tax year. Section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Ruairi has been treated as a qualifying individual by Inland Revenue and therefore can rely on section 22G(3). Ruairi can amend his return and provide what he considers to be his correct and complete income for the 2018–19 income year at any point before 7 February 2020. This will be treated as a new assessment, and he has until 7 February to pay the additional taxes due. Although in most cases a qualifying individual or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual, may amend the income information in their final account before the terminal tax date, there are limited circumstances in which a provisional taxpayer will be subject to UOMI. 17 Example 9: Jeff Lauren, Olivia and Ruairi have a brother called Jeff who also works at the accounting firm and earns salary and wages. On 1 April 2018, Jeff also commences a start-up technology venture, which he operates in his own capacity. Although Jeff is only working on his venture part time, it is successful and he earns an additional $200,000 for the 2018-19 tax year. Inland Revenue reviews Jeff’s income information at the end of the 2018–19 tax year and based on the information held for Jeff, the Commissioner is satisfied that the information contained in his pre-populated account correctly and completely records Jeff’s income for that tax year. Inland Revenue therefore finalises Jeff’s pre-populated account and it becomes an assessment on 15 May 2019. New section 22G(3) provides that a qualifying individual, or an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual, may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Although Jeff clearly has “other income” that he needs to provide, he has been treated as a qualifying individual and therefore has until his terminal tax date (7 February 2020) to provide any additional information and amend his tax position for the year. Jeff logs into myIR on 1 February 2020 and updates his tax position to include an additional $200,000 in income and finalises his account for the tax year. Although this is treated as a new assessment for the purposes of section 22G(3), Jeff is liable to pay provisional tax as he derived untaxed income during the tax year which caused him to have residual income tax (RIT) of more than $2,500 at year-end. Due to his level of untaxed income, Jeff’s RIT exceeds $60,000 and therefore he does not qualify for the provisional tax safe harbour in section 120KE. This means that provisional tax instalments were due for one third of his RIT on each of the missed instalment dates (being 28 August 2018, 15 January 2019 and 7 May 2019 for Jeff (as he has a standard 31 March balance date). As Jeff did not pay these instalments when they were due, he is subject to UOMI. For the sake of completeness, for the 2019–20 income tax year, because Jeff has filed his 2018–19 tax return after the first two provisional tax instalment dates for that year, he can pay provisional tax equalling his 2020 RIT on the third instalment date, being 7 May 2020 and not have to pay UOMI in that year. 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner for qualifying individuals Section 22G(6) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in a qualifying individual’s final account for the tax year to correct errors in the information at any time before the end of the time bar period per section 108(1), notifying the individual of the amendment. The time bar prevents the Commissioner from amending an assessment to increase the tax payable if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. This does not apply if a return is fraudulent or misleading. Section 22G(6) allows the Commissioner to correct finalised assessments in cases when the reportable income information provided to Inland Revenue is corrected after the end of the tax year, resulting in incorrect individual assessments. The Commissioner can correct the final accounts without first having to issue a NOPA due to amended section 89C(1) which references amendments made per section 22G(6). This section is limited to qualifying individuals because it reflects the way in which qualifying individuals’ assessments are finalised by the Commissioner. This means that if the Commissioner sought to amend information contained in the account of an individual with other income who finalises their own assessment per section 22H(2), the usual NOPA process would need to be followed. 18 Example 10: Rachel Rachel is a qualifying individual earning salary and wages. Her tax position is automatically calculated by Inland Revenue for the 2018–19 tax year and it is determined that she has tax payable of $100. Rachel pays this amount prior to her terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. On 1 March 2020 Inland Revenue realises that a mistake has been made in calculating Rachel’s tax position for the 2018–19 tax year because her employer contacts Inland Revenue to correct several periods of employment income information. Instead of having $100 tax payable, Rachel actually had $300 of tax payable, because her employment income information has been incorrectly reported. Section 22G(6) means that Inland Revenue can amend Rachel’s return and issues her with a tax bill for the additional $200. Rachel is given an additional 30 days, commencing on 2 March 2020, to pay this additional $200 (see section 142AB). 5. Default assessment A qualifying individual’s income tax assessment is typically automated. In most cases, the Commissioner will satisfy herself that the information in an individual’s pre-populated account, which will have been provided to her by way of third-party reporting during the year, is correct and complete. Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information is correct and complete, she can request that the individual provides more information under section 22H(3). The individual can then simply finalise the account by confirming that the income information is correct and complete or correct any errors in their reportable income and finalise the account by confirming that the corrected income information is correct and complete. Section 22G(4) provides that where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the amended information is incorrect, she can decline to accept the information and issue a default assessment under section 106. Amended section 89D(2B) provides that an individual can only dispute a default assessment by making an adjustment to their final account for the tax year. It is therefore expected that default assessments will only occur for qualifying individuals in limited circumstances. These include where an individual has been miscategorised as an “other inco me” earner, or where Inland Revenue is unsure about some of the individual’s information and has requested further clarifying information but the individual has failed to provide an adequate response. Example 11: Pamela Pamela is a salary earner who works in a large corporate office as an accountant. Inland Revenue knows that in previous tax years, Pamela has claimed a deduction of $1,000 for income protection insurance. Inland Revenue therefore has reason to believe that Pamela may intend to claim this deduction for the current (2018– 19) tax year as well. Instead of immediately finalising Pamela’s income tax assessment, since she is a qualifying individual, Inland Revenue sends Pamela a letter noting that she has previously claimed income protection insurance and gives her a period of time to respond and provide the deduction information if it is again relevant to this tax year. When Pamela responds confirming that she has this information, her assessment will be finalised based on the information she provides and confirmed as her complete and correct position for the tax year as set out in section 22H(3). If she does not respond in the given time period, Inland Revenue can progress the assessment on the basis that Pamela must not have any income protection insurance to claim for the 2018–19 tax year, otherwise she would have responded to the letter as she has done in the past. 19 For the 2018–19 income year, Pamela does not make a deduction claim for the usual $1,000 for income protection insurance, but instead, when prompted by Inland Revenue, claims a deduction for $100,000. She then confirms this as her correct and complete tax position for the tax year. As the $100,000 claim is far more than Pamela has claimed previously, Inland Revenue may ask Pamela whether this is a mistake. Pamela is on holiday and does not receive the correspondence from Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has reason to believe that the amended information is incorrect. This is because in previous years Pamela has only claimed $1,000 in income protection insurance and her salary has remained roughly the same. Because Inland Revenue cannot get a hold of Pamela, the Commissioner issues a default assessment correcting the deduction claimed to $1,000 and issues a NOPA detailing the change. When Pamela returns from her holiday she sees the correspondence, realises that she made a mistake and agrees to the proposed adjustment. 6. Formal disputes process commencing with a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer or Commissioner As a starting point, it is noted that the Commissioner is unlikely to issue a NOPA in respect of a qualifying individual. As previously discussed, the Commissioner is not required to issue a NOPA to amend a qualifying individual’s tax position post-assessment. Under section 22G(6) the Commissioner can amend a qualifying individual’s final account for a tax year to correct errors in the reportable income information at any time before the end of the time bar period, notifying the individual of the amendment. Although a qualifying individual is able to commence the formal disputes process by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, it is expected that this will happen rarely due to the qualifying individuals having up to their terminal tax date under the new error correction provisions to amend their assessments. Section 22G(3) allows a qualifying individual until their terminal tax date to correct any information in their final account, treating any earlier assessment as not having been made. This provides the taxpayer with a longer period of time to ensure they get their assessment right and allows them to amend their assessment in a much more flexible way than was provided for previously. In the event that a qualifying individual wishes to commence the formal dispute process, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89DA of the TAA. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable “response period” as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner finalised the taxpayer’s account for the tax year. However, this four-month period can change due to the application of section 22G(3), which allows a qualifying individual to amend their assessment at any time up until their terminal tax date, treating any earlier assessment as not having been made. 20 Example 12: Rangi and Siobhan Example 1: Rangi’s pre-populated account was finalised on 15 May 2019 (assessment date) for the 2018–19 tax year. Rangi did not make any amendments to his assessment under section 22G(3) prior to his terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. This means that, if Rangi realised some of his income information was incorrect on 8 February 2020, Rangi would be unable to commence a formal dispute by issuing a NOPA. This is because section 89AB requires the NOPA to be issued within the four-month period starting on the date of assessment, which in Rangi’s case ended on 15 September 2019. It is noted that Rangi is not precluded from requesting an amendment to his assessment under section 22G(8) and section 113. Section 22G(8) provides that, after their terminal tax date, an individual may ask the Commissioner to amend information contained in their final account for the tax year under section 113. This will be discussed on the following pages under the heading “later requests for changes by individuals”. Example 2: Siobhan’s pre-populated account was also finalised on 15 May 2019 (assessment date) for the 2018–19 tax year. Siobhan noticed an error in her income information and therefore made an amendment to her assessment under section 22G(3) on 1 February 2020, which is prior to her terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. This is treated as a new assessment . This means that, if Siobhan realised that further income information was incorrect on 8 February 2020, she would be able to commence a formal dispute by issuing a NOPA. Because her assessment was deemed to occur on 1 February 2020, the applicable response period for issuing a NOPA under section 89D(1) would not expire until 1 June 2020. However, due to the complexity of the formal disputes process, it would be easier for Siobhan to simply ask the Commissioner to amend her assessment using sections 22G(8) and 113. The application of the error correction provisions means that it is unlikely that a qualifying individual will need to use the formal disputes process and issue a NOPA. Should a qualifying individual issue a NOPA, then the disputes process that follows is left unchanged by the transition from the previous rules to the new individuals’ income tax rules. Section 89F governs the information required to be included in a taxpayer’s NOPA. The remaining stages of the disputes resolution process remain unchanged. If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s proposed adjust ment, then the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer as such and issue a notice of response (section 89G(1)). The process then continues as under existing law, and the stages of the disputes resolution process include an administrative phase, disclosure, a potential adjudication and then, potentially, an amended assessment. For a more in depth look at the dispute resolution process see SPS 16/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer, SPS 16/05, Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. 7. Later requests for changes by individuals When an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. Section 113 provides the Commissioner with a discretionary power. The Commissioner will, subject to the time bar, generally agree to amend assessments that are requested when the result can be clearly shown to be correct. In determining whether to exercise the discretion, the Commissioner will evaluate an amendment request using the care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A. For more information see SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. As has already been noted, a taxpayer can amend the information in their final account prior to their terminal tax date by amending their assessment under new section 22G(3) where they are a qualifying individual. If a qualifying individual wishes to amend their assessment after that 21 date, they must request the Commissioner make an amendment under section 113. Although a qualifying individual is not permitted to issue a NOPA after four months post-assessment, they are given a longer period of time, up until their terminal tax date, to amend any errors and the corrected information will constitute a fresh assessment. This provisio n provides more flexibility to the taxpayer by avoiding the highly structured disputes process. Other individuals An individual will fall into the category of “other income” earner where they earn “other inco me” above the $200 de minimis threshold. This means they will be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. This section will cover the following in relation to individuals who earn “other” income: 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the individual 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual (formal disputes process) 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner (formal disputes process) 5. Default assessments 6. Later requests for changes by individuals 1. Correction of pre-assessment errors by individuals (Section 22G) Individuals who earn other income can amend income information in their pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised (22G(2)). An individual who earns other income is required to finalise their account by 7 July of the following tax year, or longer if they have an extension of time. 2. Correction of pre-assessment errors by the Commissioner (Section 22G) Section 22G(5) provides that pre-assessment the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre-populated account to correct errors. The Commissioner must notify the individual of any amendment and this will typically be done by providing them with the updated informat ion online and in their pre-populated account at the end of the year. 3. Correction of post-assessment errors by the individual Section 22G(8) applies to an individual who is an “other income” earner and has finalised their account per section 22H(2), and wishes to amend their assessment after the account has been finalised. This means that they must either request an amendment from the Commissioner per section 113, or they may choose to issue a NOPA if they are still within the applicable response period. Therefore, to change the assessment, the taxpayer can request that the Commissioner amend their assessment under section 113. Under section 113 the Commissioner has a discretionary power to amend assessments. When a requested amendment can be clearly shown to be correct, such as a simple arithmetic error, the Commissioner will generally agree to the amendment. For more informat ion see SPS 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments. 22 Alternatively, the individual can issue a NOPA but must do so within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that their assessment was made (this occurs when they finalised their pre- populated account under section 22H(2)). The standard dispute resolution procedures then apply. 4. Correction of post-assessment errors by the Commissioner: other individuals (Section 22H) When the Commissioner wishes to make an adjustment in relation to an individual other than a qualifying individual, section 22G(2) requires the Commissioner to issue a NOPA under section 89B (subject to the exceptions set out in section 89C, such as if the taxpayer provides a return with a simple mistake or obvious oversight). The new individuals’ income tax rules therefore make no change to what would have applied under the old rules for the correction of post- assessment errors. For more in-depth guidance regarding the disputes resolution process as commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, see Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/05. Example 13: Ben Ben is a lawyer earning a salary. Ben also owns a rental property and therefore earns rental income as well as his salary. Ben is classified as an “other income” earner for the purposes of the individuals rules. As Ben is not a qualifying individual, if Inland Revenue wished to amend his tax return to increase the amount of tax payable, in most cases a notice of proposed adjustment would need to be issued. 5. Default assessments Section 22I(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that if an individual does not satisfy the Commissioner that the income information in their pre-populated account for the tax year correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year, the date on which the assessment is treated as being made is the date on which the Commissioner provides a default assessment under section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where a default assessment has been made, an “other income” earner can dispute this by: • adjusting their final account under section 89D(2B); and • issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment. The standard disputes resolution process then applies. As advised previously, for a more in depth look at the dispute resolution process see SPS 16/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer, SPS 16/05Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments. 6. Later requests for changes by individuals As is applicable to a reportable income earner, where an “other income” individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their applicable response period has expired, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. 23 Categorising individual income earners This section sets out the various groupings that an individual taxpayer may fall into and then, using the above framework as a base, provides a walk-through of what an individual needs to do to meet their obligations in various fact scenarios, and what will happen for them automatically under these new processes. Individuals will be put into one of three groupings which they may move between over time as their income profile changes. The groupings are: • Group A (automated process) – the individual earns “reportable income” and IR determines whether the income information it holds for the person is correct. In these cases, the refund or tax to pay will automatically be calculated, assessed and progressed accordingly (that is – refund or tax bill issued). • Group B – the individual earns reportable income, but IR considers, based on previous returns and other information, that the individual may have other income information that they may need to provide, deductions for example. In these circumstances, the individual will be asked to provide the additional information or confirm that the inco me informat io n held is correct. • Group C – while the individual may have reportable income, it is expected that these individuals will also have other income. Individual’s that fall into this category will then be required to provide income information – similar to the current IR3 process where a return of income is required. This special report will deal with each grouping in turn and provide a walk-through of how the new individual’s income tax proposals will apply to a taxpayer in each respective grouping, drawing on examples to illustrate how the rules will apply. From the outset, it is important to note that where an individual has a tax agent, communication will be sent directly to the tax agent. If the individual wishes to receive communication from Inland Revenue directly, they must change their mail preferences from their agent to themselves either through MyIR or by contacting Inland Revenue. The individuals’ income tax changes for a “Group A” individual This section explains how the new individuals’ income tax changes will apply to a person who falls within “group A”. A “group A” individual is a person who earns reportable income only, for whom Inland Revenue considers that the income information contained in their pre- populated account is correct and complete. This section will cover the following scenarios: 1. Assessment results in a net zero position at year-end 2. Assessments results in a small amount of tax payable that is written off resulting in a net zero position at year-end 3. Assessment results in a tax refund 4. Assessment results in tax to pay 5. Individual amends their pre-populated account pre- assessment 6. Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment 7. Individual amends their final account post-assessment 24 8. Commissioner amends individual’s account post-assessment 9. The individual requests to amend their assessment after terminal tax 10. Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the individual should be in. Scenario 1: “Group A” taxpayer when tax has been withheld correctly and the year-end tax position is a net zero Example 14: Natalia Natalia is on a salary of $70,000 per annum. Her employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. Natalia does not earn any other income. Under new section 22E the Commissioner is obliged to include this income information in Natalia’s pre- populated account for the tax year. Based on the information Inland Revenue holds, the Commissioner is satisfied that this is all of Natalia’s income and finalises Natalia’s tax position in accordance with section 22H(1) at the end of the tax year. Natalia is not required to do anything and is notified of her assessment automatically. The notice of assessment informs Natalia that Inland Revenue has finalised her assessment and that, in her case, she has no further tax to pay and is not due a tax refund. The above example is the most simple under the new individual income tax rules and is the ideal outcome for a taxpayer that solely earns reportable income. The taxpayer has paid the correct amount of tax throughout the year and has not been left with a tax bill or a refund due at year-end. The tax position has been completed for the individual by the Commissioner and a notice of assessment issued accordingly, without the taxpayer having to interact with Inland Revenue to make this happen. When will a “Group A” individual’s assessment be finalised? For most taxpayers with a standard 31 March tax year end, assessments are likely to be finalised between May and June. A notice of assessment will be sent out to the taxpayer when their assessment is calculated, whether electronically or by post. Scenario 2: Assessment for a “Group A” taxpayer results in a small amount of tax payable that is written off resulting in a net zero position at year-end A taxpayer can also reach a net zero position at year-end where they have a small amount of tax payable that is written off under the new write off rules. This will occur automatically without the taxpayer having to do anything. The write off rules will be discussed in greater detail under the “refunds and tax to pay section” of this special report. 25 Example 15: Kaylor Kaylor is a butcher who earns a salary. Kaylor is paid weekly and his employer deducts PAYE each pay day. Last year, Kaylor’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Kaylor earned $1,500 from which Kaylor’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-day. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Kaylor received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Kaylor has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Although Kaylor has a tax shortfall of $175, this will be written off under the write off rules (discussed later). Therefore, just like Natalia in scenario 1, Kaylor is also not required to do anything and will receive a notice of assessment automatically. The notice of assessment will inform Kaylor that Inland Revenue has calculated his assessment and that, in his case, he has no further tax to pay and is not due a refund. Scenario 3: “Group A” taxpayer due a refund at year-end As scenario 1 demonstrates, a qualifying individual’s income tax assessment will be completed without them having to do anything. Example 16: Sophie Sophie earns $35,000 from her main job and $18,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will pay $10,545 in tax. The $10,545 that Sophie pays in tax is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001–$35,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $18,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $5,400. The total tax payable on $53,000 of income is actually $8,920 meaning that Sophie is due a refund of $1,625. Because Inland Revenue has Sophie’s current bank account details, once Sophie’s tax position is finalised at year-end, her refund will be direct credited to her account and her notice of assessment will inform her of the refund that has been paid out to her automatically. If Inland Revenue did not have bank account details for Sophie, the refund would be unable to be direct credited. For this reason, it is important that taxpayers keep their bank account details up to date with Inland Revenue to enable any refund due to be paid out automatically. For the sake of completeness, it is noted that under the new individuals’ income tax rules Inland Revenue could proactively recommend that Sophie adopt a tailored tax code to help fix the over taxation caused by the secondary tax code. Had Sophie accepted this and her pattern of earnings remained the same throughout the year, then she would not have been owed a refund at year-end. This is because the tailored tax code would have ensured that the correct amount of tax was withheld during the year, enabling Sophie to have more money throughout the year. Both “pro-active actions” and “tailored tax codes” have their own sections later in this special report. It is also noted that under the previous personal tax summary rules, a tax payer was required to confirm the correctness of their income statement (PTS) under section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before a refund exceeding $600 could be issued to the taxpayer. Under the new rules there is no refund confirmation threshold and refunds of any amount will be paid out automatically. This means that the $1,625.00 owing to Sophie in the above scenario will be paid out to her without her having to do anything specific to request it (providing that she has updated her bank account details with Inland Revenue). 26 Scenario 4: “Group A” taxpayer with tax to pay at year-end Example 17: Robert Robert is an employee earning wages. His tax position is finalised by Inland Revenue for the 2018–19 tax year and it is determined that he has tax payable of $200 that has arisen due to being on an incorrect tax code for a portion of the tax year. Inland Revenue sends Robert a notice of assessment and also informs him that he has $200 of tax to pay. Robert will have until the terminal tax date of 7 February 2020 to pay this additional amount of tax without incurring any penalties or interest. If Robert has not paid this amount by the terminal tax date, he will be sent a statement of account which will include a late payment penalty and interest owing on the outstanding tax. The above four examples deal with the most common situations that reportable income earners can expect to experience. Although they outline the experience that the majority of “Group A” individuals will have, there are some situations where these individuals will have further interactions with Inland Revenue in order to ensure the correctness of their income tax assessment. Scenario 5: Individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment There are times when, due to an error, an individual’s pre-populated account may not accurately reflect their income position for a tax year. Individuals are therefore encouraged to log into their myIR account during the year to take a look at the information that has been included and make any corrections when necessary. To enable that the new individuals’ income tax rules allow an individual to amend their pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised. Example 18: Charles Charles logs into his pre-populated account for the 2018–19 tax year and notices that there is some income for a job he does not recognise. What has likely occurred is that an employer has input a wrong IRD number when calculating their payroll, resulting in the income incorrectly being attributed to Charles. Under new section 22G(2) Charles is able to amend his pre-populated account at any time before it is finalised, so he contacts Inland Revenue and proposes a correction to the information in his pre-populated account to delete this unknown income source. Scenario 6: Commissioner amends an individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment Although a Group A individual is encouraged to log in to myIR during and after the tax year to review their information, the Commissioner is also able to correct any errors to ensure the correctness of the individual’s income information. New section 22G(5) provides that the Commissioner may amend information in an individual’s pre-populated account for a tax year to correct errors. The Commissioner is required to notify the individual of any amendment made. Example 19: Charles Using the example of Charles above, let’s assume that Charles did not log into his pre-populated account and notice the incorrect income information, and instead Inland Revenue became aware of the error. In these circumstances, Inland Revenue would amend Charles’s pre-populated account to correct the error and then send Charles a letter to notify him of the amendment. 27 Scenario 7: Individual amends their account post-assessment A qualifying individual’s pre-populated account will become a final account for a tax year once it is finalised by the Commissioner. New section 22H(1) provides that the Commissioner may finalise the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year once the Commissioner is satisfied that the income information set out in the pre-populated account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year. As previously discussed, when a “Group A” individual amends their final account prior to their terminal tax date, any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. The individual will have until terminal tax to pay any resultant tax bill without being subject to penalties or interest. Example 20: Charles Again, carrying on with the example of Charles, let’s assume that neither Charles nor Inland Revenue noticed that some income information had been incorrectly attributed to Charles and his assessment is finalised for the tax year. Charles logs into myIR to view his income information for the 2018–19 in July 2019, which is after his income tax assessment for the year has been finalised. Charles notices that some income has been attributed to him for a job that he has never worked for. In accordance with new section 22G(3), Charles is able to amend his assessment at any time prior to his terminal tax date. This amendment will be treated as a new assessment and he will have until his terminal tax date to pay any tax outstanding without being subject to penalties or interest. Charles amends his assessment to remove the income information. Inland Revenue contacts the employer in question to seek out the correct IRD number for the employee whose income was mistakenly added to Charles’ account. It turns out the extra income should have been paid to Amelia, one of Charles’s colleagues. She has also had her account finalised by the Commissioner in June. Using new section 22G(6), the Commissioner amends Amelia’s final account to correctly include the missing employment income and withheld PAYE and notifies Amelia of the change made which results in a small refund to Amelia. Scenario 8: The Commissioner amends the individual’s account post-assessment Under new section 22G(6), the Commissioner may amend information in a qualifying individual’s final account for a tax year to correct errors at any time before the end of the time bar period in section 108(1). An amendment made to section 89C(1) ensures that the Commissioner can amend information in the individual’s final account without first having to issue a NOPA. As the time bar period extends for 4 years from the end of the tax year in which the return is furnished, the Commissioner can rely on this provision to amend the taxpayer’s assessment after their terminal tax date. 28 Example 21 On 1 March 2021 Inland Revenue discovers, following an audit, that a large employer had been incorrectly accounting for PAYE since the introduction of pay-day filing rules in April 2019. The mistakes resulted from an error in the coding of the payroll software that the employer uses. Inland Revenue works with the employer over the next few months to identify the extent of the error and finds that, in total, approximately $7.5 million was mistakenly misreported during the period April 2019–March 2021. The company employs 325 staff across New Zealand and Inland Revenue sets about checking the assessments for the affected employees. Upon reviewing the assessments, Inland Revenue discovers that the vast majority of the company’s employees are qualifying individuals for whom assessments for the year ended March 2020 had been finalised. To correct the errors made in each of the finalised accounts for these employees, Inland Revenue recalculates the corrected tax positions and amends the final accounts as per section 22G(6). Some employees receive additional refunds which are immediately direct credited, and others small tax bills for which the employees are given additional time to pay as per section 142AB. For the remaining minority of affected employees who have “other income” and therefore filed returns for the March 2020 year-end, the Commissioner relies on section 22G(8) instead. To amend the assessments, the Commissioner contacts each employee and provides proposed adjustments. Finally, because the March 2021 assessments have not yet been finalised the Commissioner, uses section 22G(5) to correct the pre-populated accounts of all of the employees and to reverse the mistake in the reported employment income information. Scenario 9: The individual requests an amendment to their assessment after the terminal tax date There are some circumstances where a qualifying individual can utilise the formal disputes process to request an amendment to their assessment after their terminal tax date. As previously discussed, this could occur where a taxpayer has amended their assessment under section 22G(3) at some point prior to their terminal tax date and, by virtue of this action resulting in a fresh assessment, the taxpayer may still be within the relevant response period to issue a NOPA. The above will only occur in rare cases. Usually where an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, they can do so under section 22G(8). Section 22G(8) allows the individual to ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. The Commissioner will accept the amendment where she is satisfied that the suggested amendment is clearly correct. There are instances where the Commissioner would refuse to exercise her discretion to amend an assessment under section 113. This could include where the proposed adjustment is merely arguable or involves disputed facts or statutory interpretation or where a taxpayer is attempting to circumvent the disputes process. For further information please consult SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 29 Example 22: Caleb Caleb works as a mechanic and earns wages. For the last pay period of the 2018–19 tax year, Caleb received an end of year bonus of $800. This bonus is treated as a lump sum payment and is taxed in accordance with the extra pay rules. Although the payment was only $800, an error occurs which results in the payment being remitted to Inland Revenue as a $900 payment. This means that, as far as Inland Revenue is concerned, Caleb has been undertaxed. His employer withheld tax based on an $800 payment when, according to the information remitted to Inland Revenue, Caleb was paid $900. Caleb is not aware of this error. When his tax position is finalised on 1 June 2019, Caleb has a small amount of tax payable. This amount is under $50 and therefore written off under section 22J. Caleb becomes aware of the error on 15 March 2020, which is after his terminal tax date of 7 February 2020. Although the error has not had any material effect on the amount of tax Caleb had to pay for the tax year, Caleb wants his tax position to be accurate. Under section 113 Caleb requests that the Commissioner makes an adjustment to Caleb’s tax return for the 2018–19 tax year. The Commissioner uses her discretion under section 113 to correct this error. Scenario 10: A taxpayer with “other income” is miscategorised as a “Group A” Inland Revenue uses the information it knows about a taxpayer to determine which grouping that taxpayer is put into. It is acknowledged that in some situations Inland Revenue may not get this completely right. Example 23: Keith Keith earns a salary of $70,000 per annum. This is the only type of income he has earnt for several years. On 1 March 2019 he buys a rental property but does not tell Inland Revenue. Sometime in May 2019, Inland Revenue automatically finalises Keith’s tax position. This is because Inland Revenue is satisfied, based on the information held for Keith, that he is solely a reportable income earner. The income Keith earns from the rental property is “other income” and will need to be included in Keith’s end of year income tax assessment. Keith has been treated as a qualifying individual by Inland Revenue. This means that under new section 22G(3) Keith has until his terminal tax date (generally 7 February of the following year) to amend his assessment without being subject to penalties or interest. When Keith receives notification from Inland Revenue in May that his end of year tax position has been finalised, he promptly logs into his myIR and amends his assessment to include the rental income information and confirms this as his final tax position for the year. Under section 22G(3) this is treated as a new assessment and Keith has until terminal tax to pay any outstanding tax. Example B Drawing on the example above, if we assume that Keith informed Inland Revenue about his rental property prior to Inland Revenue finalising his assessment, then Keith would be recategorised as a “Group C” person for the purposes of the individual’s income tax rules. In accordance with section 22H(2), this means that Keith would have until 7 July 2019 to provide other income information, correct any errors and finalise his account as correct and complete. If Keith has not finalised his account by this date, then he will be subject to a late filing penalty and Inland Revenue may eventually issue a default assessment under section 106. 30 Walkthrough of the individual’s income tax changes for a “Group B” individual This section sets out some common scenarios that a “Group B” individual may find themselves in and explains how the new law applies. A “Group B” taxpayer is a qualifying individual who earns reportable income and who may have provided additional information in prior years’ assessments, such as claiming an allowable deduction. For Group B individual, Inland Revenue considers, based on previous returns and the other information it holds about the individual, that they may have other income information to provide. In these circumstances, the taxpayer’s assessment will not be immediately finalised by the Commissioner but will be “suspended” for a period of time to give the individual an opportunity to provide this further information if applicable. Scenario 1: When a pre-populated account may be temporarily suspended to give the individual an opportunity to provide additional information The types of information that would result in an individual being subject to a suspended process are set out in section 22F(3) and the relevant table in schedule 8. As per that section, an individual may provide information for a tax year on amounts set out in schedule 8, part A, table 2. Table 2 provides that an individual may provide additional information on the following: 1. A deduction. 2. A tax credit carried forward under section LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. A tax loss balance, or tax loss component, other than a tax loss component under section LE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4. A donations tax credit. 5. An amount of income protection insurance. Inland Revenue will contact an individual if it appears that the individual may have some additional information to provide. This will be informed by whether the taxpayer may have had or claimed expenses, credits or losses in prior tax years and any other relevant information that Inland Revenue holds in respect of the taxpayer. This means that if an individual wishes to claim expenses but has not done so in the past, the onus will be on the individual to contact Inland Revenue or update their pre-populated account before it is finalised to include this information. If they fail to do this prior to their assessment being finalised by the Commissioner, they would have to apply the relevant error correction processes in order to include the additional information. When an individual provides a valid expense claim or deduction, this will lower the individual’s liability for the tax year. Therefore, there is an incentive for the individual to respond to the Commissioner’s query about additional information. Although there are limited deductions available to individuals earning reportable income, Inland Revenue intends to provide an opportunity for taxpayers who it considers likely to have such deductions an opportunity to claim them before their account is finalised for them. Inland Revenue will therefore utilise what it knows about an individual to make it easier for the individual to provide the relevant expense information, when applicable, rather than having to use post-assessment correction provisions to add this in after the account is finalised. 31 Example 24: Rohit Rohit is a salary earner who works as a scientist. Inland Revenue knows that in previous tax years, Rohit has claimed a deduction for income protection insurance. Inland Revenue therefore has reason to believe that Rohit may intend to claim this deduction for the current tax year as well. Instead of automatically calculating Rohit’s income tax assessment, Inland Revenue notifies Rohit via myIR that he has previously claimed income protection insurance and may wish to do so again this year. Inland Revenue give him a period of time to respond. If Inland Revenue has not heard from Rohit at the conclusion of the given period, Inland Revenue will progress on the basis that Rohit does not have any income protection insurance to claim for this tax year and will finalise his assessment based on the information in his pre-populated account. If Rohit responds confirming that he has this information, his assessment will be calculated using the information he provides and confirms as his complete and correct position for the tax year. Certain types of other income, such as ACC attendant care payments and expense information in relation to schedular payments, will also be subject to this suspended auto calculatio n process. For example, where an ACC beneficiary is receiving personal service rehabilitation payments and on paying that to their personal carer (known as an ACC attendant care payment), Inland Revenue would require the ACC beneficiary to provide information regarding how much was passed on to the caregiver. Individuals may also have to provide additional income information to Inland Revenue on an interim basis until the changes in the recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Emplo yment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 take full effect. These changes introduced in that Act will require investment income payers to provide detailed information to Inland Revenue about the income paid to individuals from these sources (“reportable income”). During the transit ional period, if Inland Revenue records indicate that qualifying individuals have in the past returned dividends or Maori authority distributions, then these individuals may also initially be prompted to provide this additional information in order to complete their assessments. Walkthrough of the individuals’ income tax changes for a “Group C” individual This section explains how the new individual’s income tax changes will apply to a person who falls within “group C”. A “group C” individual is a person who, although they may have some reportable income, is expected to have other income. Individuals that fall into this category will be required to provide income information to Inland Revenue. This section will cover the following scenarios: 1. A standard assessment for a group C individual 2. Individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment 3. Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment 4. Individual wishes to amend their final account post-assessment 5. Commissioner amends individual’s final account post-assessment 6. The individual requests to amend their assessment after terminal tax 7. Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the income earner should be in. 32 Scenario 1: A standard assessment for a group C individual Example 24: Mike Mike is a doctor on a salary of $200,000 per annum. His employer deducts PAYE correctly and remits this to Inland Revenue. Mike also owns a portfolio of rental properties which provides him with additional rental income of $100,000 per annum. This represents all of the income Mike earns for the 2018–19 tax year. As rental income comes under the definition of other income in section 22D(4) and Schedule 8 Part A table 1, Mike is categorised as an “other income” earner. This means that, under section 22H(2) Mike must, as an “other income” earner, provide his other income information to Inland Revenue. Mike is then required to review the information in his pre-populated account and finalise his account for the tax year by confirming it as correct and complete by the due date in section 22H(4) (usually 7 July unless Mike is entitled to an extension of time). Mike logs into myIR on 15 May 2019, provides his other income information, and then finalises his account as correct and complete. By finalising his account, Mike has filed his tax return for the 2018–19 tax year. Mike would have until the terminal tax date to pay any applicable tax due, or if in a refund position would receive his refund shortly after his account is finalised. The above example sets out the assessment process for an “other income” earner. All of the “reportable income” that an individual earns will be provided to Inland Revenue by way of third-party reporting and will be included in the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year. If an individual earns income that falls under the definition of “other income” in section 22D(4) and Schedule 8 Part A table 1, they are required to provide this information and finalise their tax position themselves. An individual who earns both “reportable” and “other income” must ensure that the information included in their pre-populated account is correct and complete before they confirm their end of year assessment. If the individual wishes to file their return shortly after the end of the tax year, and before Inland Revenue will have received all reportable income information from the relevant third parties, they must ensure that they include this information in their tax return. It follows then that it may be easier for an “other income” earner who also earns “reportable inco me” to wait until Inland Revenue has complete “reportable income” information before filing their return. “Reportable income” information will likely be completed by shortly after 15 May following the end of the tax year. Example 25: Mike Let’s assume that instead of logging into myIR on 15 May 2019 to provide his other income information and finalise his tax position for the tax year, Mike logs into myIR on 1 April 2019 to provide his “other income” information and finalise his tax position. In this situation, it is unlikely that the last few pay periods from Mike’s salary as a doctor will have been pre-populated. This means that, if Mike wishes to finalise his tax position for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 April 2019, Mike will need to provide this information himself. Mike provides his other income information and then commences a review of all of the information that is included in his pre-populated account for the tax year. As expected, Mike realises that the last few pay periods of salary and wage income are missing. Mike logs out of myIR and sets a reminder in his Calendar to log back in on 15 May 2019 to review and confirm his income information for the tax year. 33 Scenario 2: How an individual amends their pre-populated account pre-assessment An individual who earns other income can amend their income information in their pre- populated account at any time before it is finalised (section 22G(2)). As above, an individual who earns other income is required to finalise their account by 7 July of the following tax year, or later if they have an extension of time. Example 26: Mike Let’s assume a further variation of example 25 above which deals with Mike as a salary earner who also has rental income. Under this variation, Mike does the following: 15 May: Mike logs into myIR and provides his rental income for the tax year. Mike does not finalise his account at this point as he had some repairs done on his property during March 2019. Mike is waiting for the invoice for this work so that he can claim a deduction against this income. 20 May: Mike receives an invoice from the builder who performed the repair work on his property for $8,000. Mike logs into myIR and claims this as an expense against his income. Mike then finalises his return accordingly by confirming his income information as correct and complete under section 2H. Scenario 3: Commissioner amends individual’s pre-populated account pre-assessment As is applicable to individuals who earn reportable income, section 22G(5) also allows the Commissioner to amend information in an “other income” earner’s pre-populated account for the tax year to correct errors. This must be done prior to the account being finalised and the Commissioner is required to notify the individual of any amendment made. Example 27: Sally Sally is 17 years old and still at school. She is passionate about animals so works part time at a local charity that rehomes stray dogs. Sally earns a salary of $10,000 per annum. Sally is so passionate about animals that she decides to donate $12,000 to her local charity. She makes this donation on 15 March 2019. Sally logs into myIR on 1 May 2019 to add a donation tax credit claim of $12,000. Sally also runs a lemonade stand at her local netballing club and updates her pre-populated account to include the additional $2,000 income that she earnt from that during the tax year. Sally does not yet confirm her income information as complete, as she wants her dad, who is an accountant, to check that she has inputted the information correctly. Sally’s dad is on holiday in India so is unable to check over the information until he returns on 1 June 2019. In the meantime, Inland Revenue notices that Sally has claimed donation tax credit for $21,000, despite the receipt provided stating that a $12,000 donation was made. In these circumstances, Sally has clearly made a typing error. The amount claimed is incorrect. Inland Revenue make a provisional amendment to Sally’s donation tax credit claim to ensure that the claim is $12,000 and matches the receipts provided. Inland Revenue notify Sally of the update via myIR. When Sally’s dad returns from India he checks over her pre-populated account for the tax year and confirms that the information is correct. Sally finalises her account accordingly. Scenario 4: Individual amends their final account post-assessment When an “other income” earner wishes to amend their final account post-assessment, they must request that the Commissioner makes an amendment as per section 113, as discussed above. Alternatively, they may be able to issue a NOPA if the applicable timeframes have not lapsed. The taxpayer’s NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that 34 the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). Example 28: Mohammed Mike’s cousin, Mohammed, runs an online business selling vintage clothes. He sells items through his personal website and also through a Trade Me account. When Mohammed finalised his account for the 2018–19 tax year, he included $5,000 worth of sales on his Trade Me account that were his own personal items, a second- hand TV and a leather lounge suite. Mohammed’s Trade Me account lists thousands of items for sale per year and when filing his return Mohammed had forgotten he had used his business account to sell these personal items which led to the items being included in his return by mistake. Mohammed finalised his account for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 June 2019. Mohammed realised he had made a mistake on 15 September 2019. This is still within the valid response period as set out in section 89AB. Mohammed wishes to make an adjustment to his tax return. He completes a NOPA requesting that $5,000 be excluded from his taxable income as assessed for the 2018–19 tax year and sends it to Inland Revenue. Scenario 5: Commissioner amends individual’s final account post-assessment Section 22G(7) requires the Commissioner to issue a NOPA under section 89B (subject to the exceptions set out in section 89C, such as when the taxpayer provides a return with a simple mistake or obvious oversight) before amending an assessment for an “other income” earner. This is consistent with the settings in place prior to the new rules being introduced. Example 29: Ben Ben is a salary earner who owns a large amount of rental property. Ben also claimed some expenses against his income for the 2018–19 tax year for repairs carried out on one of his rental properties. Ben finalised his tax position for the 2018–19 tax year on 1 June 2019. On 8 August 2019, Inland Revenue does an audit on one of Ben’s accounts and discovers that he has incorrectly categorised the installation of insulation in one of his properties as a repair and has claimed that amount as an expense. As the property was previously uninsulated, the amount should have been treated as an improvement and capitalised. In accordance with the requirements in section 22G(7), the Commissioner issues Ben with a NOPA under section 89B. Scenario 6: The individual requests an amendment to their assessment after the terminal tax date If an individual wishes to amend the information in their final account after their terminal tax date, section 22G(8) provides that the individual may ask the Commissioner to amend their final account under section 113. The Commissioner will progress the amendment if she is satisfied that the suggested amendment is clearly correct. The purpose of this provision is to clearly signpost to the taxpayer what mechanisms will exist under the law for an individual earner to amend their assessment after the terminal tax date. Section 22G(8) does not limit the use of section 113 more generally. The Commissioner may consider a request under section 113 at any time (such as after the expiration of the time period for issuing a NOPA but prior to a taxpayer’s terminal tax date, for example). 35 Example 30: Mike Mike got a builder in to do repair work on one of his properties and the builder sent Mike a bill for $8,000 in May 2019 for the work he had quoted for and completed in March 2019. Mike had accrued this cost but had accidentally keyed in $5,000 instead of $8,000. He didn’t notice this when he was providing his tax information for the year so he only claimed a $5,000 expense, but he paid the builder the $8,000 in May. Mike discovered his earlier error when he was reconciling his accounts for the 2019–20 year. As this was an expense that related to the 2018–19 income year, Mike asks the Commissioner to amend his assessment in accordance with section 22H(4). As the amendment is clearly correct, the Commissioner agrees to use her discretion to make the change. Scenario 7: Inland Revenue miscategorises which “group” the income earner should be in There are two ways in which Inland Revenue can miscategorise which “group” an individual income earner should be in. The first is where the Commissioner treats the taxpayer as a qualifying individual in circumstances where the individual actually earns “other income”. The second is where the Commissioner treats an individual as a person who earns “other income” when they are actually a “qualifying individual”. An individual who is actually a qualifying individual will always be able to take advantage of the rules that apply to qualifying individuals. However, section 22G(3) also provides that an individual who is treated as a qualifying individual may amend the income information in their final account at any time before their terminal tax date for the tax year. Any earlier assessment for the tax year is regarded as not having been made. Extending this to miscategorised “other income” earners ensures that they are not disadvantaged by any miscategorisation. Example 31: Ousmane Ousmane works for a florist earning wages. The only income information Inland Revenue has received in relation to Ousmane for the 2018–19 income tax year is this wage income, and his earnings in previous tax years have always been consistent with this position. As such, Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information in Ousmane’s pre-populated account is correct and complete. His account is therefore finalised on 1 June 2019 in accordance with section 22H. What Inland Revenue do not know is that in February 2019 Ousmane started his own business creating and selling gift baskets. For the 2018–19 tax year, Ousmane earnt an additional $3,000 income from this side business. This is classified as “other income”. As an “other income” earner with a standard balance date, Ousmane is required to finalise his account by confirming that the income information in his pre-populated account is correct and complete by 7 July of the following tax year (section 22H(4)). However, by virtue of being treated by Inland Revenue as a qualifying individual, Ousmane can, under section 22G(3), provide this information by as late as his terminal tax date of 7 February. As previously advised, Inland Revenue auto calculated Ousmane’s tax position on 1 June 2019. As long as Ousmane logs into his myIR to provide his “other income” information and finalise his account before 7 February 2020, this will be treated as a fresh assessment for the purposes of the individuals’ rules. The assessment that resulted when Inland Revenue finalised Ousmane’s account on 1 June 2019 will be regarded as not having been made. Ousmane will have until his terminal tax date to pay any resultant tax bill and will not be subject to any penalties or interest (this means that if he finalises his account right before terminal tax, the payment date will be almost immediate). 36 REFUNDS OF TAX AND AMOUNTS OF TAX TO PAY Sections 22F, 22J, 22IB and Schedule 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sections RM 2, RM 4, RM 5, RZ 15 and RZ 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Sections MD 1, MD 1B and MD 1C of the Income Tax Act 2004. Sections MD 1, MD 1B and MD 1C of the Income Tax Act 1994. Several amendments have been introduced to improve the process for issuing refunds and advising individuals that they have tax to pay or are due a refund. New write-off rules have also been introduced to reduce compliance costs and improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system. Together, these changes will simplify the rules so that more individuals can understand their obligations and meet those with minimal effort. Changes have also been made to the refund provisions for back years. As the law previously limited Inland Revenue’s ability to refund some credits, these amendments will allow for these amounts to be managed and refunded. Background Under the previous law, individuals were responsible for determining whether they were required to file a return, or whether they needed to take any action to finalise their tax position. 1 Taxpayers who were not required to file returns did not have their tax positions squared up automatically. If these taxpayers wanted to determine whether they had tax to pay or were due a refund, they were required to interact with Inland Revenue (by requesting a personal tax summary, for example). Non-filing taxpayers could be selective and, based on their summary of earnings, request a personal tax summary only in years in which a refund was due. This approach did not accord with the Government’s objective of making tax simpler for individuals, and there was an integrity concern with taxpayers being able to choose to obtain refunds but not be obligated to crystallise amounts of tax to pay. Under the new rules, if an individual who is not required to provide additional information is due a refund or has tax to pay, then Inland Revenue will complete this process for them. Refunds will be paid out without an individual having to interact with Inland Revenue to request them and Inland Revenue will contact individuals and inform them of any amounts of tax to pay. To improve the integrity and fairness of the system, new write-off rules have also been introduced. The objective behind these write off rules is to reduce compliance costs and ensure that individuals who have done everything they reasonably could to meet their obligations are not surprised by a tax bill at year-end. 1 A person was not required to file a return if they, in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria, derived $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax had not been withheld or had been withheld incorrectly (see section 33AA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). 37 Key features The changes are as follows: New individuals’ income tax changes • Inland Revenue will determine whether individuals who are not expected to be required to provide information to Inland Revenue are entitled to a refund or have tax to pay. • Refunds will be paid out without individuals having to request them. • Inland Revenue will issue income tax refunds by direct credit (provided customer bank account information is up to date), but not if that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable. • Write-off rules have been introduced that will be reversible if the taxpayer no longer meets the requirements to receive the write-off. These rules provide that when an individual has only earnt reportable income: − Amounts of tax payable that do not exceed $50 will not have to be paid. − Amounts of tax payable that arise due to an extra pay period where that income has been taxed at the correct rate will not have to be paid (subject to exclusions). − Amounts of tax payable that arise at year-end when an individual’s income is derived solely from an income tested benefit, education grant or payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension will not have to be paid. • An amendment has also been made to allow a list of prescribed persons to supply income and expense information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer if no executor or administrator is appointed. Changes to allow refunds to be made for back years • The refund provisions have been amended for back years to ensure that they are clear and unambiguous, that there is consistency across time periods and to allow previously time barred refunds to be paid out. • An amendment has been made to ensure that there are mechanisms in the law to allow for credits owed to deceased taxpayers under the previous law, to be refunded. • Inland Revenue will allow certain prescribed persons to provide “other income” information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer from 1 April 2019 to ensure assessments can be completed on behalf of deceased taxpayers in the year of their death. 38 Application date(s) The individuals’ income tax proposals apply from 1 April 2019, with the exception of the write- off rule for income derived from an extra pay period which applies from 1 April 2020. The amendment to the refund provisions to ensure consistency for back years applies retrospectively for the period 1 October 2004 until 31 March 2013. The amendment to allow a list of prescribed persons to confirm an income statement on behalf of a deceased taxpayer applies retrospectively for the period that the law on income statements was in force, being 1 April 2000 until 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis No obligations to provide information: de minimis and certain other amounts New section 22K sets out the circumstances in which an individual will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue. 22K(1) provides that an individual will not have to provide information for a tax year if the individual derives other income below a $200 de minimis threshold. Example 1: Max Max works in an office as an analyst, earning $70,000 per annum. Max’s first anniversary with his girlfriend is coming up, and Max really wants to buy her a necklace. Unfortunately for Max, their anniversary falls shortly after they have been away on holiday and Max has spent all of his money. Max visits the beach on the weekend and sees a bunch of people riding about and having fun on Feijoa scooters. Max enquires further and finds out that he can make some additional money as a Feijoa scooter recharger. The task involves collecting Feijoa scooters that are running low on battery, recharging them at home and taking them back to a designated area. Max loves the beach and lives just across the road from a Feijoa “drop off” point. Max eagerly signs up as a recharger, hoping to make enough money for the necklace and have some fun in the sun at the same time. After a weekend of recharging Feijoa scooters, Max checks his Feijoa app and finds that he has earned $188 for his weekend of work. Max goes out and buys the necklace and lets Feijoa know that he will no longer be recharging for them anymore. As the amount of other income Max has earned is under $200, and this is the only additional income Max has earned during the tax year that has not been subject to withholding, Max does not have to return this income in accordance with new section 22K. Example 2: Jamie Jamie works as a ranger at the local wild life park, earning $50,000 per annum. His best friend, Bateson, is going away for three months and pays Jamie $250 to keep his lawns and garden in shape while he is away. As this amount is above $200, Jamie will need to provide this income information to Inland Revenue and pay tax on this income. 39 Threshold for refunds or tax payable It was initially proposed that the $5 refund threshold in section 174AA(b) would be removed. This threshold meant that refunds lower than $5 did not have to be paid out and removing the threshold would require all refunds to be paid out regardless of amount. This change was not enacted and the existing $5 threshold in section 174AA(b) will remain. While the intention is to move to issuing tax refunds by direct credit, there will still be a need to issue cheques in the short term. Although the $5 threshold will be retained legislatively, Inland Revenue are currently expecting to refund amounts lower than $5 but will not yet refund very small amounts. Write-off rules for individuals In accordance with new section 22J and new schedule 8, an individual who only earned reportable income will be able to qualify for a write off in certain prescribed circumstances. These are: • if the amount of tax payable is no more than $50; • if the amount of tax payable is derived solely from certain income tested benefits; or • if the amount of tax payable is derived solely from an extra pay period. Example 3: Max and Jamie Drawing on our two examples above: Max: Although Max’s Feijoa scooter earnings fall under the definition of “other income”, the amount is less than $200. Because this is below the de minimis threshold, Max is deemed to be an individual who only earns “reportable income” and therefore will qualify for a write off where he meets the criteria. Jamie: Jamie has $250 of “other income”. This means that Jamie is no longer an individual who only earns “reportable income” and is therefore discounted from the write off rules. New section 22J(2) also provides that these write-offs will be reversible where a taxpayer no longer meets the requirements to receive the original write off, whether that be through a subsequent reassessment or otherwise. 40 Example 4: Dan Dan is a prison warden and earns $50,000 per annum. When his father died, he was left an inheritance of $20,000. Dan has this in a low risk term deposit with his local bank and earns 5% interest per year. When Dan set the term deposit up he used the most appropriate RWT rate for his expected income, which was 30%. On 1 April 2018, Dan is promoted at work to senior warden, and now earns $70,000 per annum. This means that Dan’s marginal tax rate is now 33% and therefore, 33% is the appropriate RWT rate for Dan to be on to ensure that his interest income is taxed correctly. Dan remains on the 30% RWT rate for the entire 2018–19 tax year. It follows that the $1,000 in interest that he earns from his term deposit would have been under withheld by $30, leaving him with tax to pay of $30. When the new individuals’ income tax changes kick in on 1 April 2019, Dan, as a reportable income earner who has never had any other income, has his assessment finalised by the Commissioner. This leaves Dan with a $30 tax bill, but this is written off automatically as it is under $50. After Dan’s tax position has been squared up, Dan realises that he fixed his neighbour’s car in March and was paid $1000 for his handy work. Dan logs onto myIR and makes an amendment to submit the $1,000 of other income. Dan’s tax position is recalculated, and he has a tax bill of $360.00. This is comprised of 33% tax on $1000 at Dan’s marginal rate (or $330) and, because Dan is now no longer an individual who solely earns reportable income, Dan no longer meets the requirements for the $30.00 write off he received. The write off is therefore reversed as per new section 22J(2). The following flowchart provides a brief overview of how the write off rules operate. The write off rules, and the number of exceptions that apply to them, will be discussed in greater detail over the following pages. 41 42 a. Where an individual only earns reportable income and tax payable is not more than $50 (Schedule 8, Part B, clause 1(a)). Part B clause 1(a) in new schedule 8 provides that when an individual who only earns reportable income has tax payable at year-end that is no more than $50, that amount of tax will not be required to be paid. If the amount of tax payable is greater than this amount, the entire amount payable must be paid unless another one of these rules applies. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that individuals who have had about the right amount of tax deducted will not have a tax bill at year-end. As interest income will now be included in a taxpayer’s income and tax calculation, the addition of the $50 write off essentially maintains the position where undertaxed interest income was not required to be reported provided it was less than $200. Example 5: Sarah Sarah works part time at a local café for 20 hours per week while she is at school. Sarah finishes school in December and carries on working part time over the summer. When summer ends, Sarah asks to increase her hours to full time. As the café is unable to offer Sarah full time hours, Sarah obtains another job at a local childcare centre, also for 20 hours per week. Both jobs pay her $25.00 per hour. Sarah commences her job at the childcare centre on 22 March and elects an “M” tax code. This now means that both Sarah’s job at the café and her job at the childcare centre are on the M tax code, instead of adopting a secondary code. When an M tax code is used for concurrent sources of income, there will be multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates and therefore tax to pay at year-end due to this overuse of the lower tax brackets. This is an incorrect tax code for Sarah to be on. In Sarah’s case, as both jobs are on the M tax code she is paying $68.65 in tax from each job (excluding ACC earner’s levy) per week. This amounts to $137.30 and less than the $165.76 that she should be paying if she were taxed at the right rate. As Sarah is being taxed at the incorrect rates for only one week, being the last week of the tax year, she will have tax to pay at year-end of $28.46. As this not more than $50, the tax will not be required to be paid as per schedule 8 clause b part 1(a). For the sake of completeness, it is also worth pointing out that, as Inland Revenue receives information by wa y of pay day reporting, Sarah’s use of incorrect tax codes will be picked up early in the following income year. As the income she receives from her two jobs crosses an income tax threshold, a tailored tax code would be more appropriate for her as opposed to a secondary tax code. Inland Revenue would therefore contact Sarah and recommend she selects a tailored tax code. If Sarah did not consent to this, Inland Revenue would instruct her second employer to adopt a secondary code – as using two M codes is an incorrect use of tax codes. In Sarah’s case she would be better off accepting a tailored tax code as this will ensure about the right amount of tax is deducted during the year. (b) All income from income-tested benefits When an individual receives all of their inco me from an inco me tested benefit, education grant or a payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension (or a combination of these), and an amount of tax payable arises at year-end, then this amount will not have to be paid by the individual. The purpose of this rule is to deal with an apparent under-withholding of PAYE in the situation where a person may receive a payment for a back-year entitlement. 43 Example 6: Cameron Cameron is a 64-year-old beneficiary and is in receipt of a benefit for part of the 2018–19 tax year. Cameron turns 65 on 1 November 2018 and begins receiving NZ Superannuation from that date. It transpires that Cameron is owed a back-paid benefit entitlement due to being underpaid in a previous tax year. In the event that the calculation of the tax payable on this back payment led to a tax bill at year-end, that tax would not need to be paid by Cameron. This is because, for the purposes of schedule 8, part B, clause 1(b) of the TAA, this constitutes an amount of tax that relates to reportable income derived solely from income sources in clause 1(b). For the purposes of this rule, it does not matter that Cameron derived income from a combination of the sources listed in clause 1(b) (in his case a benefit and NZ superannuation). (c) Extra pay period in the corresponding income year If an individual who only earns reportable income which has been taxed at the correct rate has tax payable at year-end that has arisen solely because of an extra pay period, then that amount of tax owing will not need to be paid. Example 7: Sam Sam is an employee earning salary income which is paid weekly and from which his employer deducts PAYE each pay day. Last year Sam’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Sam earned $1,500 from which Sam’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-day. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Sam received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Sam has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Sam would not be required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what it knows about Sam. There would be no reason to suggest that Sam needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue, as Sam only earns reportable income which has been taxed at the correct rate, he will not have to pay the extra tax that has arisen due to the extra pay period. Exclusions (Schedule 8, part B, clause 2) As mentioned above, there are three categories under which a reportable income earner may be eligible for a write off. These are: • if the amount of tax payable does not exceed $50; • if the income is derived solely from certain income tested benefits; or • an amount of tax to pay on income derived from extra pay period in the income year The purpose of schedule 8, part B, clause 2 is to set out the exclusions that apply to these write off rules. If the amount of tax payable does not exceed $50 As per Schedule 8 Part B clause 1(a), tax payable that does not exceed $50 will be written off. This applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer has complied with any other obligations. The 44 purpose of this rule is to ensure administrative efficiency and to ensure consistency with the de minimis threshold for the provision of other income information (currently set at $200). There are no exceptions to this rule. If the income is derived solely from certain income tested benefits In order to qualify for a write-off under this rule, a taxpayer’s income must be derived solely from an income tested benefit, education grant or a payment of NZ superannuation/veterans’ pension. It is acknowledged that there may be instances when an individual who qualifies under this rule may earn a small amount of additional income which should not necessarily disqualify them fro m a write-off. Schedule 8 Part B clause 3 provides that, despite the rule, the Commissioner may write off an amount of tax if the amount is not substantial and represents an underpayment of tax that is attributable to a function or operation of the tax collection rules. Example 8: Cameron As mentioned in example 6, Cameron is a beneficiary and receives $250 per week (gross), or $13,000 pa. Cameron received a call from MSD informing him that they had miscalculated his entitlement for the 13–14 tax year and that he was owed $3,000. As Cameron’s income was derived solely from an income-tested benefit, it was concluded that Cameron’s $210 tax bill would be written off. Consider a modification to that scenario whereby, instead of solely deriving his income from an income tested benefit, Cameron also had a small amount of money in an interest-bearing bank account. In that situation, although Cameron’s income is no longer solely derived from an income-tested benefit, Schedule 8 Part B Clause 3 would kick in to ensure that Cameron still received the write off. The threshold set under Schedule 8 Part B Clause 3 will be set administratively. The other exception that applies to the write off rule for income derived solely from certain benefits, is the Working for Families Tax Credit (WfFTC) exception under Schedule 8 Part B Clause 2(1). This means that, if the taxpayer receives WfFTC, they will be unable to receive a write off under this rule. If the income is derived from an extra pay period in the income year As with the two above rules, if a taxpayer receives WfFTC, the taxpayer will not be eligible for a write-off of income derived from an extra pay period (see Schedule 8 Part B Clause 2(1). The application date for this extra pay rule is deferred until 1 April 2020. 45 Example 9: Sophia Sophia works at a meat processing plant and earns $38,000 per annum. She has 5 kids and her husband stays at home to look after them. Sophia is also a recipient of WfFTC. Because of the day on which she is paid, Sophia receives 53 weekly pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days for weekly earners). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days in a tax year, Sophia has a tax shortfall of $28.88 from her PAYE income at year-end. (She received $38,731 salary income in the tax year, but her weekly PAYE was based on $38,000). Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) provides that an amount of tax that arises solely because an individual has an extra pay period will be written off. However, the exclusion in clause 2(1) of this Part provides that a taxpayer will not qualify for an extra pay write off where the taxpayer has been assessed as receiving an entitlement and tax credit under the family scheme (receives working for families). This means that Sophia would ordinarily have to pay the $28.88 shortfall that arose as a result of the extra pay. However, in this case, because the amount is still under $50.00, it will be written off as per Schedule 8 Part B clause 1(a). A taxpayer will also not qualify for a write off under this rule if, for the types of income referred to in Schedule 8, Part B, clause 2(3): • the Commissioner has recommended, and the individual has consented to a change to a higher tax code or rate; or • the individual has used a tailored tax code. The types of income listed in Schedule 8, Part B, clause 2(3) are: • any income where the obligations of the individual under the PAYE rules are not met; • investment income where RWT is withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate; • schedular income, income from employment that is an extra pay or secondary employment where tax has been withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate; • an amount of income derived from a Maori authority distribution or derived using the EDW or CAE code where the individual’s gross annual income is more than $48,000; and • employee share scheme income where the employer has not elected to withhold tax 46 Example 10a: Thomas Thomas works as an accounting intern and earns $40,000 per annum. Thomas also has a $100,000 inheritance which he has invested in a term deposit with his local bank yielding him 4% interest pa. At the time Thomas deposited the money, 17.5% was the most suitable RWT rate for his interest income. Thomas leaves his intern position and takes up a position at another accounting firm as an analyst, starting 1 April 2019. Thomas’s new salary is $78,000 per annum. Although Thomas’s marginal tax rate for the 2018– 19 income year will be 33% due to his new job, Thomas forgets to update his RWT rate with the bank. Inland Revenue notices that Thomas’s salary has increased and that 33% is a more appropriate RWT rate for him to be on for his interest income. Inland Revenue picks this up by way of a proactive action and on 20 April suggests that Thomas consents to an increased RWT rate. Thomas consents to the change. Because of the day on which Thomas gets paid for his new job, he receives 53 weekly pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days for weekly earners). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days in a tax year, Thomas has a tax shortfall of $175 from his PAYE income at year-end (he received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000). Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) provides that an amount of tax that arises solely because an individual has an extra pay period will be written off. However, the exclusion in clause 2(2) of this Part provides that a taxpayer will not qualify for an extra pay write off when the Commissioner has recommended, and the individual has consented to, a change in tax code or rate to a type of income in clause 2(3). The Commissioner recommended a change to Thomas’s RWT rate and Thomas accepted this change. RWT on investment income that is withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate is listed in clause 2(3). This means that Thomas will have to pay the $175 shortfall that arose as a result of the extra pay. He will also have some tax payable on his interest income to account for the period of time where he commenced his higher paying job but was still on the unsuitable RWT rate of 17.5% for his interest income. For the sake of completeness, it is also noted that if Thomas had rejected the proactive action and had remained on the 17.5% interest rate for his investment income he would still have the same amount of tax payable at year- end. This is because Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) requires the amount of tax payable to arise solely from the extra pay period in order for it to be eligible for a write off. In Thomas’s case, there is also an amount of tax payable that has arisen due to the use of an unsuitable RWT rate at a time where his taxable income has increased (by virtue of the new job). Thomas is therefore not eligible for any form of write off. 47 Example 10b: Paul Paul works two days per week as an engineering consultant for a small technology start up and is paid $35,000 per year. Paul starts another job for two days per week, on 1 April, as a project manager on a large building site and earns $25,000 per year. Because Paul’s secondary income crosses an income tax threshold, Paul should ideally be on a tailored tax code for his project manager salary to ensure that about the right amount of tax is withheld during the year. Paul initially elects an “M” tax code when he starts his job as a project manager. If an M tax code is used for concurrent sources of income, there will be multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates resulting in tax to pay at year-end due to this overuse of the lower tax brackets. This is an incorrect tax code for Paul to be on. Inland Revenue notice that Paul is on an incorrect tax code, and by way of a proactive action, suggest that he adopt a tailored tax code for his second job. Paul adopts the tailored tax code after 4 weeks. Because of the day on which Paul is paid by the technology start up, Paul will have 53 pay periods in the year. Paul will therefore receive some income that has not been subject to the correct withholding and will have a tax shortfall at year-end. Paul will also have a small amount of tax payable to account for the period of time during which his second job (project manager) was also using the lowest tax rate. Schedule 8 Part B Clause 1(c) requires the amount of tax payable to arise solely from the extra pay period in order for it to be eligible for a write off. Although Paul has some tax to pay that has arisen due to his extra pay, he also has a small amount of tax to pay due to being on an “M” tax code for part of the year for his project manager salary. Paul is therefore denied the write off. Example 10c: Paul (variation) If we consider a variation of the above example with Paul, but instead of Paul selecting an “M” tax code when he starts his second job as a project manager, Paul sets up a tailored tax code from the outset. This means that a more appropriate amount of tax will be withheld from his project manager salary throughout the year. Although Paul will receive an extra pay from the technology start-up which will not be subject to withholding, he will be eligible for a write-off of this amount. This is because the amount of tax payable has arisen solely due to the extra pay period. Moreover, although Paul has used a tailored tax code, the tailored tax code was not applied to secondary employment earnings from which tax was withheld at a rate lower than the correct rate. In this case, the tailored tax code was applied to the secondary employment earnings from the beginning of the tax year and was therefore always withheld at the correct rate. Schedule 8 Part B clause 3 provides that, despite the exceptions, the Commissioner may write off an amount of tax if the amount is not substantial and represents an underpayment of tax that is attributable to a function or operation of the tax collection rules. Order in Council amending schedule 8 – 22J(3) New section 22J(3) provides that amounts of tax may be added to or removed from schedule 8 part B, clause 1 and 2 by Order in Council. Schedule 8 Part B clause 1 sets out the types of tax payable that must be written off under the individual’s write off rules. Clause 2 sets out when an amount of tax does not qualify for a write off under clause 1. In accordance with section 22J(4), appropriate consultation must be undertaken on the proposed amendments before a Minister recommends a change by Order in Council. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that there is flexibility in the law to deal with any unforeseen or changing circumstances in a timely manner without having to go through the full legislative 48 process to make a change. As consultation is a requirement under 22J(4), this will ensure that differing views are considered adequately on any given proposal. Changes to the refund provisions for back years This section of this special report outlines changes made to the refund provisions for back years. Although these changes are not part of the substantive proposals under the new individuals’ income regime, these changes are important to ease the transition between the previous law on income statements and the new rules for individuals. Amendments to section RM 2 and its predecessors for refunds of overpaid tax Section RM 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and its prior equivalents (MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) have been amended to simplify the section and to alleviate an ambiguity regarding the application of the time bar to various tax types (for example – income tax vs ancillary taxes and approved issuer levy). An amendment has also been made to section RM 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which deals with overpayments on amended assessments, to ensure that the time bar application is unambiguous in this section as well. More significantly, the Act inserts section RZ 16 into the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MD 1C into the 2004 and 1994 Income Tax Acts. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that RM 2 and its predecessors apply consistently for back years. The way that section RM 2 currently applies limits a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund from an amended assessment to a four-year period, but the ability to claim a refund from the original return is unlimited. This is consistent with the policy intent. There is a period during which this section and its predecessors restricted a taxpayer’s ability to claim from an original return to four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the return. The purpose of the amendments, which are retrospective in nature, is to ensure that the section applies consistently across all time periods and allow for previously time barred refunds to be paid out. Example 11: Adam Adam is due a tax refund of $40 for the 2007–08 tax year. Inland Revenue does not have any contact details or a bank account for Adam and is unable to pay out the refund. Inland Revenue sends a letter to Adam’s last known address advising him of the refund and asking him to contact Inland Revenue with bank account details. Adam eventually receives the letter via a forwarding service six years later and calls Inland Revenue for the refund. The refund is time barred and is unable to be paid out to Adam. This is because the law that applied for the 2007–08 tax year restricted a taxpayer’s ability to claim a refund to a four-year period. It is noted that had the same situation occurred for the 2003–04 tax year, Adam would be able to claim the refund at any point in the future. This is because the restrictive application of the provision did not apply at this time. The amendments made to these refund provisions ensures that refunds are treated consistently across all periods. This enables old refunds, such as the one in Adam’s situation, to be paid out. 49 Repeal of section RM 5 and new provisions to govern the treatment of certain refunds made on income statements for back years This Act repeals section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, along with all other law pertaining to income statements. Section RM 5 required a refund over a certain threshold to be confirmed as correct by the taxpayer before it could be paid out. The application of section RM 5 meant that, when a taxpayer died, and no administrator or executor had been appointed, nobody could legally confirm the deceased’s income statement as correct. This meant that the refund would sit in Inland Revenue’s system indefinitely and could not be refunded. New section RZ 15 has been added into the Income Tax Act 2007 and section MD 1B into the 2004 and 1994 Income Tax Acts to address this issue. These amendments allow for someone to act on behalf of a deceased person to confirm the refund when that person has died, no executor or administrator has been appointed and the refund amount is less than $15,000. Example 12: Juliet Juliet is due a tax refund of $800 for the 2015–16 tax year. In accordance with the requirements in section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007, Inland Revenue sends Juliet a letter requesting that she confirm the correctness of her income statement. This is necessary before the refund can be paid out. Juliet dies before receiving the letter. Juliet dies intestate (without a will). Her estate is not worth much money, so there is not a sufficient incentive for her relatives to apply for letters of administration to deal with her estate (this can be costly and time consuming). The law that applied prior to these amendments meant that nobody could legally confirm the correctness of Juliet’s income statement. This meant that the refund could not legally be released. The amendments in this Act allow for relatives to confirm the correctness of an income statement to ensure that refunds owing to a deceased taxpayer are able to be paid out. Provision of income information for deceased taxpayers In order to ensure that the new individuals’ income proposals work effectively, new subsections 22F(5) and (6) provide a mechanism through which certain prescribed persons can provide income information on behalf of a deceased taxpayer. Similar to the situation set out above in the example with Juliet (which exists under the old law), under the new individuals’ income tax rules it is important to ensure that income information is provided to Inland Revenue for a deceased taxpayer so that the taxpayer’s tax posit ion can be finalised. The inclusion of these new provisions makes it easier for Inland Revenue to finalise the account of a deceased person. 50 Example 13: Adam Adam works in an office and earns salary and wages. He also has three rental properties and has previousl y filed IR3 returns. Upon the introduction of the individuals’ income tax changes for the 2018–19 tax year, Adam starts providing this “other income” to Inland Revenue so that his tax position can be can be finalised at year- end. In 2022 Adam sadly passes away without a will. As there is no executor, no one can step into Adam’s shoes and officially deal with his affairs. To ensure that his tax position can be resolved, new section 22F(5) and (6) allow the Commissioner to accept income information from a prescribed list of persons, such as relatives, to finalise Adam’s tax position. 51 PROACTIVE ACTIONS Sections 24DB and 25A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to enable Inland Revenue to take proactive actions during the year to help people use appropriate tax rates or codes to minimise year-end debts and refunds. Background Previously, if an individual was using a tax code which they were not entitled to use, Inland Revenue would contact their employer and instruct that the code be changed. If an individual was using a code that was not wrong per se, but did not reflect their likely year-end tax liability, Inland Revenue lacked the relevant information to suggest corrective action. This would result in a debt or a refund at the end of the year when the individual squared up their tax position. One of the key objectives of the changes to individuals’ income tax is to ensure that individuals pay about the right amount of tax during the year, thereby minimising instances where there is a large debt or refund at year-end. To support this objective, Inland Revenue will utilise the more frequent employment and investment income information it receives to suggest corrective action where projections suggest that an individual is likely to end up with a material under or overpayment of tax because of the withholding rate they are using. This means that Inland Revenue will now contact an individual who is either on an incorrect or an unsuitable rate or code. The difference is that an individual can choose not to accept the change when their current code or rate is merely an unsuitable one. Suggesting that individuals adopt more appropriate rates will improve how secondary and irregular sources of income are taxed and strengthens the overall perception that the tax system operates fairly throughout the year. Key features The changes are as follows: • Inland Revenue will monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify when they may be using an incorrect or unsuitable tax code or rate. • Inland Revenue will contact individuals who use an incorrect or unsuitable code or rate and recommend they change it. • If the individual consents to the change in code or rate, Inland Revenue will notify the employer or payer to update the code or rate. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis In order to understand what these amendments aim to achieve, it is important to appreciate the distinction between an “incorrect” tax code and an “unsuitable tax code”. An individual’s tax 52 code will be deemed incorrect when they are using a tax code that they are not entitled to use (for example – if a taxpayer has a student loan but is on an “M” tax code instead of “M SL”). The current position under the law will remain unchanged for incorrect tax codes and Inland Revenue will continue to contact the individual’s employer and instruct that the code be changed. An “unsuitable” tax rate or code is used to describe situations where an individual is using a code they are eligible to use, but when projections suggest that the individual is likely to end up with an under or overpayment of tax. Use of unsuitable tax codes – Section 24DB Under this section, if an individual who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, Inland Revenue may recommend a prospective change to the tax code and, with consent of the individual, notify the employer of the change. Example 1: Susanna Susanna earns a salary of $42,000 per annum. Her current tax code is “M”, which is a code that she is entitled to use. Given that Susanna earns below $44,000, she is entitled to the full independent earner tax credit of $520 per year. In order to obtain this tax credit Susanna would need to be on an “ME” tax code or, if she has a student loan “ME SL”. As a result of the changes, Inland Revenue would contact Susanna and let her know that an “ME” tax code would be a more appropriate code for her to be on. If Susanna consents to the change, Inland Revenue will instruct her employer to update her tax code to “ME”. The new tax code would apply to PAYE income earned after the employer has been instructed to change the tax code or rate. Use of unsuitable RWT rates – Section 25A Section 25A provides that Inland Revenue may contact an individual regarding their use of an unsuitable tax rate for their investment interest income and recommend a prospective change to a more suitable RWT rate. If the taxpayer consents to the change, Inland Revenue will notify the investment income payer. Once notified of the rate change, the investment income payer must update this as soon as reasonably practicable. If the taxpayer subsequently notifies the income payer of a different rate, the payer must apply the rate notified by the taxpayer. 53 Example 2: Thomas Thomas set up an interest-bearing bank account ten years ago. He selected the 17.5% tax rate, which was right at the time. Thomas earns more now than he did ten years ago, so in order to have tax deducted at the most appropriate tax rate he should have increased the tax rate, but he didn’t think of this. Thomas earned $1,000 of interest this year, from which his bank withheld $175 of tax. Because Thomas’ marginal tax rate has increased to 33%, $330 would have been a more appropriate amount to withhold (33% tax rate). As his tax rate was not updated, Thomas will be required to pay $155 of outstanding tax ($330 - $175) at the end of the year because less tax was withheld from his interest income than is ultimately due on that interest income. Due to the changes, Inland Revenue could contact Thomas and let him know that 33% is likely to be a more appropriate tax rate for his interest income. If Thomas consents to the change, Inland Revenue will instruct the bank to change the rate to 33%. 54 TAILORED (SPECIAL) TAX CODES Sections 24D and 24DB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been made to enable Inland Revenue to help individuals use tailored tax codes to ensure that the rate of withholding tax on their income, including secondary sources of income, is appropriate during the year. Background A special tax code, now referred to as a tailored tax code, applies a tailored rate of withholding to a taxpayer’s income. When a person is working multiple jobs or working while receiving a benefit from the Ministry of Social Development, a tailored tax code can help ensure that the individual pays about the right amount of tax during the year and is not left with a large tax bill or refund at year-end. Although secondary tax codes and special tax codes were available to individuals under previous law, there were several limitations with that system that are rectified by this Act. Secondary tax codes Secondary tax codes are intended to ensure that income from a subsequent job is taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. Example 1: George and Mary George has one job with a salary of $53,000 on which he will pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 of tax paid on the first $14,000 of income at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001-$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and $1,500 from $48,001–$53,000 taxed at 30%. Mary earns $48,000 from her main job and $5,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will also pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001–$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $5,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $1,500. The above example demonstrates that secondary tax codes will work as intended when an income tax threshold has not been crossed. However, as we have a progressive personal tax scale, secondary tax codes can result in more tax being withheld during the year than is necessary to satisfy the individual’s tax liability. This occurs when income from a second job takes a person’s total income over a tax threshold. Example 2: Sophie Sophie earns $35,000 from her main job and $18,000 from her second job ($53,000 total) on which she will pay $10,545 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001–$35,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at her marginal rate, the $18,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $5,400. Sophie will be owed a refund of $1,625 at the end of the tax year. Example 2 above results in an overpayment of tax because, by taxing the entire $18,000 that Sophie earns from her second job at her marginal tax rate of 30%, the secondary tax code 55 operates to deny Sophie the full use of the middle tax band. In her case, only income from $14,000 – $35,000 was taxed at 17.5%, as opposed to income from $14,000 – $48,000. Secondary tax codes are set at a taxpayer’s marginal rate to prevent multiple claims to the lowest (or lower) tax rates for people with multiple sources of PAYE income. If it weren’t for secondary tax codes, taxpayers may receive an unexpected tax bill at the end of the year. Consider example 3 below: Example 3: Sophie If Sophie used an “M” tax code for both of her jobs, then the following would apply: Job 1 (salary of $35,000): $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001-$35,000 taxed at 17.5% = $5,145. Job 2 (salary of $18,000): $1,470 paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5% and $700 tax paid on income from $14,000- $18,000 taxed at 17.5% = $2,170 Total tax paid = $7,315 (compared with $8,920 that should be paid by somebody earning $53,000). Sophie will have tax to pay of $1,605 at the end of the tax year. As example 3 demonstrates, Sophie would have a tax bill of $1,605 at year-end if she used the M tax code for both of her jobs. Secondary tax codes are a somewhat blunt instrument designed to prevent over and under deductions from arising as they can only apply at a taxpayer’s marginal rate. This works where the secondary income doesn’t cross a tax threshold but causes the taxpayer to overpay tax if it does cross a threshold. Secondary tax codes are still used as the default option as they work in the majority of cases and because a more blended or tailored rate cannot be applied by default without knowing a taxpayer’s pattern of earnings. In order to limit instances of incorrect withholding, individuals who work multiple jobs and are able to estimate their likely annual income could opt for a tailored tax code, which gives a withholding rate that is tailored to their personal circumstances. Tailored (special) tax codes Although the previous system allowed an individual to apply for a special tax code to help ensure that the correct amount of tax was withheld during the year, special tax codes were not easily accessible to all individuals. This was because: • an individual first needed to know about special tax codes; • they needed to realise that using one could benefit them; and • they needed to be able to estimate their likely annual inco me. The process for obtaining a special tax code was also administratively burdensome and required an individual to fill out an application and post it to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would then calculate the appropriate withholding rate and grant the individual a special tax code and a certificate that was only valid until the end of the tax year. The individual was then required to advise their employer that they wanted the special tax code applied to their income. As a consequence of all of this, only approximately 8,000 individuals used a special tax code for the 2016 year (approximately 570,000 people were using secondary tax codes and a larger proportion of these people could have benefitted from using a special tax code if their secondary income took them over a tax threshold). 56 Key features The newly enacted provisions make tailored tax codes more accessible and customer centric. The changes are as follows: • The process of applying for a tailored tax code has been simplified (including being able to apply online). • Inland Revenue will monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify when a person may benefit from using a tailored tax code. • Inland Revenue will proactively contact individuals who may benefit from using a tailored tax code and recommend that they consider changing their code. • When an individual has consented to a change to a tailored tax code, Inland Revenue will notify an individual’s employer of their updated tax code. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Tax codes provided by the Commissioner – Section 24D Section 24D has been amended to allow the Commissioner to recommend a tailored tax code to an employee. The amendment to this provision ensures that Inland Revenue can recommend tailored tax codes as part of the proactive actions it undertakes. That is, where the information Inland Revenue receives about an individual suggests that the individual may end up with an under or overpayment of tax because of the withholding rate they are using, the Commissioner can recommend a tailored tax code to help the taxpayer to pay the right amount of tax during the year. Use of unsuitable tax codes – Section 24DB As previously mentioned under “proactive actions”, when a taxpayer who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, section 24DB allows Inland Revenue to recommend a prospective change to that code, and with the consent of the individual, notify the employer of the change. A change to a more suitable code includes a change to a tailored tax code. 57 Example 4: Sophie The following example demonstrates how a proactive action could be used to assist Sophie in selecting a tailored tax code. As per the previous example, Sophie earns $35,000 per annum from her main job and $18,000 per annum from her second job. The secondary tax code that applies to her second job means that all income she earns from this source is taxed at her marginal tax rate of 30%. Sophie’s tax year commences 1 April 2019. Inland Revenue receives Sophie’s salary and tax information by way of pay day reporting and, after a few weeks, notices that Sophie has a regular pattern of earnings that is currently being overtaxed. As set out in the initial example with Sophie, if the current rate of taxation continues, Sophie will be owed a refund of $1,625 at year-end. This is money that Sophie could be using during the year. Inland Revenue writes to Sophie to advise her that she may benefit from a tailored tax code. The aim behind the tailored code is to ensure that, where possible, there is no refund due or tax to pay at year-end. This means that the tailored rate of tax required to be applied to Sophie’s secondary income will vary slightly based on the point during the tax year at which it is adopted. This is because the tailored tax code should take into account any under or over withholding that occurs at any point during the tax year to try to reach a net zero position at year-end. Consider the following variations: Example 4a Inland Revenue writes to Sophie twelve weeks after the commencement of the tax year and Sophie immediately consents to a tailored tax code. Assuming Sophie is paid weekly, in this situation Sophie would have received twelve pays from her second job from which tax had been over withheld, representing an over withholding of $375. To ensure that Sophie has no tax to pay or refund due at year-end, the tailored tax code that would need to be applied to Sophie’s second source of income going forward will be approximately 18%. As Sophie has consented to this rate, Inland Revenue will instruct the employer at her second job to update the rate. Example 4b Although Sophie receives Inland Revenue’s letter suggesting she accept a tailored tax code twelve weeks into the tax year, Sophie does not get in contact with Inland Revenue to set up a tailored tax code for a further six weeks. This means that Sophie will have received 18 pays from her second job from which tax had been over withheld, representing an over withholding of $562.50. For Sophie to have no tax to pay or refund due at year- end, the tailored tax code that would need to be applied to Sophie’s second source of income going forward will be approximately 16%. Example 4 above demonstrates that, in order to ensure that a taxpayer pays about the right amount of tax during the year, a tailored tax code needs to not only consider pay periods going forward, but also needs to consider any under or over withholding that occurred earlier in the tax year. It is noted that there are some situations where it may not be appropriate to use a tailored tax code to ensure a “net zero” position at year-end. For example, a tailored tax code that fully recovers the underpaid tax would be unsuitable if a taxpayer has had their tax under withheld and there are not enough pay periods left until the end of the year to correct the under withholding without putting the taxpayer into hardship. Inland Revenue will take this into account when deciding whether it’s appropriate to recommend a tailored tax code to a taxpayer. This should prevent any hardship caused by imposing a very high tailored rate for any remaining pay periods for the tax year. 58 THE ADMINISTRATION OF DONATIONS TAX CREDITS Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Several amendments have been introduced to simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits. Inland Revenue will now accept donation receipts which are submitted electronically via myIR and submitted during the year. There is the option to file a separate donation tax credit claim if the payer chooses to do so. Background Previously, credits for donations could be claimed at the end of the tax year by filling in a tax credit claim form (IR526), or during the year through Payroll Giving, where the credits would be received immediately. An IR526 is a paper-based form, and paper versions of receipts had to be saved and submitted with this form at the end of the year. These changes simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits and make it more flexible. Under the changes, they have the option to submit receipts electronically when they receive them, which reduces the risk that they could be forgotten or lost before being able to be submitted. The tax credit claim process (the IR526) will be retained as an option for those who prefer to file their donation tax credit claim separately. At year-end, if a person has submitted donation receipts during the year and Inland Revenue considers the person is entitled to the donation tax credit, the refund will be issued without the need to submit a tax credit claim request. Key features The key changes are as follows: • Donations receipts can be submitted during the year and can be submitted electronically. • Donations tax credits can be claimed as part of the income tax year-end process. • If an individual has already submitted receipts during the year, these will automatically be taken into account without the individual having to fill in a separate claim form. Application date These amendments apply from 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Returns by persons with tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts (section 41A amended) Section 41A(1) prescribes the ways in which a person may apply to have their tax credit refunded. In practice, a person may: • upload donation receipts through myIR during the year; • complete the relevant donation section when providing other income information through the pre-populated account; 59 • complete a separate return online through myIR (that is – if done after other income information is provided); or • complete a paper form. Example 1: Olivia Olivia is crazy about animals and always donates money each week to a local animal charity that campaigns outside her office building. Olivia is tax savvy and always ensures that she receives a receipt with each donation. Under the changes, Olivia does not have to wait until the end of the year to submit her receipts with the paper based IR526 form at the end of the year. Each time she donates, Olivia uploads her receipts electronically on myIR. At year-end Olivia receives the refund automatically without having to do anything. Section 41A(6B) ensures that donation tax credit claims are subject to the same time bar rules that apply to income tax returns. This means that the Commissioner cannot amend a tax credit claim (either adjust up or down) after 4 years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer submits the donation tax credit claim.

### Urgent tax measures for economic recovery

Urgent legislation has been passed to support the package of economic and social measures needed to recover from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

“The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Bill will cushion New Zealanders from the worst economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Revenue Minister Stuart Nash.

“It is important to act fast to ensure businesses and individuals get the support they need now. For example, businesses can immediately claim tax deductions for low value assets like computers, mobile phones, cameras, microphones, headphones and other equipment required to work from home.

“Penalties for late tax payments will be written off, tax planning and certainty is restored through the ability to depreciate some buildings, and a higher threshold for provisional tax obligations will also give relief.

“Our first priority is to prevent and mitigate the health risks and to protect the vulnerable. But we are also keenly aware of the need to prevent and mitigate risks to our economy. This Bill is one part of the Government’s response.

“It includes targeted measures to provide relief to people and businesses economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. It also includes measures aimed at addressing the broader economic impacts of the outbreak,” Mr Nash said.

The main measures contained in this Bill are:

*   Restoring building depreciation. This would support businesses and encourage investment in new and existing building by reinstating depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings. It provides business support by improving cashflow in the near-term, and assists with the broader economic recovery by stimulating business investment in new and existing buildings.
*   Increasing the provisional tax threshold from $2,500 to $5,000. This relieves the compliance burden for small businesses as well as freeing up cashflow. It allows people to delay paying their provisional tax. They can wait until 7 February in the year following the year they file their return before they have to pay, instead of having to pay in instalments throughout the year. It allows them to retain cash for longer. It will benefit an estimated 95,000 people.
*   Allowing immediate low-value asset write offs. To encourage spending, the change will temporarily increase the threshold of the value of assets which can be deducted in the year the asset was purchased. The threshold will increase from $500 to $5,000 for assets purchased in the 12 months from 17 March 2020 (reducing to $1,000 from 17 March 2021.
*   Bringing forward broader R&D refundability. The proposed amendment would bring planned refundability measures forward by one year, to the 2019–20 income year. This would help relieve cashflow problems, encourage businesses to retain their R&D staff, and (where possible) support these firms to continue their R&D in the current environment.
*   Allowing use of money interest to be waived. The Bill proposes to allow Inland Revenue to cancel interest on a late tax payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make a payment due on or after 14 February 2020 was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.
*   Allowing greater information sharing. This would allow Inland Revenue to share information with a wider group of government agencies to assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response.
*   Allowing more access to the in-work tax credit. This would ensure that working families whose working hours are reduced as a result of COVID-19 would not lose their eligibility for the tax credit. Around 19,000 families will benefit.

### Tax changes throw cash lifeline to SMEs

A significant package of tax reforms will be pushed through all stages in Parliament today to throw a cash flow lifeline to small businesses.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill gives businesses more than $3 billion in tax refunds as they deal with the economic impact of the virus.

“This response delivers the single biggest government support package to businesses via the tax system in modern New Zealand history, and more is yet to come,” Mr Nash said.

“As the Prime Minister and Finance Minister have said we are constantly monitoring the situation for business and adjusting our support as required. Just yesterday we indicated additional support will be coming for commercial leases.

“We will keep supporting business and jobs where we can to cushion the blow of the virus and ensure New Zealand is well positioned for recovery.”

“Today’s changes mean cash could start flowing to businesses via the tax system as early as next week. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are feeling the pain now. We are moving urgently to get cash into their hands as quickly as possible, by taking current losses back to a prior year.

“My strong advice to businesses is to talk to their accountant, bookkeeper or tax agent, or log onto the MyIR portal as quickly as possible to ensure they take advantage of the government support as soon as changes come into effect this week.

“The tax refunds will be a cash lifeline for businesses with non-wage fixed costs, like rent, interest and insurance. Some don’t want to take on extra debt with a bank loan. Without this support these otherwise viable SMEs may be forced to close.

“The changes were signalled two weeks ago and design features have now been finalised after discussions between Inland Revenue and external tax practitioners. I am grateful to the accounting and legal profession and IR officials for their rapid work on this legislation.

“The omnibus bill deals with tax and regulatory changes to support businesses and others get through the economic shock caused by COVID. The main measures will:

*   introduce a tax loss carry-back regime to provide cash flow quickly to businesses, by allowing losses to be carried back one year;
*   allow IR to change due dates, timeframes or other procedural requirements for tax returns for taxpayers affected by COVID-19;
*   ensure the treatment of benefits and pensions paid to New Zealanders stranded overseas is consistent with the treatment of equivalent payments in New Zealand;
*   Bring forward the commencement date of certain protections relating to high-cost consumer credit contracts;
*   Prevent famers and others working with animals having to call in vets to undertake minor surgical procedures during the lockdown; and
*   extend the timeframe for certain Crown entities to provide planning documents to responsible or shareholding Ministers.

“Other tax changes just before the lockdown involved a $2.8 billion support package for business.

“It gives $2 billion in tax deductions to landlords through depreciation on commercial buildings. It removes 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime by raising the tax threshold to $5,000; allows businesses to claim back more for spending on low-value assets like laptops and phones; and allows interest to be waived on late payments.

“The wage subsidy has also been a vital factor in small business survival. Around 97 per cent of businesses who received the subsidy are either sole traders or firms employing fewer than 20 staff.

“More than $1.25 billion has been paid to about 188,000 sole traders. A further $4.27 billion has gone to 160,000 small businesses that employ between one and 19 staff. Almost 8,900 medium-sized firms, with 20-99 staff, have been paid $1.3 billion.

“SMEs can also call on government support to pay for professional advice to plan for survival and recovery from the economic shock caused by COVID. A $25 million business consultancy fund will pay for tailored specialist support such as business continuity planning, finance and cash flow management, HR and staffing issues.

“The global pandemic and economic crisis is hitting every nation hard. We are moving to cushion the blow for businesses and workers in this country as Alert Level 3 opens up the economy to prepare for recovery,” Mr Nash said.

New loan criteria announced
===========================

The Minister of Revenue and the Small Business Minister announced today that Cabinet had decided to make the small business cashflow loan scheme available to more businesses by introducing revised eligibility criteria. These will take effect from early February 2021.

Small business support expanded
-------------------------------

*   Eligibility criteria broadened to include new businesses
*   SMEs able to draw down loans more than once
*   Milestone reached as 100,000 SMEs tap into cheap working capital

More small businesses will be eligible to take out interest-free loans under changes announced today to a government cashflow scheme.

Revenue Minister David Parker said one of the Government’s top economic priorities after taking office was to extend the Small Business Cashflow Loan scheme for three years and extend the interest-free period to two years.

“We have extended the purpose of the scheme and will enable borrowing for investment in new equipment and digital infrastructure,” David Parker said.

“In addition, firms can draw down a second loan, if they still meet eligibility criteria and have repaid the original loan in full. We want to keep viable businesses afloat where we can.

“Some firms have promptly repaid their original loan and may wish to draw down another loan as circumstances change. More businesses will have access to this line of credit to help them prosper.

“There are encouraging signs for our economy, but the global economic outlook remains uncertain. The scheme provides a backstop for small and medium businesses. The changes deliver on our election commitments,” David Parker said.

Small Business Minister Stuart Nash says cashflow support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has been central to government efforts to accelerate the economic recovery and sustain businesses and jobs.

“The interest-free loans have proven a popular and fast way to access finance. We are delighted to reach a milestone of 100,000 SMEs who have drawn on this government support to the tune of $1.6 billion.

“Many businesses have also repaid their loans as the economy continues to open up. Around 6,500 SMEs have so far made more than $45.4 million in repayments.

“As the economy moves into recovery and rebuild we are also broadening the eligibility criteria so more businesses can access support. Businesses established after 1 April 2020, which have existed for six months, will now be eligible for a loan if they meet other eligibility criteria.

“We are also changing the requirement that a business must have experienced a decline in actual or predicted revenue of at least 30 per cent in any 30-day period from January to June 2020, compared with the same period in the previous year.

“The new criteria are that businesses can demonstrate an actual drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent because of COVID-19, over any 14-day period in the previous six months, compared with the same 14-day period a year ago.

“If the applicant was not in business a year ago, the 14-day period can be compared with the same or similar period in the previous month. Businesses must also declare that the drop in revenue is due to COVID-19, and have records to support this.

“I’m particularly pleased that micro businesses, with between one and five staff, have made good use of the scheme. Around 82 per cent of loans are to firms with one to five employees. Around 92 percent of loans are to firms with 10 or fewer staff.

“The firms are diverse. Most loans have gone to SMEs in construction and building (17%), accommodation, restaurants and cafes (12%), those offering professional, scientific or technical services (10%), retail trade (9%), and manufacturing (7%).

“The decision to extend the interest-free loan scheme is designed to give confidence to our smallest businesses and keep up the momentum of recovery. The Government is continuing to back the business community,” Stuart Nash said.

The measures proposed in the Bill involve changes to income tax, tax administration, primary industries, consumer protection and crown owned entity regulatory requirement measures. This Inland Revenue commentary provides further information on the tax policy proposals in the Bill. Loss carry-backs This Bill introduces a tax loss carry-back measure. This would allow businesses that anticipate being in loss in either the 2019–20 or 2020–21 tax year to carry some or all of that loss back to the preceding year where profits were earned. Loss carry-forwards and carry-backs are intended to prevent systematic over taxation over time. If taxpayers always pay tax when they earn income, but never get relief when they have a loss, they will pay more than the statutory rate of tax over time. Loss carry-backs are one way to address this. The Government has also announced policy changes relating to the loss carry-forward rules, but these are not part of this Bill. The proposed measure in the Bill is intended as a temporary measure to provide fast cash flow relief for businesses in loss during the period affected by COVID-19. The proposed measure would enable tax refunds for a profit year to be paid before the loss year has finished by enabling taxpayers to estimate the loss for the year and transfer it back to the profit year. The proposed measure provides for a one-year carry-back. The Government has indicated its intention to develop a permanent loss carry-back mechanism to apply from the 2021–22 tax year. The longer-term regime may be more traditional, such as not allowing a refund before the loss has been established and may have more integrity measures to cover some technical risks. The longer-term regime may provide for a one-year or two-year loss carry- back. Almost all types of taxpayers – companies, trusts and individuals – would be eligible to carry back losses. Administrative flexibility for Inland Revenue The Bill also introduces a proposed new power to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the flexibility to quickly provide an extension to due dates, timeframes or modify other procedural requirements for taxpayers who are impacted by COVID-19. The proposed power could be applied for any due date, timeframe, time period, procedural or administrative requirement across tax or social policy obligations set out in the Revenue Acts and the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. This power would be limited to an 18-month period which could be extended by Order in Council and to initiatives which are taxpayer friendly. 8 Tax treatment of payments to New Zealanders stranded overseas The Ministry of Social Development has established the New Zealanders Stranded Overseas welfare programme for beneficiaries and superannuitants stranded overseas as a result of COVID-19. The Bill proposes a measure ensuring that benefit and pension equivalent payments paid through this programme to people stranded overseas because of COVID-19 continue to have the same tax treatment as their pensions or benefits would be in New Zealand. 9 Loss carry-backs 11 LOSS CARRY-BACKS (Clauses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19) Summary of proposed amendment This Bill introduces a temporary tax loss carry-back measure that would allow businesses that are or anticipate being in loss, to carry-back some or all of that loss to the immediately preceding income year. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 15 April 2020. Key features The Bill proposes a temporary measure that would apply for losses incurred in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years. It would allow for refunds of previously paid tax before the loss year is finished. Taxpayers would generally access this provision by changing their estimated provisional tax. The deadline for re-estimating provisional tax would be extended from the final instalment date until the date the tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier. Taxpayers would be able to choose whether to use this facility. Almost all types of taxpayers – companies, trusts and individuals – would be eligible to carry back losses. The majority of individuals who are taxed through the PAYE system do not have losses so would be unaffected by this measure but those that operate businesses through partnerships, limited partnerships, and look-through companies would be able to benefit. Standard late payment use of money interest would apply if the loss carry-back is overestimated. Ownership continuity, grouping, and imputation rules would also apply. Background Businesses in New Zealand pay tax on their income when they are profitable while losses are deductible. Under existing tax loss continuity rules, these losses can be carried forward to reduce taxable income in future years. Loss carry-forwards and carry-backs are intended to prevent systematic over-taxation over time. If taxpayers always pay tax when they earn income, but never get relief when they have a loss, they will pay more than the statutory rate of tax over time. Loss carry-backs are one way to address this. The Government has also announced policy changes relating to the loss carry-forward rules, but these are not part of this Bill. The economic impacts of COVID-19 have made it more likely that taxpayers will be in loss in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years. Carrying a loss forward postpones the benefit of being able to claim losses and means that a taxpayer would still incur a tax liability for previous profitable years. The proposed loss carry-back measure in the Bill is intended to provide fast cash flow relief for businesses in loss during the period affected by COVID-19. 12 The measure would enable tax refunds to be paid before the loss year has finished and before an income tax return has been filed for the loss year. The proposed measure is intended to be temporary. The Government has indicated its intention to develop a permanent loss carry-back mechanism to apply from the 2021–22 tax year, which would replace the proposed temporary measure in this Bill. Detailed analysis Establishing the proposed loss carry-back involves amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The main features of the proposal are set out in clause 9 of the Bill that introduces a new section IZ 8 to the Income Tax Act 2007. This proposed section introduces the concept of the offset years – the pair of years affected by the carry-back. The first of these years is named the taxable income year and the second is named the net loss year. To be eligible to use proposed section IZ 8, a taxpayer must have made, or estimate that they will make, a loss in 2019–20 or 2020–21 – the net loss year. It must also have had taxable income in the previous year – the taxable income year. Losses would only be carried back for one year. This would mean: • losses from the 2019–20 year could be carried back to the 2018–19 year; and • losses from the 2020–21 year could be carried back to the 2019–20 year. Example 1 Armstrong Architects Limited (Armstrong) is a well-known architectural firm based in Christchurch and is known for its innovative designs and earthquake resistant buildings. It has been having a boom in business for the last two years but because most of its current projects are under construction its work has dropped off because of the Level 4 COVID-19 restrictions preventing work on the projects. In the 2019–20 income year it is predicting it will have taxable income of $5.6 million but because it has a number of high fixed costs to cover during the COVID-19 period and has no future projects in the pipeline it anticipates that for the 2020–21 income year it will make a loss of $3.2 million. Armstrong elects to carry back that anticipated loss to the 2019–20 income year. Armstrong has already paid $1.2 million in provisional tax over the first two provisional tax instalment dates for the 2019–20 income year and was due to pay another $368,000 on 7 May 2020. Armstrong re-estimates its provisional tax for the year to take account of the carry-back loss which will mean its taxable income will only be $2.4 million ($5.6 million − $3.2 million) with the tax liability on that being $672,000 ($2.4 million × 28%). The refund Armstrong will receive is $528,000 ($1,200,000 − $672,000) which will give it funds to meet its ongoing costs. There are ownership continuity requirements that match those that apply to loss carry- forward provisions. These mean if a company has had an ownership change of more than 49% since the beginning of the profit year, the loss carry-back would not be available, except on a part year basis. This is to prevent the use of losses to eliminate tax on income that was not connected with the loss-making business when it was earned. 13 Example 2 Buzz Autos Limited (Buzz) is a car dealership specialising in American muscle cars from the 1960s. Being in a very specialised market Buzz relies on steady custom from month-to-month. With the Level 4 lockdown Buzz is struggling to stay afloat. For the 2019–20 income year Buzz estimates that it will have taxable income of $268,000 on which it has already paid $75,040 in tax. Buzz has a standard 31 March balance date. Collins Cars Limited (Collins) is a car dealership that specialises in American muscle cars from the 1970s. It has been having a great 2019–20 year and its business model has lower fixed costs than Buzz so it has significant cash reserves. The owner of Collins knows Buzz very well and offers to assist it get through the COVID-19 situation by purchasing 52% of Buzz, which they do on 1 May 2020. Because of the lack of ability to trade, Buzz is anticipating that for the 2020–21 year they will have a tax loss of $341,000. However, because Buzz has not met the 49% continuity rule it will not be able to carry back that loss to the 2019–20 year. It will, however, be able to carry that portion of the loss arising after 30 April forward to the 2021–22 income year. The part year continuity rules will allow Buzz to carry back a portion of the 2020–21 loss for the year (from 1 April 2020 to 30 April 2020), which Buzz estimates as $160,000. Buzz will need to meet the requirements to use a part year loss such as preparing part year accounts to the date of the breach in continuity. The amount that could be carried back would be the smallest of: • the estimated loss (in 2019–20 or 2020–21), before adjusting for the carry-back • the taxable income in the previous year, again before adjusting for the carry-back; or • an amount determined by the taxpayer. Example 3 Tranquillity Limited (Tranquillity) is an online media site that publishes daily news articles and lifestyle stories with a focus on holistic lifestyles. It proved to be very popular for the year ended 31 March 2019 and made a taxable profit of $140,000. However, Tranquillity has suffered a number of setbacks in the 2020 income year, both as a result of COVID-19 and also because of unrelated pressures facing the media industry. For the year ended 31 March 2020 Tranquillity is estimating a tax loss of $180,000. As the limit of the loss carry-back is the lesser of the loss made in the 2020 year and the profit in the 2019 year, Tranquillity Ltd is only able to carry back $140,000 of the loss. The $40,000 excess loss balance can be carried forward to the 2021 year to offset against future profits of the company. If the company is within a wholly owned group of companies, the amount that could be carried back is only the amount that cannot be offset against profits within its wholly owned group in the loss year. 14 Example 4 Apollo Supplies Group (ASG) is a 100% wholly owned group that manufactures and supplies hospitality and kitchen equipment to a range of commercial operators in New Zealand. Some companies within the group focus on manufacturing while Apollo Distribution Limited (Apollo) is responsible for sales within New Zealand. In the year ended 31 March 2019, Apollo made a taxable profit of $420,000. It grouped its profits with the losses of other members within the ASG which, overall, made a group taxable profit of $2.5 million. All companies within the ASG faced a downturn in revenue in the 2020 income year because of COVID- 19. Apollo has been the most significantly affected company within the group and, in the year ended 31 March 2020, Apollo made a tax loss of $120,000 largely because of making virtually no sales in the last quarter of the 2020 income year. Apollo wishes to carry back its loss to the 2019 income year and offset it against other companies in the ASG. Before Apollo carry back its loss to the 2019 year it must first make maximum use of the ability to group the loss in the 2020 year itself with its other 100% wholly owned companies in the ASG. Together, the other members of ASG (excluding Apollo) made a taxable profit for the year ended 31 March 2020 of $90,000. As a result, the tax loss available to carry back to the 2019 year is $30,000. Apollo can group the remaining $90,000 of the 2020 loss with the profit of other group companies or carry it forward. Apollo can carry back $30,000 of its 2020 tax loss and offset this against its 2019 year profit. If it did not have sufficient profit, it could group the loss against the profits of other companies in ASG in the 2019 income year. Taxpayers would be able to claim a refund for a loss carry-back by re-estimating provisional tax (where the 2019–20 is the taxable income year) or amending their tax return (where 2018–19 is the taxable income year). The Bill proposes that the deadline for re-estimating provisional tax would be extended from the final instalment date until the date the tax return is filed (or the due date if this is earlier). This would allow taxpayers to have time to consider the estimate of their tax loss for the net loss year. For example, if a company is in profit for 2019–20 and estimates it would be in loss in 2020–21, it could re-estimate its 2019–20 provisional tax by taking into account the estimated loss carry-back deduction. It could do this any time up to the earlier of: • the day the 2019–20 tax return is filed; or • the day the 2019–20 tax return is due. Provisional tax already paid could then be refunded. The proposed provision also extends to shareholder-employees of a company who may have paid provisional tax on the basis that they would receive a shareholder salary from the company which is not in fact paid because the company’s pre-salary income is offset by a loss carry-back. 15 Example 5 Dorothy and Mary own Hidden Figures Limited (HFL) a company that makes model spacecraft. They have had a pretty good year to 31 March 2020 overall but had a terrible month of March because their main customer base is overseas visitors. Given the current COVID-19 situation and the expected worldwide decline in travel Dorothy and Mary do not see the financial position of the business improving until they get their on-line sales up and running or the tourist market gets back to previous levels. They sit down and work out that even by cutting costs HFL will probably make a loss to 31 March 2021 of at least $120,000. In the 2019–20 income year HFL used the standard method to pay provisional tax. Its instalments for the year were $24,000 on both the 28th of August 2019 and 15 th of January 2020. Dorothy and Mary have calculated that, pre-COVID, they think HFL was likely to make taxable income of $267,000 with tax payable on that of $74,760 and they were planning to make a final instalment of provisional tax on 7 May 2020 of $26,760. They elect to carry back the anticipated loss from the 2020–21 income year to the 2019–20 income year. This will give them a revised taxable income of $147,000 ($267,000-$120,000) and tax liability of $41,160. At the third instalment they decide to estimate HFL’s tax liability at $41,160 via myIR. This means there is no payment required at the third instalment date and Inland Revenue will issue HFL a refund of $6,840 ($48,000 − $41,160). In October 2020 Dorothy and Mary realise that the business has been doing worse than expected and now anticipate the 2020–21 loss to be $170,000. When they are preparing HFL’s 2019–20 income tax return they reflect this increased loss in the return and when they file they receive an additional refund of $14,000. 1 However, when completing the 2020–21 tax return for HFL Dorothy and Mary calculate that the loss for the 2020–21 income year will only be $110,000 given the quick recovery of the tourist industry in the first quarter of calendar year 2021. They complete the 2020–21 return and then amend the 2019–20 return for HFL. The reduced loss will mean that HFL has taxable income of $157,000 ($267,000 − $110,000) and a tax liability of $43,960 in 2019–20. It has only paid tax of $27,160 so will have tax payable of $16,800 (that is, $5,600 at each instalment date). It will need to pay use-of-money interest on this amount over the three provisional tax instalment dates. If the tax return for the profit year has already been filed, the taxpayer would be able to request a reassessment and refund because of the loss carry-back. Example 6 Eagle Beach Kayaking Ltd (Eagle) operates kayaking tours in Abel Tasman National Park and makes the majority of its income for the year in the summer months. The company experienced a significant reduction in bookings and a number of cancellations from early December 2019 as a result of COVID-19 which has resulted in it making a loss for the year ended 31 March 2020 of $70,000. In the prior year the company made a taxable profit of $95,000 and paid tax of $26,600. Eagle filed its 2018–19 tax return in December 2019. Eagle is eligible for the loss carry-back scheme and is entitled to carry its 2020 loss back to the 2019 year. To do so Eagle will need to amend its tax return for the year ended 31 March 2019 to receive a refund of the overpaid tax in 2019. Eagle amends its 2019 tax return via myIR and receives a refund of $19,600 (($95,000 − $70,000) × 28% less tax paid of $26,600). Alternatively, Eagle could request the Commissioner accept a section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 adjustment in writing, requesting the amendment of its 2019 tax return. At the time it amended its return Eagle filed an interim imputation credit account (ICA) account which shows a balance in its ICA of $20,500 on the date of the refund and after the refund will have a credit balance of $900. However, if Eagle only had a balance in its ICA of $15,000, The amount of the refund will be restricted to $15,000. This will mean that Eagle will have $4,600 held in its income tax account to use towards other tax debts or future tax payments. 1 Calculated as ($267,000 − $170,000) × 28% = $27,160 − $41,160 = $14,000. 16 Almost all types of taxpayers would be eligible to carry back losses (companies, trusts, and individuals). The majority of individuals who are taxed through the PAYE system and are subject to auto-calculation (qualifying individuals) do not have losses so would be unaffected by this measure, but those that operate businesses through partnerships, limited partnerships, and look-through companies would be able to benefit. Taxpayers who have ringfenced rental losses would also not be able to carry back losses. Example 7 For the year ended 31 March 2019 Michael paid tax of $21,940 on $94,000 of income, all of which related to wages and interest income he earned during the year. Michael was therefore a “qualifying individual” in the 2019 income year. In the year ended 31 March 2020 Michael entered into a partnership with Gus, running a small accounting advisory firm – Michael And Gus Accounting (MAGA). Michael and Gus’s partnership made an $80,000 loss in the 2020 income year as it was still a new business with a small number of clients and it was challenging establishing itself post-COVID-19. Each partner was allocated $40,000 of the partnership’s loss to include in their 2020 tax return. After including his other income, Michael has a net loss of $25,000 for 2020. The loss carry-back scheme does not apply to individuals who are qualifying individuals in the loss year. As Michael was not a qualifying individual in the loss year (the 2020 income year), Michael is eligible to carry his $25,000 loss back to the 2019 income year. This will now make his taxable income $69,000, with tax thereon of $13,720, Michael will receive a refund of $8,220 ($21,940 − $13,720) after amending his return through myIR. Michael would not be eligible if he only received reportable income such as salary, wages and dividends in the 2020 loss year as it would be impossible for him to have a loss. Example 8 Katherine owns a number of residential rental properties. In the year ended 31 March 2020 she paid $22,400 of tax on her net rental income of $80,000. In the year ended 31 March 2021 Katherine reduced the rent she was charging her tenants as, because of COVID-19, the majority could not continue to afford to pay the same rent. Overall, Katherine only received $40,000 of rental income from tenants in the 2021 income year, however, her rental expenses largely remained the same and her total rental deductions for 2021 were $60,000. As a result, her rental properties made a loss of $20,000. Katherine wants to carry her $20,000 loss back to the 2020 income year under the new loss carry-back provision and cash out the loss she has made this year. Under the ring-fencing of residential property rules, the amount of Katherine’s rental deductions allowed is capped at the amount of rental income received (that is, $40,000) and her excess deductions will be carried forward to the 2022 income year. Katherine cannot carry her excess rental deductions back. Multi-rate PIEs (most unit trusts and KiwiSaver funds) may not carry back losses. Multi-rate PIEs (including KiwiSaver) have tax cash-out for losses so already benefit from immediate tax relief for losses. Standard features from the tax system would apply and are therefore not specified within the Bill. These include: • To obtain a refund of income tax, a company must have an imputation credit account credit balance of at least the amount of the refund at the end of the most recently ended tax year, or alternatively it can complete an interim imputation return up to the date of the refund request. 17 • If the loss carry-back is overestimated, resulting in tax to be paid later, standard use of money interest would apply in the normal way. • The loss carry-back must ultimately be supported by a net loss shown on a tax return filed for the loss year. • If the tax return for the loss year is not filed, the loss carry-back deduction could be disallowed. • If a loss company is a member of a group of companies, its loss can be carried back to the profit year and offset against the income of those other group companies. This requires that all of the companies in the group are 66% or more commonly owned from the beginning of the year of profit to the end of the year of loss, with provision made for part periods. • As proposed by clause 12, the Bill would amend section RM 10(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so if the taxpayer owes a debt on other tax types, Inland Revenue would not apply any of the refund arising from the loss carry-back to satisfy tax debts. • As proposed by clause 19, the Bill proposes that where use of money interest applies because of an overestimate of the loss carry-back, the taxpayer cannot use the remission of interest provisions in section 183ABAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Bill also inserts a proposed anti-avoidance provision in clause 5. This would apply where a share in a company has been subject to an arrangement which allows a loss company to meet the requirements of the new section IZ 8 and the purpose of that arrangement is to defeat the intent of section IZ 8. Any arrangement subject to this provision would not be treated as meeting the requirements of section IZ 8. Clause 6 of the Bill also proposes that section GB 4(1)(b) and GB 4(2) which deal with arrangements for grouping tax losses for companies would also apply to section IZ 8. 19 Administrative flexibility 21 COMMISSIONER DISCRETION TO MODIFY DUE DATES, TIMEFRAMES OR PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS (Clauses 15 and 16) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new sections 6H and 6I of the Tax Administration Act introduce a temporary discretionary power the Commissioner may use to provide flexibility for due dates, deadlines, time periods, timeframes or procedural and administrative requirements for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 making compliance with current tax obligations impossible, impractical, or unreasonable. The proposed discretionary power is intended to provide the Commissioner with a more timely mechanism to assist taxpayers who encounter practical difficulties in complying with certain requirements under the Inland Revenue Acts, or under provisions in the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. The proposed power is therefore intended to supplement existing provisions already available to taxpayers affected by COVID-19. Where taxpayers comply with a modified timeframe or requirement made under this proposed power, they would be treated as if they complied with the requirement set in legislation. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from enactment and may be exercised for obligations which arose from 17 March 2020. The discretion would only apply until 30 September 2021 for dates and variations within that timeframe. The discretion could be further extended by Order in Council. Key features The proposal provides the Commissioner with a temporary power to vary due dates, deadlines, time periods, timeframes and administrative or procedural requirements for taxpayers who are adversely affected by COVID-19. Specifically, it would allow the Commissioner to: • extend a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe in relation to a requirement; and • modify a procedural or administrative requirement that must be met under a provision, for example, modifying the nature or form of information that is required to meet the provision. If a taxpayer complies with an alternative set out in a variation they would be treated as if they complied with the requirements set out in legislation. Variations must be made within and relate to the approximately 18-month period of 17 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. This limit would recognise that this is a discretionary power conveyed on the Commissioner for the purpose of assisting taxpayers with certain the COVID-19 compliance issues. 22 Background The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is charged with the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. As part of that administration, the Commissioner must use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. There is existing flexibility for the Commissioner to accommodate taxpayers affected by COVID-19. These include the ability for the Commissioner to remit late filing penalties or use of money interest when a taxpayer files or pays late and is affected by COVID-19, to change some dates by Order in Council or the Commissioner’s care and management power. Given the process and time required for an Order in Council, and the concern that existing provisions may be unable to resolve particular difficulties, providing a time-limited discretion to allow the Commissioner to extend due dates and timeframes or to modify other procedural requirements would be a more efficient way to respond quickly and provide relief to those affected by COVID-19. Therefore, the proposed mechanism would be more flexible and timely, and would be used where the Commissioner considers an appropriate outcome is not possible or is difficult to achieve under a current provision. The proposed power is intended to cover situations where it may be unreasonable for taxpayers to comply with due dates, timeframes or procedural requirements set out in tax legislation because of the impacts of COVID-19. A taxpayer would not need to apply a variation, they could continue to comply with tax laws as enacted. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments would provide the Commissioner with the ability to, at her discretion: • extend a due date, deadline, time period, or timeframe by, within or in relation to which: – a person must comply with a requirement set out in the provision – a person must make an election under the provision; and – a person’s entitlements, rights or obligations are affected. • modify procedural or administrative requirements. Due dates and timeframes could relate to payment, filing, disclosure or other time-based requirements, while procedural or administrative requirements are intended to cover where some information or other requirement may be able to be completed using an alternative method or means, for example, modifying the nature or form of information or action required. Subsection 6H(1) clarifies that the proposed discretion could be exercised for any provision in the Inland Revenue Acts listed in Schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Subsection 6H(5) would extend the definition of the Inland Revenue Acts for this purpose to include the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. 23 When the Commissioner would exercise the discretion (supplementary nature) Section 6H sets out the purpose of the proposed discretion, including how it would be used within the framework of existing provisions which provide relief or flexibility. The Commissioner would exercise the proposed power at her discretion, consistent with her obligations to maintain the integrity of the tax system. The proposed provision is intended to ensure the Commissioner could exercise sufficient flexibility across tax types and compliance requirements to account for practical compliance concerns arising from COVID-19. However, discretion under the proposed new power is intended to be used where the Commissioner considers an appropriate outcome is either not possible or may be difficult to achieve under the terms of the existing provisions. Existing provisions include recently introduced rules around the remission of use of money interest. This is reflected in 6H(3). Temporary application over an 18-month period Subsection 6H(4) proposes that the Commissioner could exercise the discretion under this provision for a period of approximately 18 months, and that this applies for dates, timeframes or requirements that may arise for a taxpayer over this 18 month period. Any variation made must be confined to obligations that occur within this period. The temporary nature of the proposed discretion recognises that this supplementary discretion power is only available to assist taxpayers with some of the impacts of COVID-19 and related measures. In addition, subsection 6H(4) proposes that this timeframe could be extended through an Order in Council on recommendation by the Minister of Revenue, if that is required to account for longer lasting effects of COVID-19. Applies to taxpayers affected by COVID-19 Subsection 6H(2) proposes that the Commissioner could exercise this discretion where compliance with current requirements is impossible, impractical or unreasonable, because of circumstances arising from COVID 19 or response measures to COVID-19, including by the Government. Applies generally for a class of taxpayers affected by COVID-19 Section 6I (3) proposes that a variation would apply generally unless the Commissioner specifies that it applies to a specific class of taxpayers or if specific circumstances or conditions are required. This would provide consistency across taxpayers in similar situations where they are affected by COVID-19 and allow Inland Revenue to automatically apply an extension for a group of affected taxpayers, as variations would only be advantageous to taxpayers. Taxpayers may choose whether or not to comply with variation or existing requirements The proposed variations are intended to either provide taxpayers with more time or modify a procedural or administrative requirement in a way that provides additional options or less onerous compliance requirements. 24 However, taxpayers may always choose to comply in the way set out in the legislation rather than in line with any published variation. Proposed subsection 6I(4) would achieve this optionality by providing that taxpayers who are covered by a variation may elect whether or not to use it by either informing the Commissioner or taking a tax position that reflects their choice. Subsection 6I(2) proposes that where taxpayers comply with a variation made under this power, they would be treated as if they complied with the requirement set in legislation. A variation does not change an underlying due date or requirement. However, if a variation is available to a taxpayer and they comply with it they would be treated, through subsection 6I(2) as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. If a taxpayer is still unable to comply with a variation or alternative requirements, they should contact Inland Revenue to discuss their circumstances. The Commissioner would publish details of a varied requirement Proposed subsection 6I(5) would require the Commissioner to publish any variation that she has made using this proposed discretion. This is intended to provide information in a central place, such as the Inland Revenue website, to communicate the COVID-19 variations to any affected taxpayers. Publishing this information would provide transparency and help promote consistency for treatment of taxpayers in similar positions. Amendment to confirm the exercise of this discretion is not a disputable decision Proposed amendments to the definition of disputable decision in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that the decision to issue, or to decline to issue, a variation under section 6I would not be a disputable decision. 25 Ministerial welfare programme 27 COVID-19 NEW ZEALANDERS STRANDED OVERSEAS SUPPORT MINISTERIAL WELFARE PROGRAMME (Clauses 4, 10, 13, 17 and 21–25) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that payments made under the COVID-19 New Zealanders Stranded Overseas Support (NZSOS) Ministerial welfare programme in lieu of another payment normally payable under the Social Security Act 2018, New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001, or Veteran’s Support Act 2014 are subject to the same tax treatment as those payments. Proposed amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 would also ensure that when such payments are made and the person is a receiving carer for child support the usual child support rules would apply. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 20 April 2020. Key features The proposals would amend the definitions of income-tested benefit, New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pension in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to include the equivalent payments made under the COVID-19 NZSOS programme, by introducing new defined terms “main benefit equivalent assistance”, “New Zealand superannuation equivalent assistance”, “veteran’s pension equivalent assistance”, and “COVID-19 New Zealanders Stranded Overseas Support Programme”. These proposals would ensure that: • individuals in receipt of these COVID-19 NZSOS payments are subject to the same income tax rules as if they had received their income-tested benefit, New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension directly • the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) is required to deduct and pay the relevant PAYE to Inland Revenue as is currently required with income-tested benefits, New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pension • an individual’s entitlement to Working for Families tax credits is not impacted and MSD can continue to pay the family tax credit and Best Start credit to COVID-19 NZSOS recipients who would otherwise be eligible; and • student loan repayment obligations remain the same. Other payments made under the COVID-19 NZSOS programme are made in lieu of payments and benefits that are exempt from tax. These will remain exempt from tax under section CW 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 28 While orphan’s benefit and unsupported child’s benefit remain exempt from income tax, the proposals would add definitions of these terms to section YA 1 to ensure that their equivalent COVID-19 NZSOS payments are appropriately considered for Working for Families purposes. The proposed amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 would ensure that: • child support payments made to receiving carers who receive NZSOS payments equivalent to the sole parent rate of benefit or the unsupported child’s benefit, would continue to be retained to offset the cost of that benefit to the Crown; and • the correct living allowance is applied to those receiving the equivalent of a supported living payment. Background On 17 April 2020, the Minister for Social Development made a Ministerial welfare programme under section 101 of the Social Security Act 2018 for beneficiaries and superannuitants stranded overseas as a result of COVID-19 (COVID-19 NZSOS programme). 2 Payments under the COVID-19 NZSOS programme began on 20 April 2020. The COVID-19 NZSOS programme allows the Ministry of Social Development to make payments to individuals who cannot otherwise receive their standard payment because they are stranded overseas as a consequence of COVID-19. These payments are equivalent to what the individual would otherwise receive had they been able to return to New Zealand and the intention is that there should be no difference for the recipient in terms of the tax treatment and associated obligations. The COVID-19 NZSOS programme covers the following payments: • main benefits payable under the Social Security Act 2018; • orphan’s benefit and unsupported child’s benefit payable under the Social Security Act 2018 • New Zealand superannuation payable under the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 • veteran’s pension payable under the Veteran’s Support Act 2014; and • supplementary assistance. 3 2 The Ministerial welfare programme is available at https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our- work/about-msd/legislation/notice-of-change/2020/new-zealanders-s tranded-overseas-programme.pdf 3 Defined in clause 2 of the COVID-19 NZSOS programme as: (a) Accommodation Supplement; (b) Child Disability Allowance; (c) Disability Allowance; (d) Orphan’s Benefit; (e) Special Benefit; (f) Special Disability Allowance; (g) Temporary Additional Support; (h) Unsupported Child’s Benefit; (i) Winter Energy Payment; and Temporary Accommodation Assistance, Transitional Assistance Payment and Transitional Subsidy paid under the Ministerial Welfare Programme of those names 29 Under section CF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, income-tested benefits (defined term that covers the same payments as the term main benefit), New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pension are currently subject to income tax. All other monetary benefits payable under the Social Security Act 2018 (excluding income-tested benefits) are exempt from income tax under section CW 33. Detailed analysis The intent of the proposals is to ensure that an individual in receipt of a COVID-19 NZSOS payment is subject to the same tax treatment, Working for Families entitlements, and student loan and child support obligations that apply for their normal benefit, pension or supplementary assistance payment. Changes to definitions The Bill proposes to add several new defined terms to section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and would amend existing definitions to achieve this. The proposed new defined term “COVID-19 New Zealanders Stranded Overseas Support Programme” in section YA 1 is a reference to the COVID-19 NZSOS programme made under section 101 of the Social Security Act 2018 and forms the basis of the proposed new defined terms: • main benefit equivalent assistance • New Zealand superannuation equivalent assistance • veteran’s pension equivalent assistance • orphan’s benefit equivalent assistance; and • unsupported child’s benefit equivalent assistance. These proposed new definitions refer to the specific clauses in the COVID-19 NZSOS programme under which the relevant equivalent payments are made: • payments equivalent to veteran’s pension and New Zealand superannuation are provided for in clause 10 of the programme • payments equivalent main benefits/income-tested benefits are in clause 11; and • payments equivalent to supplementary assistance (including orphan’s benefit and unsupported child’s benefit) are in clause 12. As some individuals may have already lost their entitlement to their benefit or pension prior to 20 April 2020, clause 9 of the COVID-19 NZSOS programme enables MSD to make a lump-sum payment to the individual for this period. The proposed new equivalent assistance definitions therefore refer to both clause 9 and either clause 10, 11 or 12. The Bill proposes to amend the definition of income-tested benefit to include main benefit equivalent assistance, the definition of New Zealand superannuation to include New Zealand superannuation equivalent assistance, and the definition of veteran’s pension. 30 Orphan’s benefit and unsupported child’s benefit are currently undefined terms but appear in section MD 6, the definition of dependent child in section YA 1 and in section 80KK of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Bill proposes to remove these in-text section references and insert new definitions of orphan’s benefit and unsupported child’s benefit, which would include orphan’s benefit equivalent assistance and unsupported child’s benefit assistance, respectively. An amendment to the definition of financially independent in section YA 1 is proposed to ensure all payments made under the COVID-19 NZSOS programme are covered. Impact of definitional changes and other changes One result of these proposed definitional changes would be that main benefit equivalent assistance, New Zealand superannuation equivalent assistance, and veteran’s pension equivalent assistance are taxed as income under section CF 1(1) and are subject to the PAYE rules under section RD 5(6). This means that when MSD makes a COVID-19 NZSOS payment that is paid instead of an income-tested benefit, New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension, they are required to account for PAYE on the payment as they normally would with a pension or benefit. Monetary benefits payable under the Social Security Act 2018 are exempt income under section CW 33(1), including amounts payable under a section 101 Ministerial welfare programme. There is an existing exclusion for income-tested benefits, which would include the proposed new main benefit equivalent assistance. The Bill proposes two additional exclusions to cover New Zealand superannuation equivalent assistance and veteran’s pension assistance. This would ensure that these payments would be taxable under section CF 1. This would mean that for an individual normally in receipt of a benefit or pension, there would be no difference in treatment when they receive a COVID-19 NZSOS payment instead. For the purposes of the Working for Families rules, the term “social assistance payment” is defined in section MA 8 as meaning income-tested benefits, New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pension. Through the proposed amendments to these three definitions, an individual in receipt of the equivalent payments under the COVID-19 NZSOS programme would be entitled to the same Working for Families tax credits as if they had received their normal benefit or pension instead. As the definitions used in the Income Tax Act 2007 flow through into the Tax Administration Act 1994, MSD would be able to continue paying the Best Start and family tax credits to eligible individuals. As the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 also uses the definitions from the Income Tax Act 2007, the amendments would ensure there is no difference in student loan obligations. The proposed changes to the Child Support Act 1991 would ensure that when MSD makes a COVID-19 NZSOS payment that is paid to a sole parent beneficiary or recipient of an unsupported child’s benefit, the child support rules apply as they would normally. Specifically, the proposed amendments would ensure that: 31 • Child support payments made to receiving carers who receive NZSOS payments equivalent to the sole parent rate of benefit or the unsupported child’s benefit, would continue to be retained to offset the cost of that benefit to the Crown. • Recipients of NZSOS payments that are equivalent to a supported living payment would continue to receive the higher rate of living allowance. • Recipient of NZSOS payments equivalent to a unsupported child’s benefit would still be required to apply for child support only for the child(ren) for whom they receive the unsupported child’s benefit, unless they receive any other social security benefit. • Recipients of NZSOS payments equivalent to benefits paid at sole parent rate or unsupported child’s benefit would not be able withdraw from child support. • Child support payments for child(ren) for whom an unsupported child’s benefit is paid would continue to be distributed separately to child support payments made for any other children for whom the carer receives a social security benefit.

A further provision enables information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development for the purposes of the administration of a loan scheme. 8 SMALL BUSINESS CASHFLOW SCHEME (Clause 5, 6, 19, 23) Summary of proposed amendment This Bill provides for a number of provisions to support a small business cashflow (loan) scheme (SBCS). It amends the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Such a scheme would be administered by Inland Revenue. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 15 April 2020. Key features The Bill provides for a number of amendments to support a SBCS: • the insertion of a new section 7AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into a loan contract with an applicant; • an amendment to schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to facilitate the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and the Ministry for Social Development for the purposes of administration of a SBCS; and • amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that any conversion of a portion of the loan to a grant will not have adverse income tax implications for the applicant. Background The Bill proposes a number of amendments to support a SBCS if introduced to assist small to medium businesses who are adversely affected by COVID-19. The SBCS would be administered by Inland Revenue and the Bill provides a number of amendments to support the administration of a SBCS. Detailed analysis Clause 19 of the Bill amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to enter into a loan agreement with an applicant under a SBCS. It provides for the Commissioner to be able to receive information from the applicant for the loan and the repayment of the loan where the applicant does not meet any criteria for a SBCS. It also provides for a loan contract issued by the Commissioner not to be a credit contract or a consumer contract for the purposes of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. 9 The Bill also provides for schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to be amended to provide for the facilitation of the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development for the purpose of administering a SBCS. It provides for the exchange of information for the wage subsidy scheme. The Commissioner will be able to use this information in connection with any of the Commissioner’s duties, powers or functions under the Inland Revenue Acts. Two amendments are also made to the Income Tax Act 2007 in clauses 5 and 6. Section DF1(1)(cb) will be added to ensure that business expenditure that is paid by the loan continues to be tax deductible if any part of the loan is converted to a government grant. The second amendment ensures that if conversion to a grant occurs this does not trigger debt forgiveness income under the financial arrangement rules. Section EW 45 is amended to include any release from an obligation to repay a SBCS loan through conversion to a grant. This will ensure the base price adjustment does not result in taxable income to the recipient.
Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill Commentary on proposed amendments to: – the administration of unclaimed money – the individual income tax write-off threshold Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue First published in June 2020 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140.

The proposed changes: • introduce administrative reforms to the unclaimed money regime; and • temporarily increase the individual income tax write-off threshold from $50 to $200. The proposed changes would amend the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Unclaimed money Unclaimed money usually refers to money (such as a bank deposit) which has become disconnected or detached from its owner. Unclaimed money is passed on from the holder (such as a bank) to Inland Revenue as the custodian of those funds until they can be claimed. Inland Revenue is the agency that administers the rules for unclaimed money. However, the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act) which governs unclaimed money has not been reviewed since it was enacted in 1971. As a result, many of the administrative processes in the Act are outdated and do not take advantage of new developments in technology. Currently, the regime is largely administered as a stand-alone product using a paper-based process, making the system difficult for people to use to claim their funds. The proposals seek to modernise and update the Act to take advantage of new administrative practices. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for holders and owners of unclaimed money as well as reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue. Overall, it is hoped that the proposed initiatives will result in owners being reunited with their money more efficiently. Individual income tax write-off threshold The proposed change would temporarily increase the individual income tax write-off threshold for automatically calculated assessments from $50 to $200. This is designed to assist taxpayers as part of the Government’s response to COVID-19. 9 Unclaimed money 11 ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS TO THE UNCLAIMED MONEY ACT 1971 (Clauses 67, 83B and 100B–100L) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments substantially update the administration of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 (the Act). The intention of the proposed reforms is to make the administration of unclaimed money more efficient by lowering compliance costs for holders of unclaimed money and making it easier for owners of unclaimed money to claim their money. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The Bill proposes reforms to update the administration of unclaimed money. It would define the Act as an Inland Revenue Act and allow Inland Revenue to use existing tax data to more efficiently locate and validate owners of money. However, the Act would not be brought within the disputes, penalties or interest provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposals would also clarify that the Act does not apply to unclaimed money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. The Bill would widen the definition of unclaimed money to include deposit-like investments in portfolio investment entities. The Bill would also expand the activity which prevents an amount of money from becoming unclaimed money to include online activity. The Bill proposes that the length of time which is required to pass before money is treated as unclaimed is reduced from the current 6 or 25 years (depending on the product category) to a uniform five years for all money. It is also proposed that holders of unclaimed money be permitted to transfer money to Inland Revenue before it is deemed unclaimed money in limited circumstances. The proposals would also allow holders of unclaimed money (such as a bank) to transfer it to Inland Revenue immediately upon it being deemed to be unclaimed, provided that the holder had already made reasonable efforts to contact the owner. If the holder had not sought to contact the owner, the holder would have three months to contact the owner and return the money before being required to transfer the funds to Inland Revenue. The current requirement for owners to provide occupation information when funds are transferred would be removed. Instead, holders would be required to provide Inland Revenue with other identifying information (such as IRD numbers) in electronic format which would assist Inland Revenue in locating the owners. The Bill would maintain the current unclaimed money threshold at $100, while allowing holders to transfer lesser amounts if the Commissioner agrees. The proposals would remove the requirement for holders to keep a physical register of unclaimed money, and to make this available for inspection by members of the public. 12 A 60-year time bar would be introduced on the ability of owners to claim their money, and it is proposed that holders are given a two-year transitional period to implement the proposals. Background The proposed amendments substantially update the administration of the Act. The intention of the reforms is to make the administration of unclaimed money more efficient by lowering compliance costs for holders of unclaimed money and making it easier for owners to claim it. The Act was last substantially revised in the 1970s and its administrative practices now impose a significant compliance burden. One example is the requirement that holders maintain a physical register of money which has accrued in the past year. In addition to keeping a physical register of unclaimed money, holders must make this register available for inspection by the public before transferring the money to Inland Revenue. These and other outmoded administrative practices present an opportunity to update the unclaimed money regime to take advantage of new technology. Detailed analysis Defining the Act as an Inland Revenue Act Although the Act is administered by Inland Revenue, it is not specifically listed as an Inland Revenue Act in schedule 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). This means that Inland Revenue is unable to use the information which it holds in its systems to match owners with their money. Proposed clause 83B would insert a reference to the Act in schedule 1 of the TAA so that it becomes an Inland Revenue Act. Clause 67 proposes that the definition of “tax law” in the TAA does not include a provision in the Unclaimed Money Act 1971, so that the Act is not brought within the disputes, penalties and use of money interest provisions of the TAA. Expanding the definition of unclaimed money Clause 100B inserts a new section 4 to the Act which proposes changes to the way in which unclaimed money is defined and clarifies when funds become unclaimed. Clause 100B proposes to replace the current definition of unclaimed money in section 4 of the Act which is largely focused on “money” (in the traditional sense of the word). The proposed new definition expands the scope of the section to include categories such as term deposit-like investments in portfolio investment entities (“cash-PIEs”). Account activity Currently, before a deposit can be considered to be unclaimed the owner must not have operated the account either by deposit, withdrawal or instruction in writing. This requirement does not include other modes of account interaction such as telephone and internet banking. 13 The proposed new section 4 is intended to broaden the forms of activity which will prevent an amount qualifying as unclaimed. Proposed section 4(2)(d) refers to providing instructions or requesting information. This will include internet banking, where a customer logs into their accounts online and obtains information about an account balance. Length of time until money has been deemed unclaimed The definition of unclaimed money currently includes money which has been deposited with a holder for a period of six or 25 years depending on the type of deposit. For example, money which has been deposited for a fixed term will be deemed unclaimed following the expiry of six years. Proposed section 4 removes the distinction between the categories of deposit in favour of a more generic reference to money repayable on demand or after a fixed term and introduces a standard “qualifying” period of five years. It is proposed that all money, whatever its deposit category, will become unclaimed after five years. Transfer of money to Inland Revenue before becoming unclaimed Historically there has been no ability for holders to pay unclaimed money to Inland Revenue before the expiry of the current holding periods. There are limited circumstances in which it is more expedient for holders of money to transfer it to Inland Revenue before it becomes unclaimed rather than waiting for the relevant deeming period to expire. The proposed amendments revise the definition of unclaimed money to allow money to be transferred to Inland Revenue before the expiry of the qualifying period where this is acceptable to the Commissioner. This mechanism is contained in proposed section 4(2)(c)(i) and (d)(ii). Monetary threshold Currently, the definition of unclaimed money prevents money which falls below the $100 threshold from being classified as unclaimed whether the holder wishes to pass these funds to Inland Revenue or not. The proposed amended definition of unclaimed money addresses this issue by providing, in section 4(2)(e), Inland Revenue with the ability to accept amounts below $100 where the Commissioner agrees to receive them. Information collection and transfer Proposed section 4(7) would require a holder of unclaimed money to provide the Commissioner with information in the holder’s possession or control which relates to the owner of the money and the amount. This would include information relating to the amount, the identity and whereabouts of the owner and the actions taken by the holder in attempting to locate the owner. Such information must be provided to the Commissioner either before or during the transfer to Inland Revenue. The proposed section 4(7) is not intended to impose new information collection costs or requirements on holders of unclaimed money . Instead, it is aimed at encouraging holders to provide Inland Revenue with information in their possession which may assist the Commissioner in locating the owner of the money. The format in which this information 14 must be transferred has been left unspecified and will be worked through directly with industry groups. The proposed amendments would clarify that the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 does not apply to money covered by the Public Finance Act 1989. Clause 100E proposes some consequential amendments to section 5 of the Act to reflect the new definition of unclaimed money and also clarifies that persons who hold funds in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989 are not holders for the purposes of the Act. Maintenance of a register Clause 100F would repeal sections 6 and 7 of the Act which currently require a holder to maintain a register of unclaimed money which has accrued over the current term and to make that register available for public inspection. There are a number of reasons why these requirements are no longer relevant including the electronic retention of records and privacy concerns. While holders will still maintain records to support unclaimed money, they will not have to maintain a publicly available register. Immediate transfer of money and associated information to the Commissioner Proposed clause 100G amends section 8 of the Act to allow unclaimed money to be transferred to Inland Revenue immediately upon being deemed unclaimed, if the holder has made reasonable efforts to contact the owner under section 4(6) before transferring it to the Commissioner. Currently holders can be required to retain unclaimed money for over 12 months after it has qualified as unclaimed. Many holders considered this time period was unnecessary once funds had become unclaimed. Where the holder has not made reasonable efforts to locate the owner before the amount becomes unclaimed, the holder has three months to rectify that before the amount must be transferred to Inland Revenue. The requirement to make reasonable efforts to locate owners of unclaimed money requires holders to use their initiative and take active steps to return money to its owner before transferring it to Inland Revenue. In practical terms, “reasonable efforts” means that holders of unclaimed money should, at minimum, exhaust the avenues for contacting the owners of the money which they have at their disposal (for example, telephone numbers and email address). Holders should consider whether there are any other means of contacting owners which may also be effective (such as social media). Proposed clause 100G also includes a transitional period for funds that previously had not met the definition of unclaimed money because the respective time period to become unclaimed money had not been reached but under the proposed time period would be unclaimed. Holders will be allowed a maximum of two years to transfer those amounts to Inland Revenue. 15 Example Really Big Bank Limited (RBB) has a large number of customer accounts, before the change to the time period for funds to become unclaimed, that vary in age from 5½ years through to 23 years and there has been no interaction with those accounts by the customer for some time despite attempts by RBB to locate those customers. The proposed change to the definition is enacted which now sets the time period for unclaimed money to five years and now means all those accounts immediately become unclaimed. RBB is allowed a maximum of two years to transition the funds which are now unclaimed money to Inland Revenue so they do not have to incur large compliance costs in immediately transferring those funds, although they can do so if they wish. Introduction of a time bar Clause 100J proposes to insert a new time bar for claiming money from Inland Revenue of 60 years. Currently, there is no time limit on an owner’s ability to claim money held by Inland Revenue. This means that, under the current rules a claimant could make a claim for money which accrued as long ago as the regime’s inception in 1908. However, as the time unclaimed money remains with Inland Revenue increases, the likelihood of it being claimed becomes increasingly remote. This suggests there is a point in time at which deemed unclaimed money becomes practically unclaimable. However, all amounts of unclaimed money are classified as a contingent liability in the Crown’s accounts. While placing some parameters around an owner’s ability to claim money is desirable from a policy perspective, it is equally important that owners not be deprived of the meaningful opportunity to claim money. The proposed amendments seek to balance these two aims by introducing a 60-year time bar on the ability of owners to claim money. This is contained within the proposed section 11(7) which provides that no person shall have a right of action against the Commissioner for unclaimed money which has been held for more than 60 years. 17 Individual income tax write-off threshold 18 INCREASING THE THRESHOLD FOR AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATED INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX WRITE-OFFS (Clause 84) Summary of proposed amendment As part of the Government’s response to the financial pressures on New Zealanders caused by COVID-19, the proposed amendment seeks to temporarily increase the write-off threshold from $50 to $200 for income tax assessments that are automatically calculated for qualifying individuals with reportable income. The proposed amendment is designed to reduce the financial pressure in the economic downturn for approximately 149,000 New Zealanders. Application date The proposed amendment to increase the threshold to $200 would apply for the 2019–20 income year only. The proposal to return the threshold to $50 would apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. The increase in the threshold to $200 under an Order in Council that came into force from 3 June 2020 will remain in place until the proposed changes to the legislation are enacted. Key features It is proposed to amend schedule 8, part B, clause 1 of the Tax Administration Act 2004 (TAA) to: • increase the amount of a tax assessment that may be written off by the Commissioner from $50 to $200 for the 2019–20 income year; and • decrease the amount of a tax assessment that may be written off by the Commissioner from $200 to $50 for the 2020–21 and later income years. Background Income tax obligations for individuals with only reportable income (income that has had tax withheld at source and is reported to Inland Revenue by the payers, for example, salary, wages and investment income) are automatically calculated by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers are advised of the resulting refund or tax liability. Tax liabilities of $50 and under are automatically written off under the current rules. Detailed analysis This write-off threshold applies if an individual is subject to the rules in subpart 3B of the TAA – commonly referred to as the auto-calculation rules. Under section 22J(1) of the TAA, the Commissioner may write off an amount of tax payable if the requirements of schedule 8, part B are met. 19 An increase to the write-off amount for automatically calculated income tax assessments was made by Order in Council and applies from 3 June 2020. The proposed amendment to the TAA limits the increase to the 2019–20 income year. As this threshold increase was only envisaged as a temporary measure to support people through economic hardship, the Bill proposes that the threshold is reduced back to $50 for the 2020–21 and later income years.

Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been progressively adjusted to increase simplicity and to encourage greater compliance. Child support will move to Inland Revenue’s new systems and processes in April 2021. This move will allow a greater degree of efficiency and simplicity, and also creates opportunities for legislative changes to further improve the administration of the child support scheme. The 2017 discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of social policy 1 contained proposals aimed at improving the way social policy entitlements and obligations, including child support, are administered by Inland Revenue. The focus of the discussion document was not on changing the fundamental policy settings, but rather improving the administration by taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s systems. The discussion document set out a number of problems with the child support scheme that require legislative change. The problems ranged from unfairness in the system, to the need to address situations where the person’s circumstances are unusual or complex. These problems can lead to dissatisfaction with the scheme and reduced compliance. Adding to this, the rules for penalties are overly punitive and complex, and act more as a disincentive, rather than an incentive, to pay. Following public feedback, the Government made decisions on the proposals and these have been incorporated into this Bill. Combined, these changes aim to improve the administration, reduce complexity, improve fairness and increase compliance with the scheme. The proposed changes cover four important aspects of the child support scheme: • simplifying the penalty rules; • introducing compulsory employer deductions; • limiting retrospective reassessments by introducing a time bar; and • amending the definition of “income”. The Bill also contains a number of technical amendments to assist the administration of the scheme, including to work better with customers with unusual circumstances. The proposals in the Bill apply to financial support – that is, both child support and domestic maintenance. 2 Throughout this commentary the term child support is used for readability purposes. All section references are to the Child Support Act 1991 unless otherwise stated. 1 Available at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-dd-mts-9-social-policy/overview 2 Domestic maintenance refers to payments made by a person to a former partner. Inland Revenue administers domestic maintenance under Court orders registered in the New Zealand Family Courts and voluntary agreements. 8 9 Policy proposals 11 CHANGE TO TIMING OF SECOND STAGE OF LATE PAYMENT PENALTY (Clause 42 (2 and 3)) Summary of proposed amendment Late payment penalties are imposed on a liable parent if they do not pay on time. Initial penalties are applied in two stages – immediately after the default and then a follow-up penalty eight days after the due date, if the amount is not paid. The proposal is to shift that second stage of the initial late payment penalty to 28 days after the due date, rather than the current eight days after the due date. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The second stage of the initial late payment penalty would be charged 28 days after the due date. The change to the timing of the second stage of the initial penalty would apply to amounts that become due on or after 1 April 2021. If the first stage of the initial penalty was charged before 1 April 2021, the second stage of the initial penalty would continue to be charged eight days after the due date. Background Currently, if a person does not pay their child support on time, penalties apply. An initial penalty of 2% is imposed the day after the due date and, if payment is not made, a further 8% initial penalty is applied eight days after the due date. Moving the imposition of the second stage of the initial penalty to 28 days after the due date would give Inland Revenue time to contact the customer and explain payment options (for example, a payment arrangement) and the consequences of not paying (for example, the imposition of the 8% penalty, bank deductions), with the aim of working with the person to get them back on track. 12 Example 1: Imposition of initial late payment penalties Simo is separated from his partner, Lara. They have one child, Ali, who lives with Lara. Simo’s child support payment is due 20 March 2021. He does not make the payment on time. Simo’s next payment is due 20 April 2021 (after the proposed amendment would take effect). Simo does not make this payment. The timeline in figure 1 shows how the second stage of the late payment would be applied for both payments. Figure 1 1/03/20211/06/2021 1/04/20211/05/2021 First payment (current rules) Second payment (new rules) 20/04/21 Due date 21/03/2021 Stage 1 LPP 20/03/21 Due date 18/05/2021 Stage 2 LPP 21/04/2021 Stage 1 LPP 28/03/2021 Stage 2 LPP 13 MINIMUM $5 PENALTY RULE REPEAL (Clause 42(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposal is to repeal the $5 minimum penalty rule. This would ensure that the 2% initial penalty imposed is in proportion to the unpaid obligation. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features Repeal the $5 minimum penalty rule. The penalty charged at the expiry of the due date would be 2% of the unpaid obligation. Background The initial penalty charged the day after the due date is currently the greater of: • 2% of the amount outstanding; or • $5. Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations. However, excessive penalties can discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. The current $5 minimum penalty means that some people are disproportionately penalised. This is demonstrated in the example 2. Example 2: $5 minimum penalty Karl was supposed to pay $200 child support on 20 June. However, he did not make the payment and so the initial penalty was charged on 21 June. The initial penalty charged is $5. 2% of $200 is $4, but the penalty imposed is $5, the current minimum penalty. This means that Karl pays more than 2% of the amount outstanding. Under the proposed amendment Karl’s penalty amount would be $4. 14 GRACE PERIOD (Clause 43) Summary of proposed amendment For people new or returning to the child support scheme, a grace period is proposed during which late payment penalties would not be charged. The proposed grace period would allow a liable person time to adjust to making child support payments. It would also allow Inland Revenue the opportunity to provide support to newly liable or returning persons. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features A grace period would be introduced under which late payment penalties would not be applied, for people new or returning to the child support scheme. This would apply to periods starting on or after 1 April 2021. The proposed grace period would start on the first due date and would apply for the following 60 days. The proposed grace period would apply: • when a person is first made liable for child support under the child support scheme; • at any time during a child support assessment when a person first becomes a liable parent after a period of being a receiving carer; or • if after a period of not having an ongoing child support assessment, a person re-joins the scheme and is made liable for payments. 15 Example 3: Application of the grace period Brian and Anna separate in April. They have a daughter, Brianna, who lives with Anna. Anna applies for child support. Brian receives his assessment and is required to pay $150 per month, with the first payment due on 20 June. His penalty grace period is set at 20 June – 18 August (a 60-day period from the first due date). Brian did not pay his monthly obligations due on 20 June, 20 July or 20 August. The proposed grace period would apply to the amounts due for June and July, and no penalties (neither initial nor incremental) would be charged on these amounts. The proposed grace period expires on 18 August. Penalties would be charged on the amount due on 20 August, and on any amounts that become overdue after that. Figure 2 1/06/20211/10/2021 1/07/20211/08/20211/09/2021 Monthly payments due Grace period (60 days from the due date) Penalties applied to amount due 20 August only 21/08/21 Stage 1 LPP 20/07/2120/08/21 17/09/21 Stage 2 LPP 20/06/21 The proposed grace period would begin from the date of assessment if the person is assessed as the liable parent but has no child support payable. A person may be assessed as the liable parent but no child support payable if they have shared care of their child and the formula determines neither parent needs to pay the other. The proposed grace period will not apply if: • a person is currently a receiving carer but is, for example, reassessed to pay an increased amount for a past period when they were a liable parent: or • a parent is already liable to pay child support and is made liable to pay child support for another child, either within, or outside of, the existing assessment. Late payment penalties would start being charged on a person’s child support obligations that become due after the expiry of the proposed grace period. If an amount is outstanding and was due to be paid during the proposed grace period, penalties would not be charged on this amount. The proposed grace period would provide an opportunity to work with the customer to help get them on track with their payments, but does not prevent Inland Revenue from taking enforcement action (such as deductions from bank accounts) if appropriate. Background Compliance with payment obligations in the first few months when a person enters the child support scheme is generally low. Currently, twenty six percent of payments in the first three months are paid on time. 16 Research conducted by Inland Revenue highlighted that when parents separate and the child support process is started, customers’ situations are often in flux and many felt unprepared to make payments immediately. Introducing a grace period would allow Inland Revenue to work with customers to help them get things right from the start and should result in better ongoing compliance. 17 COMPULSORY DEDUCTIONS FOR NEWLY LIABLE PARENTS (Clauses 40 and 41) Summary of proposed amendment A newly liable person would pay their child support by automatic deduction from source deduction payments made by their employer. There would be discretion to allow payments by another method, if source deduction is not appropriate for a person. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features It is proposed that employers would make child support deductions from the pay of a liable person. A person would be required to pay their child support by source deductions if: • they are first made liable for child support under the child support scheme on or after 1 April 2021; • at any time during the course of a child support assessment they become a liable parent after a period of being a receiving carer (as long as this is on or after 1 April 2021); or • if after a period of not having an ongoing child support assessment they re-join the scheme (after 1 April 2021) and are made liable for payments. People who were liable to pay child support before 1 April 2021 and who are compliant with their obligations may continue to choose to pay by another method. In some cases it may not be appropriate for the deduction to be made – for example, if the person has multiple employers or for privacy reasons. Therefore, Inland Revenue would have the discretion to determine that the compulsory deduction rules do not apply (and alternative arrangements would be made to collect child support). If the person subsequently defaults, compulsory deductions would then be applied. Background Currently, employers must make deductions of child support from salary or wages when a liable person is in debt or a customer chooses this payment option. Deductions are also compulsory for liable parents on a benefit. 3 Compulsory employer deductions of child support from source deduction payments (salary, wages and schedular payments) were proposed and then removed from the 2013 child support reforms – largely because at that time the monthly PAYE system meant they could not be effectively administered. 3 A benefit includes a Veteran’s Pension or New Zealand Super. 18 However, the recently implemented pay day reporting would allow compulsory deductions for a person newly liable for child support to be administered effectively. Compulsory deductions would assist liable parents first entering the scheme by helping them get their payments right from the start and avoid them going into debt. Currently, compliance for new liable parents in the first few months is very low – less than a third pay on time. The discretion to allow payment by another method would provide flexibility to consider other options for payment, when source deduction is not appropriate for a person. 19 TIME BAR FOR REASSESSING CHILD SUPPORT (Clauses 19, 20 and 34) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that reassessments of a child support year by Inland Revenue be restricted to four years from the end of a relevant child support year. This would be subject to legislative exceptions. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features Reassessments of child support would be restricted to a four-year period. The four-year period would start from the end of the relevant child support year. Beyond the four-year period, reassessments would not occur – that is, the year would be time barred, subject to specified exceptions. A time bar for reassessing child support would provide more certainty for parents and reduce administration costs, while balancing equity concerns through specified exceptions. Reassessments for a year could still occur after the end of the four-year period if one of the following exceptions apply: • information provided by a person in the child support assessment is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; • if types of income, for example, rental income, have not been included in a person’s child support assessment; • a person who is part of the child support assessment has died; • a person should never have been made liable – for example, a person is subsequently found not to be the parent of a child; • an amendment is required for the purpose of avoiding a double liability (for the same child at the same time) with an overseas jurisdiction; • Inland Revenue has not met the notification requirements; • a Court order is received that applies to an earlier time-barred period; • a new child support assessment should result in the reassessment of an existing assessment that is time barred; or • the exemption from paying child support for victims of sex offences should otherwise apply. The existing rights to object to a decision or an assessment that Inland Revenue has made and to appeal to the Family Court would also still apply. 20 The time bar would also restrict administrative and Commissioner initiated administrative reviews 4 – that is, there would be a four-year period in which to seek an administrative review. Once the time bar is in effect, a person would be largely unable to apply for an administrative review for the time-barred period. However, there would also be a four-month limit to apply for an administrative review of an assessment that relates to a period that is time barred. The application must be made within four months of the date of the latest notice of assessment. The four-month limit would not apply to administrative reviews applied for within the non- time-barred four years. But, when the time bar would otherwise be in effect, parents would be permitted a small window to apply for an administrative review where appropriate. This would ensure that policy intent of the time bar can be achieved, that is, to provide a limited time period for reassessments, which would result in more certainly for parents. Example 4 On 1 January 2022 Inland Revenue notifies Jane of an assessment for the child support year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The assessment is dated three months before the period will become time barred (1 April 2022). Jane would have four months from 1 January (the date she was notified by Inland Revenue) to apply for an administrative review. That is, she could apply for an administrative review up until 30 April 2022 (one month after the period has become subject to the time bar). Figure 3 31/03/201801/01/202231/05/2022 1/01/22 Assessment 1/05/22 Administrative review window closes 1/04/22 Time bar takes effect 1/04/18 Child support year ends Example 5 On 1 December 2021, Inland Revenue notifies Hector of a reassessment for the child support year 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. The reassessment arises following an audit where it was identified that none of Hector’s rental income had been included in his income tax assessment. Therefore, one of the exceptions to the time bar applies. The assessment relates to a time-barred period. Hector would have four months, stating from 1 December 2021 (the date of notification) to apply for an administrative review for the time barred child support year. 4 “Administrative review” is the term used to describe the process when a person makes an application for a departure from the formula under the Child Support Act 1991. 21 The proposed time bar will be broadly consistent with the time bar for income tax which restricts reassessments to four years after a taxpayer has provided their income tax return. Background Under the current rules, if relevant information is provided Inland Revenue can amend an assessment as far back as 1992 (when the Child Support Act came into force). Reassessments can occur for a variety of reasons – for example, changes in income, changes in care arrangements and parents reconciling. This unrestricted ability to amend assessments creates uncertainty for parents. It also results in additional administrative costs. In some cases, there is no change in the amount to be paid as a result of the reassessment because, for example, the liable person is assessed to pay the minimum child support amount. 22 DEFINITION OF INCOME (Clauses 4(1) and (3), 9, 10 and 13) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the definition of “income” used for child support purposes be amended to better reflect a parent’s financial capacity by incorporating investment income and no longer offsetting losses from earlier years. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The definition of income used for child support purposes would be amended to better reflect a parent’s financial capacity. If a person’s income in the tax year before the child support year is only from income that has had tax deducted at source, the income used to determine their child support obligation or entitlement would be their employment income plus any interest and dividend income (subject to resident withholding tax) from the calendar year immediately preceding the child support year. For parents whose income is from other sources (for example, they are self-employed), any losses carried forward from an earlier year would be ignored for the purposes of determining the income to be used to calculate child support obligations. Background Currently, for parents whose only income is from income that has had tax deducted at source, only their employment income is included in their child support assessment. That is, interest and dividends subject to resident withholding tax are excluded. This is because, in the past, interest and dividend income was not generally known until the end of the tax year. However, from 1 April 2020 interest and dividend income information will be reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. This means there will now be the opportunity to take interest and dividends into account. One of the objectives of child support is that the level of financial support that parents provide for their children is determined according to their relative financial capacity. Reducing a person’s income by deducting tax losses that have been occurred in earlier periods is at odds with that objective. This proposed amendment would also more closely align the definition of “income” used for child support purposes with that used in other social policies such as Working for Families tax credits. 23 Technical amendments 25 RECONCILING AN ESTIMATION AT THE END OF THE YEAR (Clauses 14, 16 and 17) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that a “reconciliation period” is introduced to ensure that if a parent has estimated their income for child support, the income used for the end of year reconciliation would reflect what was earned over the period the estimate applies to. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features When a parent has estimated their income for child support, the proposed reconciliation would be completed on the basis of a “reconciliation period” rather than an “election period”. This would ensure that the period being squared up reflects the number of days for which the estimation is in effect. The proposed reconciliation period would be from the start of the month in which the estimate was received until the day before the next estimate. If there is only one estimate, or it is the last estimate in a year, the proposed reconciliation period would be from the start of the month in which the estimate was received until the end of the child support year. The formula for reconciliation would be changed so that the income used reflects the amount received over the reconciliation period (rather than considering income received after the reconciliation period has ended, as can currently occur). The amended formula would have income received over the reconciliation period divided by the number of days within the reconciliation period and then multiplied by 365 to achieve an annualised income. If the actual income a parent earned at the end of the year is more than what they were originally assessed on (before they chose to estimate), the reconciliation income would still be that from the original assessment. This outcome is illustrated in figure 4. 26 Figure 4: Outcome of the proposed reconciliation period Apr May Jun JulAugSepOctNovDecJanFebMar Income$3,334$5,294$54,206 Reconciliation period 1 Reconciliation period 2 Reconciliation period 3 Reconciliation period 1 Reconciliation period 2 Reconciliation period 3 Length of period 30 days 61 days 274 days Income derived in period $3,334 $5,294 $54,206 YTD income $0 $3,334 $5,294 Formula used ((a − z) ÷ b) × 365 ((a − z) ÷ b) × 365 (a − b) × 365 ((3,334 − 0) ÷ 30) × 365 ((5,294 − 3,334) ÷ 61) × 365 (54,206 ÷ 274) × 365 Annualised income $40,563.67 $11,727.87 $72,208 Background The child support formula assessment uses both parents’ income, based on the previous year’s income. However, if a parent expects their income to reduce by fifteen percent or more for the year, they may estimate the amount they expect to earn for the remainder of the year. A parent may estimate more than once during the year. At the end of the year there is a reconciliation of the estimate and the actual income earned in that period. Detailed analysis If a person elects to estimate their income, the estimate is reconciled at the end of the year to determine if child support has been under or overpaid. The reconciliation is currently completed on the basis of an “election period”. An election period for an estimate means either: • the child support year – if the estimate is submitted before the start of the child year or in the first month of the child support year; or • the period starting on the first day of the month in which an estimation is submitted to the last day of the child support year. The income to be used in the reconciliation is the income received over the election period. Once the income for the election period is identified, the amount is divided by the number of days within the election period and then multiplied by 365 to achieve an annualised income. The current election period is appropriate when a person estimates once in a child support year. However, if there are multiple estimations in the year, all but the final election period 27 extend for a longer period than the estimation relates to. Therefore, this does not reflect what was earned in the period the estimate relates to. This means that a person’s income used in the reconciliation could reflect more income or less income than was actually earned in the period the estimate relates to. Example 6 demonstrates this. Example 6: Current reconciliation rules with multiple election periods Jorge has estimated three times in a given year: Estimate 1 begins on 1 April, Estimate 2 beings on 1 May and Estimate 3 begins on 1 July. At the end of the year Jorge has earned $62,834; the amount earnt in each election period is shown in figure 5. Figure 5 Apr MayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecJanFebMar Income$3,334$5,294$54,206 Election period 1 Election period 2 Election period 3 In practice, Estimate 1 is only in force until Estimate 2 begins. However, the election period used when reconciling Estimate 1 is the full child support year. As such, Estimate 1 is reconciled on the whole year’s actual income, not the $3,334 earned in April which annualised would be $40,563. The method for determining the income used to reconcile each estimate means it may not reflect actual earnings for the relevant period. Reconciling estimates on the income a parent earned in the relevant period the estimate applies to would improve the fairness of the child support scheme. 28 ACCEPTING AN ESTIMATION (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment When a person joins the child support scheme, it is proposed that an estimation could be backdated to the start of the new assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation within 28 days of the notification of the assessment. This means that a person (whether a liable parent or receiving parent) would have at least 28 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features When a person joins (or re-joins) the child support scheme an estimation could be backdated to the start of the new assessment if Inland Revenue receives the estimation within 28 days of the notification of the assessment. This means that a person (whether a liable parent or receiving parent) would have at least 28 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed. Once 28 days has passed the current rule would apply and the estimate could only be back dated to the beginning of the month in which the estimate is given. Background Currently, if an estimate is given before the start of the child support year, it applies from the beginning of that year. Otherwise, it applies from the beginning of the month in which the estimate is given. In some circumstances, a person new to the child support scheme may lose the opportunity to estimate for periods (generally the previous month), because they receive their first notice of assessment or entitlement after their first month of liability or entitlement has already ended. The proposed amendment would mean that a person (whether a liable parent or receiving parent) has at least 28 days to estimate their income when child support is first assessed. 29 COMMISSIONER INITIATED DEBT OFFSETTING BETWEEN PEOPLE (Clauses 35–37 and 46) Summary of proposed amendment Inland Revenue would be able to offset child support amounts owed between parents, without the person having to apply for an administrative review. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features It is proposed that the current administrative review ground which allows for child support amounts to be offset, be replaced by a provision permitting Inland Revenue to complete an offset when two people owe each other child support (whether or not the amounts have become due and payable). The offset would net out child support amounts two people owe each other rather than require an adjustment to any formula assessment (as is required with an administrative review). The person owing the greater amount would be required to pay the difference. As with the current legislative settings, an offset would not be able to be exercised for any payments that are to be retained by the Government to cover the costs of benefits paid to carers. Background Currently, a parent may apply for an administrative review to request a child support amount they owe another parent is offset by the amount that parent owes to them. Administrative review is a process when a person’s formula assessment can be changed, on application by the parent to better fit a person’s specific situation, through determination by Inland Revenue. The ground was introduced in 2016 but has been largely unused. A provision permitting Inland Revenue to initiate an offset of the debts would be simpler to administer, easier for customers to understand, and be more effective at reducing debt. 30 REPEAL OF REDUNDANT PROVISION FOR URGENT MAINTENANCE ORDERS (Clauses 38 and 39) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to repeal the provision which allows a person to apply to the Family Court for an urgent maintenance order if they have made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but child support has not yet been assessed. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The current provision for a carer to be granted an urgent maintenance order for a child if the Family Court rules that a child is in urgent need of assistance would be repealed, as it is redundant. Background In 1992, the urgent maintenance provision was included in the Child Support Act to cover the period of transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in case there were any unforeseen circumstances that meant Inland Revenue was unable to assess child support. An order under this provision has never been granted. Repealing the provision would simplify the legislation. 31 CHANGES TO TEMPORARY EXEMPTIONS (Clauses 22–32) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are proposed to the hospital patient and prisoner exemptions so that the exemptions would be available to liable persons who are overseas. It is proposed that a new exemption be introduced for people who have a long-term illness or injury who are unable to work, with similar income criteria to the existing exemptions. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The hospital patient and prisoner exemptions would be extended to qualifying liable persons who are overseas. The exemption would only be available if the liable person earns the equivalent of (or less than) the income currently allowed for New Zealand-based hospital patients or prisoners. It is proposed that a new exemption be introduced for liable persons who have a long-term illness or injury who cannot work (for 13 weeks or more) and who meet specific income thresholds. To be eligible for the exemption they must either have: • nil income; or • income only from investments (not exceeding the weekly average of the minimum weekly child support liability – currently $18). As with the existing exemptions, the exemptions would not be available to liable persons who have any other income such as a main benefit (including a Jobseekers Allowance, Sole Parent Benefit, or Supported Living Payment). Example 7 George receives a main benefit (supported living payment) of $308.91 per week. Because this amount is more than the maximum child support obligation per week, George does not qualify for the exemption for persons suffering from a long-term illness or injury. Currently, a receiving carer can make an application requesting an exemption be overturned on the basis of the financial capacity of the exempted person. Inland Revenue can make a determination that an exemption should not apply, if the exemption would be inequitable because of the earning capacity, or financial resources of the liable person. This would also apply to the proposed changes. 32 Background Temporary exemptions from payment of child support for hospital patients and long-term prisoners exist to provide relief from payment on the grounds that a person has limited income (and capacity to earn an income) for a period of time. Currently, the exemptions for hospital patients and prisoners are only available to a liable person living in New Zealand and either in a prison or hospital for more than 13 weeks or more. Under current rules, to qualify for an exemption, a liable person who is a long-term hospital patient must have: • nil income; • income only from investments (not exceeding the weekly average of the minimum weekly child support liability (currently $18); or • only income from the benefit payable to long-term hospital patients (currently $45.28 per week). Under current rules, a liable person who is a prisoner must have: • nil income; • income only from investments (not exceeding the weekly average of the minimum weekly child support liability (currently $18); • only income payable under section 66 of the Corrections Act 2004. Making temporary exemptions available to patients in overseas hospitals and prisoners in overseas prisons would bring consistency to the rules for domestic and overseas liable parents. The proposed new exemption for people who have an injury or illness but being cared for in a home environment would mean that they are being treated consistently with a person who is in hospital. 33 REMOVAL OF THE MIXED AGE EXPENDITURE TABLE (Clauses 8, 12 and 49) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to remove the mixed age expenditure table to ensure that costs of children are allocated appropriately between younger and older children. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The mixed age expenditure table would be removed. Costs would be calculated for each child based on their age, using the applicable expenditure table for their age. Background Child support obligations are based on various factors including the estimated costs of raising children. These estimated costs are reflected in schedule 3 of the Child Support Act. The schedule provides for expenditure for children aged 12 and younger or 13 and older. It also provides expenditure for when a child support calculation includes children from both age brackets in a “mixed age expenditure table” which is an average of the expenditure for the children in the other age brackets. If a child support calculation includes at least two children in the same child support calculation and they fall into different age brackets, the use of the mixed age table can lead to an inequitable outcome. For example, if the children do not live in the same household (for example, one child lives with the mother and the other with the father), the use of the mixed age table does not allocate costs appropriately to each child (although the total expenditure for all children is correct), with the result that the parent with the older child is not receiving the appropriate amount of child support. The proposed amendment would ensure that the costs are calculated appropriately for each child, based on their age, and would better reflect that costs are higher for older children. In cases when children live in different households, it would ensure that the household with the younger child does not benefit from being allocated some of the expenditure intended for the older child. 34 Example 8 Ioane and Krystal have three children together: Rian (aged 15), Brian (aged 14) and Zion (aged 10). Rian and Brian live with Ioane 100% of the time, and Zion lives with Krystal 100% of the time. Since all three children share the same parents, they form a child support group. Child expenditure would be calculated as a total figure for the group. When determining child expenditure for the group, the mixed age expenditure table applies. Ioane and Krystal have a combined child support income of $63,634. For the child support year 1 April 2020 – 31 March 2021, child expenditure for the group is $18,454.28. This figure would be divided by three to find individual expenditure figures for each child, as shown in figure 6. Figure 6 $6,151.43$6,151.43$6,151.43$18,454.28 RianBrianZionTotal expenditure As Zion lives with his mother Krystal, the individual figure $6,151.76 will be used in the formula to determine the amount of child support payable for him. This amount is greater than would be reached using the table for children aged 12 or younger, which would be $5,620.75. The reason this figure is lower than the amount reached under the mixed age expenditure table is because expenditure figures in the mixed age table are higher than the table for children aged 12 or younger to account for the costs of children aged over 13. This means that when the total figure is divided between the number of children in the child support group, children 12 or younger are allocated greater expenditure than their age would normally entitle them to. Conversely, Rian and Brian are allocated expenditure of $12,303.52, which is less than would be allocated if the table for children aged 13 or older were used. That figure would be $13,362.87 (this figure includes expenditure for both Rian and Brian). This means that Krystal’s higher expenditure figure for Zion will result in a higher entitlement, and Ioane’s lower expenditure figure for Rian and Brian will mean a lower entitlement. This outcome is not a problem when a parent cares for all children in a child support group, as that parent incurs the costs associated with all children. However, when children live with different parents, a parent who cares for children 12 or younger will benefit from higher expenditure because of the costs associated with children they do not care for, and the parent who cares for children 13 or older will be disadvantaged. 35 DISCRETION TO ADJUST CHILD EXPENDITURE CALCULATIONS (Clauses 8 and 12) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that Inland Revenue would have the discretion to adjust child expenditure calculations when children live in different care arrangements which result in the formula not achieving the intended outcome. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The proposed amendment would allow discretion for Inland Revenue to adjust child expenditure calculations in situations when complex care arrangements for children in the same calculation are not adequately accounted for. This discretion would only be applied when there are exceptional circumstances and the outcome would be unjust or inequitable if the calculations were not modified. Background The expenditure table in schedule 3 of the Child Support Act was developed based on economies of scale, that is, each subsequent child increases child expenditure by a progressively smaller amount. Example 9 In the 2020 child support year, a parent earning $61,351.00 per annum caring for dependent children aged under 12 would be permitted a dependent child allowance of: • $9,816.12 for 1 child; • $14,417.20 for 2 children; and • $16,257.25 for 3 or more children. The expenditure table does not provide individual child expenditure figures. However, these can be calculated from the difference between total figures: Figure 7 $9,816.12$4,601.08$1,840.05$16,257.25 Child 1Child 2Child 3Total expenditure 36 Although expenditure calculations serve the majority of cases, in some complex situations these calculations can produce unintended outcomes. For example, if a parent has two dependent children in their care full time and a third dependent child enters their care for fifty percent of the time, while that parent’s dependent child allowance might reasonably be expected to increase or stay the same, it can in fact decrease. This occurs because of how the formula for calculating the dependent child allowance apportions total expenditure amongst the children concerned. The formula divides expenditure equally between each child. Expenditure is granted to the parent as a dependent child allowance in proportion to the amount of time they care for each relevant child. However, because subsequent children increase child expenditure by a progressively smaller amount, the formula deducts the proportion of time from a greater share of total expenditure than the child has contributed. Example 10 Caoimhe earns $61,351 and has two dependent children in her care, Ruairi and Rawiri. Caoimhe has a dependent child allowance of $14,417.20. Figure 8 $9,816.12$4,601.08$14,417.20 R u ai r i Rawir i Total expenditure Caoimhe’s daughter Matilda comes to live with her fifty percent of the time. It could be reasonably expected that Caoimhe’s dependent child allowance would increase by fifty percent of the expenditure permitted for Matilda (in this instance, around $920). Figure 9 $9,816.12$4,601.08$15,337.23 R u ai r iRawir iMatildaTotal expenditure $920.025 $920.025 However, this is not the outcome reached under current rules. Since the formula for the dependent child allowance divides expenditure equally amongst the children, Matilda is allocated an equal third of total expenditure, of which Caoimhe is permitted only fifty percent (in this instance, $2,709.54). As such, Caoimhe’s dependent child allowance decreases from $14,417.20 to $13,547.70, even though there is an additional child in her care. Figure 10 $5,419.08$5,419.08$13,547.70 R u ai r iRawir iMatildaTotal expenditure $2,709.54 $2,709.54 37 By allowing Inland Revenue the discretion to modify expenditure calculations it would be able to resolve cases, which, due to their complexity, result in a perverse outcome. This would increase fairness for families. 38 CLARIFYING THAT CHILD SUPPORT ENDS WHEN A CHILD LEAVES STATE CARE (Clause 7) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that child support would stop for a qualifying child when the child leaves State care. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The proposed clarification would confirm that child support stops for a qualifying child when they leave State care. If the child is subsequently going to be cared for by one of the parents, that parent could apply for child support if they wish to receive payments. Background The Child Support Act provides that in situations when a child’s care arrangement is changed the new care arrangement should be updated and the child support should continue – taking into account the change in care. Notifications of the child support assessment based on the child’s new care arrangement would be issued to the parents. However, when a child leaves State care and is placed with one of the parents, Inland Revenue practice is to stop the child support that parents are paying to the State (the receiving carer in these cases). This practice is followed due to potential safety concerns for the child and their carer that may arise out of the need to notify the change in the child’s care arrangements. If the parent with the child in their care would like to receive child support, they are able to apply. However, Inland Revenue’s approach is not consistent with the current legislative provisions. Clarifying that child support should end when a child leaves State care would reinforce the current practice and protect the safety of the child. 39 TIMEFRAMES FOR PROVIDING ORDERS OF PARENTAGE (Clause 6) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that Court declarations of parentage would be required to be provided to Inland Revenue in a timely manner. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The proposed amendment would mean child support would only be back dated on receipt of a declaration of parentage if: • the carer applied for the order either before or within two months of submitting their child support application; and • having been granted, the order is given to Inland Revenue within two months. Inland Revenue would have discretion to accept the orders outside the two-month period if the delay was due to circumstances beyond the carer’s control – for example, they were seriously ill. These rules would also apply to an order or declaration made by an overseas court or a public authority in an overseas jurisdiction. If the two-month period was not met, child support would start from the date the Court order is given to Inland Revenue. Background A person cannot be made liable to pay child support unless Inland Revenue has received proof that the person is a parent as defined in section 7 of the Child Support Act. In some cases, a person is named on the child support application but not initially considered liable, then through a subsequent Court order is declared the parent. That person’s child support liability can be back dated to the date the child support application was received. This is regardless of how long it takes for the Court declaration to be given to Inland Revenue. This can lead to delays of many years and can create large debts for the liable parent. The proposed amendment would remove the ability for the carer to delay giving Inland Revenue a parentage order in a timely manner knowing that child support can be backdated. Introducing timeframes for parents and carers to provide orders of parentage would address this and improve equity for parents. 40 INTRODUCING TIMEFRAMES TO ADVISE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN CHILD SUPPORT FIRST ASSESSED (Clauses 18 and 21) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that there should be a time limit for advising Inland Revenue of a person’s circumstances that exist when they apply for child support. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features A liable parent or receiving carer would have 28 days from the date of their notice of assessment to advise Inland Revenue of any existing circumstances that could affect their assessment for it to be back dated to the start of their assessment. If notification is received after 28 days, it would only take effect from the date the notification is received by Inland Revenue. Background When Inland Revenue is satisfied that a relevant change of circumstance has occurred (for example, the birth of a new dependent child or a change in care arrangements) the Child Support Act determines when the change is to be treated as having occurred. If a change is notified within 28 days of it occurring, it is recognised from the date it occurred. However, this is not the case when the circumstance existed at the time child support was assessed for a person for the first time. In these situations, the assessment is considered incorrect and therefore could be corrected from the start of the child support assessment. This can cause overpayments to carers (for example, if a liable parent notifies Inland Revenue that they are the carer of a dependent child that reduces their payments) or retrospectively increases obligations owed by liable parents (if a receiving parent likewise notifies that they have always been the carer of a dependent child). The proposed amendment would ensure consistency with the rules governing changes of circumstances that occur after the initial child support assessment. It would also encourage parents to notify circumstances in a timely manner and improve certainty for parents and carers. 41 MINIMUM AGE AT WHICH A CHILD CAN BE CONSIDERED FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT (Clause 5(1)) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to align the minimum age at which a child could be considered financially independent with similar rules in the Working for Families legislation. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features It is proposed that a child would only be able to be considered financially independent for child support purposes when they have reached 16 years of age. This would align with similar rules in the Working for Families legislation. Background There is currently no minimum age for when a child can be considered financially independent. This change would ensure that parents support their children financially until they are at least 16 years old. 42 MAXIMUM AGE OF QUALIFYING CHILD (Clause 5(2)) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the “maximum qualifying age” of a child for child support purposes be aligned with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to any child who turns 18 on or after 1 April 2021. Key features If a child is aged 18 and enrolled at school, it is proposed that child support would stop on the earlier of: • the day before the day they are no longer enrolled and attending school; or • 31 December of the year in which the child turns 18, if they attend school until the end of the academic year. This would better align the child support “maximum qualifying age” of a child with similar tests for Working for Families and main benefit recipients. As a transitional arrangement, if a child in school turns 18 before 1 April 2021, the old rules would apply, and child support could continue to apply until they turn 19. Background Currently a child ceases to qualify for child support once they turn 18 unless they are still at school. Once a child turns 18, child support ends the earlier of: • when they leave school if they do not finish the school year; • 31 December of the year the child turns 18, if they finish the school year and they are not attending school the following year; or • the day before the child turns 19, if the child is still in school until their 19th birthday. 43 CLARIFYING RESIDENCE RULES (Clause 47) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the child support residence rules are clarified so that Inland Revenue can determine whether a person is ordinarily resident in New Zealand based on whether a person intends to be ordinarily resident or not. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features Determinations of whether a person is ordinarily resident in New Zealand or not for the purposes of child support could be made if Inland Revenue is satisfied that a person intends to be ordinarily resident or not. To determine whether a child is ordinarily resident in New Zealand, Inland Revenue would consider where the child is more likely to be living. Example 11 Kate arrived in New Zealand from England on 1 July 2021 and purchased a house in August. She has a child, Ben, from a previous relationship who lives with his father in New Zealand. Kate intends to live in New Zealand permanently. Ben’s father applied for child support on 10 July 2021. Kate’s intention to stay in New Zealand can be taken into account an d she is considered ordinarily resident for the purposes of child support. Kate is assessed as liable to pay child support for Ben from 10 July. If Kate’s intention to live in New Zealand could not be considered, the child support application could not be accepted, and a child support obligation raised until Kate had lived in New Zealand for at least 183 days. Example 12 Dave, Alice and their two children emigrate to New Zealand from Germany, they are not New Zealand citizens. A few months after moving to New Zealand, Dave and Alice separate and the two children live with Dave full time. Dave applies for child support and Alice is made liable (she is considered resident based on her intention to stay in New Zealand). A year later, Alice decides to move back to Germany with no intention of returning to New Zealand to live. Because Alice does not intend to return to New Zealand her child support obligation stops from the day she leaves the country. Dave can consider pursuing child support from Alice through the German child support system. If Alice’s intention to leave the country was not taken into account, the child support could not be stopped until at least 325 days had passed, and Dave may not be able to pursue child support through the German child support system. 44 Background Inland Revenue’s current practice is that child support residency decisions are usually based on a person’s intended movements. This is because residency for child support purposes needs to be determined in order to accept a child support application or end a child support assessment in a timely manner. If this approach is not taken, a carer could have to wait up to 325 days before Inland Revenue could determine their residency status and then accept their application for support. The proposed amendment would better reflect the current operational practice that a person’s intention to be ordinarily resident (or not) should be taken into account. 45 MINOR REMEDIAL PROPOSALS (Clauses 4(2), 11(1), 11(2), 33 and 44) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that minor remedial amendments are made, including corrections to cross references. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features • The definition of “social security beneficiary” has been repealed from section 2 of the Child Support Act. However, it is still referred to as being specifically defined in section 2(1) in sections 152B(2), 180(2)(a), 180(2)(b), 180(2)(c) and 180A(1)(a) of the Child Support Act. The Bill proposes a clarification that a social security beneficiary would be a person in receipt of a social security benefit. • Before the Child Support Amendment Act 2013, the Child Support Act stipulated that the tax rate at which to gross the benefit rate for each year be the rate in force on 1 January of the preceding year. However, this was inadvertently removed in the amendment of the Act. A clarification is proposed that the rate at which to gross up the appropriate benefit rate for the coming child support year would be the rate in force on 1 January of the preceding year. • Section 35A(2) of the Child Support Act was updated as a consequence of the Social Security Act rewrite. However, that amendment has inadvertently widened who qualifies for the higher rate of living allowance (which is based on the benefit payable under clause 1(c) of Part 3 of Schedule 4 of the Social Security Act 2018), so that it is now payable to any beneficiary granted a supported living payment. It is proposed that the higher rate of living allowance would be limited to a single beneficiary with at least one dependent child, as intended. • The Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Act 1966 was repealed and replaced by the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017. Consequentially, part (b) of the definition of “hospital patient” in section 89B of the Child Support Act was amended to “a patient within the meaning of the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017” which has widened the definition. • It is proposed that part (b) of the definition of “hospital patient” would be amended to refer to a person who is “a resident in a treatment centre” under the Substance Addiction (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 2017. • As a result of the repeal of sections 81 to 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in 2019 and insertion of new provisions to deal with collection, use and disclosure of revenue information, some cross references in the Child Support Act are no longer correct: 46 – Section 89Z(4) of the Child Support Act refers to the now repealed section 85K of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The cross reference should be to the new section 18H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (which refers to schedule 7, part C of that Act). – The definition of “relevant payments” in section 135JA(1) of the Child Support Act refers to the now repealed section 82(9) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the definition of “earnings related compensation”. It is proposed that the reference would be to schedule 7, part C, subpart 2, clause 41(9) of schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Initial penalties are applied in two stages in the first month, and if the amount is not paid incremental penalties are imposed each month the amount is outstanding. The proposal is to no longer charge incremental penalties. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features Incremental penalties would no longer be charged on child support amounts not paid on time. The change would apply to unpaid amounts on or after 1 April 2021. That is, penalties will not be applied to: • new debt arising on or after 1 April 2021; and • existing unpaid amounts due before 1 April 2021. Penalties imposed before 1 April 2021 would remain. Background Currently, late payment penalties are imposed on a liable parent if they do not pay on time. Initial penalties are imposed as well as incremental penalties. Incremental penalties are applied at: • 2% of the outstanding amount including penalties from one month after the due date for the next 11 months; and • 1% of the outstanding amount including penalties each month from 13 months after the due date. The penalties compound and create further debt for customers. The compounding nature of incremental penalties can result in liable parents disengaging with their child support obligations. When a payment is made, it is allocated to the core amount first and then to any penalties. Write-off rules mean that in most cases incremental penalties are written off. Initial penalties are being retained. As child support is due each month, if a person is late paying month-after-month, Inland Revenue is able to take appropriate follow up action with the person when initial penalties are imposed. 8 SIMPLIFICATION OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PENALTIES WRITE-OFF RULES (Clauses 43A, 43B, 43C, 43D, 43E, 43F, 43G, and 44A) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the child support penalty write-off rules be simplified. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The child support penalty write-off rules would be simplified to allow for the write-off of penalties when: • there was a reasonable cause for the late payment; • the late payment was due to the failure of another person to make a deduction; • the late payment was due to an honest mistake by the liable parent; • an error was made by Inland Revenue; • a person is in serous hardship; • it is an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the penalty; and • the receiving carer has uplifted the debt, or waived the right to the payment, to which the penalty relates and a write-off would be fair and reasonable. To ensure parents who are charged penalties on or before 31 March 2021 are not worse off under the new rules, a “fair and reasonable” penalty write-off provision would be retained that would only be used to write-off penalties charged on or before 31 March 2021. Background The current penalty write-off provisions are complex and difficult for customers to understand and Inland Revenue to administer. Most of the incremental penalties imposed can be written off. Table 1 outlines the current write-off provisions. 9 Table 1: Current write-off provisions Section Mandatory or discretionary Type of penalties Explanation 135A - - The Commissioner may grant relief by writing off in part or in full. If an amount has been paid and the Commissioner writes off a penalty, the amount paid can be refunded. 135B Discretionary Initial and incremental (but does not refer to either) Reasonable cause. 135C Discretionary Initial and incremental Failure of another person to make a deduction. 135D Discretionary Initial and incremental Honest oversight by liable person with no history of default. 135E Discretionary Initial and incremental Error made by Inland Revenue. 135F Discretionary Initial and incremental Debt waived or uplifted. 135FA Discretionary Incremental Unpaid before agreement entered into on or after 1 April 2016. 135G Discretionary Incremental Relief if some or all of the debt has been paid and recovery of incremental penalties would place the liable parent in serious hardship or it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 135GA Discretionary Initial and incremental Residual penalty only debt (including when core written off when owed to the Crown). 135GB Mandatory Initial late payment penalty Relief if full or substantial compliance with payment arrangement entered into or made on or after 1 April 2016 and within 3- month period. 135H Mandatory Initial late payment penalty Relief if full compliance with payment arrangement entered into or made before 1 April 2016 and within 3-month period. 135I Mandatory Initial late payment penalty Amount of the penalty is no more than $5 and the amount of the financial support that the penalty relates to is less than the amount of the penalty and no history of default. 135J Mandatory Incremental Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into on or after 26 September 2006 (26 weeks). 135JA Mandatory Incremental Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before deduction plan made on or after 1 April 2016 (26 weeks). 10 Section Mandatory or discretionary Type of penalties Explanation 135K Mandatory Incremental Relief from incremental penalties in relation to arrangements entered into or made before 26 September 2006 (26 weeks). 135L Mandatory Incremental Writing off of incremental penalties if non-compliance with arrangement (if at review date the Commissioner is satisfied that the circumstances relating to the failure would, if related to payment of debt to which penalty relates, entitle the Commissioner to grant relief under any of sections 135B to 135E). 135M Mandatory Incremental Relief if payment agreement in force. 135N Mandatory Incremental Relief if deduction notice in force.

The Bill includes targeted measures aimed at providing relief to those that have been economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The Bill also includes measures aimed at addressing the broader economic impacts of the outbreak. This Bill includes proposed changes to income tax, tax administration and social assistance. Income tax The income tax proposals in this Bill include: • restoring depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings; • increasing the low-value asset write-off threshold; • increasing the provisional tax threshold; and • bringing forward the application date for the broader refundability rules for R&D tax credits. These proposals are aimed at assisting the broader economic recovery from COVID-19 by incentivising businesses to bring forward investments and continue spending. Tax administration The tax administration proposals in this Bill include: • enabling Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest for taxpayers affected by COVID-19; and • allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other Government agencies to assist those agencies in their response to COVID-19. Allowing interest on late tax payments to be remitted would provide relief to taxpayers financially affected by COVID-19. Allowing Inland Revenue to share information would assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. Social assistance The social assistance proposals in this Bill include: • removing the hours test eligibility requirement for the in-work tax credit; • ensuring GST does not apply to payments of the COVID-19 wage subsidy and leave payments; • reducing the winter energy payment rates to their current levels from 2021 after a temporary increase in 2020; and • allowing people on a temporary visa to qualify for Working for Families if they are receiving an emergency benefit. These social assistance proposals are aimed at ensuring those financially impacted by COVID-19 receive the support they need. 8 9 Income tax 11 DEPRECIATION ON NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS (Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 29(2), 29(4), 29(6), 29(7), 29(8), 29(9) and 30) Summary of proposed amendment New Zealand allowed depreciation for buildings in the tax base until it was removed in a package of tax reform effective from the 2011–12 income year. The proposed amendment would restore building depreciation but only for buildings that are not primarily used for residential accommodation. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2020–21 income year. Key features A deduction for depreciation of buildings other than residential buildings would be allowed from the 2020–21 income year. It would apply to buildings owned at the beginning of that income year and also going forward to newly acquired buildings and capital improvements made to existing buildings. The depreciation rate would be 2% declining value or 1.5% straight line. This is a permanent measure. Background New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings in the tax base until 2010. Building depreciation was suspended for long-lived buildings from the 2011–12 income year. Long- lived buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Buildings with a shorter estimated useful life have continued to be depreciable. New Zealand’s position disallowing tax depreciation for almost all buildings is unusual internationally. International studies generally find that buildings do depreciate. The Tax Working Group reviewed this setting and recommended renewing depreciation for industrial, commercial, and multi-unit residential buildings. It did not recommend renewing depreciation for other types of residential buildings because data shows these buildings have a slower rate of economic depreciation than other buildings. Detailed analysis Depreciation of long-lived non-residential buildings would be allowed from the beginning of 2020–21 income year. The proposed depreciation rate would be 2% declining value or 1.5% straight line. Opening tax book value For buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, the tax book value for the beginning of the 2020–21 income year would be: 12 • the adjusted tax book value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule if applicable; plus • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. For buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, the opening tax book value for the 2020–21 income year would be: • the cost of the building; plus • non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Straight line depreciation If a taxpayer elects to use the straight line method, the building’s cost for the purpose of calculating the depreciation deduction would be the opening tax book value for the 2020–21 income year and not the original cost (if different). Depreciation recovery If a building is sold, its depreciation recovery income would be calculated taking into account depreciation deductions taken before 2011–12 (if any) and depreciation deductions taken from 2020–21. The cost base would also reduce by the amount of deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule. Non-residential buildings A non-residential building is any building that is not a residential building. A residential building would be defined as: • a dwelling as defined in Section YA 1; and • a building in which accommodation is ordinarily provided for periods of less than 28 days at a time if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than four units intended for separate occupation. The definition of “dwelling” encompasses owner-occupied houses and apartments, and houses and apartments subject to residential tenancies. The proposed additional category including some buildings accommodating short-term stays is to ensure there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for some short-term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this would put it beyond doubt those buildings remain non-depreciable. The less-than four units provision is meant to exclude larger commercial operations such as motels from being treated as a residential building. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating depreciation on non-residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms would no longer be required. Accordingly, 13 section DB 65 would be repealed, and the tax book value of the building adjusted for past DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to receive a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner would be restored for non-residential buildings. 14 INCREASE IN THE PROVISIONAL TAX THRESHOLD (Clauses 21–28 and 29(5)) Summary of proposed amendment This measure would permanently increase the residual income tax threshold for being required to pay provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000. As a result, a number of taxpayers would no longer be required to make provisional tax payments throughout the year, which would assist those businesses with cashflow issues including during the COVID-19 outbreak. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for the 2020–21 and later income years. Key features This measure would change the threshold for paying provisional tax so that less taxpayers are required to pay provisional tax instalments throughout the year. For taxpayers with residual income tax of between $2,500 and $5,000, instead of paying provisional tax throughout the income year as under the current law, they would only have to pay by 7 February following the end of the income year. Example 1: Increase in the provisional tax threshold Jenny is a tour guide who provides tours of the Lord of the Rings filming location sites around Wellington through her company Jenstar Tours Limited (JTL). She gets the majority of her customers from tourist ships visiting Wellington. In the 2019–20 income year, JTL’s tax liability was $8,000, but because of the recent changes to restrict tourist ships in response to COVID-19, JTL’s tax liability in 2020–21 is expected to be half of that amount. The Government’s proposed change to the provisional tax threshold from $2,500 to $5,000 would mean that JTL would not be a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 income year. Instead of paying tax in instalments throughout the 2020–21 income year, JTL would not have to pay tax until 7 February 2022, which would improve its cash flow during the year. Background Section RC 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 currently provides that a person whose residual income tax year is more than $2,500 is required to pay provisional tax. This threshold is used several times throughout subpart RC and elsewhere, such as for dealing with: • voluntary provisional tax payments; • the standard uplift method; • provisional tax instalments; and • the GST ratio method. 15 The threshold referred to in these sections, and others, would be changed in accordance with the implementation of this measure (with the exception of a terminating provision in section RZ 1). Provisional tax is paid in three equal instalments over an income year. The requirement to make these payments imposes compliance costs on taxpayers. It also has an impact on cash flow as provisional tax instalments comprise cash that a taxpayer is unable to use during the year before terminal tax is due. The proposed measure would remove around 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime. 16 INCREASE IN THE LOW-VALUE ASSET WRITE-OFF THRESHOLD (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment This measure would temporarily increase the low-value asset write-off threshold from $500 to $5,000 in the short term before decreasing this threshold to $1,000 on a permanent basis. This would allow taxpayers to immediately deduct expenditure on assets that cost up to $5,000 (and subsequently $1,000) rather than depreciating them over the life of the asset. This would decrease the tax liabilities of taxpayers in the short term and therefore assist with cashflow including during the COVID-19 outbreak. It may also encourage continued investment in businesses in the short term. Application date The proposed amendment to increase the low-value asset write-off threshold to $5,000 would apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2020. The proposed amendment to subsequently lower this threshold to $1,000 would apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2021. Key features This measure would increase the value of property that is eligible to be written off in the year of purchase from $500 to $5,000, before decreasing that threshold to $1,000. This means that expenditure on assets up to the threshold can be deducted immediately, so that all of the tax benefit is claimed up front. This would provide increased cashflow in the short term. The $5,000 threshold would apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2020 only while the $1,000 threshold would apply for property purchased on or after 17 March 2021. Example 2: Increase in the low-value asset write-off threshold Capes Comics Limited (Capes) is a comic store that sells comics and comic-related merchandise. The store’s owner, Clark, wants to expand by investing in two new display cabinets worth $4,600 in total. Clark believes that this will increase his sales of high-value action figures. However, with the COVID-19 restrictions, he is anxious about investing $4,600, especially given that he can only deduct the cost of the cabinets over time through tax depreciation (rather than immediately). The Government’s proposed change to the low-value asset write-off threshold would mean that Capes can claim an immediate deduction for the cost of the cabinets. This would allow Capes to reduce its tax paid this year by $1,288 (28% of $4,600), instead of that amount being spread over a number of years. Background Since 2005, the threshold value in section EE 38(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for low- value asset write-offs has been $500. Assets costing up to this threshold can be immediately expensed, which provides all of the tax benefit in the year the asset was purchased. 17 For example, capital expenditure on property that cost $2,000 exceeds the low-value asset write-off threshold and so must be depreciated over a number of years. Expenditure on an asset costing $300, however, can be immediately deducted so that all of the tax benefit is generated in the year of purchase, even if the asset lasts much longer than one year. 18 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS – BROADER ACCESS TO REFUNDS (Clauses 15, 16, 37 and 38) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment brings forward the application date of broader refundability rules, so that these can apply from the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2019–20 income year. Key features The proposed amendment changes the rules for R&D tax credit refunds to make refundable credits more accessible for businesses. It does this by bringing forward the application date of broader refundability rules to the 2019–20 income year (year one of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). These rules would otherwise have applied from the 2020–21 income year (year two of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme). Limited refundability rules currently apply in the 2019–20 income year (year one rules), which only allow businesses who meet certain corporate eligibility and R&D wage intensity criteria to access refundable credits. A $255,000 cap applies to limit the total amount of credits that can be refunded. Broader refundability rules apply from the 2020–21 income year (year two rules). These rules remove the corporate eligibility and R&D wage intensity criteria, and replace the $255,000 cap with a cap based on labour-related taxes. The year two rules are aimed at enabling more businesses to access R&D tax credit refunds, and would also enable more of these businesses to access greater amounts of refundable credits. The proposed amendment would shift the application date of the year two broader refundability rules, so that these apply one year early (from the 2019–20 income year). It is proposed that the broader refundability rules would apply by default to all claimants in the 2019–20 income year. Businesses would have the option of using the year one limited refundability rules if they prefer. When filing an R&D supplementary return, each business would be asked to confirm which set of refundability rules they intend to apply to their claim. From the 2020–21 income year onwards, all businesses would have to use the year two broader refundability rules. Background COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to all businesses in New Zealand. There is a significant risk that this disruption could cause many R&D-performing businesses in New Zealand to reduce or stop their R&D. While ceasing R&D saves businesses money now, it 19 means some New Zealanders would lose their jobs, fewer innovative products would be developed, and there would be a deeper and more protracted decline in economic activity. This weakens our economy’s ability to recover once the global economy has stabilised. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced an R&D Tax Incentive regime from the 2019–20 income year (year one). The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes, so there was insufficient time to develop comprehensive refundability rules before the legislation was enacted. As a consequence, in year one of the Incentive, limited refundability rules (based on another R&D scheme, the R&D Tax Loss Credit) were put in place to provide refundable credits for a small portion of eligible R&D tax credit claimants. The Government reviewed the R&D Tax Incentive’s refundability rules in 2019 and developed some new, broader refundability rules. The year two rules were put into place by the recently enacted Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, and apply from the 2020–21 income year (year two). To provide cash to businesses now and encourage them to continue with their R&D despite COVID-19, this proposed amendment would bring the application date of the broader year two refundability rules forward. Instead of applying from the 2020–21 income year, the year two rules would apply from the 2019–20 income year. This would enable more businesses to access refundable R&D tax credits, and would provide some businesses with larger refunds than they would have obtained under the existing year one limited refundability rules. Detailed analysis The proposal brings forward the application date for the broader refundability rules introduced in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020. Instead of applying from the 2020–21 income year, these new rules would apply from the 2019–20 income year. The broader refundability rules (default option) It is proposed that broader refundability rules would apply from the 2019–20 income year, and would apply by default unless a business chooses to apply the limited refundability rules in section LZ 14 (section LA 5 (4B), (5B), (5C), and (5D)). A loss-making business can be eligible for R&D tax credit refunds provided it is eligible for the credit more generally. It can obtain R&D tax credit refunds up to a labour-related tax cap. The cap is made up of any labour-related taxes (PAYE, ESCT, and FBT): • paid by the business; and • paid by companies the business is controlled by or which sit within the same wholly- owned group, if these companies have allocated amounts to the business for the purposes of the cap. No cap applies to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy bodies, or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. Note that it is proposed that the “transitional 2020–21 amount” portion of the refundability cap formula (see section 101 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial 20 Matters) Act 2020) would be deleted. The “transitional 2020–21 amount” is not needed if this proposed amendment is passed, because businesses would be able to apply the year two broader refundability rules if they provide a better outcome for them in the 2019–20 income year. The limited refundability rules Proposed new section LZ 14 sets out the limited refundability rules, which businesses can choose to apply instead of the broader refundability rules if they prefer. A business can obtain R&D tax credit refunds under the limited refundability rules, provided it is a company and: • is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the 2019–20 income year; • satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and MX 3; • does not derive exempt income, and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income; • is not a listed company, and is not associated with a listed company; and • does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the business’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is the equivalent of $1.7 million of eligible expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the 2020–21 income year if the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Choosing between the year one and year two refundability rules Businesses would have the option of applying the existing year one limited refundability rules in the 2019–20 income year if they prefer (proposed new section LZ 14). Businesses may choose to use the limited refundability rules or the broader refundability rules in the 2019–20 income year, but they cannot use both. Only the broader refundability rules would be available from the 2020–21 income year. Example 3: Applying the broader refundability rules Moppy’s Chicken Factory (“Moppy”) has brought forward tax losses from the 2018–19 income year. It claims R&D tax credits in the 2019-20 income year, but does not have enough income tax to pay to use all of its credits. Moppy determines that it will be able to receive more refundable R&D tax credits if it applies the broader refundability rules, because it has $500,000 of surplus R&D tax credits and has paid $500,000 of PAYE in the 2019-20 income year (so its refundability cap is $500,000). Moppy files its income tax and R&D supplementary returns soon after 31 March 2020. It advises Inland Revenue that it would like to apply the broader refundability rules. Inland Revenue processes Moppy’s claim and refunds Moppy $500,000 of R&D tax credits. 21 Tax administration 23 USE OF MONEY INTEREST REMISSION (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment Use of money interest (UOMI) is charged when a taxpayer fails to make a payment of tax on time. There are some legislative mechanisms that allow UOMI to be remitted, however, these are not fit for purpose to respond to the nature of the economic shock caused by COVID-19. The proposal would allow the Inland Revenue to remit interest on a late payment if the taxpayer’s ability to make the payment on time was significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. This would include both when a taxpayer is physically unable to make a tax payment on time and when a taxpayer is financially unable to make a tax payment on time because of the economic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on the date of enactment of the Bill (the date on which it received the Royal assent). However, the amendment would give the Commissioner the ability to remit interest that has accrued on tax payments due on or after 14 February 2020. The proposed ability for the Commissioner to remit interest related to COVID-19 would expire 24 months after the enactment date unless extended by an Order in Council. Key features Interest remission The proposal would add new section 183ABAB to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section would allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) to remit use of money interest if a taxpayer’s ability to make a tax payment on time is significantly adversely affected by an outbreak of COVID-19. This would include both where a taxpayer has been physically unable to make a payment on time, for example, because they have been quarantined, and where a taxpayer lacks the financial means to make a payment on time because of the economic impacts of COVID-19. The Commissioner’s discretion to remit interest would only apply to interest that has accrued on tax payments due on or after 14 February 2020. For the Commissioner to remit interest the taxpayer must ask the Commissioner to remit the interest and the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has asked for the relief as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax as soon as practicable. The interest would not be remitted until the core tax debt has been paid. Inland Revenue is developing guidance on when a taxpayer would be considered eligible for interest to be remitted and this would be published following the Bill being enacted. 24 Preliminary guidance is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19-novel- coronavirus/tax-relief/uomi Sunset provision The Commissioner’s ability to remit interest would only apply for 24 months following the enactment date. However, this period would be able to be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. This Order in Council would need to be made within the initial 24 months during which the Commissioner can remit interest. The extension to the time limit would expire after the period given by the order or 6 months after the order came into force if the order did not specify a time limit. However, the time limit could be extended further by subsequent Orders in Council so long as they are made before the date on which the preceding order would expire. In recommending the making of an Order in Council, the Minister of Revenue would need to be satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the expiry of the time limit. As such, it is unlikely that the time limit would be able to be extended by Order in Council once the COVID-19 outbreak has concluded. Background The purpose of UOMI is to compensate the Government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue, including income tax and GST. UOMI also applies to underpayments of tax that are withheld at source, such as PAYE and RWT. UOMI also applies to Working for Families debt. In certain circumstances the Commissioner may remit UOMI on a late tax payment. For the remission of interest in response to emergency events, the current rules provide for an Order in Council process to allow the Commissioner to remit UOMI where a taxpayer is “physically prevented” from making a payment. However, the Commissioner cannot remit interest for a taxpayer that is financially unable to make a payment on time because of the emergency event. The current rules around remitting UOMI in emergency events are directed at situations or events where public safety is of paramount concern because of the risk of injury or death, typically due to a natural disaster. However, the current statutory framework is not fit for purpose to respond to the nature of the economic shock of COVID-19 where a taxpayer may be financially unable to pay their tax on time. 25 INFORMATION SHARING (Clauses 32 and 34) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow Inland Revenue to share taxpayer information with other government departments to assist the efficient and effective delivery of the Government’s COVID-19 response. The amendment would only apply for up to two years. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of announcement of the change, being 17 March 2020. The amendment would apply for a period of two years only unless extended by an Order in Council. This would allow the Government to continue sharing information, if required, in response to COVID-19 after the two-year period. Key features The proposed amendments would allow Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies in order to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. This proposal would be targeted, time limited, and only used when existing legislative provisions are not adequate to share information. The other agencies Inland Revenue would share information about persons or entities with are Government departments, the New Zealand Police, ACC, and Kāinga Ora. The information would only be shared for the purpose of enabling those agencies to provide assistance to individuals and businesses, f ulfil any obligation or function, or exercise any power in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The information shared would not be available for use in administering other assistance not related to C OVID-19. The information that could be shared would be both individual and non- individual information and may include, but is not limited to, identifying information, contact and location information, financial information, and family information. The provision would also enable information to be shared to enable the government agency to undertake co mpliance activity related to that COVID-19 assistance. An example of where the information could be provided is to assist in determining entitlement to any temporary income assistance package or the auditing of an y assistance claims to counter fraud. Currently, tax legislation requires those persons who have access to taxpayer information to keep that information confidential and not disclose or use it for a purpose other than that for which it was provided. This requirement would also apply to the proposed information sharing provision to assist the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. As a safeguard, Inland Revenue would retain a discretion as to whether to share information and sharing would only occur where the information is readily available, it is r easonable and practicable to share, and it is not undesirable to share the information. 26 Background Currently, tax legislation requires Inland Revenue staff to keep taxpayer information confidential unless a specific legislative exception authorises the disclosure. There are a number of exceptions in the tax legislation enabling Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies. These existing exceptions will be used, where possible, to share information with other agencies to assist in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there may be situations where, as a result of the outbreak, it is desirable for Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies with which Inland Revenue does not have any existing arrangements or where the existing arrangements are not flexible enough to allow the required sharing to occur. A similar provision to the one outlined in the Bill applied during the Canterbury earthquake and allowed Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies as part of the government’s response to the Earthquake. The proposed amendment is modelled on that provision. 27 Social assistance 29 REMOVAL OF HOURS TEST FROM THE IN-WORK TAX CREDIT (Clauses 17, 19, 20, and 29(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The In-Work Tax Credit is an income-tested cash payment to working families with children of $3,770 per year (plus an additional $780 per child for 4 th and subsequent children). This amendment would remove the requirement for recipient families to normally be working at least 20 hours per week as a sole parent or a combined 30 hours per week as a couple. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 July 2020. Key features The removal of the hours-test would allow families that work variable hours or less than the required 20 (sole) or 30 (coupled) hours per week to receive the In-Work Tax Credit. The remaining eligibility criteria for the In-Work Tax Credit would remain unchanged. Therefore, recipient families must still be deriving income and cannot be receiving an income-tested benefit or student allowance, as per the existing requirements. Background The effect of this proposed change would be to allow all Working for Families recipients that have income from employment and do not receive an income-tested benefit or student allowance to receive the In-Work Tax Credit, regardless of the number of hours they work. Currently, families that work a fluctuating number of hours from week to week or are unable to increase their hours of work do not receive the In-Work Tax Credit for weeks that they do not work 20 (sole) or 30 (coupled) hours. 30 WINTER ENERGY PAYMENT (Clause 36) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment would reduce the rates of winter energy payment back to $450 for single people with no dependent children (down from $900) and $700 for couples or single people with dependent children (down from $1,400). Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 May 2021. Key features The proposed amendment would ensure that the doubling of the winter energy payment rates for 2020 as part of the COVID-19 Recovery Package are only temporary. It would reduce the rates back to $450 and $700 for the 2021 winter period. Background As part of Phase One of the Recovery Package in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Government agreed that the annual rates of WEP payments for 2020 would be $900 for single people with no dependent children, and $1,400 for couples or single people with dependent children. The increase is double the normal rate and is only intended to be temporary. Single people would receive $40.91 each week, and couples would receive $63.64 each week for the 2020 winter period (1 May to 1 October), these rates would be reduced back to their previous levels for the 2021 winter period. The temporary WEP increase provides further support to beneficiaries and superannuitants to help cover their heating costs this winter. It is estimated that around 850,000 WEP recipients would benefit from the proposal to temporarily double the WEP rates. If partners of recipients are included, over one million people are expected to benefit. 31 WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS ENTITLEMENT FOR EMERGENCY BENEFIT RECIPIENTS (Clause 18) Summary of proposed amendment The proposal would allow people on a temporary visa who wouldn’t otherwise meet the Working for Families (WFF) residency criteria, to qualify for WFF, if the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has granted them an emergency benefit. This would ensure that people on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit would qualify for the same WFF components as other beneficiaries. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features If MSD grant an emergency benefit, to a person on temporary visa, that person would be able to qualify for the same WFF payment as other beneficiaries. That is, they could qualify for family tax credit and Best Start. They would not qualify for the In- Work Tax Credit or minimum family tax credit because these payments are not available to a person who is in receipt of a main benefit. Background Currently, emergency benefit recipients with dependent children and who are on a temporary visa, do not qualify for WFF tax credits. This is because they do not meet the residency criteria for WFF. The result is a difference in the financial support that these families can access, compared with other main benefit recipients with children. In general, to receive a main benefit (including an emergency benefit) a person must be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and have resided in New Zealand for at least two years since becoming a citizen or resident. However, MSD has discretion to grant an Emergency Benefit in other circumstances 1 when those residency criteria are not met. The WFF legislation does not contain any comparable discretion. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child or the parent. The WFF residency requirements can be met by the child if: • the child is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • is present in New Zealand for the period of entitlement. 1 These circumstances can include not being eligible for another benefit, that they are in hardship and unable to earn a sufficient livelihood. 32 The WFF residency requirements can be met by the parent if: • the parent is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and • has been in New Zealand for 12 months continuously at any time. Those on a temporary visa are specifically excluded from the definition of New Zealand resident for WFF. This exclusion was intended to prevent short-term visitors from accessing WFF. It was not intended to prevent those in exceptional circumstances from accessing WFF. The proposed amendment would ensure that families on a temporary visa who are granted an emergency benefit are able to access a comparable level of financial support to other recipients of main benefits. 33 GST ON COVID-19 RELATED SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS (Clause 35) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment ensures that COVID-19 Leave Payment and the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy (the payments) which were paid between 17 March 2020 and 23 March 2020 are not subject to GST. The amendment is necessary because the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Amendment Order 2020 (the 2020 Order) came into force on 24 March 2020. This Order added the payments to the schedule of non-taxable grants and subsidies in the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992, however, it did not have retrospective effect. This means that the payments are only non-taxable from 24 March 2020, which is not the intent. Proposed section 89 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ensures that payments made between 17 March 2020 and 24 March 2020 are non-taxable grants and subsidies for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for the period between the Government’s announcement of the payments and the commencement of the 2020 Order. This means that recipients of the payments would not need to return GST on them, irrespective of when they were received. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on the day the Bill is enacted, and would apply retrospectively from 17 March 2020.

This would apply to annual personal income that exceeds $180,000. The Bill would also amend other tax rules to ensure that the proposed new top personal tax rate would apply consistently across the personal tax system. The Government’s objective for this Bill is to raise revenue to allow the Government to continue providing public services while supporting New Zealand’s economic recovery (a revenue objective), in a way that increases the progressivity of the tax system (a distributional objective). The Bill would clarify the legislation to ensure that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) can collect information for tax policy purposes. It would also introduce a rule to allow for the collection of information from trustees to assess compliance with the 39% rate and to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees. The Bill would also set the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) threshold for the 2020–21 and later tax years. Introducing a new top personal income tax rate and other consequential changes A number of tax rules are being amended to incorporate the proposed new top 39% personal income tax rate, including: • PAYE rules • fringe benefit tax (FBT) • resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest • employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) • residential land withholding tax (RLWT) • retirement savings contribution tax (RSCT), and • the taxable Māori authority distributions non-declaration rate. The consequential changes to the PAYE rules, FBT, ESCT, RLWT, RSCT and the Māori authority distributions non- declaration rate would apply from 1 April 2021. The higher RWT rate on interest would take effect from 1 October 2021 to ensure that interest payers are able to implement the required systems changes. Information-gathering measures The Bill includes two proposed information-gathering measures: • increased information required on trustee annual returns from the 2021–22 income year (including the ability for the Commissioner to request this for some prior years), and • clarifying the information-gathering powers of the Commissioner. 8 These measures would ensure that the Commissioner has access to the information required to provide high quality tax advice. Minimum family tax credit The minimum family tax credit (MFTC) is a mechanism of government support for low- income families. It provides assistance to low-income families, to ensure they are better off in the workforce than being on a benefit. From 1 April 2020, main benefit payments were increased by $25 per week, but adjustments to the MFTC were not made. The proposed amendments would retrospectively increase the MFTC threshold for the 2020–21 tax year to $29,432 per ($566 per week), a $32 per week increase. 9 Introducing a new top personal income tax rate 11 INTRODUCING A NEW TOP PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATE (Clauses 5 – 31) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would introduce a new top personal income tax rate of 39% on annual income exceeding $180,000. The proposed new statutory income tax rates for individuals would be: Taxable income Tax rate $0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 30% $70,001 – $180,000 33% $180,001 upwards 39% The Bill proposes to amend a number of tax rules to incorporate the proposed new 39% personal income tax rate, including: • the PAYE rules • fringe benefit tax (FBT) • resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest • employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) • residential land withholding tax (RLWT) • retirement savings contribution tax (RSCT), and • the taxable Māori authority distributions non-declaration rate. Application date The proposed new top personal rate of 39% would apply for the 2021–22 and later income years. For most taxpayers the 2021–22 income year starts on 1 April 2021. Consequential changes to taxes that apply on a transaction basis would largely apply from 1 April 2021. The proposed changes to the PAYE rules, FBT, ESCT, RLWT, RSCT and the Māori authority distributions non-declaration rate would apply from 1 April 2021. An exception is the new proposed RWT rate on interest, which would apply from 1 October 2021. Key features The Bill introduces a proposed new top personal income tax rate of 39% for the 2021–22 and later income years. The proposed amendment would apply to annual income in excess of $180,000. 12 The Bill also proposes amendments to other basic tax rules to ensure the proposed new rate is applied consistently on all types of personal income. These consequential changes would generally apply from 1 April 2021, with the exception of a proposed new RWT rate on interest, which would apply from 1 October 2021. Background New Zealand’s personal income tax rates are progressive. The greater a person’s taxable income, the higher the proportion that is taxed. Currently, the top personal income tax rate is 33% and applies to the part of a person’s income that exceeds $70,000. The tax rates that apply to personal income differ from the flat tax rates that apply to entities, such as companies. A flat rate means the rate does not increase as income increases. Portfolio investment entities (PIEs), which includes KiwiSaver funds, are subject to a progressive tax scale, but at rates different to those that apply to personal income. Detailed analysis Table 1 in part A of schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the basic income tax rates that apply to personal income. The Bill introduces a new row to accommodate the proposed 39% rate: Row Taxable income Tax rate 1 $0 – $14,000 10.5% 2 $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% 3 $48,001 – $70,000 30% 4 $70,001 – $180,000 33% 5 $180,001 upwards 39% The statutory income tax rates set out the rates at which personal income is taxed in New Zealand. A number of other tax rules are also being amended to reflect the proposed new top personal income tax rate of 39%. Secondary tax codes ( clauses 23, 30, and 31) This Bill would amend the PAYE rules to introduce a proposed new tax code (SA) for secondary-income earners whose total PAYE income payments (total income subject to PAYE) are greater than $180,000. The current top secondary tax code (ST) would still apply for secondary employment earnings for an employee whose total income subject to PAYE is more than $70,000, but would only apply up to $180,000. Where an employee’s total income subject to PAYE is greater than $180,000 the SA new code would apply from 1 April 2021. 13 Tax deduction code Withholding tax rate Who should use this code ST 0.330 For secondary employment earnings for an employee whose total PAYE income payments are more than $70,000 but not more than $180,000. SA 0.390 For secondary employment earnings for an employee whose total PAYE income payments are more than $180,000. Extra pay ( clauses 5, 6, and 24) Lump sums earned in the course of employment (“extra pays”) such as bonuses, back pay, redundancy and retirement payments are generally taxed at the employee’s marginal rate. The Bill introduces a proposed new 39% tax rate on extra pays if a person’s taxable income is expected to exceed $180,000. Fringe benefit tax (clauses 7 – 13, and 17) FBT is paid by employers on non-monetary benefits provided to employees, such as motor vehicles. The rates and thresholds are calculated using the after-tax value of a benefit paid to an employee and takes into account the PAYE which would otherwise been paid had an employee received an equivalent amount as salary or wages instead of the fringe benefit. It is for this reason FBT rates and thresholds differ from the basic personal income tax rates and thresholds. The FBT rate is calculated using the formula: tax rate 1 – tax rate To account for the introduction of the proposed new top personal tax rate of 39%, the Bill would amend table 1, part C of schedule 1 to the Income Tax Act 2007 to introduce a proposed new top FBT rate of 63.93% applying to all-inclusive pay exceeding $129,680. Row Range of dollar in all-inclusive pay New rate 1 $0 – $12,530 0.1173 2 $12,531 – $40,580 0.2121 3 $40,581 – $55,980 0.4286 4 $55,981 – $129,680 0.4925 5 $129,681 upwards 0.6393 Certain parts of the FBT rules refer to the current top FBT rate (49.25%) as well as the current second highest FBT rate (42.86% or 43%). These references would be updated to 63.93% and 49.25% respectively. The proposed FBT changes would apply to fringe benefits provided or granted on, or after, 1 April 2021, for the 2021–22 and later income years. 14 Resident withholding tax rates on interest income for individuals (clauses 19, and 20) The Bill introduces a proposed new RWT rate for individuals who receive interest income. This mirrors the proposed new top personal rate of 39%. Individuals would be able to elect this proposed new rate on interest earned from 1 October 2021. The proposed new RWT rate on interest has a later application date than other proposed amendments in the Bill to ensure that interest payers are able to implement the required systems changes. The non-declaration rate would remain at 45%. This applies if an individual does not give their IRD number to the interest payer. Employer’s superannuation contribution tax (clauses 14, and 18) ESCT applies to superannuation contributions made by a person’s employer. The rates are set at the same rate as basic income tax rates, but only one single ESCT rate applies to the amount of the contribution. The ESCT thresholds are therefore grossed up to minimise the risk that employers’ superannuation contributions are taxed at a higher rate than the rest of an employee’s salary and wages. In most cases, the ESCT rate threshold amount is the amount of salary and wages earned by the employee and their gross employer’s contributions made in the preceding tax year. The Bill would introduce a proposed new ESCT rate of 39% on superannuation contributions made for an employee whose ESCT rate threshold amount exceeds $216,000. The rate of ESCT that applies to the employer’s superannuation contribution would be 39% if the contribution is made for the benefit of one or more past employees or if the employer chooses the rate of 39% and the contribution is made to a defined benefit fund. Residential land withholding tax (clause 15) RLWT applies to sales of residential property by offshore persons made within five years of acquisition. From 1 April 2021, the RLWT rate would be 39%, except for where the vendor is a company. If the vendor is a company, the RLWT rate would remain at the company rate of 28%. Retirement scheme contribution tax ( clauses 22, 25, and 27) A proposed new RSCT rate of 39% would apply where the other rates notified under section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not apply. Taxable Māori authority distributions non-declaration rate (clause 21) Under the Bill, the payment of a taxable Māori authority distribution that is more than $200 where the Māori authority does not have a record of the member’s IRD number would be subject to a tax rate of 39%. The current non-declaration rate is the existing top rate of 33%. The standard rate for a taxable Māori authority distribution is 17.5%, which is not changing. 15 Information-gathering measures 17 INCREASED INFORMATION REQUIRED IN TRUSTEES’ ANNUAL RETURN (Clauses 34, 35, and 38) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to collect more information on income earned by trusts and on the financial positions of trusts, remedying a current deficit in information collected and held by the Commissioner. This additional information would be required from the 2021–22 income year onwards. The Bill also proposes that the Commissioner is able to request this information from certain trustees in relation to the prior seven years. This would support the Commissioner’s ability to assess compliance with the new 39% personal income tax rate. It would also assist the Commissioner in understanding and monitoring the use of structures and entities by trustees. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for trustees’ annual returns for the 2021–22 and later income years. Key features The Bill would introduce a requirement to collect information from trustees about the financial position of trusts as part of a trustee’s tax return. This would include financial information for the trust and information on settlements and distributions relating to the trust. The proposal would apply to trustees of all trusts who have taxable income and therefore are currently required to file a return under section 59(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Proposed section 59BA would replace section 59(3). This proposal would not apply to the following types of trusts: • non-active trusts that are not required to file pursuant to section 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 • charitable trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 • trusts eligible to be a Māori a uthority, or • resident trustees of foreign trusts. The Bill includes the ability for the Commissioner to request information for certain prior years. Background Trustees are already required to provide a return under the Tax Administration Act 1994 where they have derived income for an income year. 18 As part of the return, trustees are required to include information on allocations to beneficiaries and identifying information for the beneficiaries. Some types of trusts, such as trading trusts, already return financial statement summary information. The Bill would expand this current obligation in order to provide Inland Revenue with more information on the use and financial position of trusts, and to remedy the current information deficit. Existing provisions to exempt non-active trusts from the requirement to file would remain unchanged. Detailed analysis Information required to be provided The Bill would require financial accounting information to be provided by trustees on an ongoing basis. This would include: • profit and loss statements • balance sheet items, and • other information to be specified by the Commissioner (for example any transfers to the trust by associated persons). The Commissioner would prescribe additional information relevant to trusts which must be provided as part of the return information, such as loans to or by related parties. Trustees would also be required to provide information on distributions and settlements made during the income year and include that in their return. Distributions For distributions, the information required would include identifying information for beneficiaries such as their name, IRD number and date of birth. This is set out in proposed section 59BA(2)(d). The information required for distributions is similar to the information Inland Revenue collects about beneficiaries as part of the current tax return process, where there is an allocation of income to the beneficiary. The Commissioner may require other information relating to distributions to be reported, which could include, for example, the source of the distribution. Settlements The information required for settlements over the year would include identifying information for settlors such as name, IRD number and date of birth, as well as the amount and nature of each settlement. In addition, it is intended that for the 2021–22 return year, trustees provide names and details of settlors from prior years. This is achieved in proposed section 59BA(2)(c) by requiring details for those settlors whose details have not previously been supplied to the Commissioner. 19 Inland Revenue does not currently collect information on subsequent settlements on a trust. This is an information gap which means that Inland Revenue is not capturing information on the true settlor. This is a key piece of information, as New Zealand has a settlor-based trust taxation regime. Other relevant persons Proposed section 59BA(2)(e) would require trustees to provide information on those with the power under the trust to appoint or dismiss a trustee, to add or remove a beneficiary, or to amend the trust deed. Requiring this information is necessary as “appointers” or those with power to amend the trust deed would not be disclosed otherwise. The reference to the power arising “under the trust” is intended to ensure this does not capture beneficiaries where they have one of the above powers only if all beneficiaries agree. This would form part of a trustee’s annual return requirements and therefore existing penalty provisions would apply as appropriate, if the information is not provided or false information is provided. No additional or specific penalty is proposed. Power for the Commissioner to request the information for prior years The Bill would allow the Commissioner to collect information as part of the increased disclosures for prior years, where such information exists. This is necessary because even if more information is provided going forward, there would still be an information deficit relating to years prior to the 2021–22 income year. This provision is necessary to assist with assessing compliance with the proposed new top personal income tax rate of 39%. Information for income years prior to 2021–22 is expected to assist in understanding and monitoring the changes in the use of structures and entities by trustees in response to the new 39% rate. Rather than requiring prior year information for all trusts, the Commissioner would be able to determine for which trusts the information is likely to be the most useful in order to minimise compliance and administration costs. The Commissioner must notify a trustee if they are required to provide prior year information. This provision would be limited to the prior seven years to align with record keeping rules. However, it is recognised that record keeping rules would not necessarily have applied for the requested information. Proposed section 59BAB(1)(c) makes it clear that trustees are only required to provide the requested information if it is within the knowledge, possession or control of the trustee. While this would not form part of a return, it would be information required to be provided to the Commissioner under tax law. Exempt trusts The proposed provisions would not apply to certain types of trusts: • Non-active trusts are automatically carved out as they are not required to file a trust return pursuant to section 43B. 20 • Charitable trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are also not required to file a return of income. In addition, many of these trusts are registered with the Charities Services which has its own set of reporting requirements. • Trusts eligible to be a Māori authority under section HF 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, this includes Māori land trusts constituted under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. • Resident trustees of foreign trusts, as they already provide information to Inland Revenue as part of the foreign trust disclosure rules. 21 CLARIFYING THE INFORMATION-GATHERING POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill clarifies that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers include being able to require persons to provide information solely for the purpose of tax policy development. This would be achieved by inserting new section 17GB into the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date the Act comes into force, which will be the date it is enacted. Key features The Bill inserts proposed new section 17GB into the Tax Administration Act 1994, to clarify that the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers extend to requiring information for the purpose of tax policy development. Proposed new section 17GB provides that the Commissioner may require information to be provided for the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system. The wording is similar to that used in section 18D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “tax system” is intended to include social policy products administered by the Commissioner. Background Existing section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with the ability to requisition information where the information is required under the Inland Revenue Acts or the information is required for any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. The proposal in the Bill would remove any uncertainty that the Commissioner can require persons to provide information solely for tax policy development purposes, by inserting a new express power, proposed new section 17GB. Having access to information is critical to providing good tax policy advice. 23 Minimum family tax credit 25 MINIMUM FAMILY TAX CREDIT (Clause 37) Summary of proposed amendment The minimum family tax credit (MFTC) is a payment to low-income working families. The purpose of the MFTC is to ensure that the incomes of families who work full-time (defined as 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and do not receive a benefit are always higher than what their income would be if they continued to receive a benefit. The proposed amendments would increase the MFTC threshold for the 2020–21 tax year to $29,432 per annum ($566 per week) from $27,768 per annum ($534 per week). Application date As the MFTC is an annualised credit, the proposed 2020–21 MFTC threshold would apply retrospectively from the start of the current tax year ( 1 April 2020). Key features The proposed increase to the 2020–21 MFTC threshold reflects the $25 increase to benefits made in March 2020 in response to COVID-19. Due to timing pressures, the MFTC threshold was not updated at the time of this change. The proposed change would increase the 2020–21 MFTC threshold to $29,432 ($566 per week). The proposed increase to the 2020–21 MFTC threshold would provide an additional $32 to families in each week that they receive the MFTC in the 2020–21 tax year. Inland Revenue administrative data suggests approximately 3,600 families would benefit. Background In response to COVID-19, main benefits were increased by $25 per week from 1 April 2020. Due to timing pressures, the MFTC threshold was not updated at the time of this change. The MFTC is now being adjusted retrospectively to reflect the $25 increase to main benefits. The MFTC threshold is set above the maximum income a two-parent family could receive on a benefit. It is therefore sensitive to changes that impact how much income a family can receive on a benefit, such as benefit rates, benefit abatement thresholds and the minimum wage. The MFTC threshold has been adjusted each year since 2006 to reflect changes to these settings.
