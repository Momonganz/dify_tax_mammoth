SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP 27 APRIL 2017 Submitter – Andrew Riddell Some Important Principles To Consider 1.In this submission I set out what I consider are some important principles to consider when looking at any tax. In this submission I use “tax” in a wider sense that includes user charges for public services, unless the context suggests otherwise. 2.Specific taxes I consider and comment on are income tax, wealth tax (including land tax), goods and services tax and taxing environmental externalities. I do not comment in any detail on company or trust tax as I am not familiar with the fine details of these. However the principles I identify in this submission can be applied to the consideration of company and trust taxes. 3.I do not consider local government taxes, although it is clear that there should be a degree of integration with central government taxation and, possibly, collection. 4.I also point to an important link between the social security system and the tax system. Principle 1 – NZ is a monetarily sovereign nation 5.The first principle is that a country such as New Zealand does not need to depend on tax income, borrowing and other income to meet its expenses. 1 The New Zealand Government can always meet its financial obligations so long as those obligations are in $NZ. 6.The reason for this is that New Zealand is a monetarily sovereign nation, with the government issuing its own currency and operating a foating exchange rate. 2 This allows the government to meet its expenses by spending money into existence. 7.The significant limit on public spending thus changes from the commonly perceived need to balance spending against income 3 to ensuring that the money supply is sufcient for the economy to operate at a full employment of resources level 4 . 1 This statement applies to central government finances. Local government, not being a currency issuer, is still subject to the need for expenditure to be balanced against income. The same need to balance income and expenditure applies to countries using the Euro. 2 This proposition is fully developed in modern monetary theory. Modern monetary theory is based how monetary relations changed after most nations went of the gold standard and adopted foating exchange rate regimes. 3 Income being, broadly, taxes, borrowing and revenue from public enterprises. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 1 of 6 \[1\] 8.An implication of this principle is that the purposes of tax become: ▪to control the money supply and infation; ▪income redistribution; and ▪discourage “bads” and/or encourage “goods”. 5 9.Any central revenue gathering via borrowing from private sources is not an essential funding source to fund public activities, given the intrinsic capability of the government to issue $NZ. Government borrowing can however assist with control of infation, as it removes currency from circulation. 10.Another consequence for the Tax Working Group should consider with respect to this principle is the inconsistency with the principles of responsible fiscal management set out in section 26G of the Public Finance Act. Principle 2 – Fairness and Simplicity 11.Most people will agree that a tax system needs to be fair and simple. 12.Our current tax system is, especially the PAYE and GST systems, simple to understand and to comply with. 6 The IRD web site helps with this simplicity. Retaining that simplicity is important to public acceptance of taxes. 13.The perception that a tax system is fair is also importance. When a tax system is not seen as fair and simple there are compliance issues. 14.There is unfairness and inconsistency in the current tax system, especially with regard to the taxing of wealth and capital gains, a trend over the past few decades of increased regressiveness in the tax system, the diferent treatment of interest on savings v other investments, and in the treatment of trusts and companies compared to wage earners. This is discussed further later in this submission. Principle 3 – Tax and Social Security Need to be Integrated 15.The government operates a social security system which relies on the income tax system to provide an element of targetting. 16.Working for Families is the prime current example of this. There are issues with abatement rates for this system which I leave to other submitters to address. 17.The important point is that any review of the tax system needs to include consideration of how the tax system, especially the income tax system, can be integrated with, and help achieve the intent of, our social security system in a simple and efcient manner. 4Full employment as used here includes no underemployment and no structural or cyclical unemployment, but does include frictional unemployment. The full employment level for natural resources is, for renewables, the sustainable maximum rate of use. For non-renewables it has to be a minimum level of use. 5This can include explicitly linking a tax or charge to a particular spending programme (e.g. linking a fuel tax to transport spending) to help develop public acceptance of the tax. 6I pick up this point further under the discussion of universal v targetted taxes. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 2 of 6 18.Further comment is made on this under the discussion on universal v targetted taxes. 19.One example of the way social and security and income tax can be better integrated arises with superannuation. Superannuation is a universal payment to all aged 65 years or more. There is no means testing, which is a strength of this system. There is targetting of people who continue earning income and receive superannuation via the current income tax bands. This is significantly more efcient and simpler, administratively, than any means testing. There is a strong case to be made, however, for a special income tax code, with a higher abatement rate, for working people receiving superannuation. This would avoid the demeaning and bureaucratic means testing for superannuation, while taking advantage of the simple and efcient income tax collection system we have, in a way that integrates tax and social security. Principle 4 – Income and Wealth 20.As stated earlier in this submission, one of the purposes of a tax system is income redistribution. A more equitable income distribution benefits society and the economy for several reasons, including social stability, reduced social security needs, a better fed, healthier, clothed and educated work force, reduced environmental impacts, and increased spending in the economy. 21.These social benefits do not arise only from more equitable income distribution. Less concentration of wealth is also important to a functioning society. Important socially- desirable results of less concentration of wealth is increased social mobility and more secure housing. 22.Currently the tax system does not, with some specific exceptions, tax either wealth or capital gain. The disincentive this causes for investment is well recorded. 23.What is needed is a consistent and universally applying system of taxing wealth as well as income to provide the income redistribution and investment benefits identified above. 24.The current income tax system, but more progressive, will achieve these benefits with respect to income. 25.There are main avenues for address the taxing wealth – a tax on capital gains, or a tax on wealth, or a land/resource tax. 26.The assumption behind a capital gains tax is that wealth increases through income which is already taxed, and from capital gains which, by and large, are not taxed. A capital gains tax would take at least a decade to have reasonably full efect as capital gains are episodic. It also introduces a significant financial record keeping complexity to which is presently a fairly simple overall tax system. 27.An annual tax on wealth has immediate efect, and provides a strong incentive to use wealth productively. There would be an initial major exercise for all taxpayers recording the current level of taxable wealth if a wealth tax is introduced. After that initial exercise, however, the administrative overhead can be expected to greatly reduce as only the annual changes in wealth would need to be recorded. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 3 of 6 28.A tax on wealth could also take the form of death duties, a system that has been used in New Zealand previously. This is a tax that would apply randomly, may be perceived as an unfair tax, and does not act as a constant incentive in favour of investment in the same as an annual wealth tax. 29.The simplest wealth tax to administer would be a land tax, possibly extended to apply to other selected natural resources. The infrastructure to implement such a tax already exists with our land valuation system used in local government rating systems. It is based on the assumption that a land tax, coupled with an income/company tax system, is an efective proxy for all wealth. 30.Any wealth tax will need to consider the benefits and disbenefits of a progressive wealth tax, what would be included as taxable wealth (for example should a family home be excluded? a family home below some value?), whether a land tax should be set at a diferent rate for extensive land uses such as pastoral faming v intensive land uses, ensuring people cannot hide behind trust or company structures, whether a wealth tax based on land should include other natural resources, and, importantly, the relationship between income/company tax and a wealth tax, and whether the introduction of a wealth tax, of whatever form, should be roughly revenue neutral when considered in conjunction with current income and goods and services and company tax. 31.A wealth tax in the form of a progressive annual land tax based on unimproved land value, that is roughly revenue neutral when considered in conjunction with income and company tax, appears to be the most efcient and fair system which would help with the income redistribution and the encouraging goods (in this case productive investment) purposes of our tax system. The progressiveness of such a land tax provides the means to address the issues of cash poor-asset rich and to provide a level of exemption for a family home. Fairness considerations would also suggest that there should be several classes of land tax, refecting the development potential of land as provided for in the relevant district plan 7 and in order to capture betterment. The administration is simpler because of it would be based on the same information as is used for local government rates, and it would be cover all landowners, whether individuals, trusts or companies. 32.Relying solely on a land tax to address wealth inequality is based on an assumption that it would serve as an adequate proxy for all wealth. If that assumption is not supported then further wealth taxes would need to be considered. Principle 5 – Universal v Targetted 33.In general, a universal approach to taxes is to be preferred as it makes the tax system much simpler and reduces the opportunity for loopholes to be exploited. 34.Where targetting is considered necessary, a general principle to apply is to apply the targetting at the specific stage of the payment and tax process which is administratively simpler. 8 7A classification could be, for example, to set diferent rates for rural, urban residential (low, medium and high density), urban commercial and mixed, urban industrial, based on the type and level of development provided for in the relevant district plan. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 4 of 6 35.This includes considering the administrative impact on the taxpayer. A system that requires means testing can be, in my experience, very stressful and demeaning for a taxpayer. 36.I have discussed means testing of superannuation payments earlier in this submission, and concluded that the administratively simpler approach to this is to apply a universal payment principle to the payment of superannuation, and to introduce a specific individual tax code to abate superannuation payments at a greater rate where there is additional income. This avoids the need for an administratively complex means testing system while taking advantage of the universal and relatively simple nature of our income tax system. Principle 6 – Regressive v Progressive 37.The fundamental principle to apply with respect to whether to apply a regressive or a progressive tax is that there should be a strong preference for progressiveness with any tax. This is an approach that is fair, and, in so far as it assists in reducing inequality, will have a beneficial approach to all of society. 38. The main tax that is regressive is goods and services tax. Goods and services tax does have the benefit that it is paid by all. 9 39.My submission on this tax is that the rate of goods and services tax should be reduced (to its original 10% rate) in conjunction with a new wealth tax as part of a roughly revenue neutral exercise. 40.My submission is also that income tax should be more progressive than it is now. The benefits of a progressive income tax in terms of helping reduce inequality, increase if the income tax system is made more progressive. 41.Increased progression in the income tax system could occur by reducing the tax levels for lower income earners, or by increasing the tax levels for higher income earners. 42.Attention also needs to be given to how to overcome the practice of using trust and/or company structures income liable for income tax is understated. The same income and wealth tax rates applying to trusts would remove that loophole 10 . 43.Whether income and wealth taxes should apply to company revenue is a more complicated consideration, discussed in the next section of this submission. Principle 7 – Economy v Environment – Taxing Bads 44.The economy is a social construct that can only exist within, and which depends on, the wider natural environment. However environmental costs are, by and large, an externality which has lead to significant environmental impacts, including climate change. 8Establishing the administratively simpler system where there is a targetting intention will require considering the payment and collection components of the revenue. This may mean deciding whether it is administratively simpler to have one government department undertaking a universal payment system, and a second government department applying some sirt of progressive targetting of that income. 9Although taxpayers can and do use a company structure to avoid paying goods and services tax on their expenditure. 10Coupled with public beneficial owner disclosure for trusts. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 5 of 6 45.A further role of the tax system is to put a price on that externality, to encourage a shift from environmentally damaging behaviour. 46.My submission is that a shift to taxing environmental bads is to be encouraged. It would make sense to link this to some reduction in company taxation 11 , and in income tax levels for lower income people so as to provide the means to shift away from environmentally adverse behaviour. 47.More design work is required on which bads can readily be taxed, the impacts of diferent rates of tax, and the extent to which any 'bads' tax should be set against reduced company and/or income tax, before it is possible to comment further 48.Conclusion -- Some Suggested Tax Changes 49.In my submission I discuss tax, particularly income and wealth tax, goods and services tax and taxing 'bads' using a framework of seven principles to apply: ◦New Zealand is a monetarily sovereign; ◦a tax system should be fair and simple; ◦tax and social security need to be integrated; ◦both income and wealth should be taxed; ◦universally applied taxes are to be preferred over targetted taxes in most cases; ◦the tax system should be progressive, not regressive; and ◦environmental 'bads' should be taxed. 50.I suggest the following specific changes be considered to the tax system: ◦keep superannuation as a universal payment, any targetting should be by a specific income tax code for superannuatants; ◦introduce a wealth tax based on unimproved land value, with consideration to the tax being progressive and refecting the level of development each property has under the relevant district plan; ◦make income tax more progressive, and reduce it so that the combination of a new wealth tax and goods and services tax and income tax is roughly revenue neutral; ◦reduce goods and services tax back to 10%; and ◦agree in principle with a taxes on environmental 'bads' with the revenue raised in from this group of taxes used to reduce income tax for lower income people and to reduce company tax. 51.I am happy to discuss this submission further if the Tax Working Group wants to do so. Andrew Riddell 11A radical approach would be to replace company taxation with environmental and betterment taxes. A Riddell Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018, page 6 of 6

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax Anders Crofoot The Purpose of Tax Tax should be used to fund things that the Government does. The Government needs to be careful and not over reach and provide services that could be done by the private sector. The Government should provide things that no other entity can, Law/Regulation, Police, Defense, Health, Education and Social Safety Net. Tax is a very blunt tool and as such is not appropriate to try and fine tune people’s behavior. What We Tax Having emigrated to NZ from the USA I have been very impressed with the NZ tax system. It is simple and efficient. I think the current settings are about right. Can Tax Make Housing More Affordable? In a word, no. The reasons for increasing house prices would be many and complex and they are not unique to NZ. Looking at other countries where there are similar issues and they have different tax settings (capital gains in particular) it isn’t solving the problem. Tax Issues Capital Gains A lack of a capital gains tax was an attraction for emigrating to NZ from the USA. The experience of having lived and paid tax in the USA showed that a capital gains tax is very good business for accountants and lawyers who can help those who can afford them structure their affairs in ways that minimise the tax. Additionally, dislike for paying tax causes distortions and decisions are made based on tax rather than other economic considerations. NZ does have a usable capital gains tax policy that has good logic to it, if you are a trader then those capital gains should be treated as income, so greater efforts could be made in appropriate collection from some who may be avoiding the tax. I would not support expanding the capital gains tax. Land Tax A land tax while possibly administratively simply is fraught with inequities as the value of land has little connection with ability to pay. In fact for some environmental outcomes it could drive quite perverse incentives, where open space is desired, if it is taxed there will be incentives to intensify and develop. I would not support a land tax. \[1\] Progressive Company Tax This would seem to just be a complication in the tax system as the majority of NZ companies are small. It could well be a perverse incentive to grow a company. I would not support a progressive company tax. Environmental Tax Tax is a very blunt tool and environmental issues are not simple. Regulatory rules can be more finely tuned and would seem a more appropriate way to address the issues. I would not support an environmental tax unless it could be very finely tuned. GST on Everything The NZ GST system if straightforward due to its relatively few exemptions. If we started to load it up with exemptions with the aim of changing behavior it would add costs and likely have little effect on behavior. Very high excise taxes have not stopped drinking and smoking. I support continuing the existing broad GST the currently exists. I also wish to express my support for the submission put in by Federated Farmers of NZ. I would be happy to be contacted by the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat.

There is a summary below and in the pages that follow, I have set out the more detailed arguments that support these proposals. My submission falls under four headings; • “Fairness” • New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system • Taxes and behaviour • Housing affordability, Capital Gains Tax and Land Tax In summary: “Fairness”. In Chapter 3: “Purposes and principles of a good tax system” you raise the issue of “fairness”. “Fairness” is a recurrent theme throughout your consultation document – and quite rightly so. The concept of fairness is fundamental to any discussion about taxation. Our problem in discussing fairness is that it is too easy to rush to a subjective judgement. We must avoid this, as otherwise we will never get a consensus view on what this cardinal concept actually means in practice. Put another way; unless we can agree on what we mean by “fairness”, we cannot even start the debate about tax reform. It is that important. In the Living Standards Framework, you set out the concepts of horizontal equity and vertical equity – both conceptually simple ideas and both helpful. I would like to add three strictly practical tests that I think are pre-requisites for “fairness”: • Simplicity – can it be easily explained and understood? • Clarity – is it unambiguous? • Practicality – is compliance straightforward? I have fleshed out the arguments behind this summary in Appendix 1 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \[1\] 2 In Chapter 4: “The current New Zealand tax system”, you ask for feedback on two subjects on which I would like to respond. First, on New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system: Yes, I do think that our broad-based, low rate system should be maintained. I think it sends an important message that everyone who earns an income should make a contribution to government, however small, as should everyone who consumes. Our progressive income tax system and low rates mean that we can achieve “vertical equity”, whilst keeping all income-earners and all consumers in the same boat. We should keep to this philosophy Second, on Taxes and behaviour: You ask: “Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?” Here, I want to talk about our behaviour in relation to debt: The factors that influence the choice between debt and equity; how tax policy has shaped the outcome that we see today and how proposed new taxes would impact our preference for debt over equity The fact is that we are drowning in debt – private debt, not Government debt. Data from the Reserve bank of New Zealand shows that household debt has increased from 100% of disposable income in December 1998 to 168% in December 2017. (In contrast, New Zealand Government debt is much lower relative to GDP than most other OECD countries) While a large part of total household debt is mortgage debt on the family home (and therefore, I assume, falls outside the Tax Working Group’s remit), there is still plenty of household debt that is financing investment and other activities – especially investment property. The points that follow relate to household debt other than mortgage debt on the family home. While my focus is on household debt, many of the same arguments apply to corporate debt My contention here is that existing tax policies subsidise debt (by allowing the tax- deductibility of debt interest) and penalise equity capital (by taxing savings income). In doing so, they reinforce an existing bias towards debt that comes out of the relative ease of access to debt capital in today’s market, as compared to equity capital – particularly for individuals. The new proposed capital gains tax, if enacted without changing the existing debt subsidies, will push this bias even further towards favouring debt over against equity. I have summarised this contention in the table that follows 3 Factors that shape our behaviour towards debt vs. equity Factor shaping behaviour Debt/borrowings Equity capital/savings Lead-time needed to access enough to make a “significant” difference Days to weeks Years to decades How to access Pick up the ‘phone/go online /walk into a bank. We are surrounded by offers of debt and by the positive marketing images of the financial sector Requires sustained self-discipline & sacrifice - not spending money earned - to accumulate equity savings Present tax policy Subsidises the cost of debt and as a result, drives up property prices and increases wealth disparity Taxes the income from savings. Proposed capital gains tax, wealth tax Would increase the demand for debt, as CGT reduces the availability of savings. Amplifies the effect of existing tax policy Additional tax on savings is a further disincentive to keep to the discipline of saving Long term impact on society Excess debt risks default, Banks become “too big to fail”. The world’s economy becomes excessively financialised. The next credit crisis will be worse than the last one Excess savings makes default a non-issue. Savings reduce individuals’ dependence on the state in later life. Domestic savings reduce our dependence on foreign debt capital In summary, I would like to propose that the Government should recognise that debt is an addictive product that has simply never been on the radar for these discussions, despite the fact that millions of New Zealanders spend more of their income on it than they do on any of the products that we traditionally regard as “addictive” In contrast, savings (of all kinds, not just “retirement savings”) are the opposite of debt. I suggest that Government should encourage savings to start to wean us off our addiction to debt, rather than add to the tax burden on savers, which will drive us further into debt I have fleshed out the arguments behind this summary in Appendix 2 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 4 Housing affordability, Capital Gains Tax and Land Tax. You ask about these in Chapter 7: Specific challenges. Taking these in turn: On housing affordability: Introducing a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) will not improve housing affordability. Other measures to improve housing affordability are subject to the law of unintended consequences and may well achieve a result other than that intended. Here we can learn some lessons from the UK experience: • The UK has had a capital gains tax (excluding the family home – just like the model proposed here) for over 50 years, and houses there are as unaffordable as they have ever been. • In recent years, this problem became so acute that the government of the day introduced a “Help to Buy” scheme, in which they offered an interest-free 5-year “equity loan”, specifically to try to make housing more affordable to first-time buyers. As the IMF pointed out at the time, fresh government money entering the housing market pushed up the prices of existing houses and development land, benefitting existing homeowners and property developers, rather than those it was intended to help. • The lesson from this is an old one: “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”. The role of Government in housing is to pay for, or to provide housing for those who cannot afford it themselves, but not to meddle with the housing market On the proposed capital gains tax: I have already argued that a capital gains tax would be a tax on behaviour we should encourage, not deter If, however, the Tax Working Group decides that we have to have a CGT regardless of this point, you have asked for submissions on its design. My detailed submission is set out in Appendix 3, but in summary: • CGT should be a separate tax, not “income tax” • It should be levied on realised gains, not accrued gains • Roll-over relief should be allowed • Matrimonial property settlements should be covered by roll-over relief • Death should not trigger a CGT event • Collectibles and private assets should be excluded on grounds of practicality • Allowing CGT exemption to KiwiSaver and other savings vehicles would distort investment markets. It would be “fair” for some lucky savers, but unfair for others, whose savings happen to be in assets that cannot readily be transferred into permitted tax-exempt vehicles. It is potentially a minefield 5 • Assets held offshore should be taxed equally to New Zealand-held assets. Returning to the previous point, if tax-exempt vehicles are to be allowed, it should be possible to transfer assets held offshore into them • If a CGT is introduced, it should replace all existing tax structures on the assets covered by the CGT • Non-residents should not be subject to New Zealand CGT, subject to renegotiating existing double taxation treaties • CGT losses should be ring-fenced against future capital gains without limit in time • Emigration should not trigger a CGT event. This would be a tax on emigration • Immigrants should be allowed a grace period before any CGT applies to assets held at the time of immigration • The tax rate on CGT should be lower than the marginal income tax rate, to minimise the disincentive to save. It should be a flat rate of 15%, with a zero-rate band to encourage savers to get started on their journey. • Indexation of the purchase price used in a CGT should be allowed so as to avoid forcing taxpayers to pay real tax on illusory gains • There should be a de minimis rule – see above • The administrative implications are considerable and wide-ranging. A CGT can simplify the existing tax structure only if it replaces all tax regimes that currently apply to capital assets. If it becomes an additional tax regime, it merely adds complexity to a massively complex existing tax regime covering capital assets. It will also be necessary to re-think the provisional tax regime if CGT is to fall within it • The transition to a CGT should be via the “Australian Rule” Finally: Land Tax (excluding the land under the family home) It is not clear how this might be applied, so: • If a land tax were to operate like a wealth tax (i.e. like council rates), it would trigger tax payments far ahead of any income from which they could be paid (maybe decades ahead in this case). This would undermine “fairness” • If a land tax were to operate like a CGT, then I would reiterate my observations on CGT above. I would add that a land tax, if applied in isolation, would discriminate against one type of investment asset and therefore distort investors’ choices about where to place their investments – not a desirable outcome. I have fleshed out the arguments behind this summary covering housing affordability and capital gains tax in Appendix 3 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The detailed arguments that underpin these conclusions are set out in the appendices that follow 6 Appendix 1 Defining ‘fairness'. In Chapter 3: “Purposes and principles of a good tax system” you raise the question of fairness. The concept of fairness is central to the Tax Working Group’s questions for submitters. However, whilst it is easy to come up with a subjective definition, this would leave “fairness” as purely a matter of opinion – not a good start if we want to finish up with a consensus view To avoid subjectivity, let us ask what practical pre-conditions have to be met for a tax regime to be “fair”? I think there are three: • Simplicity – can it be easily explained and understood? • Clarity – is it unambiguous? • Practicality – is compliance straightforward? We can apply these criteria to ask how well the existing tax regime performs Simplicity In my view, where the existing tax system is simple, it qualifies as “best in class”. However, where it is complex and lacks clarity, it falls far short of this description. Tax on income from employment and GST are simple taxes that are easily understood. However, tax on investment income can be quite the opposite. Someone who is saving for retirement and has sensibly invested their savings in a diversified mix of different types of investment can potentially be subject to tax under at least 9 different tax regimes of which I am aware: • The “Financial Arrangement” rules • The “Comparative Value” (CV) method, if investments fall under the “Foreign Investment Fund” (FIF) regime • The “Fair Dividend Rate” (FDR) method, as an alternative to the CV method above, within the FIF regime • The “Quick Sale” adjustment (applicable to the “Fair Dividend Rate” method, but not to the “Comparative Value” method). • The “Australian Exemption” rules • The rules that govern the definition of “fixed rate shares” • The rules governing the tax credits that can be claimed for foreign tax deducted at source when using the FDR method within the FIF regime 7 • The slightly different rules governing the tax credits that can be claimed for foreign tax deducted at source when using the CV method within the FIF regime • The rules governing taxation on sales of land or property Different rules apply to investments held directly by an individual, as compared to those held via a Collective Investment Vehicle (CIV), such as a KiwiSaver or other savings vehicle. Thus, if an individual wishes to hold foreign investments as part of their retirement savings, the same foreign investments held for the same purpose by the same individual could have quite different tax outcomes if held directly, versus if held via a CIV. There is no way that this morass of complexity (and matching acronyms!) could ever be called “fair” – it falls flat on its face when measured against the criterion of simplicity. It also runs contrary to the principle of “horizontal equity” (fair treatment of those in similar circumstances) set out under the Tax Working Group’s heading: “Purposes and principles of a good tax system” In practice, the detailed working of the FIF regime for individuals is so complex that I have encountered some tax practitioners who simply refuse to take on a client whose tax return involves the FIF regime. Complexity of this sort drives up the cost of compliance, as well as potentially fertilising mistakes, so I would urge that complexity be explicitly recognised as the polar opposite of “fairness” when it comes to tax design With this in mind, I would like to suggest a criterion for tax reform with reference to individual taxpayers. Simplicity requires that: Any tax to be paid by individual taxpayers should be readily understandable by a reasonably literate and reasonably numerate taxpayer, without the need for expert advice and/or interpretation I refer to individual taxpayers here, because I recognise that corporate (and perhaps, Trust) taxpayers may have complex income structures that require specialist advice. Clarity In its briefing to submitters, the Tax Working Group has said that “One important aspect...is to provide as much certainty to taxpayers as possible as to what tax is due”. There can be no doubt that certainty as to what tax is due is essential to any definition of “fairness”. However, clarity about tax outcomes is completely undermined by retrospective changes to tax policy. 8 From time to time, the IRD changes its view about the tax treatment of particular types of asset and issues a tax determination that applies retrospectively. Thus, a taxpayer who might have thought that they had settled their tax affairs for previous years correctly, given the best available advice at the time, now suddenly finds that they have not. Such retrospective determinations undermine any certainty that taxpayers may have as to what tax is due. Retrospectively-determined taxation should simply not be allowed. It undermines any notion of “fairness”. If the IRD decide that the interpretation they have historically been applying to a particular type of income or asset was wrong, they should be able to change their determination for the current and future years, but not retrospectively. The taxpayer has to “wear” the cost when the taxpayer gets it wrong (though UOMI interest and/or penalties), and so should the IRD when the IRD decides that it has got it wrong - or has been less than clear in the past - if “fairness” is to be achieved. Practicality Is compliance straightforward? One practical test of “fairness” in tax design is to ask - can taxpayer in practice, pay the tax that they owe? If tax is charged ahead of the receipt of the taxable income on which it is calculated, compliance may become quite impractical. That is why, later in this submission, I argue that a capital gains tax should only ever arise on realised gains (i.e. not on an accrual basis). When tax is charged ahead of the income from which it is derived, the taxpayer is forced to sell some assets. This cannot be “fair”. The same principle applies to any wealth tax. A wealth tax would become payable regardless of the taxpayer’s ability to fund the tax due. Thus, it cannot be “fair”. The same would be true of a land tax, if it were to operate in the same way as a wealth tax \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 9 Appendix 2 Modifying behaviour. In Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system, you ask “Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?” Traditionally, this subject refers to raising taxes on addictive products, such as tobacco and alcohol and more recently, on sugar, to deter what we see as socially “undesirable” behaviour. However, tax policy also shapes our behaviour towards debt and has contributed to the fact that millions of New Zealanders now spend more of their income on it than they ever do on any of the products that we traditionally regards as “addictive”. As set out in the summary, the points that follow relate to household debt other than mortgage debt on the family home. While my focus is on household debt, many of the same arguments apply to corporate debt Several factors contribute to our addiction to debt over equity: • The lead-time to access debt finance, vs. equity.  Debt: The financial services sector makes sure that we live our lives in a deluge of their marketing – they are extremely keen to extend credit to borrowers and this is reflected in the short lead-times to get a loan for any creditworthy borrower  Equity: The hard graft of saving to create an equity stake that can then be invested looks like a long, hard, slow road to travel and in comparison to borrowing, it is. It can take years or even decades to save as much as can be borrowed in days or weeks. In comparison to savings, debt has become the route to “get rich quick” • How to access debt, vs. equity  Debt: There are many channels to access debt. Lenders make it as straightforward as they can  Equity: There is only one way to accumulate equity by saving. It requires sustained self-discipline - not spending money to build up equity capital • The impact of present tax policy 10  Debt: Tax relief on debt interest subsidises the cost of debt. As a consequence of debt being cheaper, borrowers can take on more of it than they could in the absence of tax relief. This means that more money is available to chase up the price of investment assets that can be debt-financed. Thus tax relief on debt underpins high property prices. Further, it drives up inequality of wealth because our progressive tax regime gives a bigger subsidy to borrowers on higher tax rates – i.e. to those whose taxable income is higher  Equity: Income from savings is taxed, slowing the rate at which reinvested income can build capital. On this, let me be clear, I am not suggesting that savings income should be taken right out of the tax net. However, I am making the point that present tax policies, given the differences in tax treatment between debt and equity, push us towards the warm embrace of the banks • The proposed capital gains tax would further amplify the incentive that the existing tax system offers to favour debt over equity • The long term impact on society. This heading refers to the different consequences of our preference for debt over equity, rather than to its causes  Data from the RBNZ show that household debt (relative to disposable income) is at record levels and is higher now than it was in the run-up to the global financial crisis of 2008/09. This relative level of debt cannot continue to rise indefinitely – financial chaos would inevitably follow. The Tax Working Group has an opportunity re-think how tax policy influences our attitude to debt  I cover the impact of tax policy on savings in more detail below. On retirement savings, you ask: “should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal?” The Tax Working Group makes the point that predictable demographic shifts will stretch the ability of the Government to finance the needs of an ageing population. There is a hidden public benefit of private savings that seems to have attracted little comment so far. It is simply that an individual who has provided for their retirement through their savings is likely to be less dependent on the state than someone who hasn’t. They are less likely to need (or to qualify for) welfare support and more likely to be able to fund or contribute to their own medical care and aged care in later life. Once we accept that private savings can actually contribute to the “public good”, we begin to see savings in a different light. 11 It seems to me that the best role that Government can play is simply to “get out of the way”. If more taxes are imposed on savers, less will be saved. If the tax burden on savers is reduced, more will be saved. It is really as simple as that. Here, I am not suggesting that we should take savings income (e.g. interest or dividends) out of the tax net altogether. My proposition here is that any discussion about additional taxes on savings needs to take into account our existing high levels of debt and how increased taxes on savings will affect this Let me add that savings does not have to be “for retirement”. There can be reduced dependency on government well before retirement – e.g. if someone who has accumulated some savings finds themselves temporarily out of work, they may be less immediately dependent on Government support than someone who has not a dollar of savings to fall back on, so any question about how the tax system could “encourage saving” should not be restricted to saving “for retirement” I will cover the practical implications for this in the section below on the proposed Capital Gains Tax In summary, my response under this heading is that the bias of the present tax system is to favour undesirable outcomes by subsidising debt whist taxing savings. Over many years, this has led to an addiction to debt. When you think about it, we seem to have got our attitude to debt and savings the wrong way round \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 12 Appendix 3 Under Chapter 7: Specific challenges, you ask for submissions on • Housing affordability • Capital Gains Tax • Land tax Taking each in turn: Housing affordability: “How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend?” On this, my first contention is that there is good evidence from overseas experience to show that introducing a capital gains tax (on assets other than the family home) will not improve housing affordability. Prior to immigrating to New Zealand in the early 2000s (one of the best choices I have made in my life, I have to say!), I had been living in the UK for long enough to remember the introduction of capital gains tax back in 1965. As with the model proposed here, this excluded the family home. Over 50 years later, it is still in place, though over the years, various Chancellors have tinkered with the system. It started with capital gains taxed as income and subsequently switched to become a separate tax with its own tax rates and personal (tax free) allowance. It has gone through periods where purchase costs could be indexed before the capital gain is calculated and other periods were a reduced rate was charged on investments held for longer terms (to penalise short-term trading - this latter provision also applies in the US tax code). 53 years later, housing in the UK is more unaffordable than ever – so much so that in 2013, the Government of the day introduced its “Help to Buy” scheme, in which the Government offered first-time buyers an interest-free 5-year “equity loan”. Thus, the UK experience demonstrates that a capital gains tax will do nothing for housing affordability So if a CGT won’t help, what can we learn from what is now a 5-year-old experiment in direct intervention by government in the UK housing market to improve housing affordability? Unfortunately, the learning experience here is a model of how government intervention in the housing market can so easily misfire. Soon after its launch, the IMF expressed concern 13 that the pressure of additional funds entering the first-time buyer market was inevitably going to raise the price of existing houses and building land and therefore benefit existing homeowners and property developers to the disadvantage of those who weren’t already homeowners. This is exactly what has happened. “Help to Buy” has therefore achieved largely the opposite result of that intended, but it has left a number of new homeowners with 90% mortgages at a time when the original 5 year subsidy will come to an end and interest rates look set to rise from their 300-year lows. “Help to Buy” in the UK made good headlines for the Government at the time of its launch but it may well finish up bankrupting at least some of those it was intended to help. As the old saying goes “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”. The lesson from this is that Government interventions to “promote greater housing affordability” are fraught with risk. Government should stick to its job of providing a housing safety net for those unable to provide for themselves or for their families. Capital gains Tax (CGT) The main problem I have with the proposed Capital Gains Tax is that it penalises savers and encourages spendthrifts. Imagine two siblings, Jack Spendthrift and Jill Saver. They are the same age and start their working careers at the same time, doing identical jobs, with the same pay. This continues to be the case over the next 40 years until their retirement and the only difference between them is that Jack always indulges himself. He likes to take expensive foreign holidays, to be seen in trendy restaurants, and drives a flash new car. He spends every cent he earns and is frequently in debt. In contrast Jill takes camping holidays in New Zealand, dines out modestly, and drives a 10- year-old car. However, she always makes sure to save 5% of her income into a savings scheme. She is willing to forgo the pleasure of spending money today to provide responsibly for her own and her family’s future. She accepts the need for deferred gratification. 40 years later, Jill’s parsimony, achieved by not spending all her money, has given rise to a substantial savings pot that she can draw on in retirement. She will be able to live an independent life in retirement and may well not need to call on the government to fund her aged care in later years. 14 Jack, in contrast has sacrificed nothing for the last 40 years. He will entirely depend on Government support once he retires and will not be able to fund his own aged care This is the situation before CGT is introduced. Add in a CGT and who pays it? Jill Saver, of course, but not Jack Spendthrift. Jill, who has maintained the discipline of saving for the last 40 years and who will be less of a burden on the state as a result, will pay more tax. Jack who has sacrificed nothing and spent selfishly, will be more of a burden on the state in later life, but will face no increase in tax. In this situation, the principle of “horizontal equity” is completely undermined. “Fairness” goes out of the window and the CGT becomes a millstone round the neck of Jill Saver, encouraging her to behave more like Jack Spendthrift. The higher the rate of CGT, the greater the encouragement to do so. After all, why make sacrifices and defer gratification when this results in you paying more tax than someone who doesn’t. Why should you subsidise their behaviour? Best to spend it all – enjoy life today. The Government will take care of you tomorrow! This argument – that there is a long-term public benefit arising from private savings – especially when we face a demographic “time bomb”, has to be set against the contrary view that whereas income is taxed, capital gains are mostly untaxed today. In the section that follows, I argue that if there is to be a CGT, then this public benefit from private savings should be reflected in a lower rate of CGT, as compared to income tax rates. Design Issues for a CGT The Tax Working Group has asked many questions under this heading. I would like to respond to 16 of them Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? I think it has to be a separate tax. If CGT were charged at current income tax rates, the progressive nature of income tax means that capital gains would attract the marginal rate for each taxpayer. To the taxpayer, it will seem that their capital gains are being taxed at a higher rate than their income – very discouraging for savers. If we have to have a CGT, the rate should be lower than the top rate of income tax, recognising the value of the lesser burden on the State to be expected from the “Jill Savers” of this world I would therefore propose a rate of 15% as the “fairest” outcome for Jill Saver 15 Let me also suggest that this should be a flat rate, rather than a progressive rate, as this is the only way to allow horizontal equity for an investor who only occasionally realises a capital gain. An investor who holds an investment property may only realise a gain after, say 10 years. Another investor who holds exactly the same amount of investment, but in the sharemarket, may realise the same overall gain, but spread over the 10 year period, as shares are held and may be sold in smaller “parcels”. A progressive tax would be more severe on the property investor, all of whose gains fall due in one year, than the on sharemarket investor, even when their overall capital gains are identical. Further, there has been some discussion of whether there should be a lower rate for gains realised after a longer holding period and a higher rate for short-term gains (as in the US, for example, where “short term” is defined as a year). I don’t think this should be the case. The implication of taxing short term gains at a higher rate is they are somehow “less deserving” of the lower, long term capital gains tax rate. I don’t think that it is the Government’s job to pass judgement on the “quality” of an investment – to say that some are “better” than others simply because they are held for longer. Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? .... How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? Three questions here. First, A CGT should only be charged on realised gains. If it is charged on accrued gains, this brings tax payments ahead of realised income – possibly years ahead. This would force a taxpayer to sell some assets to pay their tax. At best, this would force the taxpayer to incur additional costs (the cost of selling a small number of shares is high relative to the value realised). At worst, it is impossible. An investor whose only asset is an investment property cannot sell a part of it. Thus, taxing capital gains on an accrual basis fails the “practicality” criterion for fairness outlined earlier. It can never be “fair”. \[As a footnote, when an accrual basis for CGT was last proposed in New Zealand prior to the introduction of the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime in 2007, it was met by a storm of protest. The present FIF regime was then introduced as a compromise in 2007/08\] As to matrimonial property settlements – these should be covered by roll-over relief provisions (covered separately below) As to disposal of assets on death. Death in a family is a major trauma. I used to live in the UK, where Death Duty had always been known as the “cruellest tax”. Just at the time a family is dealing with the shock of a bereavement and the cost of a funeral, the Government steps in demanding money. UK Death Duty has since been re-branded as “Inheritance Tax” 16 in an attempt to overcome this stigma, but the sense of a remote, heartless Government still remains. If CGT were to be triggered on assets sold following a death in the family it becomes a death duty by default. This must not be allowed to happen. The “cruellest tax” is about as far from a “fair” tax as you can get. If a CGT is introduced, there must be an exemption for disposal of assets on death. What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? If a CGT were to include assets like collectibles and cars, The IRD would be forced to make a host of judgements: What is the difference between a pair of earrings that is “collectible”, vs a pair that is not? How is the owner to know? Is my 20-year-old everyday car a “collectible”, or is my 20-year-old sports car “collectible”, because it is not an everyday car? Including collectible and private assets such as cars would force the IRD to spend their time generating long lists of taxable assets – even more so than they have to do presently under the Australian Exemption rules. The IRD should not have to micro-manage tax outcomes for individual taxpayers in this way. Thus, collectibles and private assets such as cars should not fall within the scope of any CGT. This may make the CGT less than perfect, but it would at least be practical One final point here. Going back to my earlier comment about not allowing retrospective taxation; if a CGT is introduced with exemptions for certain items such as collectibles and cars and the IRD later decides it wants to reinstate a particular type of collectible, it should not be allowed to do so retrospectively. At the risk of repetition, retrospective taxes undermine any certainty that the taxpayer has about his tax outcome and should not be allowed. Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? If certain investment vehicles like KiwiSaver and other savings schemes are exempt, but the same investments held outside these vehicles are taxed, this will distort the investment universe. It would cause a rush to sell assets held outside the favoured exempt vehicles and switch them into the exempt vehicles. The beneficiaries of this switch will be the fund managers of the favoured exempt vehicles, whose performance bonuses and ongoing fees will go through the roof (though not because of anything they have done to deserve it)and the losers will be the investors who are caught out by the change in tax policy. Further, it may be that certain assets presently held outside an “exempt vehicle” simply cannot be switched into one (e.g. foreign shares held directly by an individual or an investment property in Australia, etc.). 17 Thus, there is a risk that if assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes are not taxed, some investors who are lucky enough to have assets in the “right vehicle” will not feel forced to sell, others, who are holding similar assets for the same purpose, but in the “wrong vehicle” will either have to sell, incurring transaction costs (and perhaps CGT at the time of sale), or will have to accept a tax burden not shared by their luckier brethren. Thus exempting KiwiSaver and other existing savings vehicles will not be “fair” or equitable Aside from the practical obstacles to CGT-exemption, there is a conceptual problem here. As the Tax Working Group points out in its briefing to submitters, New Zealand operates on a “TTE” (taxed, taxed, exempt) basis. Exempting KiwiSaver or any other vehicles from CGT would violate this simple principle. What is presently a clear and simple concept could become messy and confused Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? There should be no distinction between assets held offshore and assets held in New Zealand How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? For any class of investment asset that is included in the scope of a CGT and that is already taxed, the CGT should entirely replace the existing tax regime. We must not have overlapping, conflicting tax regimes. Simplicity is the objective here When should non-residents be subject to tax? Non-residents should not be subject to New Zealand CGT. New Zealand needs overseas investors as we typically run a budget and trade deficit that leaves us needing to attract capital from overseas. We already have rules and structures in place that protect certain types of New Zealand asset from overseas investors (the OIO for example) and to apply CGT to overseas investors would be a deterrent to investment. New Zealand also has negotiated a raft of double taxation treaties with other countries. If a CGT was applied to residents of those treaty countries, it would seem that all those treaties might have to be renegotiated. Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. If CGT is a separate tax (as argued above) and is charged on a realisation basis, capital losses should be ring-fenced against CGT income. It should be possible to carry forward any unused capital losses into future years without limit in time. (I see that there is a current 18 proposal from the IRD to ring-fence taxable losses from property sales against future taxable gains from the same source – the same concept) If CGT is a separate tax but is charged on an accrual basis, CGT losses should be offset-able against income and any eventual overall loss for the year should be carried forward into future years without limit in time. This recognises that CGT charged on an accrual basis means paying tax ahead of any corresponding cash income. As explained above, I think it would be most unwise. If CGT is an income tax, CGT losses will be definition, be offset-able against income Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? Roll-over relief could defer the negative impact of a CGT on savers. If a taxable asset is sold, there needs to be a decent amount of time in which the funds can be reinvested and it should be possible for this reinvestment to be made into a different asset class. It should not be necessary to reinvest in the same tax year, for example and it should be possible to reinvest a capital gain from the sale of a property into some unrelated asset, such as debentures, for example. As to farms, without roll-over relief, CGT could deny farmers a career in farming. As a farmer migrates up the hierarchy of farms in the course of a career, they have to sell one farm to move up to the next level. If they had to pay CGT at each step, they may well not be able to raise the extra capital to move up to the next level. A CGT without roll-over relief would fall particularly hard on asset-intensive businesses The key criterion for implementing roll-over relief is that it should be simple to do, for it to be “fair”. No complex rules, please! How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? I have covered death above. I believe it should not crystallise a CGT liability, for the reasons already outlined Emigration. Please can we keep it simple? Emigrants should be taxed under the tax regime of their jurisdiction of residence. Prior to their date of emigration, an emigrant is a New Zealand taxpayer. After that date, they are taxable in their new jurisdiction and subject to whatever New Zealand tax rules apply to residents of that particular jurisdiction. The act of emigration per se does not trigger a capital gain. Thus emigration should not trigger a CGT “event”, as this would then become a straightforward tax on emigration. 19 Immigration. Is the converse of emigration, though there is a practical problem here, to do with the value of assets held abroad at the date of immigration – in particular, illiquid assets like property that cannot quickly be sold and are expensive or difficult to value. There has to be a transitional period before an immigrant’s assets held overseas fall into the CGT net. In the past, this has been 3 years after the year of arrival. If however, the “Australian Rules” are applied to govern the transition into a CGT, (see my comments under that heading below), this problem goes away. Immigrants would be taxed on gains on assets acquired post-immigration. Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? Most definitely yes, the purchase price of taxable assets should be indexed to CPI. In recent years, inflation has been unusually subdued, but even with a steady 2% inflation, $100 will grow to $149 after 20 years or $221 after 40 years (the savings lifetime of “Jill Saver”). However, the $149 after 20 years or the $221 after 40 years will only have the purchasing power of the original $100. In the absence of indexation, after 20 years, $49 (49% of Jill’s initial capital) would be treated as taxable “income” and after 40 years 121% of her initial capital would be treated as taxable income – more than all of it. If the inflation rate ticks up just a bit to 3%, it sounds innocuous, but is not at all so in practice. The “capital gain” after 20 years rises from 49% of her initial capital to 81% and over 40 years from 121% to 226%. Such is the power of compounding over many years These “capital gains” are entirely illusory. If CGT is levied on the money value of assets without indexation, it is simply a tax on inflation. Taxpayers would be forced to pay real taxes on illusory gains. There is no way this could be called “fair” Should there be a de minimis rule? Yes, for two reasons. A zero-rate band would mitigate the discouragement that a CGT brings to smaller savers. Returning to the example of “Jill Saver”, above, a zero-rate band could keep her out of the CGT net for a few years, but not for ever. The purpose of introducing a CGT is to tax the gains on her retirement savings, so she will in the long run, still pay more tax than “Jack Spendthrift”. Let me suggest that any de minimis rule be applied to the capital gain itself, not to the amount of investment held. I think it would be administratively simpler for taxpayers to handle The second reason for arguing for a de minimis rule is that of simple practicality. For small amounts, the administrative cost of collection is large relative to the sum collected and there is a much greater likelihood of administrative mistakes by inexperienced taxpayers 20 What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? Many: Existing tax structures (e.g. the FIF regime, the Financial Arrangement regime, existing land tax structures, etc.) should be replaced entirely. At the risk of repetition, confusion and complexity arise where different tax regimes intersect, so for major tax reform to have credibility, existing tax structures that act upon any investment asset subject to a CGT must be replaced. Careful thought would also have to be given to how the investment industry would have to adapt to accommodate new reporting and to replace existing systems for the reasons given above. This may represent a considerable cost to the funds management industry, all of which will eventually be passed on to savers. One final thought. Any transition to a CGT must be much better-planned than the introduction of the FIF and PIE rules a decade ago. Both were rushed through Parliament with too little planning and caught the fund management industry unawares. The original FIF rules were far from clear and required numerous clarifications from the IRD over the years. It is my guess that if FIF tax returns from its early years were critically examined today, they would turn out to be riddled with errors –simply because the rules were so unclear and tax practitioners did not have time to get up to speed. As far as I recall, the introduction of the entire PIE regime had to be delayed by 6 months or so, simply because the industry could not set up the IT infrastructure to operate it in time. This is not how Government should work. Particularly not one that places such an emphasis on “fairness” There is another implication arising from the introduction of a CGT – it would also require a re-think of the provisional tax regime. Payment of the correct provisional tax requires taxable income to be relatively predictable from year to year – this is the basic assumption built into the “uplift method”. However, capital gains are completely unpredictable from year to year, so the existing “uplift method” and “safe harbour” provisions may be quite unsuitable for a CGT regime. What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). I have made the point above that there should be no retrospective taxation of past accrued gains. This would fly in the face of the Tax Working Group’s objective “to provide as much certainty to taxpayers as possible as to what tax is due”. Any notion of “fairness” rules out using the historical cost of the assets as the base point for a CGT. 21 Using the valuation at the date of introduction would cause another set of difficulties. For assets that are publicly-listed (e.g., listed shares) this is not a major problem, but for unlisted assets, it is. All of these would presumably have to be independently valued. The cost of all this would of course, be picked up by investors. Yet another burden for the “Jill Savers” of this world to bear. This approach cannot be described as “fair”. So this leaves the Australian Rule – assets acquired post-introduction - as the only “fair” way to transition into a new system. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

NZ Taxation Review Submission by: William S Macky First, one needs to consider what tax is for. It is clearly not for raising money. The New Zealand dollar, being a fiat currency, can be freely issued by the Government whenever it likes. The reason for imposing a general tax is to remove liquidity in the economy. The Government has a few ways of removing liquidity and tax in one of them. The main others are borrowing and charging fees for goods and services it provides. Of these, borrowing is often the most attractive. Borrowing requires no compulsion so has no compliance costs, it raises interest rates which forces market participants to make better decisions, it can be instituted at any time and reversed. The other side is that interest must be paid, but because this is a fiat currency, that will never be an issue, only in as much as liquidity in the economy must still be controlled. Borrowing would build up if not covered by some other effect. That should be estate and gift duties. That effectively formalises the individual’s lending as tax at the end of the person’s life. This is no double tax; the tax requirement is lower because borrowing is being used to help control liquidity. Obviously, the person doesn’t need the money if they are dead or giving it away. Trusts should be treated the same. Any disbursement should be subject to gift duty at the standard tax rate. The Government should provide a grace period to allow trusts to be wound up to avoid this. The effect of this is to convert lending into tax. Currently there is a severe problem with over liquidity in the economy leading to extreme asset price inflation and many dangerous asset valuations. The solutions suggested remind one of the Muldoon years when all sorts of freezes were tried out. The solution eventually adopted was to raise interest rates until people valued money. We are in a parallel situation today were various mad solutions are offered when the require solution is to raise interest rates. In the eighties we had just come out of 15 years or so of price chaos, both consumer and asset. Consumer prices being the hottest button and easily measured, was selected for control. That was a mistake. We should have targeted asset prices and that remains the situation today. People will always buy an asset if it is rising in price but will not buy consumer goods if they are rising in price. And anyway, how was lowering interest rates in New Zealand expected to stop the Egyptians from widening the Suez Canal and bringing down prices. Discussion of a capital gains tax is a result of the failure to properly manage the economy. Alan Greenspan, on surveying the wrecked Japanese economy slowly recovering from the collapse of a huge asset price bubble, declared in 1996 the asset prices were not a worry. His management of the US Federal Reserve had been governed by that view for a little while. I don’t know what he was on at the time. Everyone in New Zealand is on a benefit, whether it be a free police force or superannuation. There is no need to single out any group of people for special treatment or harassment. Many people are struggling with the cost of living on a near minimum wage income and harassment will only make things worse. The provision of targeted benefits, intended to draw people into certain areas of antisocial activity, should be abandoned. The information provided shows that the highest marginal tax in New Zealand is about 33%. In fact, struggling families in the income range $40k to 90K as described in the living wage argument are paying on average about 52%. If they \[1\] have a student load and many will, it is over 60%. The arrangements are extremely complicated, possibly simply to frustrate those involved. Some of these interventions are reduced by lump sum amounts at income steps so negating a small wage increase entirely if an extra dollar income takes you over a threshold. All interventions in someone’s income is tax and should be called such. (If you don’t like that, abolish tax altogether by calling it something else.) Realistically given that the purpose of tax is to reduce liquidity, it should be directed towards where excess liquidity is a problem. That is not low income families. Once one enters the glorious 33% + ACC tax band, one is entitled to $9,080 per annum, no questions asked. Your net income is 67% - ACC of your gross plus $9,080. For simplicity’s sake these payments should be separated. The employer knows it needs to deduct the 33% + ACC. The Government makes the $9,080 payment fortnightly. It doesn’t matter how many employers one has, they all do the same: pay net 67% - ACC of gross. ACC is just tax. It doesn’t need to be separated. The complication hasn’t worked; New Zealand still has a high accident rate. This deal is far too generous to apply to the poor people. What sort of country is this? The over $70K earners are effectively on the UBI scheme. Put everyone on it as well. The attached graphs show the chaos of the tax system. But one can see that in the area $40k to $100k the underlying trend is simple: just over 50% tax and a basic income of about $4,000. This difference between North and South Korea is said to be 10 times in 65 years. That is less than 4% pa. Half of that goes to having the worst of friends instead of the best of friends and half goes to having the worst of economic policies instead of the best of economic policies. So, what we are considering here is part of that the extreme range of 2%. Simplicity and fairness is the major thing we should be seeking. I haven’t bothered to try to explain the graphs. They are just chaotically and completely unnecessarily complicated. Similarly, the economic fiddling that goes on, adjusting GST by 2.5% for example, is just a nuisance. It has no real consequence. Taxes can nudge people to more sensible behaviour. The tax/benefit scheme can certainly nudge people into worse behaviour and we need to drop that. Nobody knows whether people would use the roads if they had to pay for the cost of building them through fuel tax. Government studies in the early 1990s showed the cost of road use collateral damage was about the amount collected be fuel tax and road user charges. Roads were valued at $40 to 100 billion. Now they are probably worth twice that (but who knows with current asset price madness). A reasonable return on that investment the Government has made on behalf of the people would be 12% or about $4 per litre. That would solve congestion. Auckland would be one of few places where roads made economic sense. Underutilised roads elsewhere would still be loss makers. Nothing can be done now but when the autonomous vehicle revolution hits, we need to ready to make sure all that profit arising from getting rid of New Zealand workers is not spirited out of the country to Ireland or somewhere similar. Alcohol taxation is far too low, tobacco too high. Currently illicit drugs escape all taxation but put significant costs on the community. These should be taxed. Sugar is all pervasive and sugar substitutes are just as bad. Labelling should be used to make sure people understand what they are using. For example, tomato sauce is 85% sugar by dry weight. 85% of the label should explain just how bad this product is for the user, and 85% of any advertisements for the product should explain how bad it is. All these costs paid by the manufacturer. People complain about product wrapping. The local supermarket offers credit for plastic bags at $10 per kg. The real problem is the rubbish inside the packages. $10,000 per tonne is too high but consumers need to pay a reasonable fee for the disposal of the rubbish they are buying, maybe $1,000 per tonne. Company taxation should be the same as personal. It is not true that foreigners owning New Zealand companies cannot get dividend imputation. That is an issue for their government, not ours. y = 0.1237x + 6597.2 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 2,0004,0006,0008,000 10,00012,00014,00016,00018,00020,000 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 Marginal tax rate Basic incomeNet eachNet for Max. indiv idual 33%, 9,080 Marginal tax (RH axis)Linear (Net each) y = 0.1483x + 5166 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 5,000 10,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,00050,000 25,000 50,000 75,000 100,000 125,000 150,000 175,000 200,000 225,000 Marginal tax rate Basic incomeNet eachNet for Max. indiv idual 33%, 9,080 Marginal tax (RH axis)Linear (Net each)

NZ Taxation Review Submission by: William S Macky First, one needs to consider what tax is for. It is clearly not for raising money. The New Zealand dollar, being a fiat currency, can be freely issued by the Government whenever it likes. The reason for imposing a general tax is to remove liquidity in the economy. The Government has a few ways of removing liquidity and tax in one of them. The main others are borrowing and charging fees for goods and services it provides. Of these, borrowing is often the most attractive. Borrowing requires no compulsion so has no compliance costs, it raises interest rates which forces market participants to make better decisions, it can be instituted at any time and reversed. The other side is that interest must be paid, but because this is a fiat currency, that will never be an issue, only in as much as liquidity in the economy must still be controlled. Borrowing would build up if not covered by some other effect. That should be estate and gift duties. That effectively formalises the individual’s lending as tax at the end of the person’s life. This is no double tax; the tax requirement is lower because borrowing is being used to help control liquidity. Obviously, the person doesn’t need the money if they are dead or giving it away. Trusts should be treated the same. Any disbursement should be subject to gift duty at the standard tax rate. The Government should provide a grace period to allow trusts to be wound up to avoid this. The effect of this is to convert lending into tax. Currently there is a severe problem with over liquidity in the economy leading to extreme asset price inflation and many dangerous asset valuations. The solutions suggested remind one of the Muldoon years when all sorts of freezes were tried out. The solution eventually adopted was to raise interest rates until people valued money. We are in a parallel situation today were various mad solutions are offered when the require solution is to raise interest rates. In the eighties we had just come out of 15 years or so of price chaos, both consumer and asset. Consumer prices being the hottest button and easily measured, was selected for control. That was a mistake. We should have targeted asset prices and that remains the situation today. People will always buy an asset if it is rising in price but will not buy consumer goods if they are rising in price. And anyway, how was lowering interest rates in New Zealand expected to stop the Egyptians from widening the Suez Canal and bringing down prices. Discussion of a capital gains tax is a result of the failure to properly manage the economy. Alan Greenspan, on surveying the wrecked Japanese economy slowly recovering from the collapse of a huge asset price bubble, declared in 1996 the asset prices were not a worry. His management of the US Federal Reserve had been governed by that view for a little while. I don’t know what he was on at the time. Everyone in New Zealand is on a benefit, whether it be a free police force or superannuation. There is no need to single out any group of people for special treatment or harassment. Many people are struggling with the cost of living on a near minimum wage income and harassment will only make things worse. The provision of targeted benefits, intended to draw people into certain areas of antisocial activity, should be abandoned. The information provided shows that the highest marginal tax in New Zealand is about 33%. In fact, struggling families in the income range $40k to 90K as described in the living wage argument are paying on average about 52%. If they \[1\] have a student load and many will, it is over 60%. The arrangements are extremely complicated, possibly simply to frustrate those involved. Some of these interventions are reduced by lump sum amounts at income steps so negating a small wage increase entirely if an extra dollar income takes you over a threshold. All interventions in someone’s income is tax and should be called such. (If you don’t like that, abolish tax altogether by calling it something else.) Realistically given that the purpose of tax is to reduce liquidity, it should be directed towards where excess liquidity is a problem. That is not low income families. Once one enters the glorious 33% + ACC tax band, one is entitled to $9,080 per annum, no questions asked. Your net income is 67% - ACC of your gross plus $9,080. For simplicity’s sake these payments should be separated. The employer knows it needs to deduct the 33% + ACC. The Government makes the $9,080 payment fortnightly. It doesn’t matter how many employers one has, they all do the same: pay net 67% - ACC of gross. ACC is just tax. It doesn’t need to be separated.

The Tax Working Group is also interested in how the tax system can encourage retirement savings. A simplistic view of the world is that introducing some form of capital tax, such as a capital gains tax or an asset tax, will have a dampening effect on house prices and thus improve housing affordability. However, we do not live in a simple world and changes to taxation have complex consequences. It is therefore important to try to understand these consequences. The previous 2009 Tax Working Group, which issued a final report in January 2010, commissioned various background papers on taxation issues. One paper by Coleman, Andrew, “The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand,” Motu Working Paper 09-13, August 2009 (available from: https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/cagtr/twg/publications/3-long-term-effects-of-cgt- coleman.pdf) considered the prospective effect of various capital gains tax regimes on various indicators, including house prices and rental levels. In addition to examining various capital gains tax regimes, Coleman (2009) also considered a tax system where the inflation component of interest income was exempt from income tax, both as assessable income and as a deductible expense. “Coleman (2008) argued that the tax system would have less effect on the housing market if the inflation component of interest income were exempt from income tax. He argued that by exempting the inflation component of interest income from tax, and by only allowing the deduction of real rather than nominal interest payments, landlords would have less incentive to enter the property market when the inflation rate was positive, raising rents and home ownership rates.” 1 1 Page 15, Coleman, Andrew, “The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand,” Motu Working Paper 09-13, August 2009. \[1\] Tables 2a, 2b and 2c of Coleman (2009) 2 show the results of modelling the following three tax regimes: 1. Capital gains tax at a flat rate of 20%, owner-occupied housing exempt; 2. Capital gains tax at marginal rates of 20% and 33%, owner-occupied housing exempt; and 3. Inflation part of interest tax exempt, under three supply elasticity and construction cost scenarios. The following points taken from these tables are notable: 1. All three tax regimes project increases in household rents (“Rent” line in the tables) and in house prices, for both small and large houses (“P F ” and “P H ” lines in the tables) under all three scenarios. (I.e. a capital gains tax makes housing affordability – both owning and renting – worse.); 2. Tax regime 2 above (capital gains tax at marginal rates of 20% and 33%, owner-occupied housing exempt) has the greatest projected effect on increasing rents and house prices of the three tax regimes examined in Coleman (2009), under all three scenarios evaluated; 3. Tax regimes 1 (capital gains tax at a flat rate of 20%, owner-occupied housing exempt) and 3 (inflation part of interest tax exempt) have broadly comparable effects on rents and house prices, but tax regime 3 was projected to have a much greater positive effect on household savings (“Net financial assets / GDP” line in the tables). Coleman (2009) notes: “This is because exempting the inflation component of interest income from tax raises after tax real interest rates, encouraging saving and capital accumulation among working age agents. Since a capital gains tax does not affect after tax interest rates, after tax returns are higher when the inflation component of interest is tax exempt than when a capital gains tax is introduced.” 3 A tax regime that increases household investment in financial assets is beneficial in helping our nation deal with an increasing aged population and concerns around inadequate self-provision for retirement. With current bank deposit rates being so low, investors realise negative after tax real returns from investing in such financial assets. They are unfairly taxed on compensation for inflation, which is not real income. Introducing a tax regime that makes the inflation component of interest tax exempt is worthy of serious consideration as not only does this correct for current tax induced preferences for investing in real estate, but it also will help our country improve its savings rate. Submission points In light of the above I submit the following points: 2 Pages 27-29, Coleman, Andrew, “The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand,” Motu Working Paper 09-13, August 2009. 3 Page 16, Coleman, Andrew, “The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand,” Motu Working Paper 09-13, August 2009. 1. That the Tax Working Group commission comprehensive economic analysis of any prospective tax changes so that the likely effects on house prices, rent levels and household saving and investment behaviour is well understood; 2. That the Tax Working Group gives equal consideration to making the inflation component of interest tax exempt as it does to capital gains tax or other asset tax regimes; 3. That by making the inflation component of interest tax exempt, not only would the government be addressing perceived skewed incentives for households to over invest in property, but it would also be: a. providing a fairer method of taxing interest income (such as from bank deposits); and b. encouraging household retirement savings in financial assets. It is acceptable for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact me to discuss the points raised, if required. Yours sincerely, John Redmayne \[1\]

This project examines the reasons why this form of taxation is popular and whether it is feasible to replace Value Added Taxes (VAT) with a tax on financial transactions (FTT) in New Zealand. New Zealand’s VAT is in the form of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Financial Transactions Tax has been proposed as a more equitable tax with a broader tax base than GST/VAT. This project examines what in New Zealand the rate at which such an FTT would have to be levied for the replacement tax base to be revenue neutral. The 3 estimated rate is established by examining the annual accounts of 20 public listed companies. 1 Overview There has been criticism of Value Added Tax (VAT) 1 internationally along with its apparent popularity. The strongest voice of dissent has been coming from Canada 2 for years, and more recently in Australia with the introduction of GST on 1 st July 2000. In NZ with the increase in penalties on all taxes, and the big Accounting firms moving to value added consultancy, there is a reluctance to undertake compliance work (including GST) especially for smaller taxpayers where compliance costs are a significant burden. The NZDemocrats, one of the parties making up the Alliance (coalition partner in the present New Zealand Government), proposed a tax on financial transactions 3 (FTT) both as a way of more fairly raising funds for the government and of curbing unproductive speculation (The FTT that the Alliance proposed is in Appendix A). GST in New Zealand is levied on all goods and services at 12.5%, with exceptions for exports, that are zero-rated and financial services, which are exempt, (which means GST inputs can be claimed but nothing charged on outputs). All businesses that make supplies of goods and services in a taxable activity (almost everything) above a threshold of $40,000 must be registered and charge GST on all good and services sold. 4 So what is a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)? “It can be thought of broadly as any tax, fee, duty, etc imposed by a government upon the sale, purchase, transfer or registration, of a financial instrument - it is for the most part a turnover tax.” 5 Marion Wrobel proposes a tax on financial transactions i.e. on sale, purchase, transfer or registration of any financial instrument. Wrobel argues bank withdrawals, cheque writing, or obtaining finance for a car or home would be exempt from FTT. A traditional FTT is designed to reduce short-term market volatility by slowing down or reducing speculative trading. The reason that I am doing this project; is that FTT is apparently simpler than the current GST and fairer to all taxpayers. 1 GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a form of VAT (Value Added Tax) payable by the ultimate consumer. GST &VAT are levied on all taxable goods and services produced by a registered firm. Deductions are allowed for GST paid on inputs (purchases) and GST must be charged on all outputs (sales). The sales invoice will generally show the amount of GST in the sale price. GST/VAT is collected and paid at all points of the production and distribution cycle in a cascading form of collection. 2 Brooks, Neil, “the Canadian GST: a skeptic’s assessment after 7 years“, (Sydney 1998) Paper for the conference Tax Reform & GST an international perspective. 3 See Alliance Alternative budget, “Would a Financial Transaction Tax be more efficient and equitable than the Goods and Services Tax?”, Alliance (1995). 4 GST Act 1985, section 8. 5 Wrobel, Marion G. “Financial Transaction Taxes: Pros, Cons, design issues and revenue estimates”, (1996) Library of Parliament (Canada). 4 What I propose is to tax every transaction where, money/cash asset is transferred to a third party. This would then exempt transactions where people and firms are juggling funds between their own bank accounts. A simple definition would be that the same IRD number is registered with the two accounts involved. Exchanging one form of money with another should not be taxed, as there is no effective difference between money in a non-interest bearing current account in the bank and that in one’s wallet 6 . There is the question as to which leg of the transaction should be taxed - the payment on purchase or the receipt on sale? Consider: What is the difference between: buying an artwork and it appreciates in value, buying stock and reselling at a higher price, buying shares on the stock market and receiving a dividend, reselling those shares at a higher price, buying a business and making a profit, buying debentures and receiving interest, deposit in a bank account receiving interest. Fundamentally they are all investments, they only differ in the treatment of GST. Section 2 discusses why GST is so popular internationally and the criticisms of GST as well as proposals for an FTT. Section 3 describes the research methodology employed in this project. Section 4 analyses the results of the project Section 5 notes some limitations of this project. Section 6 reaches a conclusion about the feasibility of replacing GST with FTT in New Zealand. 2 Literature review Cedric Stanford 7 has said that the requirements for a good VAT are: - Should be productive of revenue and responsive to changes in revenue needs. - Unintended distortions of producer choices, with respect to the form and the methods by which business is conducted, and of consumer choices for one good over another should be minimised. - Should permit the unequivocal application of the destination principle - taxed in country where consumed not produced. - Simple and easy to understand - Costs of collecting and enforcing should be kept low. - Should be easy to comply with and should interfere as little as possible with the free function of business and trade. 6 The author does mean, tax interest bearing accounts. 7 Sandford, Cedric, (Editor), “Key Issues in Tax reform”, (1993) Fiscal Publications 5 2.1 GST Why is GST popular? The introduction of GST has, as in most countries where a comprehensive VAT is introduced has also seen a reduction of high marginal tax rates. This was seen as a good thing because of the disincentive and distorting effects, which were believed to follow from high marginal tax rates. There is also the belief that taxes on consumption rather than on income would encourage saving and might reduce evasion and avoidance. Cedric Sandford’s conclusion is. 8 1. It is a good revenue-yielder. Its wide base means that a small rise generates considerable revenue. 2. It is neutral in its treatment of goods relatively to services: and if a single rate is employed with minimum zero-rating and exemption, it achieves a practicable neutrality as between different products. 3. It is a relatively effective mechanism for securing neutrality in international trade. 4. It is more evasion proof than its principal rival, the RST (Retail Sales Tax). 5. Infrastructure, wealth, literate population needed to levy taxes on other bases, e.g. income tax. 9 Some trading blocks require a VAT as a precondition to membership 10 . One of note is the European Community. The international Monetary Fund and the World Bank have also encouraged tax reform. Why is GST criticised? As the share of income that is spent on goods and services decreases with rising income the incidence of GST falls more heavily on those with low incomes. 11 Regressivity is a major issue, in Australia it led to unprocessed food being “GST free”. Financial services have as a rule not been taxed because of various problems in trying to tax them. Should tax be imposed on the full price - the interest - of the financial service, or should the tax be confined to the gross margin of the intermediary as measured by the difference between the revenue from the lending and the cost of borrowing etc. 10 Its compliance cost are regressive, they fall with exceptional severity on small businesses and smaller taxpayers. 10 For example; 8 Sandford, Cedric, “Why have so many countries adopted VAT?“ p.10. 9 Sandford, Cedric, “Why Tax Systems Differ”, p 14 10 Sandford, Cedric, “Successful Tax Reform”. 11 Sandford, Cedric, (Editor), “Key Issues in Tax reform”. 6 Taxable turnover ($NZ000) compliance costs p% of turnover 1990-1991 12 0-30 2.66 30-100 1.64 100-250 0.72 250-500 0.63 500-1000 0.42 1000-2000 0.23 2000-10000 0.07 10000-50000 0.01 over 50000 0.005 Overseas research reports similar shaped results although only NZ had low turnover compliance cost above 2% For large business compliance cost can be negative, (the cash flow advantages, greater than administration costs) The reduction in marginal tax rates and the regressiveness of GST has resulted in the rich few getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. 13 Professor Srikath Chatterjee, “... in the last 15 years, the top 5% have seen their share of the wealth rise by 15%, next 15% have barely held their ground, bottom 80% were left relatively worse off.” “that, the lower down you were the more you suffered in a proportional loss.” Murry Dobbin 14 studied GST in Canada, which is based on our GST in New Zealand. In particular he also noted its regressivity, and that it redistributes income to the wealthy. He rebuffs the criticism that argues against the removal of GST. 2.2 FTT Much of the literature has proposed financial transaction taxes as a means of curbing financial speculation. It has also be suggested as a means of funding a Full Universal Income into the New Zealand Economy 15 Dean Baker 16 said: - tax shift should also produce large dividends in terms in economic growth. Simply by reducing the number of transactions ... making these markets more efficient. - A small tax on financial speculation, such as a 0.25% tax on the sale or purchase of a share of stock, would have little impact on people who buy investments to hold. People who speculate in financial assets, often buying and selling them in the same day, would pay the bulk of this tax. - It is far better economically to tax unproductive activities than productive ones. - A tax on the trading of financial assets should have substantial positive effects on the economy. The most immediate and direct effect is that the tax would eliminate a substantial amount of waste in the running of financial markets by reducing the volume of trades that take place. - Output of the financial sector is not trading assets. Rather, its output is the transfer of savings from investors to the corporation, individuals, or governments that need to 12 Sandford, Cedric, “Why have so many countries adopted VAT?“, p.8. 13 New Zealand Listener 8-14 August 1998, page 18 “For Richer or Poorer”, article by Gorden Campbell. 14 Dobbin, Murry, “10 Tax Myths, (Myth 9 "cancelling the GST now would be to difficult. ...)”. 15 Manning, L, “The Economic Effects of Introducing a Full Universal Income Into the New Zealand Economy”. 16 Baker, Dean, “Taxing Financial Speculation: Shifting the Tax burden from Wages to Wagers”. 7 borrow. If this transfer can be done with fewer workers and fewer trades, then the efficiency of the financial sector will be greater. There is concern about the flight of financial transactions, 17 although it is recognised that the degree of the problem is difficult to quantify. A well designed tax should follow the model of the Danish stock transactions tax, which applied to the foreign trades of Danish nationals and Danish corporations, which meant that they could not benefit by shifting there trades to other markets. 18 Dean Baker 20 of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (USA) said that: “The tax shift from goods and services to financial transaction should also produce large dividends in terms in economic growth. Simply by reducing the number of transactions ... making these markets more efficient. A small tax on financial speculation, such as a 0.25% tax on the sale or purchase of a share of stock, would have little impact on people who buy investments to hold.” “The bulk of this tax would be paid by people who speculate in financial assets, often buying and selling them in the same day. It is far better economically to tax unproductive activities than productive ones. A tax on the trading of financial assets should have substantial positive effects on the economy.” “The most immediate and direct effect is that the tax would eliminate a substantial amount of waste in the running of financial markets by reducing the volume of trades that take place. Output of the financial sector is not trading assets. Rather, its output is the transfer of savings from investors to the corporation, individuals, or governments that need to borrow. If this transfer can be done with fewer workers and fewer trades, then the efficiency of the financial sector will be greater.” 3 Methodology I collated a list of all financial reports that were obtainable. Only companies whose balance dates fell in the range 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2001 were considered. Using the random number generator on a computer I obtained 23 reports to analyse. I obtained 23 instead of the planned 20, to make an allowance for when, on going through a report, I found a reason that I could not use a particular report. I had to eliminate one company because due to the particular nature of its international business, its income and expenses would not have similar portions of GST attached. Some other companies also had international business, but I expect that they would have attracted GST in similar proportions on income and expenses. Rather then trying to work out what portion of their business was outside NZ and therefore did not attract GST, I simply assumed that it would not affect the calculation for the FTT rate because it was a proportion on the tax base and although the size of the tax base would change the rate would not. Another company was eliminated because the nature of it’s funding meant there was insufficient information provided in the accounts to fairly determine it’s tax base. It was necessary then to eliminate a third company. This was done simply by picking a random number and eliminating the corresponding company. It is interesting to note that its variance from the mean was small enough that its elimination from the calculation did not affect the rate 17 That because financial transactions will cost more, traders will move to other countries where the cost of transactions are less. In general banks already charge per transaction. 18 Barker, Dean, “The Feasibility of a Unilateral Speculation Tax in the United States”. 8 of FTT that was calculated. Only five of the companies gave the net GST paid (received). An additional analysis was done on these five to see how accurately GST was calculated using the method below. 3.1 Obtaining GST figure Starting with the pre tax profit, I then searched for every mention of items that were included in the profit, but would not have attracted GST and therefore needed to be taken out, or added back in, depending on whether it was a revenue or an expense item. Items that were added back to profit included, (where listed): amortisation of goodwill, amortisation of intangibles, amortisation of premiums on leases, bad debts written off, decrease in value of fixed assets, depreciation, development feasibility cost written off, directors fees, donations, foreign currency loses, gas entitlement amortisation, GST written off, increase in doubtful debts provision, interest paid, leasing charges, loss on sale of assets, personnel, provision for write down of fixed assets. Items that were taken off profit: decrease in provision of doubtful debts, dividends received, foreign exchange gains, interest received, gain on sale. Also as asset sales and purchases attract GST, these amounts were added or subtracted, respectively from profit. This then gave a total tax base from which GST paid was calculated. Five of the twenty companies stated net GST in their accounts. 19 Due to the published end of year accounts not containing the detailed information that would be required to ascertain all the adjustments needed to calculate the correct net GST inputs and outputs, I took advantage of these five companies to estimate an adjustment to the calculated GST. 3.2 Obtaining FTT rate The total cash flows in and out were calculated to give the tax base from which I calculated an FTT rate. Total cash in was obtained by simply adding the amounts as stated in the cash flow statement, and similarly for cash out. This gave the size of the potential tax base. It is worth noting that the totals for cash in and cash out were almost the same, giving an initial FTT rate within 0.02 percentage points, which was small enough to disappear in the variance of the final figure. Statements of Cash Flows were analysed to determine total receipts and payments for a year, to use as a basis for the value of transactions that would be in the base that 19 Table 4.3 9 would be levied under an FTT. If GST paid was not given, I assumed that net GST was 1/8 of net profit, adjusted where possible for non-current asset acquisitions and disposals. A selection of 20 Company annual reports randomly selected were analysed to see what effective rate an FTT would need to be, to generate an amount equivalent to GST. A range of effective rates will be found. To obtain one rate it was calculated on the total transactions and the calculated GST of the 20 companies. As an example: Contact Energy for the year ended 30 September 2000. 20 GST paid was not specifically mentioned in the Report, but if we take GST to have been 1/8 of the operating surplus before tax 21 , we have 1/8 of $115, 358 22 is $14,420. The tax base if an FTT was applied to Contact Energy would be the amount of funds flowing into or out of Contact Energy. If we take total cash provided from: 23 Operating activities $ 792 139 Investing activities $ 88 992 Financing activities $ 1 234 986 Total $ 2 116 117 If this total was taxed at a rate to raise the same as GST we need a rate of 0.68%. To obtain a range of tax rates that FTT might be levied at, I obtained and analysed the information available from Statistics NZ and Reserve Bank bulletins to find out what the volume of financial transactions was. The volume of inter bank transfers would provide a starting point to determine the minimum size of the tax base. Some assumptions had to be made in analysing the data, for example where the amount of GST paid in the financial year was not specified in the Statement of Cashflows. A limitation of this project is that only published financial reports are analysed because information relating to smaller businesses is not readily publicly available. The impact of FTT may differ on different sized businesses. 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of Public listed companies The twenty listed public companies were from various industries: 20 “Contact Energy Limited Annual Report 2000”. 21 “Contact Energy Limited Annual Report 2000”, p.29 Statement of Financial Performance. 22 Rounded to $000. 23 “Contact Energy Limited Annual Report 2000”, p.31 Statement of Cashflows. 10 forestry, transport, energy, airport, investment trust, carpet manufacturer/retailer, motor vehicle dealer, clothing, newspaper, retirement villages, financial service, recreation, shipping, fishing, public utility, but no retail trade.

For FTT on cash in to raise the same amount the FTT rate will need to be 1.63% For FTT on cash out to raise the same amount the FTT rate will need to be 1.61% 11 Five companies gave net GST paid. Using the same method as for the other companies I calculated their GST and compared it to their actual GST. Table 4.3 Comparison of reported GST to calculated GST (NZ$) Company Reported GST Calculated GST C 20 000 1 437 750 D 11 475 000 13 790 250 F (131 000) 2 573 375 J 184 000 13 871 000 N 2 000 258 375 Totals 11 550 000 31 930 750 The actual GST is 2.76 times lower then the figure I calculated for them. Using this 2.76 times, as the over estimate of the calculated GST gives a new amount of GST equal to $ 31 930 750. The adjusted equivalent FTT rate becomes 0.6% on cash flow in of $ 5 747 738 204 This is less than one percent, which is low, one twentieth of the current GST rate. 4.2 Volume of financial transactions I was not able to obtain the total amount for financial transactions that occurs in New Zealand, nor the amount of inter-bank transactions, but I was able to obtain data for Production and distribution GST sales and purchases, and the New Zealand Government bond turnover survey. Assuming that there is no overlap between the two data series, the actual volume of financial transactions must be greater than these two combined, therefore a maximum FTT rate can be calculated. Table 4.4 Minimum financial transactions for the year ended 31 March 2001 Total minimum financial transactions for the year ended 31 March 2001 (NZ$ million) Production and Distribution GST sales 24 $ 382 116 New Zealand Government bond turnover 25 $ 552 480 Total minimum financial transactions $ 934 596 With the net GST collected for the same year $9031 million, 26 this gives an effective maximum rate of 0.966%. 27 24 Appendix D, Part DB 25 Appendix D, Part DC 26 Appendix D, Part DA 27 = GST / Total minimum financial transactions x 100% 12 Therefore, assuming that the volume of transactions does not decrease dramatically with a change from GST to FTT, an FTT rate of at most one percent could reasonably be expected to raise at least as much money as the GST it would replace. 4.3 FTT on cash in or cash out? What are the arguments for making cash in 28 the tax base? - As tax is taken out when funds are deposited, the full amount in the taxpayers account is available to the taxpayer instead of having to make an allowance for tax on withdrawals. - Tax is paid from funds that have been received, rather than subtracting from an account that has just had a withdrawal. What are the arguments for making cash out 29 the tax base? - The funds received are the full amount expected. Levying FTT on cash out could possibly put the taxpayer’s account into overdraft unexpectedly, if the taxpayer does not make an allowance for FTT. It would be better that legal requirements avoid putting a taxpayer in this situation, so it would be better to levy FTT on cash in. 4.4 Canons of taxation In 1776 Adam Smith 30 proposed four canons of taxation that any tax system should meet, these are: - equality of sacrifice, - certainty, - convenience, - economic in operation. How does GST and FTT measure up to these canons? Equality of sacrifice: as mentioned previously GST is a regressive tax, it falls more heavily on those of low incomes than those of high incomes, also the cost of collection falls more heavily on small businesses than on large businesses, who may even have the cash flow benefit (use of funds payment to them) outweigh the cost of collection. The inclusion of all financial transactions in an FFT will spread the tax more evenly. Certainty: GST is on all goods and services, except financial services, which are exempt, and exports, which are zero-rated. The tax base is quite certain because it includes almost all goods and services consumed in New Zealand. With FTT in order to make use of income from illegal activities, the income must enter the financial system before it can be spent to acquire goods in the normal economy. Convenience: With GST every business registered of GST must collect, account for, and pay the IRD, the tax collected. With FTT the financial system will be set up to 28 Cash in: All cash and cash equivalents received by the taxpayer, i.e. deposits. 29 Cash out: All cash and cash equivalents paid by the taxpayer, i.e. withdrawals. 30 Smith, Adam, “Canons of Taxation” Wealth of Nations (1776), 13 collect the tax, so those who currently collect GST will be free of the extra administration that is required to account for GST. Economic in operation: The collection of GST falls on the taxpayer. 31 The collection of FTT will fall on financial institutions, there will be an initial cost to change their systems to collect the tax, but thereafter the ongoing cost will be minor, is the resident withholding tax on interest that banks currently collect. There will be no compliance costs on Joe Public or companies excepting financial institutions. So after the initial set-up costs FTT will be very economic in operation. Therefore FTT meets the canons of taxation better than GST. In addition there will be a psychological advantage. With a low rate of FTT set to 0.6%, being a twentieth of GST, there will be less incentive to avoid the tax. 5 Limitations For this project, only end of year accounts from listed public companies were used. Small business (less than 5 employees) form approximately 92% of the business in New Zealand, 32 these businesses are not represented in the listed public companies I used for this project. A broader analysis than I have done, would need to be undertaken to see if the rate of FTT on a wider range of business differs from the 0.6% I have calculated. The increase in costs due to the flow on effect of suppliers costs increasing because of FTT paid, and their suppliers paying FTT and so on, is unknown. But there will need to be on average 19.6 33 steps in the chain for the end user to pay the same as he does now with 12.5% GST. The savings to the IRD that will be obtained because FTT will be far cheaper to administer than GST has not been factored into this research project. The amount of savings will reduce the rate FTT will need to be for a transition from GST to FTT to be revenue neutral. 6 Conclusion Replacing Good and Services Tax with a Financial Transactions Tax will be fairer, more economic in collection and broaden the tax base significantly. Just as financial institutions currently collect Resident Withholding tax, they will be a far more efficient collecting $9 031 million in FTT, than taxpayers currently are in collecting the $9 031 million in GST. 31 Sandford, Cedric, “Why have so many countries adopted VAT?“, p.8. 32 Wong, Patsy, Chairperson of the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee, “Report into small business compliance costs”, New Zealand Government 1998. 33 1.125 = 1.006 19.6 , (1 + 0.6% multiplied by itself 19.6 times). 14 Analysing the twenty companies in this project, I obtained an effective FTT rate of 0.6% ± 0.3% 34 to be revenue neutral. With such a low rate being a twentieth of GST, there will be less incentive to avoid the tax. The minimum financial transactions of $ 934 596 million, give an effective FTT rate of 0.966% 35 on these transactions alone. Based on my studies it appears that an effective FTT rate of at most one percent would replace GST and possibly as low as 0.6%. It would be preferable to levy FTT on cash in rather than on cash out. 36 It is unknown if introducing an FTT will reduce the amount of financial transactions, so this will require further investigation. There are other possibilities that then become available, but as they are outside the scope of this report, I will just briefly mention some. One percent FTT would apparently raise more money at less cost than GST, which could then be used to increase government spending or reduce taxes in other areas or increase debt repayments etc. Those on lower incomes would effectively have greater spending power on their current incomes. Those who make their livings by unproductive financial speculation will be contributing to Government revenue instead of just those who offer goods and/or services. My recommendation is that a Financial Transactions Tax should be a part of any tax review, especially as the government is interested in simplifying tax collection. 37 It may be possible to simplify tax by replacing GST with FTT in conjunction with simplifying income tax, by introducing a cash flow tax as proposed by Dieter Katz of the New Zealand Treasury. 38 Further investigation will need to be done to see if nationally to the $9 031 million net GST collected annually is less then one percent of cash flows as found with the twenty companies studied. If the national rate is comparable, replacing GST with FTT will be fairer, more convenient and more economic than GST. 34 Section 4.1 35 Section 4.2 36 Section 4.3 37 Tax Review 2001, Issues paper, New Zealand Government, June 2001 38 Katz, Dieter, “Towards a practical Cash-Flow Tax” a paper presented to the Australasian Tax Teachers Association Conference – February 1999 15 Bibliography Alliance a plan for all New Zealanders 1995, Alliance Alternative Budget – Appendix 3 – FTT.

The Government would levy each bank on the dollar value of debits made each month. The computer programming costs are likely to be minimal compared with the tax received. The government will pay for this programming of the settlements system as a separate contract rather than demand that the work be done for free by the banks. The rate of FTT would be determined as a proportion of the value of transaction (i.e. so many cents per $100). The Alliance would abolish Cheque and Stamp duty at the time that FTT is introduced. The Alliance would ensure that small business and personal customers are not unfairly levied as they are under the present GST regime (where there is no necessary link between GST cost incurred and the fees charged to different customer groups.) Tax Base The tax base for FTT is huge, According to very recent Reserve Bank estimates, which have been confirmed by enquires with a number of banks over several years, the New Zealand financial system conducts on average about $25 billion worth of transactions per day. 40 In a full year of trading this are at least $6 000 billion ($6 trillion) of transactions. This means that large sums of revenue can be raised at very low rates of tax. It also means that the effect on most transaction would be almost imperceptible and hence would not affect whether or not the transaction takes place Rate of FTT The rate that would be necessary to eliminate GST immediately under current economic conditions is estimated to be 10 cents per $100 of bank debits. The potential base of FTT is so large that even such a low rate of tax has the potential to seriously depress the economy if it is levied alongside GST. Hence, the growth of FTT revenue would be very carefully monitored so that GST can be reduced by the same amount as the FTT collected, and at the same time. Incidence of FTT The central issue over the introduction of FTT is the political choice between a tax which is levied on all transaction at very low rates (FTT) and which will be borne by many people (such as shareholders or overseas buyers) apart from final consumers in New Zealand, and a consumption tax (GST) that adds 12.5% to final goods prices. All taxation must be paid out of current income. This is also true of FTT. FTT implies a different method of taxing current income that is less regressive than other types of indirect 41 tax such as GST. 39 Alliance a plan for all New Zealanders 1995, Alliance Alternative Budget – Appendix 3 - FTT 40 Reserve Bank Bulletin, June Quarter 1995, Page 79 41 Indirect tax; is a tax that is collected from some intermediary or agent rather then the final taxpayer. A direct tax, like Income tax, is charged directly to the taxpayer. 18 FTT is a tax on the use of the financial system. Those using the financial system intensively would tend to pay a greater proportion of their income in FTT. This is likely to mean that those with considerable assets to manage in complex ways will tend to pay more than those cashing a pay cheque at the local pub. FTT is the purest form of turnover tax it is possible to devise. As such it is not so much a financial transactions tax as a money transactions tax. The only items that are not covered are non-monetary gifts and barter. Apart from that all types of spending are taxable. Advantages over GST Unlike GST, FTT would be levied on virtually all money transactions that take place in the country. At present only final consumers pay GST. A huge range of goods like second-hand goods and houses are not subject to GST. For example, tax avoidance schemes, which use NZ BANK accounts, would pay FTT. FTT is, thus neutral between exports and imports, 42 spending and saving, financial and non-financial transactions and spending on new goods and spending on second hand goods. None is true of GST. Compliance and collection costs of GST are not small. Banks are exempt from GST. This means that a lot of their business they have to pay GST on their inputs but are not allowed to charge on outputs. As a result they levy charges on their customers as best they can. In addition, the also have zero-rated outputs and taxable outputs. In order to fill out their GST returns they have first to separate all transactions into domestic and foreign as well as the three taxable categories. All this is costly. Costs are charged to captive customers like small businesses and personal customers, often quite arbitrarily and unfairly. Finally, all businesses, large or small, have to fill in regular GST returns and so have become unpaid tax collectors. FTT relieves people of this. Consultation Like any tax, there would have to be considerable discussion before it is brought in. This discussion would involve the full range of issues and concerns that would arise from the introduction of such a comprehensive new tax. 42 The author disagrees with the Alliance with its affect on imports vs. exports. GST is neutral as it is a flat 12.5% of the cost of the good imported, with exports zero-rated. FTT would have several transactions to reach the final exportable good, while an imported good has for example only the importation, wholesaler, distribution, and reseller. 19 Appendix B, Time table To mid September, September, October, November, Analysis of Selected Company accounts GST and cash flow information.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. New Zealand Tax Working Group Submission I expect you will receive many submissions from people with their own vested interests. I offer my perspective with a focus on the long term intergenerational benefit that can be offered by tax changes, which are at times counter to my own personal interests. Overall, I believe, the performance of the current tax system is good: • Easy to understand • Good horizontal equity (the same treatment for the same people in the same circumstances) • Simple and low administration and compliance costs for tax payers and collection • Revenue integrity: minimises opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage • Fiscal adequacy: raises sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements • Coherent The areas where I believe performance can be improved are: • Greater vertical equity (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay) and fairness • Efficiency: the need to minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid biases to the use of resources Changes recommended to address the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system, ordered from highest urgency to lowest: 1. New Zealand currently has very high wealth inequality compared with other OECD countries. A Capital Gains Tax (CGT) would help address this. This may also have the added benefit of creating a level playing field for asset classes and thereby reducing house prices, making housing affordable for all New Zealanders, and reducing the amount of money borrowed from overseas to fund mortgages, with the attendant risks to the New Zealand economy. Feedback on the design issues for a CGT are discussed in the next section. 2. Long term, New Zealand should consider CGT on the family home, while allowing roll over relief. Exempting the family home from CGT will cause people to over invest in the family home, this is based on first-hand experience. We plan to down size the family home and invest in shares, however if a CGT is introduced with a family home exemption we will not do this. Figure 21 of the Future of Tax Submission Paper highlights that it is the family home with the greatest inconsistency in tax obligations, (figure included below). In conjunction with CGT for the family home, estate duty / inheritance tax and gift duty should also be introduced to limit tax avoidance behaviour and ensure everyone is taxed fairly and consistently. 3. Tax should be equal across all asset classes to avoid distortion of economic incentives: o Overseas shares should be taxed on the same basis as New Zealand shares. The FIF regime assumes a fixed income return and imposes costs that may require shares to be sold to be met, which is inconsistent with other asset classes. o Shares and ETFs should be taxed in the same way. Currently the tax treatment for Australian shares is the same as New Zealand shares, but Australian ETFs are treated as FIF income. 4. New Zealand should maintain a system where income earned on investment is taxed at the same rate as income from labour. Anything else would be unequitable. 5. There is a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes, especially the use of water resources. This is needed to ensure biodiversity and resources are available for future generations. Alternative non-tax measures, such as fines and targeted regulations could be introduced depending on the administration cost and practicalities. 6. The tax system should keep the same tax rate for companies regardless of size. To change the tax rate for small companies would be counter to the current horizontal equity and encourage tax avoidance. 7. Charities should have to pay tax on businesses owned for fairness to competing businesses. 8. The lack of GST on low value imported goods is a disadvantage for New Zealand retailers and should be addressed. 9. There should be better tax compliance for the sharing economy, for example income from Airbnb. 10. Rather than assisting low income people by GST exemptions, assistance can be more directly targeted, for example by changing the way benefits abate or reducing the lowest tax rate. 11. Fining people who pay ‘under the table’ (for services and rental properties etc.) may result in higher compliance and lower tax avoidance. ‘Under the table’ payments provide an unfair price advantage over a competitor who does pay tax. 12. There is a need to include the agriculture sector in emissions targets for economic neutrality. For example, some marginal farm land might better be forest. This parallels the need to put an economic cost on water (bullet point 5). 13. The maximum income tax threshold of $70,000 is too low and should be increased. To balance the books either the highest top tax rate could be increased, or a new step in tax brackets could be introduced. The challenge with this approach will be the current company tax rate at 28%, which can encourage tax sheltering. For comparison the highest income tax rate in Australia is 45%. 14. I am apprehensive about a sugar tax, due to the law of unintended consequences. How effectively has this been implemented overseas? 15. I endorse the introduction of a policy regarding the ‘ringfencing of losses’ for property investment. 16. Additional tax revenue from CGT could be targeted to a universal benefit for young people and / or the New Zealand Super Fund. The figure below was referenced in bullet point 2 and is included here for completeness. Source Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Design issues for a Capital Gains Tax • If CGT is implemented it should: o be paid on realisation. In the instance of a start-up company this is important as cash flow is usually very limited during the initial years. Paying CGT on realisation will avoid the potential need for an annual valuation for unlisted companies and property (and the associated cottage industry). o have the same rate of tax as income tax to avoid distortions and tax avoidance behaviour o be equal across all asset classes to avoid distortion of economic incentives, including assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes and offshore assets o be applied only to assets acquired post introduction of CGT ▪ This will create a tax incentive for people to hold onto an asset acquired pre- CGT introduction rather than sell to an economically higher value owner. ▪ The alternative approach is for CGT to be applied retrospectively or to the value of the assets at the date of introduction. This would financially penalise an individual who has made a purchase on the assumption of no CGT. Although applying CGT to assets acquired post introduction creates a tax advantage for those holding assets post introduction and an incentive to retain assets, it is not the intention of the tax system to be punitive, and therefore retrospective CGT should be avoided. Retrospective taxation could lift the risk premium attributed to New Zealand investment. o allow roll-over relief for capital gains re-invested in similar assets, by treating these gains as not yet realised. Otherwise there will be a financial incentive to hold assets longer than required. o allow rollover relief for property transferred as a result of a relationship property agreement. This means that any potential tax liability will be deferred until a subsequent sale. • The family home CGT exemption will cause tax avoidance behaviour, such as the family bach being owned by one family member / partner and the family home being owned by another, is this fair? What can be done to reduce this avoidance? • The system will need to ensure transactions of unlisted shares and property are at market value. The cost of providing an independent market valuation for transactions subject to CGT could be onerous. This impediment could be limited by only requiring independent market valuations for transactions between related parties. Rules around valuation methodologies would be beneficial. • If gifts are not subject to tax, then could CGT be avoided by gifting assets to family members? What could be done to address this? • If capital gains tax includes private assets, such as cars, would this would mean that an individual could claim a tax loss on the family car and may result in higher spend on private assets? As these private assets do not create economic growth for New Zealand, higher spend is unlikely to be in New Zealand’s best interest. Similarly, for collectible assets, however if collectibles are not included in CGT is there a risk that this will cause distortion and greater investment in the collectible asset class? • If CGT is introduced the need to review FIF regime becomes more pressing. The 5% assumed fair dividend rate for overseas shares is higher than the historical average for U.S. shares (4%). It is acceptable for the Group and the secretariat to contact me and discuss the points raised, if required. Kind regards, Kim Bannon

My submission is that the Tax Working Group recommend in favour of the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax (CGT). 2. That said, the purpose of my submission is more limited and is to argue for a CGT to be part of a comprehensive package to address: (a) housing affordability; and (b) rental housing affordability, quality and security of tenure. 3. I see other parts of the package being: (a) increasing housing supply; (b) loan to value ratios applying to property purchases; (c) ring -fencing property losses as has been proposed. 4. I see the package as being aimed primarily at investment in property for speculation. By speculation, I mean investment in assets that is funded by substantial borrowing where the purpose is to make a gain on disposal that is the result of inflation rather than any enhancement of the asset. Speculation does not add to the wealth of an economy; it simply enables the speculator to benefit at the expense of future buyers. There is no justifiable economic or moral argument for speculation. I draw a distinction between investment for speculation, which I see as being without merit, and investment for development and/or income, which I see as desirable and the lifeblood of a thriving economy. CGT – Structure 5. In my view a CGT should: (a) apply to all gains from all property, including the family home ie. there should not be any exceptions; (b) apply at the same rates as apply to income; (c) apply irrespective of how long the property is held; (d) nevertheless only apply to realised gains but (reflecting (a) to (c) above) otherwise not be concessionary; (e) only apply to gains accruing from a prospective implementation date. CGT- Issues 6. Those opposed to a CGT on real property raise the following arguments: Conceptual (a) A CGT dis-incentivises investment; (b) A CGT does not interact well with other taxes, which are designed to raise revenue, without dis-incentivising economic activity, and are not primarily designed to achieve wealth distribution or to impede transactional activity; (c) Revenues from CGT are uncertain/volatile/minimal; (d) A CGT is a tax grab, so if it is to be imposed it should be accompanied by reductions in other taxes; (e) A CGT is also a wealth tax that should not be used to address inequality issues; (f) If a CGT is levied on realised gains, people will stop selling assets to avoid paying GST, ie the lock-in effect; (g) Capital gains are affected by inflation so should not be taxed; (h) A CGT on companies poses double taxation issues; (i) A CGT is administratively difficult to implement and operate; (j) If a CGT is imposed people will take their capital offshore. Property Based (k) A CGT on real property is unnecessary because housing affordability is primarily a problem of supply, not demand; (l) A CGT will not solve housing affordability; (m) A CGT nevertheless adversely impacts the housing rental market by forcing landlords out of that market, thereby reducing the supply of rental accommodation; (n) A CGT should not be used to try and modify behaviour in any case; (o) If we are to have a CGT on property it should at least be concessionary, like Australia. My Approach 7. I consider that conceptual issues should not be a barrier to GST. Tax should apply to all gains, whether they be income or gains from the disposal of capital. Otherwise, people are incentivised to invest in capital for the gains to be obtained from its disposal rather than the gains to be made from its development and/or use. 8. Any argument that a CGT is a disincentive to investment is out-dated. Historically the belief was that a CGT would discourage investment in favour of consumption. But this ignores the reality that investment is largely made by those who want to make money rather than spend it. Often the consumption needs of these people have already been satisfied. For these people, investment for profit (albeit where the profit from any gain on disposal would now be taxed) will normally still be a more attractive proposition than making money from wages and salary. 9. The only form of investment that is likely to be discouraged to any significant extent is speculation. As I have said, by speculation I mean investment in assets that is funded by substantial borrowing where the purpose is to make a gain on disposal that is the result of inflation rather than any enhancement of the asset. Speculation does not add to the wealth of an economy; it simply enables the speculator to benefit at the expense of future buyers. There is no justifiable economic or moral argument for speculation. 10. I consider that a CGT interacts with other taxes in a complementary way. It broadens the tax base by closing a loop-hole that allows capital gains to be favoured over gains in the form of income. It should not discourage investment for production so long as the CGT makes an allowance for asset enhancement. The only investment it should discourage is speculation where what would be an after tax return does not cover the cost of that speculation. 11. A CGT is also not a wealth tax; it is a tax on the gains that accrue to wealth. Also it is not a transaction tax; it taxes gains from transactions. 12. Therefore, I see a CGT as interacting positively with other taxes to broaden the tax base while closing a loop-hole. 13. I believe it does have to be accepted that revenues from a CGT are potentially volatile and difficult to predict. A CGT may not prove to be a substantial source of revenue. But I do not see revenue raising as its primary purpose. Its primary purpose should be to discourage speculation which serves no purpose other than to enable the speculator to benefit at the expense of others. 14. I think it is open for debate as to whether a CGT should be applied in a revenue neutral way, ie whether it is used simply to reduce other taxes. If revenue neutrality is the political price that needs to be paid to get acceptance for a CGT then that, in my mind, is worth considering. 15. Notions that a CGT is a wealth tax need to be firmly dispelled. But equally, because it is not a wealth tax, I believe it is misleading to portray a CGT as being primarily designed to reduce inequality. It only reduces inequality by discouraging speculation. It does not stop gains accruing to capital and generally speaking these will continue to exceed income gains. 16. I think it would be a mistake to tax capital gains other than on a realised basis. Capital is usually held for a period. Taxing gains to capital on an accruals basis can result in cash flow issues. For me, interim taxes levied on a risk free rate of return basis are not an answer. I do not favour land taxes. 17. I believe arguments based on lock-in, capital assets suffering from inflation and double taxation also tend to be exaggerated by those seeking tax purity. Should I be wrong then I would still leave them for the future. I think it is important that a CGT not be seen as being too complex. 18. Arguments that a CGT is difficult to implement and administer are exaggerated. Any tax system requires a lot of administration. That is not a justification for not having a CGT. It is not an argument that has prevailed in most countries. 19. A CGT is not revolutionary by world standards. It should therefore not result in any wholesale movement of assets offshore. 20. This leaves the property based arguments against a CGT. Before commenting on these, I set out below my arguments for advocating a CGT on realised gains from property. A Societal Problem 21. I consider that a CGT is needed as part of a solution to house price inflation. Despite recent trends, I see this as a major unresolved problem that will continue to be a major contributor to housing unaffordability and problems of supply, cost, quality and security of tenure in the rental housing market. 22. There can be no doubt that house price inflation and the associated increase in debt was the major contributor to the GFC of 2007/2008. Since the GFC house prices have more than doubled in many western countries. It would be naïve to think that the current levelling in prices indicates that the problem has been solved. 23. Nevertheless, despite the evidence, a combination of ideology and vested interest tries to persuade us that all this is part of a cycle; that we have gone through these cycles before; and so we should expect to experience them again in the future. 24. The reality is otherwise. Notwithstanding the GFC, the rubber band continues to be stretched. Average house prices in Auckland are now about 10 times the average wage. This scenario is being sustained by interest rates that are ridiculously low by historical standards, an ability to off-set property losses against other income, and the absence of a capital gains tax. The result has been increasing house prices and a rate of home ownership that continues to fall. 25. Simple economics tells us that house price inflation is a problem of supply or demand or both. While the answer is clearly both, housing supply has been a continuous problem throughout the years, while rational and irrational demand has fluctuated, with corresponding fluctuations in house prices. Clearly the massive spikes in house prices are first and foremost a problem of demand; although there is clearly also a problem of supply. Development versus Speculation 26. Some argue that CGTs are an unwarranted fetter on market activity. But what is the nature of the activity at issue here? Is it an entrepreneur spending money to produce something? In the context I am talking about the answer is no. While a comprehensive CGT would apply to all gains it should only discourage speculation, where the gain is all that supports the borrowing and subsequent loss making activity. In these situations the investor spends borrowed money, produces nothing, does little or nothing else, and waits for the price to go up. This simply allows people to benefit at the expense of future buyers. This is not justifiable on normal business principles, let alone on moral grounds. 27. People should still be incentivised to make money out of developing properties and/or using them for income. If they buy and develop they should obviously get a deduction for the cost of development when determining the gain to be taxed. But the gain, and especially any inflationary component of that gain, should be taxed. Importance of Real Property? 28. Why single out real property for special attention? Because it supports housing, one of the essentials of life. Its supply is limited in the short to medium term, and it has the potential for rapid price escalation. None of the other common consumption and investment asset classes has this unique set of characteristics. 29. Food is obviously essential to life, but supply is not a major issue in modern western democracies. Price can be an issue when the international price is allowed to dictate the local price. But the low level of the CPI over many years is a testament to the fact that the markets for housing and food work in quite different ways. 30. Stocks and bonds are also different. The capital they provide is obviously essential to business. But investment in stocks and bonds does not have the potential to deprive others of the essentials of life. Moreover, investment in these markets is not debt funded to anywhere near the same extent as the housing market. By and large, people accept any losses they suffer, and market fluctuations are not calamitous. The reasonably rapid recoveries from the 1987 stock market crash and the 2000 tech boom crash are testament to this point. These are markets that, by and large, can be left to themselves. 31. Housing is a different story. Not only do we need it, it is also in limited supply in the short to medium term. Cheap debt funding in the absence of a CGT tends to fuel demand. 32. We are now well past the point where the ever-present propensity for house price inflation can be ignored. House price inflation over the last 10 years has been a substantial contributor to rising housing unaffordability. Arguments in defence of the current position that this is a worldwide problem, that it is cyclical, and that it has happened before, are hollow excuses. 33. The reality is that all sides implicitly accept that there is a problem. The issue is that most choose to ignore it, or attempt to portray it as predominantly a problem of supply. The flaw with this argument is that supply was an issue before and after bouts of house price inflation. That inflation is primarily the product of excessive demand. Any solution has to focus on demand, albeit that this should not be an excuse to ignore the problem of supply. CGT is Only Part of the Solution 34. I am not suggesting that a meaningful CGT regime is guaranteed to solve the problem of house price inflation. Even a punitive tax might not work. In an era of low income growth, where we have become accustomed to making money from property, it is possible that people will continue to treat housing as the easier option, even if it becomes less attractive financially than wages and salary. 35. Therefore, I see a comprehensive CGT regime as only part of a package. Other demand-focussed measures are necessary. These include loan to value ratios on property and ring-fencing property losses as has been proposed. 36. Note that I would not ignore supply-focussed measures as part of a package. Undoubtedly there are problems with land banking, and supply not keeping up, and addressing these problems would undoubtedly help with the problem of house price inflation. But these problems have been a constant, and yet house price inflation has undergone repeated bouts of rational and irrational exuberance. Moreover the problem of a lack of supply takes a long time to remedy, and problems with shoddy construction show that imperfect solutions can create even bigger headaches. Despite what some lobby groups argue, there seems little doubt that house price inflation is first and foremost a demand issue and one that the market has been unable to resolve. Effect on the Rental Market 37. Some say that a CGT will lead to a reduction in the supply of rental housing. This risk is real. But it needs to be looked at in the context of what is happening in the absence of a CGT. 38. Presently, the rental housing market is largely a by-product of investment in property for capital gain. It works up to a point, but not particularly well. It is affordable to those who are on the ladder to property ownership or, increasingly, those who are comfortably off and see it as a substitute for home ownership. But for many on low incomes, it has become an uncertain road to nowhere. Landlords looking for capital gain have little incentive to provide quality accommodation or security of tenure. 39. Despite the imperfections in the rental housing rental market it has become a tool to castigate those who advocate for a CGT. But the reality is that is a second problem that also needs fixing. Trying to justify not taxing capital gains on property by suggesting that this might adversely affect the housing market is not a solution, it simply ignores two problems. 40. Both problems need fixing. The reality is that house price inflation has made both home ownership and being a landlord unaffordable for most without substantial subsidy. Home ownership is subsidised by depositors being paid at low interest rates and the absence of a capital gains tax. Rental returns that represent a modest return on inflated capital costs are subsidised by capital gains on realisation. The result is house prices that are unaffordable, and poor quality rental housing that offers no security of tenure. 41. As the home ownership policies start to bite, there are risks to the housing rental market. Without the subsidy of the absence of a capital gains tax (and not being able to offset property losses against other income), many landlords may leave the market or seek to increase rents. But this is no reason for not pursuing the home ownership policies. However, any risks to the housing rental market also need to be addressed. 42. The cross subsidy that capital gains from home ownership provides to landlords points to a wider problem in the housing rental market. That market suffers from being a by-product of the pursuit of capital gains from home ownership. The rental housing stock will need to be held by moderately geared institutional investors prepared to accept modest returns. While the home ownership policies are designed to arrest the increasing unaffordability of housing, the rental market stands to remain a substantial portion of total housing. Irrespective of what happens with home ownership, the rental housing market needs to be a viable standalone market that works for landlords and tenants. 43. House price inflation in recent years means that the rate of home ownership continues to fall. As Germany, Switzerland and other European countries show, this need not be a bad thing. But the transition out of home ownership needs to be managed. 44. A CGT and the other home ownership policies are likely to mean the transition will include some current landlords. Highly geared landlords who have entered the market in the last few years are the most likely to join the transition. The issue becomes who will be prepared to enter a tougher market in their place. 45. While there might be some role for the State here, the German experience indicates that the market should continue to have a major private sector component. The essence of a solution here is for any vacuum left by departing landlords to be filled by reasonably geared housing rental property specialists funded by investors prepared to accept modest but stable returns. 46. As with any situation where over-geared vendors need to sell, part of the answer is likely to be a softening in prices received by vendors. It might also involve rental increases (which are likely to happen anyway when house price inflation takes off again). State subsidies to tenants might also be needed, but better a subsidy that doesn’t directly fuel property prices. 47. The housing rental market needs to become more stable, and less risky. The focus needs to be on making the market more attractive to conservative investors prepared to accept modest returns, rather than trying to convince speculators to remain in the market. 48. The transition will not be easy, but the experience of Germany, Switzerland and other countries shows that it is possible. The Principal Purpose of CGT need not be to Raise Revenue 49. In my view the principal purpose of a CGT should not be to raise revenue. Given the volatility of the activity on which it is levied, trying to predict the revenues from a CGT would be difficult. Moreover, if a CGT is to work it should discourage that activity and make revenue from a CGT even more uncertain. 50. Therefore, the purpose of a CGT on property needs to be clearly spelt out. Its purpose should be to dis-incentivise speculation. Such activity does not add to wealth; it simply transfers it to speculators at the expense of those who cannot afford or otherwise choose not to speculate. Increasingly, that transfer is becoming generational. There is simply no economic, let alone moral, reason for allowing the more senior members of this generation to continue to gain at the expense of our youth and future generations. 51. It would help to reinforce the real purpose of a CGT if its proponents were to accept that its primary purpose is not to increase the tax take; and that any revenue from a CGT might be redistributed to reduce tax in other areas. Why CGTs have Failed in the Past. 52. Opponents of a CGT say they don’t work. Australia is often cited as an example. This overlooks the fact that Australia’s CGT regime is concessionary. Any regime that allows for the possibility of 50% of gains on sales made after one year to go untaxed is effectively designed to fail. Grandfathering – Striking the Right Balance 53. If a CGT regime is to bite, it must not be concessionary, and it must have limited grandfathering provisions. That said, it needs to be fair, so it should not be retrospective. It must also not impose substantial deflation on an over indebted population. Therefore it is important to strike the right balance. Don’t do enough and a CGT will fail. Do too much, and you create a potentially bigger debt deflation problem. A CGT Needs to be Sold to the Public 54. A CGT is a tough concept to sell to the public. It tends to turn off voters of all stripes. For some, a CGT puts the brakes on their ability to make money. For others it is a challenge to their security in retirement. These concerns have been exacerbated as real incomes for most have fallen over the past 30 years or so. 55. It is important to continue to emphasise that speculation does not benefit an economy. It is simply a means of transferring wealth to speculators. That transfer benefits current generations at the expense of future generations. 56. As a CGT would be introduced on a prospective basis, current benefits would be preserved. The superannuation is safe, albeit that it might not grow as fast in the future. That has to be an acceptable compromise to the current generation of property owners. Given what has been allowed to happen, it is arguably too generous. But for a populace saddled with debt there is arguably no alternative. We have to be aiming to come to a soft landing and avoid too much deflation. But doing nothing is not an option. Allan McRae

Tax Working Group Submission Mike Smith I do not wish to be heard in support of this submission. Taxes are what we pay for a civilised society Too many cracks have been papered over for too long in our society. In order for New Zealand to construct a properly civilised society, we will have to contribute by paying more tax. It is that simple. The Government will need much more revenue in the coming years to address New Zealand’s social deficits, such as inequality, insufficient pay for essential service providers, environmental degradation, and public services. The New Zealand public sector is in the midst of an underfunding crisis. The nation's infrastructure has been severely run down. High inequality in wages, salaries and income from ownership of capital adds to the pressure. Underfunding of basic services such as health and education, and holding benefit levels below the levels required to support an acceptable standard of living, means that holding Government expenditure to the “historical level of 30% of GDP” is undesirable and arguably irresponsible. The Tax Working Group should be constrained by an arbitrary cap on tax revenue. There is a strong case for a higher level of tax revenue and borrowing to assist in funding capital investments and the non-Core component of expenditure. The 2017 Labour Manifesto stated that “the tax system should be progressive, with those who are more able to pay tax contributing a greater share, and it should be fair and balanced across income, consumption and wealth to pay for the needs of our society.” Those should be the guiding principles for the Tax Working Group, as the New Zealand tax system has gone in the opposite direction since 1999. Within the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference I support the reasoning and the recommendations of the NZCTU for: • A reduced rate of GST; • A Capital Gains Tax exempting the family home, but treating all other capital gains as taxable income, both for fairness and to dampen speculation in assets including housing, while encouraging investment in productive assets; • Consideration of a tax on wealth, including property but exempting the family home (one possible method would be a tax on a deemed “risk free rate of return” on assets); • Investigating other ways of removing the tax advantages that investment or speculation in property enjoys relative to productive investment; • Taxation of international companies like Facebook and Google which avoid tax in various ways including shifting profits overseas, not having a local presence, and other tactics not being actioned under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda; • Taxes on excess profits resulting from windfalls or market dominance; • A Financial Activities Tax (FAT) on financial institutions as proposed by the IMF; • Taxes on cross-border financial transactions, both as a revenue source and to stabilise international financial flows and the exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar; • A review of the company tax structure and its interaction with dividend imputation to \[1\] ensure investment income is taxed sufficiently; • Consideration of ending tax deductibility of interest on related party borrowing; • A review of the taxation of closely held companies to make it difficult to use them for tax avoidance, and to provide tax relief for local owners of small firms; • Ensuring that Trusts other than Charitable Trusts cannot be used for tax avoidance; • Broadening of the tax base by recognising wealth transfers such as gifts and inheritances as forms of income; • Pollution taxes to force polluters to bear the costs of all significant externalities they cause; • Ensuring New Zealand’s resource use taxes and royalties provide a fair return to New Zealanders and incentivise efficient use of those resources; • Ensuring IRD has enough resources to track down tax evasion and abusive tax practices; Specifically also the Tax Working Group should • Set aside the arbitrary 30%-of-GDP ceiling on tax revenue; • Recommend further reviews to consider restoration of progressivity to income tax rates by means of for a tax-free income band up to $35,000, a 38% rate on income between two and three times the average wage, and a 45% rate on income above that (paragraphs 5.6– 5.8); • Look at full or partial replacement of Working for Families with a tax-free threshold on personal income (paragraph 6.3); • Recommend that the GST rate should be reduced immediately to 12.5 percent and GST should be progressively replaced with other forms of taxation (paragraph 7.1); • Address directly the issues raised by tax avoidance on the part of multinational companies not being actioned under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda; • provide clear advice on addressing these and future challenges to the tax system in international double taxation agreements and trade and investment agreements (section 8). • Recommend introduction of a Financial Activities Tax on the financial services sector (paragraph 9.13); • Give consideration to a Financial Transactions Tax on cross-border financial flows (paragraph 10.2); • Define income to bring capital gains, gifts, and inheritance within the ambit of the income tax system • Urge development of a wealth-holdings register (paragraph 12.8); • Review options for a wealth tax targeted at the top of the distribution (paragraph 12.9); • Recommend adoption of a broad-based land tax with exemption for land under the family home, and a value-per-hectare lower threshold (paragraph 13.4); • Recommend returning the company tax rate to 30% • Investigate an excess profits tax • Strongly recommend an increase in resources available to IRD to track down tax evasion and abusive tax practices, to ensure that everyone in the community pays their fair share of tax • Review the level of existing resource levies, taxes and royalties • Recommend major improvements in the quality and accessibility of tax statistics

Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 1 A. Introduction and Background I am a New Zealand Citizen by choice rather than birth and I arrived here at the age of 48, under the then applicable skilled migrant category. I provide below a brief summary of my experience of the New Zealand job market to the reader, only for the purpose of facilitating an understanding that being not fully absorbed into the workplace at the quantum of working hours and level of responsibility, I had been accustomed to, allowed me to became a ‘gig worker’ (as referred to in the “Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper”). What I would label as underemployed. Despite my entry to New Zealand as a skilled migrant I discovered that my knowledge, experience and natural capital represented unwanted baggage for a Kiwi employer. Being able to ‘hit the ground running’ is what matters. Businesses in New Zealand have the perception that they cannot afford the luxury of providing prospective employees with time to get up to speed with local methodology and cultural norms. There is no room for accelerated learning curves and no patience or willingness to embrace cultural diversity as a potential asset to the business. My time as a ‘ gig worker’ has given me access to and experience in:  The IRD’s large corporate office in Auckland;  Business development within the New Zealand business community on behalf of a global accounting software company with a regional head office in Australia;  Working for a firm of chartered accountants in a small regional town in the Waikato;  Volunteering as a treasurer of two not for profit entities;  Volunteering at the Citizens Advice Bureau;  Volunteering for Business Mentors New Zealand and  Providing business management advisory services to small Businesses in the Waikato. This experience provided me the opportunity to view the New Zealand economy, political climate, business sector and tax policy from a distance. Set out in the following pages are some points that I think are worth considering by the Tax Working Group. I would be happy to make myself available to answer any questions or provide the background data and information I used to prepare this submission. \[1\] Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 2 1. The Regressive Nature of the New Zealand Tax System. a. At the risk of stating the obvious it is a known fact that a tax on discretionary income is a regressive tax that favours the rich over the poor. GST being the main example of a regressive tax in New Zealand. Arguing that the nominal GST rate is much lower than other OECD countries is a meaningless comparison. One needs to compare the level of discretionary income and buying power between countries not nominal rates. b. The impact from the initial introduction of a new discretionary tax (such as the recently proposed road tax or sugar tax) and any subsequent increases in the rates of these taxes have a devastating impact on low income earners. This impact also has an inflationary impact that proportionately impacts on the poor more than the rich. c. When discretionary income barely covers an individuals’ basic survival needs like shelter, food, clothing and heating costs; any introduction of a new tax or increase in the rates of these taxes, such as sales tax, fuel tax, city/regional council rates, or excise duties all seriously erode the ability of low income earners to survive each month. Not to mention that for most low income earners GST is levied and paid on all their discretionary income (other than accommodation). This means that their average tax rate is relatively higher than a wealthy individual that saves a large part of their discretionary income. The regressive nature of GST coupled with inflationary pressures on food and housing can push more and more people into a poverty trap that forces them to rely on food subsidies, charity giving and results in crowding in shared accommodation or worse still living in their cars. d. The larger and more insidious social impact is that it strikes at individuals’ sense of self-worth and this has a concomitant impact on the family unit and results in a sense of futility. It leads to the destruction of the social fabric that keeps people motivated and happy to contribute to the greater good of their families and society as a whole. e. The impact of these regressive taxes is exacerbated by inflationary pressures on food and housing costs such as the impact that climatic conditions has had, as in the recent shortage and resulting astronomical costs of freshly grown New Zealand vegetables, not to mention the housing crisis (whether due to shortages or exorbitant rents/values). f. There is no doubt that fresh food inflation is far higher than average wage/salary increases (this increases overall GST collections - refer IRD statistics, available on their website). I refer to such items as vegetables, fruit, dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, in other words the healthy items located in the outer perimeter of the supermarkets’ aisles, the very items that would not be subject to a sugar tax; which ironically are mostly locally grown, cultivated and manufactured, but whose prices are based on an ‘ import parity pricing’ model.( What is my empirical evidence - my own grocery bills as these statistics are not readily available from government sources). \[1\] Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 3 g. The announcement today (30 th April 2018) that Auckland will implement a fuel tax is most distressing. It is another example of a regressive tax that will increase the poverty trap for many of Auckland’s residents, for the reasons enumerated above, poorer people have less discretionary income, this tax is inflationary and has a multiplier effect - shrinking discretionary income, not to mention that wealthier residents generally have shorter commutes as they live closer to their areas of employment. 2. Narrow Tax Base: a. Although there may be few deductions provided to individuals in the computation of taxable income, the derivation of taxable income excludes all gains of a capital nature. This tax regime favours the affluent members of society and places a greater burden on those taxpayers who spend all their after tax income on basic human needs, being shelter, food clothing, transport, schooling, personal toiletries, dentistry, and whatever is left over for sports and recreation (all of which carries either a GST or excise cost). Hence these members of society have a low savings profile and a relatively high average tax rate. b. I would dare to suggest that taxing the very first dollar of income must be a contributing factor in the designation of New Zealand as a high wage economy given that a basic living wage in New Zealand has to be determined on an after tax basis. In other words if one, as an example, looks at the British tax system the first £11 850 of taxable income is exempt from tax. c. Historical tax allowances, allowing the offset of tax losses from residential housing and related deductions as for example with depreciation allowances, have had a significant impact on the distortions we witness today in the residential housing market. What this proves is that it is never a good idea to use tax policy to favour a particular area of the economy; it is a blunt instrument and often leads to unintended/unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the tax planning community behave like oxygen, they gravitate immediately to fill any vacuum created by targeted tax allowances, which leads to long-term economic and social distortions. d. Excluding all capital gains from inclusion in taxable income also has the effect of distorting the tax net in favour of more affluent taxpayers and yet the level of savings and capital investment in the New Zealand economy is not notably higher (in fact possibly the contrary) as compared to other economies in the OECD, who all have some form of capital gains tax. e. A capital gains tax is needed to prevent the relentless arbitrage between capital and revenue gains. There should definitely be an exclusion for the family home and the percentage of the capital gains that are taxed need not be one hundred percent. Furthermore, it should be levied only on realised gains (a cash basis only) and genuine capital losses should be allowed to be offset against capital gains and carried forward, where there are no capital gains to absorb these losses. \[1\] Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 4 f. Other ways to broaden the tax base such as inheritance taxes (which can be levied on the physical realisation of the asset rather than at the time of change in ownership), stamp duties and land transfer costs should be considered. g. It is remarkable that the level of gaming tax far exceeds excise duties and this begs the question of why alcoholic beverages (and in particular RTDs which have a high level of sugar) are not subject to higher punitive taxes at the same level as tobacco products, given that excess alcohol consumption has been proven to impact on New Zealanders’ physical and mental wellbeing and leads to so many serious traffic infringements and other serious anti-social behaviour? h. The above suggestions are not likely to result in large immediate increases in tax collections but they have the effect of broadening the tax base and add more fairness and neutrality to the tax system. They also provide more gears and levers to allow for changes in the future demographics (like an aging population) in New Zealand. 3. Structural Issues a. The three year period between parliamentary elections may be a factor in preventing the full benefit of changes to tax policy and other structural reforms from filtering through the economic and social systems. Macro policy changes by their very nature require time to bed down before their full impact is felt and embedded into the machinery of government. Politicians are easily distracted by upcoming elections almost as soon as they have won an election. The party machinery is quickly set in motion to focus on the next election and this leads to a short-term policy horizon designed to appease perceived electorate demands with little regard for the long term structural needs of the economy and the country as a whole. Competing political ideologies that are at odds with each other are permanently oscillating 180 degrees between these opposing views. Managing a tax collection agency in the age of computerisation has become a nightmare because policy advisors and their political masters, assume that it is a simple exercise to adjust the data base for new types of taxes, record keeping and the filing of such information. Furthermore, it is often assumed that it is easy to extract data at the push of a button, little realising that the design of the database and the change in tax policies may not necessarily be a simple adjustment within the existing design of the database. It is suggested that overall tax policy and any changes thereto should be agreed to on a non-partisan basis so that, the level of tinkering with the taxing statutes is limited to correcting any unintended loopholes or drafting errors. \[1\] Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 5 b. Whilst a healthy democracy should support and thrive in an environment of competing ideologies and opinions, it is disquieting to witness a growing divide within New Zealand, between those who sway towards the American form of Libertarianism and Laissez-faire capitalism as espoused by the likes of Ayn Rand and more recently Paul Ryan (Speaker of the American House of Representatives) and those who favour socialism. These schisms cannot be ignored and need to be ventilated so as to prevent a head on collision between the two disparate ideologies. Ignoring this issue could cause irreparable damage to the very fabric of New Zealand society. It is there every day in full view in the newspapers, radio and TV talk shows across New Zealand. You may ask what this has to do with tax policy BUT it has everything to do with tax policy and this was made abundantly apparent, when it was first suggested by the Labour Party that a Capital gains Tax should be considered. c. It is noted that New Zealand often compares itself to the likes of the Nordic countries, however New Zealand’s geographic location and relative age as a nation state, should not be underestimated when it comes to making comparisons: a) as a remote island economy there are certain constraints that make direct comparisons misleading: i. our distance to market; ii. Having one of the most expensive shipping routes; iii. Our dependence on foreign banks for funding and global corporations who fund and supply large capital infrastructural needs, such as plant and machinery; iv. Not being a member of the EEC, with such benefits as cross pollination with physically close neighbouring states as well as an element of cross subsidisation between these nation states; b) We define New Zealand as a developed economy but we ignore that it is only in the last +/-40 years that New Zealand’s economy has evolved away from being a purely pastoral economy; c) We seem to brush aside the fact that we have a diverse population at different levels of educational, social and economic development. Ignoring this reality prevents us from implementing policies designed to address these divides. Successive governments have dealt with this by on the one hand increasing targeted welfare payments to certain groups but simultaneously doing nothing to address such social issues as the growing number of persons living under incarceration, whilst simultaneously actively reducing the stock of state housing, to mention just two such examples. \[1\] Submission to the Tax Working Group Prepared by Marcienne Jacobson BCom., BAcc. H.Dip., Company Law, H.Dip. Tax Law, MBA (Wits) CA (Australia and New Zealand) 6 4. The Danger of Adopting an Insular Vision The recent attacks by local business leaders and the press on Foreign Corporations doing business in New Zealand by accusing them of tax evasion and of taking advantage of New Zealand serve no purpose. This attitude reflects either ignorance of, or a deliberate case of Myopia with respect to: a. tax law and the impact of double tax treaties; b. the ability of the Revenue authorities to police transfer pricing due to such factors as inadequate resourcing and the inordinate power wielded by the large local legal and accounting practices, whose interests are served by assisting in tax avoidance measures and in some instances money laundering practices, as illustrated by the release of the Panama Papers; c. the very business leaders who whinge about foreign operations having unfair tax advantages, are themselves complicit in similar tax structuring arrangements as in the use of offshore tax havens and financial arrangements to finance large infrastructural projects, machinery and equipment. 5. Recommendations a. Re-design the individual tax tables so that more of the income tax burden is levied on the more affluent members of society; b. Consider introducing GST exemptions on locally grown/farmed fresh (non- processed) fruit, vegetables, milk, butter and meat and poultry. Many countries that are less developed than New Zealand have successfully managed a dual GST system and there is no reason why New Zealand cannot do so too. c. Widen the tax base so that the tax burden is shared in a fairer way. d. Try and build consensus among the different political groups so that economic policy becomes a shared vision rather than a football to be tossed around at the expense of the overall economic welfare of all New Zealanders. e. Encourage a shift back to a more egalitarian approach to sharing the wealth of the country amongst all residents rather than an elite select few. f. Encourage New Zealanders to embrace and appreciate cultural diversity, knowledge and experience, by actively demonstrating that their fears are based on stereotypes which bear very little or no resemblance to reality. \[1\]

Submission to the Tax Working Group Secretariat Patrick Connolly 30th April 2018 I see the main risks to a fair tax system is the ability of those with resources to organise their (and/or their business) affairs to avoid paying anything like their fair share of tax. Not long ago in Australia, Kerry Packer famously spent thousands of dollars on tax lawyers to avoid paying tax that had been calculated as something less than $20. Such is the feeling of entitlement. Global corporations and even local businesses can organise their books so that the NZ arm of the business makes minimal profit, due in part to bogus payments to tax- haven subsiduaries. This is well-known but it’s simpler to remedy than commonly thought. If we wish to make the best of an investigation of possible changes to the taxation system, it’s important to speak to those who have lots of experience with the subject. But it’s also important to get the perspective of those who don’t have a professional financial interest in the final result. Tax consultants, by virtue of their profession, are acutely aware of the complexity of tax law and will be aware of deficiencies in the rules they conform to. In many cases, they will be aware of details that the drafters of the laws are unaware of. So it makes good sense to ask for their input. However, it must not be forgotten that tax consultants also have a vested interest in not making the system so simple that their clients are able to do their own tax structuring without the need for professional services. Tax consultants are not inclined to propose a system that greatly reduces the need for their services. So, it’s no surprise they did not investigate a Financial Transactions Tax last time we had such an investigation. Some of the benefits of a Financial Transaction Tax 1. Anyone buying on the internet will pay a transaction tax, and if it’s structured correctly, it will be the same as that paid by those buying from NZ retailers. I envisage (after some years of transition) there being no need for GST or Income or Company tax. We would, indeed have a level playing field. The more money you spend, the more tax you pay. 2. It would be very difficult to avoid an FTT. It would be collected by the banks and could be avoided only by paying cash. That would not be a big issue since there is already a larger incentive to avoid GST. I’ve not heard it claimed that GST avoidance is a big issue. 3. Taxing financial transactions will put an end to the ability of those with large resources to make (as distinct from “earn”) more money by virtue of the arbitrage margins in high-frequency trading in foreign exchange and futures markets. Those who currently make fortunes that way make absolutely no –1– \[1\] contribution to the economy or provide any service or benefit to anyone – except, perhaps, providers of high-speed cabling. Yet they are able to consume large amounts of what is produced by those who make real contributions. Financial Transaction Tax in summary: General Basis •Every transaction is taxed (at, say, 1%) •Income tax and GST abolished •Tax is collected at banks when deposits are made –tax automatically paid to Inland Revenue –no returns need be filed •Excise taxes remain –possibility of new taxes on activity that leads to increase in government expenditure Some downsides •Needs to be on everything including essentials –will be less than present GST •Encourages businesses to use cash –already a much greater incentive to avoid GST •Simplicity of collection –less time spent dealing with complicated rules ∗less business for tax consultants Some benefits •Simplicity of collection –less time spent dealing with complicated rules •Fairness –the more you spend, the more tax you pay –collects from large amounts of commercial activity that currently pays no tax –2–

I also advise clients on investment portfolio matters most commonly encompassing diversified PIE and FIF fund assets as an Authorised Financial Adviser. There are several matters that one might wish to focus on in preparing a submission for the tax working group’s consideration, but the matter that I feel motivated to comment on relates to the complexity of a potential for a capital gains tax (CGT) and if recommended the promised carve out for the family home. This is because I have not heard any detail in the public debate that allays my concern of distortions that the definition of ‘family home’ may create at the margins of a CGT. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) I note that New Zealand already has a range of mechanisms to tax capital appreciation in many circumstances including: • The bright line test now capturing up to a 5-year ownership period on property • The FDR and CV calculation of tax on FIF assets • The accrual rules for financial arrangements • Habitual or frequent trading in any asset I am in principle averse to the introduction of a broadly-based CGT for the same reasons referenced in the conclusion of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group (TWG) report of January 2010. Their conclusions expressed in chapter 4 include the following on page 67 include the excerpts below: “...most members of the TWG are concerned about the practical challenges and efficiency implications of introducing a CGT. These issues include the lock-in effects that can result from a realised CGT and the inherent complexity of a CGT.” “A key concern with a CGT is the treatment of owner-occupied housing. If comprehensive base broadening is pursued through the introduction of a CGT, then in principle owner-occupied housing should be within the CGT base. However, the Group recognises that this is unlikely to be the case as \[1\] Page | 2 evidenced by the exemptions which operate in other jurisdictions. Introducing a CGT that excludes owner-occupied housing would create a new bias in the tax system.” CGT and the family home... I note that the government has already ruled out the application of any CGT to the ‘family home’. If CGT continues to be advanced as a policy consideration I raise the concern of what constitutes the family home and how this can be fairly defined today. One concern is that this policy lacks symmetry with the fact that we do not calculate income tax based on a family unit. In fact, attempts to change income tax policy to value the work of stay at home parents by permitting income splitting have been ruled out by successive governments. I am not fully aware of all the reasons that income splitting based on a family unit have been rejected historically, but the notion of ruling capital gains in or out of the tax net based on an arbitrary expression of ‘family’ will in my view have unintended consequences. If CGT is advanced as a recommendation in some form, I believe the family home exemption needs to be simplified to the concept of one nominated residential property per individual adult taxpayer. This would also remove the need to link the property to where those individuals reside. This nominated property that sits outside the CGT net should look through the legal ownership structure, be it held in individual names, joint names or in a family trust. A range of circumstances come to mind where an individually based nominated property outside the CGT net creates a fairer and more practical working outcome than a single ‘family home’ concept. For example: • A couple jointly own a primary residence and a second holiday home that has been in the family for three generations. I.e. these personal family property assets can fall outside the CGT net if one is nominated to each person. • A couple that jointly own two residential properties, one in which they live and one rental property. Again, two people will permit nominating one property each to be held outside the CGT net, recognising and avoiding penalising the small-scale rental property investment of Mum and Dad investors. • A family trust that owns three residential properties for the benefit of beneficiaries, where three adult beneficiaries can be nominated as having the primary non-CGT beneficial interest. With the current cost of housing relative to incomes, this is an increasing means whereby trustees assist younger generation beneficiaries into property ownership. E.g. parents might live in one property and their two adult children and grandchildren might live each of the other residences. • A couple entering a second relationship may wish to protect their separate interests and to preserve some distinct financial security for their separate children from previous marriages. Accordingly, they enter a pre-nuptial agreement to recognise the financial stating point of the new relationship. This includes houses that served their family homes before meeting. They decide to rent their individual houses and to jointly rent a larger 5- bedroom family home to accommodate the larger blended family. Each separate property owned before entering the new relationship can continue to be recognised as the nominated residential property outside the CGT net for each partner. Page | 3 • For couples partnering later in life bringing two existing properties to the relationship, but retaining them as separate property, electing to live under one roof would unequally penalise one partner’s security if the CGT only recognises one house as the new family home. The adverse impact of one property failing the ‘family home’ test is even more unfair if the new relationship is not enduring and one partner needs to return to their previous housing asset but during the intervening period it has been caught in the CGT net. I believe this concept of personal residential property defined on an individual basis as outside any potential CGT calculation is a valid clarification to the concept of family home. It is small scale, as it is naturally limited to one asset per individual taxpayer. Further, it maintains symmetry with the approach of basing income tax on individual income rather than family units. In circumstances where multiple properties might feasibly be in common ownership of a family trust, the designation of different properties to individual beneficiaries is consistent with the option trustees currently have to allocate trust income to beneficiaries and for such beneficiaries to be taxed on that income rather than it being retained and taxed as trustee income. Conclusion I am concerned at the distortions a broadly-based CGT will introduce to the tax system and therefore am against such a CGT in principle. However, if a CGT is advanced as a policy recommendation and If the ‘family home’ is not the target of a possible CGT, then I believe the refinement recommended within this submission more validly reflects the complexity today’s relationships and modern family life. Otherwise tax policy will create potential distortions at the margins of the family home concept and may even be an unhelpful driving factor in relationship decisions.

NZ Tax Working Group Secretariat for Submissions 30 April 2018 To the Secretariat: I am offering my input on the subject of New Zealand’s tax system for consideration by the Tax Working Group in this submission. Points raised in this document are intended to provoke discussion on matters which I realise are technically outside the formal ambit and terms of reference of the TWG; however, it is impossible to have a conversation about the role of taxation in political economy without raising issues of money, banking, and social good which are intrinsically linked. I am willing to appear before the group and speak to my submission. Framing of tax in monetary terms Before we consider how best to refashion our tax system, it would be beneficial to consider just what tax is – or more precisely, how the definition of tax shapes our thinking about its purposes. For any tax which is levied by a sovereign state, it is best to view its functions through the lens of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) i , an accounting framework in which money is issued by the sovereign (the Crown in this instance), goes into circulation in the broader economy, and at some point is removed from circulation by the issuing entity (the Crown once again). This view of money treats tax as either a payment for services provided by the Crown, or as an extinguishment of money which completes the circuit and maintains its value...but, importantly, not as revenue. In MMT terms, a sovereign spends first and taxes later. Tax types and amounts in MMT are set to achieve societal and economic outcomes, so Pigouvian taxes and wealth taxes can be used to provide market signals, influence behaviours, and ward off gross inequality. Of course, in the present system 98 percent of our money supply is not issued by the Crown ii , but instead comes into existence via lending by commercial banks and is extinguished when the principal of a loan is repaid iii . This has led to the curious phenomenon of the Crown borrowing its own currency from banks, at interest, and to the commonly perceived requirements that governments both 1) fund their spending by raising revenue in the form of tax or through borrowing; and 2) keep their levels of expenditure and indebtedness within the “means” provided by available revenue, in much the same way a household or business would balance its bank account. This requires us to overlook the ability of the Crown to create money by issuing notes and coins, and in our present-day reality of electronic banking this is easy to do. However, there has also been a concerted and ideologically-motivated effort to promote and entrench the notion of budgetary restraint among politicians, commentators, and the public. The reason for MMT’s existence within the discipline of political economy is precisely to counter the omissions and distortions of discourse which arise in blind acceptance of the orthodox view. Endogenous money creation and asset price inflation Another problem is present in the creation of money through lending, and it is profoundly evident in its effect on the NZ housing market. The largest portion of our domestic private sector credit, and hence the main component of our money supply, is residential mortgages ($250 billion), and because a growth in aggregate lending requires economic growth to service the repayment, even more lending is required to create the money to support the larger economy. Axiomatically, this means credit must grow exponentially for GDP growth to take place and at some stage the leveraging of households becomes unsupportable. This precipitates defaults, writedowns, bank weakness or failure, and deflation due to the sudden decrease in the money supply. A period of recession or even depression is required to unwind and deleverage before the next cycle begins iv . Prof Steve Keen refers to the ratio of private debt to GDP (and its rate of growth) as the bellwether for a national economic collapse, and considers anything greater than 100 percent to be cause for concern. Ours is presently in the neighbourhood of 180 percent v . Because the mortgages are used to buy houses, a growing market in credit places upward pressure on home prices. Keen and other economists link the credit impulse with asset price inflation, and it is this combination which has both driven NZ property values to levels which cannot be supported by the incomes of most households, as well as given us a dangerous exposure to economic collapse driven by debt deflation. Unsurprisingly, the politically obvious solution of capital gains taxes has been trotted out. A capital gains tax looks superficially fit for purpose, but in real life often encourages property owners to sit tight, creating market distortions such as supply restriction and inefficient resource utilisation (think of empty nesters in four bedroom houses, while extended families cram into two-bedroom flats). And for the parameters of this exercise, the TWG’s terms of reference explicitly rule out a tax on owner- occupied housing. Painting a profit-derived target on landlords and property speculators is politically expedient but won’t fix the underlying problem. Taxing the asset, not the effect The solution lies not in taxing the family home, but rather the land underneath. The capital appreciation in home prices is in reality the value of the land, not the improvements. An increase in land values is an expression of a place’s desirability in a multivariate assessment: proximity to schools, shops, transportation, amenities, and the social cohesion of the neighbourhood are strong drivers. These qualities feed into the intrinsic value, while the market places extrinsic signals on price and in times of credit expansion can create bubbles. Asset price inflation, especially that of land, in turn drives rent-seeking and as such is responsible for a feedback loop which increases socioeconomic inequality. By putting an appropriate tax rate on land, we can create a market signal which reverses or levels incipient bubbles, tamps down speculative incentives, and encourages full utilisation of urban residential sections subject to appropriate council planning. If we are to curb the alarming rise in inequality and deprivation that is underway in New Zealand we need to have a policy handbrake that inhibits wealth accumulation. The disparity putting a wedge into our society is wealth, not income, and a tax response needs to target assets because this is where wealth goes and from assets rents are derived. Placing a meaningful tax on land could be done at a level that removes the need for GST, and ideally income and company tax as well. In doing this, we would see individuals and families on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder reap an immediate windfall in disposable income by eliminating GST, while the effects on middle income families would be mostly neutral as long as they were not on unusually high value sections. Capturing the appreciation in value In the year ending March 2018, average house prices in New Zealand went from $631,432 to $677,618, an increase of slightly over seven percent vi . We can safely assume that virtually the entire appreciation was in land and not improvements. Across the whole-of-country portfolio of 1.8 million homes vii , that represents an increase in market value of over $82 billion. No one worked to earn that; it was an effect of credit-driven demand for location, and location is a value created by the public. A reasonable setting of a land tax which captured that increase could therefore “fund” (in non MMT terms) all the expenditure items in the present Budget with a considerable amount remaining for discretionary spending and at the same time render all other taxes unnecessary, and this example does not even consider commercial or industrial property, let alone rural lands. The example cited above highlights what good could come of the upward surge in values observed as the persisent bubble in the housing market refuses to abate. What goes up must come down, though, and one of the outcomes of a well-executed land value tax is a stable market in which asset speculation is difficult by design. I offer the scenario merely as a talking point to demonstrate what might be possible. If commercial and industrial land were put into the mix the tax levels across the board could be quite modest, perhaps 2-3 percent annually or less, and council rates could be paid from that instead of being billed separately by local and regional authorities. Taxing what we take and the messes we make The other taxes that should be in effect under a new, fairer system would comprise a meaningful price on externalities. These are resource and emission taxes or levies, and Pigouvian taxes. We can start with the biggest externality and market failure in human history: climate change. To create the appropriate signal across all sectors, a carbon tax must be put into place and the amount should be no lower than $20/tonne, with $50 an achievable target that could replace excise taxes on refined fuels. We can use similar measures to pay for the cost of cleaning up waterways with taxes on the abstraction of water and on the emission of pollutants. Closing the monetary circuit Returning to the concept of money in MMT, if we look at the various ways the state would be taking money out of the economy in the form of tax, it makes sense that this be done as a formal extinguishment instead of a way station along the path to a bank’s loan balance being repaid. Ideally, the state should be putting money directly into the economy. To put the principle into application, a universal basic income could be implemented alongside the new tax regime, using a public bank established under Crown auspices solely for this purpose. UBI payments would be electronically created under the Crown’s account in this bank, with the deposits (the liability in banking terms) immediately transferred to each resident’s own account, and the aggregate asset remaining with the Crown until such time as tax in that amount is paid. By creating some money this way, we take the edge off the moral hazard of having too much of our shared economic well-being subject to the vagaries of boom and bust in credit cycles. In addition, a UBI could supplant some forms of welfare, currently the single largest line item in the Budget. The other mechanism for non-bank money to be introduced would be direct spending by the Crown on public infrastructure and services. The ripple effect induced by an injection of debt-free money into the system would go a long distance and contribute to a new wave of egalitarianism and well-being in New Zealand, and would provide a model for the rest of the world to follow.

Submission to New Zealand Tax System Review from Rik Deaton We are an Australian family of five who are now fortunate enough to reside full time in New Zealand. My wife Juliet and I purchased a 115 hectare farm in the Wanaka area in 1991 and have been regular visitors ever since. Along with our three sons, we took up full time residency in February 2015. We have an utterly extraordinary taxation story to tell It is the story of a family that became the victims of a taxation system run amok and a bureaucracy that has no trace of humanity or rationality left to it - the Australian tax system. My personal tax loss for the 2008/09 tax year in Australia was AU$15,500,000.00 - we were financially destroyed by a combination of the Australian taxation system and the Australian Resource Consent industry. This destruction was wrought entirely by the nature of those systems and was centred around a particular division of Australian taxation ... Property Value Based Taxation. The full story is outlined below and entails a litany of wrongs done to a contributing Australian family that was so egregious and so targeted that the reader may have trouble believing it actually happened. I can verify every word of it if asked and would be happy to do so if it helped avoid having the same level of taxation stupidity, inequity and iniquity visited upon the people of this wonderful country. It all started in 1997 when my late mother, battling bowel cancer and dealing with chemotherapy, was watching TV news one evening when the NSW State Treasurer for the Carr government (Michael Egan) announced a new tax in his budget speech. In addition to $25,000 a year in local council rates (yes, that is how much we were paying in rates in the late 1990’s), our very valuable family home of half a century at Sydney’s famous Palm Beach was suddenly to become subject to Land Tax. A few weeks later the assessment duly arrived in the mail, $27,000 in year one and rising to $40,000 by year three. This was money we simply didn’t have. Income we just didn’t make, and the introduction of this heinous tax was the beginning of twelve years of hell for our family that culminated in the loss of almost all that three generations had earned and accumulated as they helped build Australia. We were subjected to direct targeted victimisation by so many of the organs of Australian society, institutions that supposedly exist for the protection and service of citizens, that, as I said above, the whole story almost beggars belief. We were tyrannised by at least five different taxes that don’t exist in New Zealand: Land Tax, Premium Property Tax, Stamp Duty, Capital Gains Tax and even Death Duty played a retrospective part although abolished some time earlier. New Zealand is free of these Page of 114 \[1\] egregiously invalid forms of taxation and it is my strongly held opinion that it must absolutely remain so. The very worst of these classes of taxation is what I term Property Value Based Taxation (PVBT). Our family, and a tiny number of other unfortunates in New South Wales, were subjected to the most extreme form of this tax that I have ever heard of and it was this that financially destroyed us. I will end this submission with an analysis of PVBT and explain why it is the only division of our taxation system that, contrary to popular opinion, is entirely REGRESSIVE and therefore, by definition, utterly invalid as a method of raising revenue in a country that espouses fairness in taxation and strives to achieve progressive taxation outcomes. The very fact of its inherently regressive nature means it is also entirely counter productive to effective revenue generation and the rational funding of the two branches of government that must make do with it as their revenue generation mechanism - regional and local government. I will argue finally that PVBT is a broken system that should be crushed into a ball and filed circularly as the garbage that it is and the required revenue raised instead by that most rational of all taxation mechanisms, income tax. But first ... PLEASE ... TO DISCOVER JUST HOW WRONG A COUNTRY CAN GET TAXATION, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST READ THE FOLLOWING 7 May 2013 BACKGROUND FOR BRIEF TO ADVISOR RE TAXATION POSITION AND OPTIONS FOR RIK DEATON IF RESIDENT IN NEW ZEALAND AUSTRALIA My full name is Rik Deaton, Australian citizen born Sydney 18/7/53. Due to an utterly extraordinary series of events I have an asset in Australia consisting of accumulated tax losses of over AU$15 million. This arose as a consequence of the collapse, at the height of the GFC in September 2008, of a redevelopment project involving an ultra high value residential property that had been my family home since 1954. Strictly speaking, the reasons for my being in the position where this could happen are not really relevant to this advice. I feel however, that it is useful for our (my wife Juliet and I) advisor to understand our background and to know that the redevelopment that went so catastrophically wrong, and resulted in the astonishing loss I mention, was not of our choosing but was forced upon us by what passes for systems of government, taxation and law in Australia. This means that I am a very angry and bitter ex-Australian and wish to make New Zealand my home. I also wish to have my residual wealth benefit New Zealand rather than Australia. Our present finances and my limited Page of 214 capacity for future employment or wealth creation however, dictate that our funds must stay invested in Australia until some are needed for development of our property in NZ, and that the tax free status I have in Australia be maintained for the foreseeable future. I feel it is useful therefore, for me to give a brief glimpse of the events that have so blighted our lives and reduced and diminished us as people and as a family. As I have said, this redevelopment was not of our choosing. We were forced into it by a wealth tax that was put in place in NSW in the late 1990’s by the socialist Labor government of Premier Bob Carr; he named his creation “Premium Property Tax”. Carr is currently Foreign Minister in the Gillard government last time I looked – when I write to him I address him as “Comrade Carr” and I call his reign of terror in NSW “the 10 long years of totalitarian Carrmunism”. Premium Property Tax affected a tiny proportion of very high-end homes in NSW and effectively imposed Land Tax (does not exist in NZ) on the principal place of residence (normally exempt) if those homes were above a certain value (AU$1 million Unimproved Capital Value), irrespective of the income of the homeowner. Like all property value based taxation, this tax proceeds from the invalid assumption that a homeowner (as distinct from a property owner) always magically has an income, the only source from which one can pay taxation, commensurate with the value of their home. This is a demonstrably false assumption and leads to appalling taxation discontinuities and great distress at the personal level through the state imposed reality of “Gentrification”. Other than in the instance of simple confiscation by totalitarian regimes, the Premium Property Tax imposed in NSW by the Carr government is the most extreme example of this that I am aware of. It was in place for seven years and put roughly a third of those affected, mostly elderly widows, out of their homes. In our case, my late mother, 75 years of age and battling bowl cancer, suddenly received a new tax bill on her home – on top of all the other taxes that she and the rest of the nation were subject to, this was a new one just for her and 3,000 other lucky home owners. In her case it was AU$26,000 in year one, rose to $40,000 by year three and was in place for seven years. It was entirely revenue negative given administrative and compliance costs and was done purely so Carr could say “I’m hitting those silvertails in their Jaguars for Land Tax on their mansions” in the 1998 election campaign. This was pure vote buying, political cynicism and tall poppy scything at its despicable worst: the politics of division in all its ugliness. My mother, a self-funded retiree with a fixed income from a single investment property and no government benefits whatsoever, attempted to increase her income by starting a B&B business in her home. Unbelievably however, because I spoke out against the government in the media during the election campaign, Carr sent the thought police after us, in the shape of the NSW Office of State Revenue, just 34 days after being returned to power. It turned out that by running a home based business where the public enters the home as part of the income generating activities, the areas of the home used by the public are no longer available for the “exclusive use of the owner occupier” and become subject to Land Tax. By this time they had renamed the new tax “Premium Property Tax” and written special legislation for it as it was originally under the auspices of the Land Tax act. In a complete travesty of ethical and progressive taxation tradition they now put a numerical cut-off point to the homes affected. This was simply the number of homes caught in the net in year one by the initial AU$1 million Unimproved Capital Value (land value only in NSW – value of improvements not considered for taxation purposes) cut off point. That benchmark was open-ended and was now catching properties in some Labor electorates and that would never do. The new Page of 314 numerical cut off was just that – a maximum number of owner occupied residences to be subject to the tax. We unfortunate 3,000 home owners got to pay forever more, but no other homes would get caught in the net, irrespective of increase in value or income of the owner. Hard to believe but it is absolutely true – the number they settled on, as if sent down to us from the gods, was “the most valuable 00.2% of Owner Occupied Residences in NSW”! That was the mystical number enshrined in the legislation. It is difficult to imagine a more obscene parody of taxation than was embodied by Carr’s Premium Property tax, except perhaps this: When he sent the OSR after my dying mother for having the temerity to operate a B&B in her home in a pathetic attempt to increase her income to try a pay a tax that raised no revenue and was only levied on 3,000 of 20,000,000 Australians, she actually unknowingly triggered another layer of Land Tax. The first million dollars of the initial entry threshold (which was retained along with the numerical one) was “tax free”. It was this tax free entry threshold that they now attacked because of the fact of the public entering the home as B&B guests. They calculated exactly how many square metres of the home were used by the B&B guests verses how many square meters were available for my mother’s “exclusive use” and levied Land Tax proportionately. The income from the B&B was the trigger for this tax but not the basis for its quantification. Quantification was determined by the value of the property applied to the square metres of B&B space. The end result then of my mother spending the last three and a half years of her life changing beds, cleaning toilets and scrubbing floors for B&B guests, in between chemotherapy, radio therapy and a colostomy, is that we are pretty certain that she is the only person in any liberal western democracy who has ever had to pay greater than a 100% marginal rate of taxation on a legitimate business. Yes, believe it or not, the tax they took was greater than the income that triggered it! Yes, those evil, vicious, malignant bastards took it all and then some. And, dear reader, you’ll never guess how many other B&Bs of the 3,500 operating in NSW at the time were subject to this same witch-hunt? Not a single one - just Veda Rae Deaton of 39-40 Ocean Road, Palm Beach. Even that wasn’t enough for them however, as they then decreed that one of our two properties (which were contiguous and integrated and had been treated that way for the fifty five years of our ownership) was our “home” and the other was our “holiday home” and levied a $123,000 land tax bill for that year. I ultimately fought them on that and actually won. Then they thought they should check up on us from time to time in case we were trying to “cheat the system” by offering our home for short term rentals as did all our billionaire neighbours (which would result in more Land Tax of course) so they raided us. We suddenly had be-suited “compliance officers” from the NSW OSR appear at our door, without warning or appointment, and demand to know if we were the owners and what we were doing in our home. I am not kidding – this happened twice in two years! I felt like I was living in Stalinist Russia rather than Australia. Mum died about then (October 2000), broken hearted, knowing that her home was lost to her family, and my sister and I could not agree on a way forward with our inheritance. This resulted in having to put the home on the market and my formerly close relationship with my sister being terminated permanently. We expected a ready sale of the property and at a very high level, as it is a truly remarkable location on Australia’s most beautiful beach. There are only twelve homes on the beachfront; amongst them is the Packer family’s beach home. We were stunned to find however, that the property was extremely difficult to sell. In over three years and three major marketing Page of 414 campaigns we did not receive a single serious offer. We finally had to step back and try to consider why such a majestic property was not generating the excitement it should have. We finally had to admit that the problem was our house and other buildings. Along with privacy issues and the poor layout of our two blocks, the buildings were simply not trendy enough for buyers at this end of the market. Any normal person seeing our beautiful (1940’s rebuilt in mid 1980’s but still very modern) three level home would have trouble understanding that, but buyers at this level want this month’s centre-spread from Vogue living and with the right architect’s name on it. At this point we discovered that we also had dramatic Capital Gains Tax problems. If the executors of an estate manage to sell a property within two years there is no CGT. If you miss settlement by so much as a day, you do not pass go, do not collect $200, but you go directly to jail and directly to the value at the time of death (or even to the date of initial acquisition in certain circumstances) to determine a base price for CGT. We had not thought this was an issue for two reasons. Firstly, the family home is exempt from CGT. As this was our family’s full time home, and as Juliet and I were living there for the last few years of mum’s life, caring for her and helping with the B&B operation, it was initially thought that we were exempt on that basis. It turned out however, that this position was dramatically impacted by the fact that we had two blocks not one, that there was a tiny guest cottage on the second block on top of a garage and squash court complex, which meant that we arguably, technically, had two homes rather than one. It was also impacted by the income generating activities of the B&B, which meant that we lost our CGT exemption for those years even though the B&B income had already been confiscated in state level Land Tax. We still did not think that mattered as we had owned the property and used it as our full time family home since 1954 – a full thirty years before CGT was enacted. Since pre-CGT assets were granted CGT free status we assumed we were safe on that basis - wrong again of course. We had not remembered the small fact of a technical change of ownership brought about much earlier by yet more taxation problems. When my late father suffered but survived a massive heart attack in 1971, in his early fifties, the property was in his name alone. Those were still the days of death duties. Knowing there was a fair chance he would have another attack and that he might not survive, he took steps to get the property out of his name and into a holding company. This meant that from that point on it was subject to Land Tax as it was no longer owned and occupied by an owner- occupier – I presume these people are very good at chess. Tragically for our family, Dad’s precautions were not in vain as he died the next year of a ruptured aneurism. The only good news being that our home was not lost to Death Duties. Some years later a NSW government actually acted properly and appropriately for once and recognised that that heinous class of taxation was morally unthinkable and utterly abhorrent to any rational person – they abolished it. We could have changed the ownership back to my mother’s name at that point but for another huge Australian tax that does not exist in New Zealand ... Stamp Duty on real estate purchases. This amounts to about 5-6% of the purchase price of all real estate transactions; when I bought my sister out of her half of the property in 2007 the stamp duty alone was $330,000! The amount of the stamp duty was high enough at this time (early ‘80’s) that we opted to leave the ownership in the company and continue to pay the land tax – mistake. In 1985 another NSW government again broke with tradition and acted correctly and morally. They recognised there were many people in our position, unfairly paying Land Tax on their family home because it was in a company name from Death Duty days. They announced a moratorium on Stamp Duty for qualifying properties throughout the whole of calendar 1985. Our property qualified fully Page of 514 but our accountants did not tell us of it and we only heard about it quite by accident in late October and just managed to scrape the transfer in before the window closed on December 31. We therefore managed to transfer the property from the holding company to Mum’s name and avoid state level Stamp Duty and save the state level Land Tax from then on. Was there another critical taxation event in that year of 1985? Well, yes, there was. In September, just three months before our transfer, the Federal government introduced Capital Gains Tax to Australia. So, after full time ownership and occupation by the Deaton family since 1954, our home was now deemed to be a post-CGT asset due solely to a technical transfer, wholly within the family structure, in which no money changed hands and was only necessary because of other taxation convolutions that ought never to have affected a family home. The end result of all this was that during our three years fruitlessly attempting to sell the property, we spent over $150,000 on taxation advice that finally included a brief from Senior Counsel who declared that he had never seen an instance such as ours that brought nearly every aspect of the CGT legislation into play. The realities we faced due to the madness of this CGT position entirely dictated how we had to market and attempt to sell the property lest we lose some vast proportion of its value despite the fact it should have been exempt in any of three different ways. Anyway, on with the story. Once we realised we did not have the type and style of residences the market required, a grand redevelopment became our only option. My sister did not want to be involved and so I was forced to buy her out for AU$6 million. To do that, my wife and I had to sell everything we jointly owned: a $1.2 million harbour front home unit; a $2.5 million industrial investment property; four other home units; a substantial share portfolio, concede other family assets to my sister ... and enact a multi million dollar finance facility with Westpac for project funding. Once I realised that I had no choice but to start thinking “redevelopment”, I identified a possibility for a spectacular redevelopment coup if it could be pulled off. I planned to use unpopular legislation called “SEPP (State Environmental Planning Policy) Seniors Living” to get permission to build low-density apartments on this very sensitive beachfront location. This legislation was enacted by State government in response to the housing crisis Sydney faces (expected population growth of 25% within two decades but zero undeveloped land in Sydney basin = rising population densities) and is uniformly loathed by all except those who live in them. I knew there would be a firestorm of local protest but architectural and legal advice was positive so we bought my sister out and ploughed ahead. In the same week that I paid my sister six million dollars however, the state planning Minister, Frank Sartor, waved his pen in the air one afternoon and summarily changed the status of the mapping of the SEPP governing coastal protection, SEPP 71. One day we were not included in the mapping, the next day we were. Inclusion in the mapping meant that our property was suddenly deemed to be in a “Sensitive Coastal Location” and SEPP Seniors Living was therefore no longer available to us due to its specific wording. This meant that the entire legal basis for a $6 million real estate purchase and a proposed $20+ million property development was withdrawn by government, with absolutely no prior warning, within 48 hours of me committing to it! Nonetheless, we knew they had not meant to ban SEPP Seniors Living from the entire coast of NSW and we knew they were not aware they had done it. We sought advice from Senior Counsel as to the ramifications of the government action in respect of these two SEPP’s and then I gained high access within the planning department and hit them with the bombshell of their own incompetence by giving them the QC’s advice. In the words of my contact, who was third from the minister, this caused an “electric shock throughout the department”. Page of 614 It was inevitable that they would shortly amend the SEPP we had been relying upon initially and reopen the door for coastal development, but we knew it would not be instantaneous. It would involve actually changing legislation and that never happens quickly. We clearly needed a viable fall back plan. One was duly formulated; it consisted of redesigning the two three-level apartment buildings our architect had already prepared, into two typical Palm Beach mega-houses. Along with a boundary realignment to give us two beachfront blocks, as opposed to one behind the other as was then the case. These two houses, fully complying in every respect with the Council’s planning legislation, were lodged (along with twelve different consultant’s reports) with the local Council for the inevitable rejection. In the end, it took 20 months and $550,000 in architectural, consultancy and legal fees to gain victory in the NSW Land & Environment Court and it cost the rate payers of our district just under $70,000 dollars in legal fees to oppose us. Why – no idea really, it is just what they, local councils, do I guess. In due course, with considerable impetus and lobbying from me, the NSW Department of Planning did amend SEPP Seniors Living and our ability to lodge the apartment proposal was restored. We went back to Council and lodged the identical buildings but reconfigured as apartments. Two houses, each of three residential levels (almost 900m2 each building) and an underground parking level, that were already approved by the Court, became six grand beachfront apartments. There were absolutely no additions to the size (bulk and scale) of the buildings to reconfigure them into apartments and all substantive planning and environmental issues had been dealt with comprehensively in the first court case. The only visible difference was that there was one garage door at street level instead of two; in a fair world and on a level playing field it was checkmate, we couldn’t lose! It is almost impossible to adequately describe the obscene travesty of courtroom procedure that followed for the next year and the next AU$1.5 million in costs, but one example should suffice to illustrate. Because we were using Seniors Living (over 55’s as opposed to old age) legislation, one of the requirements was that the site be within 400 metres of a bus stop to provide public transport for the residents to the local shopping village of Avalon – we were just 330 metres away from the Palm Beach bus terminus where regular services existed. The next requirement was that there be a properly constituted footway available to those residents to allow them to safely reach the bus stop. Being a beachfront that is very little used most of the year, but frantically gridlocked for two months of summer, there had never been anything other than the narrow but well made road that meanders down the beach to the cul-de-sac at the southern end onto which our property fronted – no footpaths. We initially did not see this as a problem as about three years earlier the Council had commissioned a traffic study by a firm of road safety consultants on the precise piece of road that was in question – the road from our driveway to the all important bus stop. In it the consultants said that the current uncontrolled nature of the road, with a 50kmh speed limit, was far too dangerous and Council needed to take action. They proposed turning it into a “Shared Pedestrian Zone”. This is an approved road designation with performance parameters set by the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority; it carries a 10kph speed limit. The Council then duly followed the advice of the consultants and designated Ocean Road, Palm Beach, from bus terminus to our driveway at the end of the road, to be a Shared Pedestrian Zone. The problem was that the traffic consultants had also listed eight other measures that must be taken Page of 714 at the same time as the declaration of the shared pedestrian zone in order to make it almost comply with the RTA’s parameters for these zones. These measures included: multiple speed bumps; moving the pay & display parking machines to new locations; three marked pedestrian crossings; colour coding of the road surface; setting up of roundabouts before the bottleneck ... and footpaths on both sides of the existing road as well. Council did not do a single one of these things. They just put up the signage and ignored the advice of their own consultants, the roads & Traffic Authority’s regulations, the support of residents and their duty of care to residents and visitors alike. My legal team knew it would be coming and they said we had to have a back up plan. I had trouble believing they could possibly get away with it, that they would actually dare run it in a court of law as an argument ... but they did. The shared pedestrian zone, which they had enacted completely illegally, while supposedly being safe and appropriate for all other beach users – residents, visitors, elderly people, children, disabled people, life savers, cars, motor cycles, trucks, bicycles, skateboarders – was not able to be used by the residents of our proposed development because it had not been legally enacted and therefore did not satisfy the precise wording of the SEPP that requires a safe pedestrian access to the bus stop! We were ready for them of course. We had a plan already prepared to put one of the two footpaths (down the landward side of the road) that the traffic consultants had said must go down both sides of the road. This is something regularly ordered by judges in such cases, although usually for just a few metres. When I say a “plan” I am really not doing it justice. I presume it was some kind of a work of art as the cost for our landscape architects to prepare it was ....... $120,000 for a 330 metre crushed granite footpath bounded by timber edges!!! Needless to say, the QC representing the Council argued vociferously against the possibility of us installing this pathway at our expense. I have a vivid memory of their QC in a foaming, fulminating peak of feigned righteous indignation, grasping his lapel with one hand and shaking his other fist at the ceiling as he bellowed in his best Rumpolean voice, “not so much as a single nail in a single bollard will be countenanced by my clients to allow this footpath to be built”! Yes, this actually happened in a Court of Law in Australia. A Queen’s Counsel, the highest appointment in our legal system outside of the Judiciary, the direct pathway to the judiciary, actually stood there and argued the utter illegality of his client’s actions as a defence against the legality of ours. Not only did he do it, he was allowed to get away with it by the court officer in charge, as if his insane, upside down, Daliesqe vision had validity in the real world. By this time we had stupidly said no to a very real offer to buy the property, made directly from the prospective purchaser to me, of fifteen million dollars. I try not to think of that moment too often. We had demolished our beloved home and commenced construction by doing the immense excavation and retaining wall - $2.5 million in costs to that point. This made absolute sense as, win or lose in court, we would be constructing the same buildings in the same hole as either houses or apartments. As the Court hearing progressed during mid 2008 the first stirrings of the looming financial crisis were becoming apparent but I was much too busy and absorbed in the fight to notice. Several sales of lesser beachfront properties nearby in recent months had driven our most recent valuation, prepared under instructions from Westpac, up to the staggering figure of AU$23.5 million for the two properties – land price only. Had we pulled off the apartments we were looking at astonishing numbers. Agents valuing them for financing purposes were talking $8.5 million each but without doubt we would have achieved closer to ten. We would have kept an apartment and made $20 million after tax. Had we lost in court, we would have just built the two houses and sold Page of 814 them for approaching twenty million each and still come out of it with over ten million. It was very big but the risks were known and the value was there in the property ... but then our project, and the whole world, just collapsed. I really should have known that defeat in court was inevitable despite the fact that the other side was reduced to such base tactics as those described earlier (and there were others just as outrageous) because they had no valid arguments to offer. I had been told we were going to lose some time earlier. One of our very near neighbours, a big name in the financial and equities world, with unlimited amounts of money at his disposal, told me so. He stopped me at the foot of our drive one day, poked me in the chest and said, “listen you, don’t you understand that you are up against the richest and most powerful people in Australia here? We don’t want this, so it’s not going to happen. We don’t care what it costs us to stop you; it is just pocket change to us. You should stop now while you still can”. I looked the man in the face and said “listen ------, I think that when you and your deep pocketed mates find yourself in front of a Commissioner in the Land and Environment Court – and you don’t have an argument – there’s only so far your money and your bullshit will take you”. Needless to say, he was right and I was wrong. In Australia, money and bullshit will take you wherever you wish to go. On the 17 th of September 2008, the same judge in the same courtroom of the Land & Environment Court of NSW who’d had no difficulty at all in approving our proposal for two 900m2 houses for the uber-rich, rejected the proposal to transition the identical buildings to apartments, despite there being no valid arguments or real non-compliances with the relevant legislation. His reasons? The buildings, which he himself had approved just over a year earlier, had suddenly and mysteriously become too great in “Bulk and Scale”. Our rich neighbour was right, they really can get any outcome they want. The defeat in court came in the same week that Lehman Bros. went down in the States and the world fell of the cliff. In Sydney, the first and biggest casualty was high-end real estate, especially holiday houses. With the sole exception of our home, that is what every beachfront house in Palm Beach was and is – a five weekend a year holiday house. The bank had a new valuation done (we paid of course) and 23.5 became 10.5 in the blink of an eye. We no longer had 60% coverage so they just sold us up. After such a desperate time trying to sell a few years earlier I was expecting very little interest, especially in that climate. Surprisingly there were over twenty parties the agents classified as very interested. As the financial crisis deepened however, they fell away one at a time. Ultimately only one remained. They made an initial offer of AU$13.5 but then got cold feet and backed off. Ultimately the agents earned their money and got them back at $12 million. At this point we owed Westpac the vast majority of that amount. Once that debt was satisfied we were left with the balance – and that is what we came away from those eleven years of hell with, a tiny portion of the sale price and a fifteen million dollar tax loss. As the reader might imagine, I consider that tax loss as an asset and all that is left of three generations of my, my wife’s and my family’s toil and contribution to Australia and I have no intention of giving it up. Australia confiscated the rest of what we earned and owned over a long and tragic period that also deprived us of any semblance of the peace and security that citizens of countries like ours have the right to expect. We got bent over and gang raped by every single one of the organs of society that are meant to exist for our benefit and protection – Federal, State and Local government, slimy, cynical, lying, manipulative and self-serving politicians, neighbours and lawyers, the taxation system, the legal system, the financial system. It was a betrayal by our nation as appalling as paedophilia by a priest. Our whole family have suffered from it as it all took place Page of 914 during the entire period of our children’s childhoods. They had parents so perpetually overwhelmed by the enormity of the problems they faced that there was never a moment in the lives of our two oldest sons when we have not been under dramatic stress that we ourselves had no part in creating. I am angry, bitter, cynical and utterly mistrusting of my society and its mechanisms. I don’t think they are out to get me, I know they are out to get me and I have the proof. My mother died heartbroken, my sister and I have not spoken for ten years and I am pretty much broken in mind, body and spirit to the point that I will never really recover. How my wife and I managed to have our marriage survive it is a wonder to both of us sometimes and speaks volumes for our relationship and her strength and resilience. Damn them. PROPERTY VALUE BASED TAXATION THE MOST UTTERLY INVALID FORM OF TAXATION EVER INVENTED According to a Wikipedia article: “A land value tax is a progressive tax, in that the tax burden falls on titleholders in proportion to the value of locations, the ownership of which is highly correlated with overall wealth and income” I would argue that precisely the opposite is true, that any Property Value Based Tax is demonstrably REGRESSIVE because the supposed correlation with income, the only source from which an individual ought to be required to pay taxation, simply does not exist. By definition, the term “overall wealth” used above is entirely divorced from the other term used, income, and relates to assets already owned by an individual that represent the residual of income after income tax has been deducted. Therefore, the very first thing that is wrong with Property Value Based Taxation is that it is nothing more or less than double or multiple taxation bites of the same income. Then we come to the transparently obvious inherent fallacy of the statement itself. Whilst it may be true to say that ownership of a high value property correlates strongly with “overall wealth”, it is only true because the value of the property itself is included in the calculus of an individual’s overall wealth and that property may absolutely represent the vast majority of that overall wealth. So it was in our case. It is utterly false however, to claim that ownership of a high value property correlates at all with income over the given taxation period. If it is held by a society that double or multiple taxation of income is wrong then it must be accepted that income over the current taxation period is the only valid marker of an individual’s ability to pay tax and therefore the only measure against which a valid tax ought to be assessed. Once this point in the analysis is reached then the utterly invalid and fatuous rationale for the use of PVBT simply crumbles into dust. My simplistic non-economist’s analysis of a taxation system is that there are three broad classes of taxation: Page of 1014 1. Income tax which is inherently progressive. 2. Transactionally based taxes. Here at least there exists choice. An individual can choose not to enter into the transaction if the total cost, including the taxes attached, are too high. 3. Asset Value Based Taxation. Since the only class of asset we choose to tax is property, I call this Property Value Based Taxation. With PVBT where there is no choice. If you own the property then you must pay the tax ... irrespective of ability to pay as dictated by income. PVBT, as a class of taxation, attempts to gain legitimacy from the invalid assumption embodied in the above quote from Wikipedia. That assumption is that the current income of each and every property owner is always somehow magically commensurate with the current value of their property. In an environment where, in living memory, property values have never done anything but increase, often dramatically and rapidly, to imagine the income of each and every property owner just automatically keeps up is so fanciful, so facile, and so self-evidently wrong that it is hard to believe people still hold to such a fiction. PVBT is one of the greatest forces driving the relentless urbanisation and density increases of our towns and cities, it is the driving force behind gentrification in places such as the the Queenstown Lakes district where we live, it is one of the key causative factors in driving rents ever higher and, in its extreme expressions, it leads to utterly mad taxation discontinuities such as were visited upon our family in Australia. In this country it is local and regional government that have their revenue generation capability hamstrung by having to use this stupidly anachronistic method of taxation to raise the funds needed for operations. This is just now being evidenced to dramatic negative effect to Queenstown Lakes District Council as they try to find methods of funding their upcoming ten year plan. This plan is a very bold and necessary step into the future and its key elements are mandated by the dramatic growth in both the resident and visitor population of this very special area. The infrastructure and service capability of the region are already stretched beyond design capacity and the cost of the desperately needed upgrades can presently only be funded by three methods: keep on jacking up rates to local property owners in accordance with the traditional paradigm, take the district deeply into debt for generations to come or go cap in hand to national government to try and get a fair share of the national income tax take. QLDC is about to have to resort to all these imperfect methods because the simple and inherently progressive methodology of assessing tax on residents of the district according to income is denied them. Via rates increases then, they will be forced into raising the taxes of low income earners who own their own homes and thereby driving gentrification, raising the tax burden of landlords who will instantly pass it on to their tenants thereby exacerbating the desperate shortage of rental properties, raising the tax burden of struggling farmers Page of 1114 who are already barely viable in the region, missing out completely on taxing many residents living alternative lifestyles ...whilst simultaneously letting many, many high income earning residents contribute just a tiny fraction of that which an income based metric would yield. All this is simply inherent to Property Value Based Taxation if one does even a cursory analysis. What is not so obvious as these functions of PVBT however, is that it is also inherent to the system that as development proceeds and population densities increase from country town to city levels - especially as multi-floor apartment buildings become the norm - then Council’s revenue take per residential unit falls. This effect is less pronounced in New Zealand where improvements form part of the rateable value of a property; as opposed to Australia where all PVBT is assessed on the Unimproved Capital Value of the land - i.e. land value alone. Nonetheless, as a single piece of land is redeveloped with ever higher densities and ever more floors, the land component of rateable value per unit of accommodation falls and so local government’s revenue take per set of goods and services provided falls also. Again, my Australian experience provides another graphic example of this. One of the wonderful pieces of real estate I owned that was confiscated by Australia was a harbour front apartment at Kirribilli, immediately beside the Prime Minister’s Sydney residence, Kirribilli House. This was sold in 2005 for AU$1.2million. Because its land value was split between the 26 units that comprised the building, its annual PVBT (council rates) contribution was a mere $850.00. Immediately next door was a single home on a single block of land. The rates burden of this family was based on the entire value of the block of land so it would have been in the order of $20,000 ... plus, there was Premium Property Tax to consider! This added something like another $40k to this family’s PVBT bill each year. So here you had a system of taxation that took next door neighbours, made not the slightest attempt to consider their relative incomes, and charged one of them $850 and the other circa $60,000 for the identical government supplied set of goods and services. This is not a system of taxation; this is systematic injustice and a lapse in rational policy making that defies understanding. Needless to say, that lovely old harbour front home is long gone and was replaced by a block of apartments. My basic premise is that all taxation ought to be based on the tax payers true ability to pay, not an assumed ability based on a false marker such as the value of one’s home. If this premise is accepted then any form of Property Value Based Taxation, on the principal place of residence at least, is inherently unacceptable as it is not income linked in any way and attempts to gain its legitimacy from a demonstrably false assumption. Unless one is in favour of the forced property redistribution that inevitably results from the application of taxation so based (most especially Land Tax or Premium Property Tax – its ultimate and most inequitable expression) then one simply cannot support Property Value Based Taxation as being a valid and equitable mechanism to raise the revenue needed by any of the three tiers of our governmental system. My argument is not that the rating system should be tinkered with to make it Page of 1214 less outrageously inequitable than it is (and when you get some residents paying ten, fifteen or twenty times that which others pay for the identical set of goods and services without relative income being included in the calculus, it clearly is inequitable - in fact it would be illegal in any other sphere of society) my argument is that it ought to be scrapped entirely and the funds raised via some other mechanism! The mechanism I favour is that most equitable, progressive and egalitarian of revenue gathering methods – INCOME TAX!! Property Value Based Taxation is an anachronistic remnant from medieval Europe and the days before a proper monetary economy and modern accounting methods allowed a fairly accurate picture of an individual’s income and so their true ability to pay tax over any given period. In those times the Laird or Crown had little choice but to confiscate a percentage of an assumed output from a property regardless of the hardship any error might impose. Today we do have a choice and we should exercise it. Property Value Based Taxation is inherently regressive and inequitable. It is therefore unacceptable as a class of taxation in a society that espouses fairness and so should be totally scrapped. The logic is simply inescapable and the multiple benefits of doing so are obvious ... now that I have pointed them out. EPILOGUE The reader will have seen that the section above that described our taxation travails in Australia was written as a brief to a tax advisor who we were hoping would give us some better news on our taxation position here in New Zealand once we became tax residents of this country than that which had been outlined by our accountant. We intended to ultimately bring our total assets over here and start a business based on our farm property and we are in fact currently in the throes of doing exactly that. Initially however, we had to leave our residual investments in Australia and maintain our tax free position over there. The crushing news from both accountant and advisor was that the New Zealand tax system, whilst it recognises accumulated tax losses incurred after one becomes a tax resident, it does not recognise such tax losses incurred prior to becoming a tax resident. Consequently, we had to make a decision whether to come to live permanently in New Zealand and simply write off the fifteen million dollar tax loss still extant in Australia, or whether to move back to Australia and be tax free for ever more! We chose New Zealand. But, given that we are presently attempting to begin an agri- tourism business on our Wanaka farm that will first entail a twelve month $100k Resource Consent battle with Queenstown Lakes District Council just to get our concept approved, and then the development itself will soak up several million dollars - the entirety of our residual Australian assets ... it is somewhat galling to have been paying full taxation here in New Zealand on income that is unassailably tax free to me in Australia and to then see a giant tourism operator like A.J. Hackett be handed a half million dollar government grant last year to develop some new adrenaline saturated canyon swing whilst we get to battle on alone as usual. Page of 1314 I have to say that it would be very, very welcome to see a government, especially my government, do something rational and appropriate in respect of taxation for a change. So please take a look at what the Australian system did to us and, for pity sake, don’t do any of it to New Zealanders. Yours faithfully ... Rik Deaton, Wanaka. P.S. Several year ago I heard the CEO of Google in the UK literally boasting on national television there that his company paid no tax in the UK at all and barely any in any other jurisdiction. “We don’t write up the international tax law” he smarmed, “we just use it to our advantage”. If true, this is beyond outrageous and should somehow be addressed. Page of 1414

Submission to the Tax Working Group 1 Introductory Comments The political motivation for the review of the tax system is grounded in issues of fairness, income and wealth inequality and profound problems in the New Zealand housing market. There are indeed major issues facing New Zealand which can be enumerated as follows: 1. Wage growth has failed to keep pace with the real cost of living. 2. House prices have increased at a rate that vastly exceeds inflation and wage growth. 3. Home ownership rates are falling. 4. Increasing numbers of New Zealanders are becoming trapped in the rental accommodation market and after paying rents are unable to save for a home of their own or indeed fund reasonable quality of life objectives ( such as enjoying a healthy diet, good health care or having a stable home and strong community connections ). 5. There is a major imbalance between the amount of money foreign investors extract from the New Zealand economy as profits ( approximately $20 billion pa ) versus the amount of money New Zealanders earn from their foreign investments ( approximately $5 billion pa ). 6. Societal infrastructure is not receiving the level of investment needed to sustain quality outcomes in core areas such as education, health care and transport. 7. There is significant under-investment in training of doctors and teachers and many critical public sector jobs are poorly paid. 8. Increasing incidence of mental health issues is attributable in part to the increased personal pressures faced by ordinary people in an economy that is not serving the common good or the interests of ordinary people. 9. There is insufficient funding available for research & development, innovation and business development. Few start-up companies of note remain in New Zealand ownership for long. 10. The working for families program is effectively a wage subsidy for businesses operating in the face of extreme competitive pressure; potential threats of off-shoring to lower cost jurisdictions; or in low margin industries. It is unlikely to be sustainable indefinitely. 11. There is evidence of growing levels of unfunded future liabilities in the welfare system due to changing demographics and in particular with respect to superannuation funding. 12. Rates of poverty and deprivation are at absolutely unacceptable levels and we appear to be breeding the foundation for future social problems, criminality and welfare costs through our collective failure to ensure children are well-cared for. 13. Free trade agreements are no longer about free trade but have become implements of social re-engineering that are attempting to drive common standards into economies. The investor state dispute resolution provisions are of particular concern in that they provide the right for investors to sue the State in the event government policies affect investment returns. This should be seen as a blatant attempt to constrain democratic freedom and create undeserved and biased protections for a privileged class of international investors by removal of risks that would otherwise be an intrinsic part of the investment landscape. These issues cannot be solved through changes to the tax system alone. Indeed, some of the changes proposed to the tax system by experts and commentators will in fact be highly counterproductive to solving these issues. The issues require solutions defined in a much broader strategic framework. Requirement to be Forward Looking This framework must necessarily be forward looking and include consideration of the future pressures that New Zealand will face from major disruptive factors such as: 1. Climate change related damage to low altitude infrastructure and properties; impacts on agricultural outputs; impacts on job security; disruption to business and governmental revenue streams; and consequential financial market instability. 2. Climate change adaption costs and emission reduction costs. 3. Artificial intelligence and robotic automation which it is estimated by McKinsey will eliminate 800 million jobs globally by 2030. This will affect the fabric of society in a highly negative manner by reducing personal incomes, impacting the ability of many people to care for themselves or their families, reducing income tax and disrupting markets. The required strategic framework requires politicians to abandon blind ideological nonsense and proceed based on verifiable fact-based analysis of problems, cause and effect, risks and solutions. This constraint cuts left and cuts right across the political spectrum. Instead of just fighting about redistributing the scraps from an under-performing economy, we need to be concentrating on creating a larger economic pie as well as ensuring that all people in our society receive a respectful and decent social dividend to sustain their lives at more than a subsistence level. Entitlement Wealthy people are not worthier human beings. Furthermore, they are not wealthy in isolation. They are wealthy because of the opportunities existing in the society in which they live, education and healthcare, stable food supplies, stable legal systems and the markets the society creates through the needs of businesses and citizens and the ability of businesses and citizens to buy goods and services that meet their needs. Usually wealthy people become so with as a result of simple good luck and they could in fact be replaced by any number of other equivalently capable people who would be similarly rich given the same fortunate breaks. It is true that some wealthy people have a deluded sense of entitlement as a result of becoming rich. There may well be fewer lucky breaks available in future. The scale of disruption to employment from artificial intelligence and robotic automation will span all levels of society and will significantly erode the basis of the traditional conservative view that poor or unemployed people have made bad life choices and are responsible for their own demise. It’s certainly true that some people are responsible for their predicaments or act in ways that load unconscionable burdens on the State and have a false sense of irresponsible entitlement. However, in future many ordinary hard-working people stand to be seriously affected by job losses from artificial intelligence and robotic automation leading to the need to consider what people are entitled to receive from the society in which they live and what constitutes sufficiency at both ends of the wealth spectrum. Capitalism and Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Automation. It is said that the capitalist desire to eliminate labour costs through automation is unstoppable. In the absence of regulation, companies will seek to locally optimise their business operations using artificial intelligence and robotic automation, shedding jobs and relying on other actors, especially the State, to deal with the impacts of job losses. Job losses on a major scale will affect market demand and diminish company profits. Countries that have lost manufacturing jobs to low cost Asian countries have on balance been spectacularly unsuccessful in creating equivalent replacement jobs. Many former manufacturing workers in the American ‘rust belt states’ now have multiple low paid menial jobs instead of a single job supporting a middle-class lifestyle. There is no reason at all to believe that job losses to artificial intelligence and robotic automation will play out any differently. Governments faced with falling income tax takes will need to increase tax from other sources, including companies. Therefore, a company having invested in automation may well find its markets are diminished and face increased taxes to fund welfare income for displaced employees. One must ask whether the combination of capitalism and artificial intelligence and robotic automation will of necessity result in strong and active socialism becoming the entrenched political norm. Equally, one must ask whether at a societal level, where all costs must be accounted for, it makes sense to invest in artificial intelligence and robotic automation technologies that will render human beings less valuable and less employable, if not redundant in large numbers. Would it not be better to design society to meet human needs and avoid non-productive disruptions based in the desire of company owners to achieve self-centred local optimisation of company profits? The Government must urgently consider the full picture in respect of artificial intelligence and robotic automation and ensure that the overall interests of society are identified and represented. Businesses do not exist independently of society and have a critical role to play within society. Exclusion We need to understand that the consequences of excluding people from achieving good outcomes in a society are profound. Apart from the direct human impacts, we erode the basis of civil society. When a person does not get a good education; cannot get proper health care; cannot get a job; cannot buy a house; is trapped in rental accommodation or lives in the garage; is faced with grinding poverty and a subsistence income; or when they lose these benefits; or when they are threatened with the loss of their social position or standing then they question the value of their personal social contract. When people do not feel they belong to a properly functioning society that works for them, they retreat to partisan identities to regain their lost sense of attachment and their beliefs can be become bound to those partisan identities. Facts and rationality become less important in forming their opinions or determining their actions which are then most strongly influenced by partisan messaging. Exclusion, diminishing opportunity, loss or the threat of loss - these are the sources of the emerging post-truth society. Accordingly, we see lies, dishonesty, denialism and fact aversion more and more commonly in political discourse despite the ready availability of information. We have seen National Party leaders absurdly denying the reality of climate change and denying the existence of a housing crisis. Shaping the Debate It is likely that the debate around tax will become a contest of rich versus poor. However, it is imperative that the framework for addressing the issues confronting New Zealand includes economic and competitive strategies that serve the common good of New Zealanders and faces the harsh realities head on. This means we must both look after the interests of less well-off, less skilled and disadvantaged people; we must also look after the interests of portable highly skilled people upon whose shoulders the competitive success of our country depends; and we must also become expert in creating, attracting and retaining wealth in our society for the benefit of all of our citizens. Essential strategies must be implemented and sustained across changes in Governments and not fall victim to short-term left-versus-right policy oscillations. They require a sense of national team work. 2 Core Strategy In a world with less work available for citizens, income tax revenues will fall. Societal wealth and the ability of the state to provide services to its citizens will increasingly be determined by the assets the society owns and the returns derived from those assets. Net societal wealth will also be affected by the costs imposed by external owners of assets deployed within that society. Therefore, we need to encourage societal ownership of financial assets that provide passive incomes and appreciate in value. We need to rapidly and dramatically increase the size of our sovereign wealth funds. We need to encourage individuals to invest in financial assets that provide passive incomes and appreciate in value to complement this strategy. We need to create an environment in New Zealand that is highly conducive to long term ownership of financial assets and businesses that operate domestically and globally. We need to constrain the outflows of profits from foreign investments in our economy through a strategy of achieving predominantly domestic ownership of the majority of high quality New Zealand based assets. We need to leverage improving life expectancy and health status to reduce superannuation costs in a compassionate manner. We need to recognise that the world must address core problems relating to climate change and ecological stress and that the required changes are opportunities that we should embrace through research and development, commercial innovation, business development and ownership positions in emerging technologies and businesses. For example, by adopting biofuels, electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, we could avoid purchasing $10b of foreign sourced fossil fuels each year. Implications for Taxation Policy • Introduce an additional specified-purpose progressive income tax to fund the expansion of New Zealand’s sovereign wealth funds. • Avoid the introduction of taxes that discourage ownership of financial assets by New Zealand citizens ( eg wealth taxes, land taxes, capital gains taxes ). The latter step should be seen as a clear point of competitive differentiation that will attract wealth to New Zealand over the long term. 3 The Housing Market The housing market is a market. Markets behave as markets do - supply and demand drive pricing. This is stating the obvious. Let us review specific examples of Government stupidity in respect of the housing market: • Failing to expand the Auckland Metropolitan Urban Limit in a timely manner in the face of constrained land supply and growing demand. • Failing to implement coordinated central and local government responses to increase national housing supply following the Christchurch earthquakes and the relocation of people away from the earthquake zone. • Failing to manage immigration numbers in line with the capacity of the building industry to create new homes. This has resulted in many people being priced out of their traditional market segment and cascading down to less desirable options ( eg Owned Home  Rental Home  Extended Family Homes  Garages  Cars  Shelters  Streets ). • Exposing the domestic property market to international investors through foreign trade agreements without proper safeguards such as capital gains taxes or land taxes to constrain foreign speculative investment and national interest tests. • Selling State houses when we are short of State houses. Rather than taxing New Zealanders because the market has run away to price bubble territory as a direct result of Government mismanagement, the housing market needs to be managed as a market using market fundamentals in order to achieve worthy societal goals aligned with the common good and the needs of all New Zealanders. Specifically, market prices (and price points within the market) need to fall to align with income levels which are linked to international labour cost structures and cannot easily be raised without jeopardising business viability. Actions to Remedy the Housing Market • Reduce immigration levels to better match supply and demand and vary immigration numbers upwards only in response to sustained improvement in housing market conditions. • Distribute immigration-linked growth around New Zealand rather than allowing it to be concentrated in Auckland driving huge infrastructure costs. • Implement a substantial social housing programme based on mass production and Government-funded bulk land purchases. • Remove the tax deduction for rental property losses where a person has a beneficial interest in more than one rental property and phase this remaining deduction out completely after a period of time. • There is strong anecdotal and preliminary evidence of significant offshore investment in the New Zealand property market and the likelihood of windfall profits being made. The Government has failed to take adequate steps to measure this issue. New Zealand needs to implement a strict data acquisition law that requires the legal owner of any land or property in New Zealand to register their details with the Government and to maintain this information as current at all times. Where trusts or companies are involved, then the details provide must identify ultimate shareholders or beneficiaries and define their country of residence. • Retain current settings for income tax but vigorously enforce tax rules around ‘trading for profit’ ensuring that investment intent is statutorily declared when land and property is purchased. • Consider making large scale Government land acquisitions on the perimeter of major cities before changing land zones to help provide more affordable housing to lower income people. • Apply a citizenship test to residential property purchases. Implications for Taxation Policy • Implement an 80% capital gains tax on foreign individuals and organisations investing in the New Zealand property market. A punitive rate should be defined to send a clear message that foreign speculation will not be tolerated. • Implement a 1% annual property value tax on all foreign individuals and organisations owning land or property in New Zealand. 4 Issues with Capital Gains Taxes Various pundits are in favour of implementing a capital gains tax with exceptions for the family home and perhaps the land that it sits upon but not the other land in the property title. Computation Even without the complexities in the ideas floated in the introductory comment above, the manner in which CGT is computed is intrinsically problematic. To be precise it should reflect: • Purchase cost • Interest costs • Maintenance costs • Insurance costs • Repair costs • Improvement costs • Rates • Inflation • Sales Price and appropriately reflect net present values of prior investments. To maintain accounting records to capture such data and maintain it over an extended period of time is a serious if not impossible burden. Simplistic workarounds such as setting arbitrary CGT rates of say 15% fail to recognise the underlying commercial reality and will inevitably lead to injustices. Lossless Conversion Between Asset Classes In a dynamic and responsive economy based on lightly capitalised small businesses, people need to be able convert an asset from one asset class to another without incurring ‘transactional losses’ arising from capital gains taxes. For example, a person having created a business should be able to sell that business without incurring a capital gains tax liability and be entitled to the full value of that asset either for their enjoyment or to reinvest in their next venture. Asymmetry Capital gains taxes are implicitly asymmetric. Liabilities are incurred and must be paid when asset values increase and the increase is realised. However, Governments never actually pay capital gains tax credits to tax payers when asset values decline and losses are realised. All one will get is a credit to offset future liabilities, which may or may not arise. The cyclic nature of some markets means that Governments may make repeated tax gains from the cyclic upswings in the value of the same asset ( depending on the timing of sale & purchase transactions ). Capital Gains Taxes Are Selective Capital gains taxes focus on the gains people might make but studiously ignore the costs people incur through the depreciation of assets such as home appliances, vehicles and indeed older houses as they reach their end of working life (eg 50-60 years). Capital Gains Taxes & Housing Markets There is no evidence that domestic capital gains taxes prevent house price bubbles. Indeed, the exemption of residential property from most capital gains regimes distorts asset values as people pursue profits from the exempted asset classes. 5 Changing Our Mindset Foreign Investment Foreign investment is in general bad for our country. It nearly always results in greater outflow of funds than inflow – otherwise the foreign investor would not bother making the investment. The alleged benefits foreign investment brings are seldom uniquely associated with foreign ownership. Kiwis are excellent at running companies. Kiwis can take our products to foreign markets. Every technology is a commodity or soon will be. Every business model will soon be improved upon. Virtually every Kiwi business that falls into foreign ownership is run leaner, offshores manufacturing, loses autonomy and is optimised to serve the best interests of its foreign owners by maximising exported profits. The banking industry is a classic example of an offshore profit pump. We have allowed our share market to be hollowed out though companies being bought and delisted. Then we complain when local investors turn to the property market in an effort to secure their future. Around fifty percent of the New Zealand share market is owned by offshore interests. This means fifty percent of listed company profits are exported to fund other countries’ future success not ours. End Free Trade Agreement Over Reach There is no good reason that our country should give a damn about the ‘rights’ of freedom-hating Chinese communist party acolytes to make money from investments in New Zealand. The free trade agreement with China gives a Chinese communist the right to sue the New Zealand Government if we damage their returns on property investments they have made in New Zealand. However, a New Zealander cannot even buy a property in China. One must seriously question the negotiating skills of the New Zealand Government. It is time to address such asymmetries in free trade agreements. Furthermore, it is time to work to limit the scope of scope of free trade agreements to trade in goods and services and to reject their incursions into our ability to govern independently or run independent sovereign strategies that serve the common good interests of New Zealand. Play Economic Hardball We need to play economic hard ball just like countries such as China, Japan and America already do. New Zealand is a tiny economy by comparison. We genuinely need to run unique strategies to prevent businesses in our economy being subsumed as ‘minor branch offices’ exporting profits to foreign companies. We need to remember that our exports are of increasing value in a growing world busy trying to feed itself. We must not under-estimate the value of what we have to offer by making concessions we do not need to offer or by accepting bad deals that have no basis in fairness (eg you cannot buy our real estate but we need to be able to plunder and pillage your real estate market). For example, a hungry China will quickly revolt and the Communists know that. They should therefore pay top dollar for the privilege of buying our high quality food. The Chinese already dominate global manufacturing and they should not be permitted to buy up our remaining productive assets and extract profits from our few remaining sources of potential wealth. We should not be afraid to tell them why we do wish to be dominated by their country with its offensive internal politics and freshly minted dictator. Visions of Alternative Outcomes There is at least a $15 billion per annum net deficit in our investment returns with the rest of the world. Over 60 years this is worth a nominal $900 billion dollars – and likely far more than we received when we sold off the related companies and assets to foreigners. In the current environment, we have to earn that money as a country or become poorer. Imagine how different the New Zealand Government accounts would be if instead our sovereign wealth funds generated a steady 5-8% return on $900 billion dollars. It might take two, three or four generations of work by New Zealanders to achieve such a change in our net financial position but we need to make a start and sustain the effort.

Page 1 Richard Moore 30 April 2018 Submission to the Tax Working Group “Future of Tax” To the members of the Tax Working Group: This submission is regarding the “Future of Tax” and the items set out in the “Submissions Background paper” dated March 2018, as well the spreadsheet and charts also published by the Tax Working Group which supplement the Submission Background Paper. The issues paper covers a very large range of matters and this submission is necessarily extremely brief in comparison. Many of the issues raised have both causes and effects far beyond NZ tax system. This submission approaches the background paper in the following order: 1) specific observations regarding the whole issues paper and tax system: 2) Answering appendix two); 3) Answering appendix three including chapter seven, and additional comments; 4) commenting on the extraordinary omission in Fig 21. Firstly, some “big-picture” commentary regarding the background paper: • I am strongly opposed to tax which people may not have some approximation of cash income to be able to pay with: for instance, land taxes above extremely minimal levels (IE substantially less than current land rates) and taxes on unrealised capital gains. Both such taxes are unfair by common principles and also highly regressive in that they force capital assets into the hands of those who are already cash-rich. • I am opposed to the income tax system attempting to modify behaviour. I specifically refer to income tax because I am in favour of “excise” taxes which attempt to, in economic parlance, “internalise the externalities” of a social ill. Using income tax to attempt to modify behaviour has numerous highly negative consequences including: o Distortion of investment in the economy as a whole; \[1\] Page 2 o Such devices being extremely regressive; o Necessary regulatory goals are less likely to be achieved. By that I mean, just because someone has the means to pay more for it, does not mean that something should be done: pollution by a poor person is no worse than pollution by a rich person, but the latter is more able to afford it. This does not achieve regulatory goals. • Many of the issues raised by the paper concern matters that are influenced by factors far beyond the NZ tax system, or indeed the whole NZ financial system. Purely for instance, pricing of housing in NZ is affected by numerous things, financial and otherwise, including the following: o Supply & demand, and also differences between ability to increase demand (via, say immigration) and to increase supply (IE by physical building of homes.) o Governmental stability in other parts of the world; o Ability to borrow from major banks secured against residential homes (contrast: ability to borrow secured against shares / commercial property / intangible assets.) o International financial matters; regulation as to local purchasers. No reasonable / imaginable change to our taxation system would counter the effects of these non-financial matters. • I have not commented below on the “Maori Economy” as it is outside my expertise and experience. However, in general, I believe that “affirmative action” is best taken outside the normal income tax system to avoid distortions, and lack of competitiveness which inevitably comes with broad-ranging subsidies. Secondly, to answer Appendix 2, “Design Issues With a Capital Gains Tax.” 1. I support the introduction of a realised capital gains tax, as long as it does not introduce distortions into the economy or tax system and does not have other undesirable consequences. This is likely to require extensive attention to detail in drafting such legislation. I am opposed to a tax on unrealised capital gains as being extremely regressive, and unfair to people who may, for a variety of reasons, be asset-rich and income-poor. To refer in order to the points raised in Appendix 2: a. Capital gains as part of income tax would seem to make both drafting and administration of such a tax easier, and a separate tax would greatly increase compliance costs for taxpayers (whereas a combined tax can reduce costly analysis relating to the nuance of capital / revenue distraction.) The drawback of this is that when a low-income individual derives a capital gain it is obviously all at one time, and they may pay a higher rate of tax on it than on their average marginal tax rate in Page 3 previous years. Also, having a capital gains tax introduced into our current system would usually have negative effects on the effectiveness and fairness of a) the PAYE tax-code system including that on NZ Super, and b) the standard-basis provisional tax system. These affects could potentially be balanced with changes other parts of the tax system (for instance IRD use-of money interest rules.) See my following comments regarding “deferred tax” also. Note that that a separate tax for capital gains would also have huge implications for the administration of the company imputation credit system. b. I strongly oppose a tax on unrealised capital gains unless full and penalty-free deferral of tax is given until the item is sold. To tax a capital asset when there is no easy possibility of realisation (for instance a property, rather than an easily divisible share investment) unfairly penalises and reduces opportunities for people who may be asset-rich and income-poor. It also penalises prudent financial management (IE people who save to buy income-producing assets over a long period of time, but do now have continued high incomes.) It is also likely to further penalise people who earn most of their income over a shorter period of their lives than most professional and trade careers (EG rugby players, or people with degenerative diseases.) While a “deferral system” (where tax is calculated but deferred until realisation) may assist those would be penalised by a single capital gain due to margin tax rates, the costs of calculation and administration would probably be prohibitive to both the taxpayer and IRD. “Disposals” of assets on death or matrimonial property settlement can probably be easily dealt with rules similar to the existing “rollover-relief” rules which apply to tax on depreciation recovered under such scenarios. c. To avoid distortions, a capital gains tax should be as wide as possible, except of things that are totally private in nature (see “H” below). Chapter 7 refers to the possibility of double-taxation of un-distributed profits on shares. Because of the way the imputation system works, this would probably only apply to publicly-traded or widely-held shares. I believe it can be assumed that the market would “price-in” the possibility of double taxation of un-distributed capital gains on such shares. d. Kiwisaver and other savings schemes should also be tax, to avoid ludicrous distortions. In any case, a tax on capital gains is almost always a disincentive to save, unless inflation is extremely low. e. Integration with current tax laws: as mentioned above, making capital gains part of ordinary income tax makes this vastly easier. f. Assets held off-shore by NZ Tax Residents should be subject to capital gains tax. (This is currently achieved in many cases through the FIF rules etc.) g. Non-residents should be subject to tax when they sell an asset that is domiciled in NZ. Apportionment of an assets owned in NZ by foreign entities, such as internally generated good-will of businesses in NZ, should be covered by rules similar to the existing transfer-pricing rules. h. I would argue that if we are taxing capital gains, a capital loss is just as valid an item to deduct to a capital gain is to assess. If capital gains are part of ordinary income tax, ring-fencing losses does not make sense; however care needs to be taken that totally private items that would normally be expected to reduce in value do not give rise to asymmetrical deductions. Page 4 i. Except in the case of “forced disposal” such as death, matrimonial disputes or government compulsory acquisition, rollover relief should not apply. Note: my answer to this question would be materially different if we were considering income tax on the family home. j. Death should give rise to capital gains tax on eventual realisation by the beneficiaries, within at most two generations. Immigration should give a deduction for provable assets held at the point of immigration (+/- effect of “transitional resident” rules.) Emigration should eventually incur a capital gains tax: for instance, after four years, as a “reflection” of the transitional resident rules. k. Gifts should be exempt from tax as long as they do not affect the integrity of the capitals gains rules. Gambling winnings should also be exempt, because a) gambling is already well taxed and b) allowing a fair system of gambling deductions would be problematic. All, of course, subject to tax-avoidance rules. l. If capital gains taxes are part of normal income tax, normal income tax rates would apply. If not, I suggest that a concessionary rate would be appropriate given inflation. m. Allowance should be given for inflation of capital gains, but this should be simple, and realistic. n. A de-minimus rule is probably necessary, but given the likely extent of such a carve- out it should be relatively low (A comparison, for instance, with the FIF de-minimus rules is not sensible because income subject to FIF de-minimus rules is subject to income tax under ordinary concepts.) o. For both the tax payer and IRD, there would be a huge administration cost of a separate capital gains tax. It is notable that the current policy of a PTS with no “taxpayer action” except under special circumstances would probably be up-ended. p. I oppose retrospective tax of past capital gains. Value at date of introduction seems fair, but is a larger compliance cost and is probably unworkable (imagine if most of the property in the country had to be valued in such a way as have a provable value under “balance of probability rules” at, say, 30/06/2019.) Assets acquired post introduction date is almost certainly best in terms of both policy and administration. q. Family Trusts should have the same “main-home” exemption as is currently in place for the “bright-line” rule. To reply to Appendix 3: 2. The future environment. The greatest risks facing our tax system/ base in the medium-long term are loss of revenue from: a. Overseas industries using economies of scale that will never be available in NZ, along with things such as labour laws and regulatory environments which enable far lower costs of goods. Under the current tax system (including “tax residence” of non-individuals) this will inevitably result in a lower NZ tax base; Page 5 b. A combination of the above and technology allowing hugely more corporate profits while paying less wages. The former, of course, a more likely to be able to be moved away from the NZ tax base. Against the threats, those of an ageing population are relatively small. 3. A “fair tax system” includes: a. “Horizontal” fairness; b. “Vertical” fairness having regard to the cost of living; c. That it is predictable and can be integrated into long-term plans; d. Not unduly dis-incentivising productive efforts of individuals; e. That it does not penalise individuals for good behaviour, including good decision- making; f. That it does not unduly “double tax” g. That it does not place unfair compliance burdens on taxpayers. 4. The current tax system in NZ is renowned for its “ease of use.” However, one disadvantage of this is that people that are not required to fill in a tax return, and as such often take the “path of least resistance” and just go with, say a PTS. The result is that many people completely ignore non-PAYE earnings (such as property income, and interest and investment income.) In particular, “quick and dirty” organisations such as can often be found in shopping malls advertising PAYE refunds, often ignore all non-PAYE income. This results in non-compliance across the whole sector. Two other points: a. I oppose taxes that have the dual use of being re-distributive and also modifying behaviour. Taxes to modify behaviour should be restricted to excise-type taxes. One reason for this is that there becomes a dichotomy between the desire to reduce a given behaviour and to increase revenue. (For instance: imagine the additional tax take if everyone in NZ took up smoking. Disclosure: the submitter does not smoke and doesn’t closely know anyone who does.) b. I have not commented on savings for retirement in this submission apart from in this section. It would seem that any special treatment for retirement savings would be inextricably linked to ongoing availability of NZ Super. In the current environment, the “tax-tax-exempt” system seems fair, and less distortionary than the alternatives; bearing in mind that special favourable treatment of retirement savings (including timing subsidies such as “exempt-exempt-tax”) are both distortionary and regressive (as “the poor” benefit far less from such systems.) 5. Our current tax system has the advantage of extreme simplicity and therefore extremely low compliance costs. At the same time, the low level on engagement necessary (See “4” above) can sometimes lead to ignorance of the law. The income tax system is not the place to regulate use of natural capital except to the extent that it regulates things which are nearly “public goods.” The only types of businesses which I am aware of which benefit from excessive deductions are those that are the focus of the general BEPS international tax rules. 6. The main inconsistencies in the current tax system concern international taxes through three mechanisms: a. BEPS type arrangements; Page 6 b. Overseas investments subject to FIF and similar rules which are given concessional tax treatment because of compliance issues; c. GST on imported low-value goods. 7. To reply to the issues raised in Chapter 7 specifically: Housing Affordability. 1. The only taxation issue raised there that is not already a fact is in relation to “ring- fencing” losses on rental properties (presumably referring to residential rental properties) from other income. I oppose this measure on the following basis: a. It introduces complexity into the tax system, and would be likely to lead to distortion of borrowing costs over difference types of assets. b. It would be somewhat “regressive” in that people with trading businesses, or a larger range of financial affairs than a single rental property, would be less likely to be subject to such a tax (in that they may obtain deductible borrowing costs in other trading rather than against a rental property.) c. This change would be likely to have significant immediate cashflow effect on some rental property owners, which they may not be able to afford (as opposed to say a realised capital gains tax where it could be assumed that people who have realised such capital gains could afford, cash wise to pay the tax on them.) Note: A senior government minister has said that few “mom and dad” type investors use negative gearing. This is completely at odds with both my experience in public accounting practice, and indeed with the IRD’s own figures. I wish to emphasise that housing costs, for both owners and renters are a) not predominantly affected by the tax system and b) are not inextricably linked. (The current extremely low rates of rent to capital value are related to a low cost of capital / borrowing, including the taxation effects applying thereto. It is unrealistic to expect that additional costs on rental property owners will not eventually translate into higher rents.) 2. Capital gains tax: covered above. 3. I am against a land tax. Is represents both a double tax on many levels and also, penalises those without high cash incomes. 4. Effective environmental taxation: for reasons mentioned above, I believe that environmental regulation is more effective that taxation. For instance, introducing a tax on dairy cows in relation to effluent flowing to waterways will make farmers poorer, but Page 7 will not reduce effluence flowing to said waterways. An excise tax may be applicable here. 5. Progressive company tax. I believe that this would be an unnecessary and extremely complex item: for instance, how it would integrate with the imputation credit system. (Note: a “progressive” company tax rate would in fact be regressive; because the company tax rate is lower than the top marginal tax rate, and reducing it would be an advantage to those already on the top marginal rate, and to business owners in general, who tend to be more well off than PAYE earners.) Please note that most working company owners are able to access lower marginal tax rates through “shareholder salaries.” The easy solution to the concerns regarding company tax rates is to allow non- taxed income to pass through to company owners without being tax in the company, and therefore taxed to the shareholders personally, by-passing the imputation credit system. This would allow all company owners (not only working shareholders) to take advantage of company profits (in the same way as “shareholder salaries”) without penalisation of non-refundable imputation credits. 6. I am strongly opposed to GST exemptions for particular goods. One of the strongest features of the GST system in this country is its universality which makes it a) easy to administer, b) hard to avoid without blatant tax evasion, c) predictable and non- distortional. Changing this would lead to hugely higher compliance costs, and more importantly, differing perceptions of “fairness.” Often-mentioned is the proposal to remove GST from “fresh fruit and vegetables.” If this is accepted then it is necessary to consider all other necessary costs of living, for instance sanitary products, car registration etc. I also note here that the cost of goods which seem incredibly expensive in NZ (for instance, the said “fresh fruit and vegetables”) are actually the result of far broader government policies and commercial realities, and the GST component is relatively negligible. (Kumuras are considered expensive at $9.00 a kilogram; they would still be expensive at $7.83 per kilogram if they did not incur GST.) Other comments: • You refer to a lower top marginal tax rate than Australia, for instance, but a higher income tax % of GDP. This is because the marginal tax rates in Australian increase at far higher levels than in NZ; you would need to be easily within the top 10% of income earners to be paying more tax in Austria than NZ. • Likewise, higher GST to GSP rates reflect the broad nature of our GST which also applies to “government services” such as car registrations and land rates. • You refer to an ageing population. This needs to be contrasted with a “less productive” population which may or may not be the same thing. • The so-called “gig economy” should be revenue-neutral except for the extra deductions afforded to independent contractors. It is likely that a broader “withholding tax net” would increase compliance. • We need to make sure we are taking items in the “sharing economy” appropriately (IE under current normal income principles.) • Many taxes are subject to double tax agreements. This needs to be considered when thinking about the effectiveness of taxes. • Tax charities are an ongoing loss or revenue to the system, and carry the potential for extreme avoidance. This should be considered. Page 8 • When considering tax outcomes, need to think about investment in productive assets but both private business and government. (For instance, if a company that was going to make capital investments is taxed to provide expendable items such as administration or social benefits, this has an effect on the overall productive investment of the economy.) Figure 21. I wish to draw your attention to the extraordinary omission in the chart “Fig. 21” and supporting figures in the relevant spreadsheet chart. This chart assumes that there are no capital gains achieved anywhere other than in housing. For instance, it assumes no capital gains either on shares or within a company (such as when a business division is sold with a goodwill profit.) I acknowledge that capital gains within a company cannot normally be distributed before wind-up, but their existence will allow distribution of other taxable retained earnings, or other “return of capital” methods. However, this omission makes Fig. 21 highly misleading. Submission regarding marginal effective tax rates that do not identify this error should be discarded. Thank you for your time. Yours Faithfully Richard Moore

This is very concerning to me as my husband and I own a family bach which we may gift over time to our children. While my bach might not be caught by the new rule, the possibility of a CGT raises many issues that I outline below. Ownership I am concerned how a CGT would apply to our current bach, or a future replacement bach, and how it might operate given that the ownership maybe with my husband and I and, in the future, our four children. Will a change in ownership from us to our children, either through gifting or inheritance, trigger CGT? Valuation The property cost us approximately $300,000. This included a free boat that we later sold for $2,000 – we had to get a warrant for the boat trailer first (that cost us about $100 and $300 for new tyres). Is our cost $300,000, $298,000 or $298,400? According to its current council valuation it is worth $450,000. The local real estate said that if we were to sell we would likely receive $500,000 (before his fees). While this sounds a like we have made a gain, it ignores the following that we have spent on the bach. From my memory: • We had to put on a new roof. This cost us around $25,000. When we purchased the bach there were leaks in the roof. It took us about three years to replace the roof. Should this expense be added to the cost of the house? • The roofer ordered the wrong length for the roofing iron. We agreed a deal and he did the boat shed roof for $5,000. The old roof on the boat shed was fine, but now it has a new roof. Does this add to the cost? • After about 7 years of owning it, we did major renovations. This included replacing the old kitchen and bathroom. We also put in new carpets and repainted everything. This cost us $150,000. I have not kept records of these transactions, although I will be able to get payment information from my bank. Given the kitchen and bathroom were replaced, do I reduce the original value of the bach as we no longer have those parts? If so, how do I value the old kitchen and bathroom? We sold parts of the old kitchen and bathroom on Trade Me, do we have to account for that? • We have spent money on landscaping the property including about $500 on planting native trees. Do I add this to the cost? What records do I need for this? Do I also include the new spades and shovels used only for these plants? • What do we do about the costs for plants that did not survive? As well as the native plants, we planted a range of fruit trees (approximate cost $200). Most of these succumbed to the rabbits. • Do we get any adjustment for inflation? The original purchase price of $300,000 (about 15 years ago) would no longer be sufficient to purchase a comparable property. • Part of the original house has its own bathroom. We just had to replace the toilet system, we do account for this? We are likely to replace the downstairs carpets, do we add this to the cost? • We purchased a table tennis table, this will likely be given to any subsequent purchaser. When we purchased the bach it came with a number of furniture items (sofa, kitchen table and TV). How do we treat these items? • When we purchased the boat, we had to spend $2,000 changing the garage so that the boat would fit it. This was building a box on the end of the garage so that the boat could fit in. This is a permanent feature to the garage but probably of no use to any new purchaser. Do we add this to the cost? Given all the issues above, I am unsure how I would value the bach if a CGT were to be introduced. Joint costs of separate costs Who claims the costs of capital expenditure– is it done via the relative share of the asset or does each owner carry their costs of the asset. We are having a debate over the veranda. My husband has said that if I spend my money we can add to the veranda for better sun protection. This will cost approximately $10,000. Will he be able to add to his share of the cost of the property when it is paid for with my funds or do I carry the entire cost. Gifting to our children As noted above, we are likely to gift part/all the bach to our children. We suspect at least one of our children will live overseas. Do overseas based owners pay CGT? They may not have an IRD number or do we have to keep the IRD number simply due to them owning part of the bach? Do they have to file anything with the IRD while they are overseas? If we do gift to the children, how will this impact on the working for families tax credits? Will the gift be caught and will they lose their working families tax credits? If we sell and make a gain, will this result in their tax credits having to be repaid? Do we have to employ an accountant? We don’t employ an accountant. Should I employ an accountant to keep track of all these costs? As you can see from this letter, I am confused as to how a CGT would work. Many Thanks Sarah Polaschek \[1\] \[1\]

This submission is made in a personal capacity and does not represent the views of my employer, Victoria University of Wellington. 2. I wish to comment briefly on the questions: “Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?” 3. A focus of my research lies with the application of human rights to taxation. I have a particular interest in the ethical and rights implications of behaviour modifying taxes (“BMTs”). 1 4. BMTs are not new 2 but we can observe “increasing use internationally of economic market-based instruments for the purpose of influencing the achievement of desired behavioural change and objectives, be they social, economic or environmental”. 3 5. The plastic bag environment levy introduced by Ireland in 2002 is commonly cited as an example of a successful BMT. 4 Very high rates of excise have also contributed to curbing tobacco use, 5 although tobacco taxes were traditionally designed to raise 1 See, in particular, Jonathan Barrett “Behaviour Modifying Taxes: Some Ethical Considerations” in Adrian Sawyer and Andrew Maples (eds) Taxation Issues: Existing and Emerging (Centre for Commercial and Corporate Law, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, 2011); Jonathan Barrett “‘Fat Taxes’: A Proportionality Approach” (2012) 18(3) New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy 242; Jonathan Barrett “The Human Right to Adequate Housing and Vacant Property Taxes” (forthcoming). 2 See, for example, the gin tax introduced by the Sale of Spirits Act 1750 (UK). 3 Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Circular PL 7/2016 - Implementation of the Vacant Site Levy as provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 (2016) <www.housing.gov.ie>. 4 See Sheila Killian “Environmental Taxes and the Double Dividend Hypothesis: A Case Study from Ireland” (2003) 18 Australian Tax Forum 407. 5 See, for example, Joy Townsend “Price and Consumption of Tobacco” (1996)v52(1) British Medical Bulletin 132. 2 revenue, rather than modify behaviour. BMTs are commonly proposed as contributory solutions to other health issues, such as obesity. 6 6. A BMT, such as the plastic bag levy, interferes trivially with autonomy, whereas taxes which seek to alter people’s choices about their health and bodies, raise significant human rights concerns. 7. Respect for human dignity is the root of all human rights. 7 According to the human rights jurist and commentator Aharon Barak, human dignity is ‘the freedom of the individual to shape an individual identity. It is the autonomy of the individual will. It is freedom of choice.’ 8 It is also a cornerstone of liberal democracy, expressed most persuasively by John Stuart Mill, 9 that individuals are ‘sovereign’ over their own bodies and are best placed to make decisions about their own health. 8. The findings of behavioural psychology show that people often make decisions which, from the perspective of an outsider, are not in their best interests. 10 9. Furthermore, behavioural economics has shown that people do not behave in the economically rational way of the presumed homo œconomicus. This insight has led to so-called libertarian paternalism or nudging, as popularised by Cass Sunstein. 11 Acceptance of the insights of behavioural economics does not mean that government should not use economic measures, such as BMTs, but implies a more nuanced understanding of how they may modify people’s behaviour. 10. Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of the presumption of autonomy and self- responsibility in liberal democracies. In other words, before government uses BMTs to 6 For an overview of proposed taxes, see March Suhrcke “Fiscal Policy Instruments to Improve Diet” (2010) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence <www.nice.org.uk>. 7 See the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, GA Res 217A (III), UN GAOR, 3rd session, 183 plen mtg, UN Doc A/810 (10 December 1948). 8 Aharon Barak The Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, Princeton (NJ), 2006) at 86. 9 See J S Mill On Liberty (1859). 10 See, for example, Dan Ariely Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions (HarperCollins, New York, 2010). 11 Cass R Sunstein Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism (Yale University Press, New Haven, 2014). 3 direct or nudge its citizens in particular ways, it should give proper consideration to human dignity, including autonomous decision-making. 11. Proportionality testing is the most appropriate way of ensuring that rights are taken into account when a BMT is proposed. 12. While it is trite that Acts of Parliament are not subject to judicial review in New Zealand, proportionality testing of administrative decisions provides useful guidance on respecting fundamental rights. According to the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court, proportionality “depends on an exacting analysis of the factual case advanced in defence of the measure, in order to determine i. whether its objective is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of a fundamental right; ii. whether it is rationally connected to the objective; iii. whether a less intrusive measure could have been used; and iv. whether, having regard to these matters and to the severity of the consequences, a fair balance has been struck between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community.” 12 13. Proportionality also underpins sound policy making. The Organization of Economic Cooperation Development Council on Regulatory Policy and Governance provides extensive guidance for policymakers on proportionality analysis. 13 The OECD guidelines are substantially similar to the judicial review process outline in 12. 14. Proportionality testing should be employed by policymakers before a BMT is introduced (ex ante analysis), and by administrators after a reasonable period of time following the introduction of the BMT (ex post facto analysis). 15. In the light of this sketch of proportionality: “Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour?” a. BMTs should be considered as a component of a suite of measures designed to remedy social mischiefs. b. However, such taxes must be transparent. The risk is run of a plethora of ‘invisible’ taxes. 12 Bank Mellat v Her Majesty’s Treasury (No. 2) \[2013\] 4 All ER 533, \[2013\] UKSC 39, \[20\] (Lord Sumption). 13 Recommendation of the Council on Regulatory Policy and Governance (2012) <www.oecd.org>. 4 c. A BMT, whose revenue is ringfenced to contribute to solving an identified social mischief, may be preferable to one whose revenue goes to the general account. 14 16. “If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes?” a. BMTs that are likely to have only trivial effects on autonomy but lead to positive social or environment outcomes, such as a plastic bag levy, are the best candidates. b. BMTs that seek to alter people’s bodies and health, may be considered but must be subject to rigorous proportionality testing. 14 For example, the British Columbian Empty Home Tax, revenue from which will be reinvested in affordable housing initiatives.

I am happy to be contacted by the Working Group to discuss the submission if required. Summary of recommendations 1) Process - The TOR of the Working Group need to be broadened to include the whole of the tax, benefits and transfers system and consider the context of overall public service funding. - Brief public consultation like the Working Group’s quiz should focus on desired rather than ‘likely’ outcomes and not present preferences as mutually exclusive by default. - There should be a further consultation period with the ability to hold public discusssions with officials in community settings. 2) Overall taxation - Overall taxation should be increased in order to at least maintain if not improve public services and support. - This is important for demographic equity and fairness, including gender, ethnicity and intergenerational equity. - We should move away from our heavy reliance on taxing work and income and broaden our tax base to new taxes, including taxing ‘bads’ like speculative transactions and pollution. 3) Specific taxes and credits - We must introduce a capital gains tax on property other than the family home. - Consideration could be given to taxes on other capital gains by using a financial threshold but this is far less important for social and health outcomes than taxing property investment and speculation. - Land taxes may be unfair on low income asset holders and are effectively already in existence with rates. - Rates are an inadequate revenue source for some councils, and difficult to meet for some residents, central Government should put more money into important local infrastructure that has national benefits. 2 - Emissions taxes should be introduced. They need to be comprehensive, not just ‘carbon’, have regard to ability to pay, be targeted at commercial activity where possible and be offset by investment or subsidy in clean technology. - Pollution taxes should only be ‘offsetting’ where this has a net environmental benefit and doesn’t allow ‘pollution privilege’, in this circumstance they should be encouraged. - New Zealand’s income taxes, benefit and transfer system need to be reviewed together because of significant and complicated problems with abatement rates. - Income taxes should be more progressive with an income free tax threshold up to a ‘living wage’ and then spread more broadly over a larger income spread, with an additional tax bracket for very high incomes. - The definition of ‘income’ needs to be standardised for benefits, taxes, credits and subsidies and made fairer particularly for low to middle income families. - Small goods and services provided as family or community support should not be considered ‘income’. - The gender impacts of Working For Families tax credits should also be explored. - Given New Zealand’s high and rapidly increased levels of wealth inequality, the IRD should be given more powers to track and report on wealth. This information could form the basis of a broader public debate about wealth taxes. - Financial transaction and financial activities taxes should be considered as a means to raise revenue and reduce harmful speculative activity. - G.S.T. should be reduced to promote progressivity but not complicated by exemptions. - Progressive company taxation should be introduced at the same rate as personal income, and company tax fraud and avoidance should be better considered and prevented. - There should be the option of easier and more frequent company tax returns to implement a progressive rate with less major adjustments needed. 4) Education and social sustainability - New Zealanders need better education about tax theory, obligations, practical systems, and greater transparency about our tax arrangements to protect our collective resilience. 3 Full submission 1) Submissions on the process Please note that these are recommendations for improvement in isolation of what I believe is overall a positive exercise. Firstly, I am concerned by the limited Terms of Reference of the Working Group, which will make any recommendations ineffective in isolation. The Tax system needs to be considered as a whole, rather than piecemeal, to avoid unintended consequences and preserve fairness and relativity. Tax does not exist in isolation or for the sake of it- it also needs to be considered in the context of the public services it provides and the benefits and transfers system which it complements. Secondly, I am concerned that there are false exclusive choices being set up in the consultation process. For example, the ‘quick polls’ (https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/have-your-say-future- tax/purpose-of-tax ) set up choices between the potential impacts of taxation which in the real world is not a choice- a single tax can achieve multiple aims, and we should not seek some kind of exclusivity of purpose, but rather, desired social outcomes. ‘Encouraging New Zealanders to make better choices’ and ‘Encouraging investment in some types of business’ could be seen as the same thing. Isolating ‘core services’ from ‘supporting those in New Zealand who need help’ makes public social services like MSD automatically seen as outside of the ‘core’ purpose of the tax system. I would hope that the results of this consultation are not presented as alternative comparable options to inform policy choices. Thirdly, the framing of some questions to ask about likely outcomes rather than desired outcomes is problematic in a society where members of the public should not be expected to be tax or economic experts, especially when this is not a standard educational subject. For example, asking whether tax can ‘make housing more affordable’ is not a question that the vast majority of respondents will be able to answer based on experience or evidence. It would be better to present a variety of likely outcomes and ask which one is ‘fair’ or ‘better for New Zealand’ and then have those in the public service tasked with implementing democratic outcomes and designing policy options most likely to achieve them. Finally, I note that the consultation period has been quite short, and it is difficult to engage the public outside of those notified by interest groups in such a tight turnaround. It would be better to have a longer process or a second round that allows public discussions in q and a sessions with officials in community settings to get a more balanced view. 4 2) Overall taxation Given that there is a choice between retaining current overall levels of taxation and decreasing public services and support or raising overall taxation to at least maintain current services and support, I strongly submit that New Zealand’s quality of life, democratic stability, climate change adaptation process and intergenerational equality demands the latter. Taxation and public services are not gender, age or ethnicity neutral either- more progressive taxation and greater public service provision protect the lives of women, the very young and old, and tangata whenua, and the Working Group should actively seek the representatives of and advocates for these groups in the consultation process. Because the nature of work is changing to more causalised and less secure work, more global employment arrangements, and with an aging population, New Zealand risks being overly reliant on taxing personal income. GST tax is also vulnerable to economic downturns, as is company tax. It would be preferable to develop new forms of taxation to increase the stability of New Zealand’s revenue base, while also moving away from taxing productive and socially beneficial activity, like work, to using taxation to reduce or help pay for negative activities like financial speculation and pollution. 5 3) Specific taxes Capital gains The lack of a capital gains tax alongside almost no purchasing restrictions has contributed to New Zealand’s housing no longer being a home for our people but becoming a speculative commodity for global markets, as well as over-leveraged domestic investors. This negatively impacts on our health, our social cohesion, educational impacts for children and our extremely high levels of personal debt. It encourages poor rental housing stock quality (and I’ve lived in some not fit for pets, the reality of this problem is heart-breaking) because the primary investment is the capital gain rather than the rent.It contributes to New Zealand having one of the highest rates of transience in the developed world, and longer periods of vacancy despite a housing shortage, particularly in Auckland. There is no good or fair reason for treating income earned on the sale of investment property differently to other income and leaving it tax free and there are a myriad of social, health and equity reasons for taxing it, as well as this providing another revenue stream for social services. The only reasons for not doing so are political. I support a capital gains tax on property other than the family home for the sake of simplicity. Other capital gains taxation on larger investments could have a financial threshold, but investment property is the most urgent change needed. Land tax Rates are already effectively a land tax, and with the addition of capital gains which is on the realisation of an asset, this seems like it would unnecessarily burden those who hold unrealised assets on low incomes. Given the aging population with limited retirement savings after high mortgages and unstable work through the 1980’s- late 90s, a land tax may have unintended unfair consequences. As a related note, local and regional councils experience large inequities in raising revenue and meeting infrastructure needs which results in some poor local outcomes with populations unable to meet rate rises, and councils unable to make good tendering or maintenance decisions. The downstream costs of this often have national impacts – see for example the issues with faecal and agriculture contamination of drinking water through lack of enforcement and maintenance resource. This has an impact on the health system and on productivity. It would make sense for the central Government to increase its investment in local infrastructure to build resilient communities and to balance the revenue and funding inequities experienced by local governments. Pollution and emissions taxes Using a tax to ‘offset’ polluting behaviour can be an unhelpful way of framing this option, especially when looking at climate changing emissions- there is no ‘offset’ cost that we know of for global mass extinction based on emissions projections. This can simply encourage continued polluting behaviour for those that can ‘afford’ it. 6 However, in a long-term phase in to a net zero emissions economy an emissions tax will be a useful price signal to switch behaviour of consumers and firms and make sustainable options relatively more affordable, especially if rising overall tax take allows greater investment in and subsidy of clean energy technology. Given New Zealand’s high per capita contribution to climate change which is largely due to agricultural and transport emissions, it is important that any emissions tax: - Not simply be a ‘carbon’ tax but be an emissions tax to capture the disproportionate impact of methane on climate change and - Be balanced by the ability to pay and relative impact on the lives of the least well off, particularly when those in isolated rural communities are reliant on petrol-based transport for work, health and community, yet these communities often receive little in the way of public transport services or subsidies. - Be seen to be contributing towards affordable and sustainable public services and energy options. - Be targeted at commercial activity where possible over consumption (bearing in mind pass-on). I generally support taxing other polluting activities if it can be shown that this does change behaviour to sustainable outcomes over time – but don’t support it if it simply allows the wealthiest to continue or take over polluting behaviour and industries at similar levels. Income tax brackets and abatements Despite the country-based comparisons in the background paper, New Zealand ranks poorly (115 out of 152 countries) for how well our tax system reduces inequality. 1 The personal income tax cuts implemented by the last National Government have reduced our Government revenue by approximately $1 billion or more per year, every year since the 2008/9 financial year and have not been reversed, contributing to the unsustainability of our public services and social support. Although this issue is outside the TOR of the working group, the progressivity of income taxes is the largest contributor the tax system can make to fairness and equality in a country, as well as to robust social outcomes (see, The Spirit Level, Piketty etc.), and I note that these factors are ones that the working group is considering. New Zealand’s very high cost of housing and living relative to incomes, and the abatement rates of other benefits, subsidies and transfers (Working for Families, childcare subsidies, student allowances, community services cards and the accommodation supplement, for example) means 1  Oxfam’s ‘Commitment to Reducing Inequality’ Index. https://www.oxfam.org.nz/reports/commitment-reducing-inequality-index-new-global-ranking- governments-based-what-they-are 7 that many young adults in particular with children are living in relative material poverty despite ‘good’ incomes, with the inability to build personal wealth. Our income tax system starts early with no tax-free threshold and rises over a relatively narrow band, up to $70,00 which is a decent, but not exceptionally high income and one that many Gen X and below families would struggle to service a mortgage or obtain a healthy rental on. Personally, I have been in a work situation returning from parental leave with another colleague who was forced to leave the position because the abatement of the above allowances plus the cost of childcare and transport to work meant she was losing income to stay in the workforce. Her paid career was put on hold, and society lost her income taxes generated from her salary. I have myself been in a position where I was similarly economically disincentivised to increase my income because of the interaction of abatement rates and the income tax thresholds. There needs to be a full investigation of the interaction between the benefit and transfer system and income taxes that takes the cost of living, especially housing in to account, with greater intergenerational equity as a specific goal in mind. The greatest amount of income tax is generated from those on the highest incomes, but it is of course less of their discretionary income. The low rate of top income tax and widening inequality, which most New Zealanders are concerned about, suggests that there is potential to raise additional revenue while increasing equity by adding a further tax bracket on very high personal incomes. This would need to be accompanied by greater capacity for the IRD to prevent, detect and rectify tax avoidance, particularly by high net worth individuals. There is no convincing evidence that this would deter the production of wealth and income in New Zealand- particularly when most high net worth individual’s attraction to New Zealand is not the tax arrangements but New Zealand’s lifestyle opportunities. Similarly, I support a tax-free threshold up to a ‘living wage’, and then a more graduated introduction of tax brackets over a wider range of personal incomes. The way that personal ‘income’ is treated regarding personal tax and benefits also needs to be investigated and corrected for fairness. For instance, a family member helping out by paying for a car registration or buying a load of groceries for someone in need with a new baby, or a grandparent paying for childcare is counted as ‘income’ towards working for family payments, but not for tax purposes. This is counterintuitive and I would submit, not even realised by most WFF recipients. It is open to subjective interpretation by IRD officials and highly contestable at the margins. Apart from the absolute difficulty of determining, submitting and enforcing this, there is an inequity in that there is a tax credit abatement of a benefit for the provision of such services although the purchaser has already paid income tax on the money used to purchase the goods- and if, for example, the grandmother were not in paid work but were living close by and providing her time for exactly the same childcare, this would not be counted as ‘income’. The irony is that those forced to live further away from their social support networks often do so because they are in economically precarious situations or work, and in this case, the family is penalised for providing support to their loved ones most in need. s 8 The above situation is not hypothetical but is again something I have personally experienced. On the other hand, it pained me that when my family was able to help gift me a not insubstantial sum for the deposit against a first home (and a roof over one’s head must surely be considered an ‘essential expense’) this was completely tax free and not counted as income. It goes without saying that income definitions in the above examples privilege the rich. Similarly again, and this may appear a minor point but is an illustration on why the system is so difficult to navigate, when such small support for groceries or childcare is provided to the family it is counted as family ‘income’. However, if it is not declared then a Working For Families debt is lodged against the individual ‘recipient’ only, despite WFF also being usually used (and legally treated) as the family’s (untaxed) income. In the situation of a separation this leaves just one partner, usually the mother with an IRD debt for support potentially provided to the family by in-laws and tax credits assessed against the personal income of both parents. Given that Working For Families tax credits are so widely received, and effectively are a subsidy for low wages in New Zealand versus the high cost of living, particularly for women in the paid workforce, it is worth considering whether there is a gendered impact on wages or other gendered impacts of this tax credit. Wealth tax New Zealand’s wealth inequality is much greater than income inequality and has increased rapidly over time. It is resulting in poor social and democratic outcomes where there is no equality of opportunity and contributing to a concentration of economic and political power that makes reversing income inequality and absolute material poverty even more difficult. New Zealand does not do well at tracking and reporting on accumulation of wealth. The IRD should be given greater powers to monitor wealth and report, in aggregate or anonymised fashion, on the wealth of individuals and companies. This would be the first step in considering the implementation of a wealth tax/taxes, and public discussion and input into whether this is desirable is an important debate, and one that must be well informed. The ability to decide whether resource allocation is ‘fair’ is a central tenant of genuine democracy, but first we need to know what New Zealand’s true resource allocation now is. Financial transaction or financial activities tax I support the exploration of the above to increase overall revenue and protect against non- productive or predatory speculative activity. G.S.T G.S.T is an inherently regressive tax in that the poor are less able to divert money to savings or investments but must spend it on goods and services. I support a blanket reduction in G.S.T and a replacement with more progressive taxation options or taxing of ‘bads’ rather than ordinary consumption. I don’t support exemptions for products like fresh fruit and vegetables because the problem of the price of healthy food is less about tax and more about restricted competition 9 in domestic supply, price mark-ups and exposure to global markets. 2 There is also the problem of administration and definition, and a simple regime works best. Where there are worthy objections to the tax on, for example, sanitary items, other solutions have more merit for the argument than G.S.T removal, like PHARMAC provision of essential products. Company tax To promote innovation and local business, company tax rates should be made progressive to the same rate as (revised) personal income taxes. The lower company rate relative to personal income tax rates is an incentive for tax avoidance and should be corrected. Company tax arrangements generally should be looked at to avoid potential loopholes that allow tax avoidance or fraud. More regular ‘mini’ tax returns throughout the year that are voluntary, simple and also available online would allow businesses to adjust their tax rates more quickly if income fluctuated unexpectedly. 2  https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard- debates/rhr/document/49HansD\_20100908\_00001000/goods-and-services-tax-exemption-of-healthy- food-amendment See Russel Norman’s speech quoting research by Sue Kedgley. 10 4) Tax literacy and democracy New Zealand does not provide universal education about our personal tax obligations, about how to navigate the IRD systems or about how tax works and what it funds. This opens us up to an undervaluing and undermining of the tax system because the benefits of tax take are not ‘visible’, whereas the benefits of tax cuts to individuals are more tangible- even if not more valuable. It is commendable that the Tax Working Group has started a public engagement process around tax. However, we currently lack the facts on tax (for example, transparency around multinational profits and tax, the tax arrangements of high net worth individuals and effective marginal tax on different income groups and family structures, and the untaxed income of charities and trusts) to have an informed democratic process to review our tax arrangements. Government should invest more in tax compliance, transparency and education to preserve the functioning of government and the quality of New Zealand lives when we are facing a future of global instability, climate change and increased risk of social breakdown and violence due to resource hoarding and shortages. It’s important that we understand that tax is a mechanism for sharing, for protecting society and for increasing our collective resilience in the face of fear and uncertainty.

New Zealand has an admirably simple tax system compared to many other countries and our efforts should concentrate on making it more simple and efficient prior to considering increased taxes or changing the tax mix. Our lack of state governments keeps our administrative burden comparatively low and this flat governmental structure should be taken full advantage of. The Discussion Paper talks of Vertical and Hortizontal equity. I would put forward that there needs to be a third pillar to this equation and that is Reciprocal equity and is the single most inequitable aspect of our tax system. The most important economic unit in our society is the family. It is the basis of our social structure and failing families have widespread implications for society as a whole. The current tax and the welfare system are fundamentally out of step. When it comes to the Government levying taxes, they are based on individual income at their relevant marginal tax rate – but when it comes to the government handing out funds to the population it is based on the family income and the number of dependents one has. The interaction of the two regimes and the Working for Families regime is incredibly complex and leads to situations in which those on low to medium incomes are effectively paying up to 65% in tax and reduced benefits for each additional dollar earned in income. (30% in income tax, 20% in reduced Working for families and 15% in GST on purchases). This is a significant disincentive for wage earners to aim to earn more and better their situation when the government is going to be taking the lion’s share of any additional income they earn. The tax system should be reformed so that the family unit forms the basis of marginal tax rates and aligned to the welfare system so that those on low to medium incomes are not subject to high effective tax rates, and to more equitably treat single income families who pay more tax on the same income than dual income families. How would this work? Income would be assessed based on each family, with both partner’s earnings being consolidated and taxed at levels that are half of the rate of individuals. In addition, for each child in the union a tax free threshold should be introduced to recognise the contribution the children will be making to the community in the future, and the cost of raising them. A tax free threshold should also be introduced similar to that used in Australia to limit the negative impact of high effective tax rates at low incomes which is not equitable, and frankly pointless if much of the tax is being refunded via working for families anyway. For those on lower incomes welfare payments will still be required, but with this system the tax free threshold will ensure that the reduction in welfare for each additional dollar earned doesn’t exceed the top marginal tax rate. This system better recognises the contribution given to society of stay at home parents who forego earning a wage to invest in a more valuable and meaningful occupation – raising the next generation. This system also negates the need for a myriad of tax minimisation strategies such as partnerships, trusts and companies that are used to better flatten the income out in family owned businesses. This will reduce the compliance requirements of these businesses whilst simultaneously giving salary and wage earners the ability to be taxed in a more equitable fashion. GST The current mix and rate of GST should not be altered. The introduction of GST in Australia was a comparative minefield compared to New Zealand with the exclusion of basic food items. Although a noble aim, the administratively simpler resolution to the fact that those on lower incomes spend a much higher proportion of their income on food is to provide them with an increased welfare payment or lower tax rate (or higher tax free threshold). Instead of taking this pragmatic approach Australia had to grapple with what was considered “basic” food. For example a bbq’d chicken was basic, but what if you cut it in quarters? Please refer to: https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=GII/GSTIIFL1/NAT/ATO/00001 GST is administratively simple in NZ – keep it this way. If there is a perceived inequality in how it impacts those on lower incomes – increase their benefits as compensation, do not make the GST regime more complex. Housing Affordability Housing affordability is impacted by many complicated factors so prior to making the situation more complex by attempting to implement new taxes to address the issue the government should address the current causes of housing unaffordability in the first instance. 1. Development Contributions – Are levied by local councils as a “user pays” cost to the development of new housing sections. The theory being that covering this cost via standard rates is inequitable to existing land owners. This concept is fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons: a) Those that are charged the development contribution may not be the ones increasing resources. Take for example an elderly couple downsizing to a smaller newly constructed home in the same town they have always lived in. They will be charged a development contribution whilst the existing house they sell could be sold to a new family or entrant into the region who are the ones that are creating the increased impact on council resources. b) The development contribution pushes up the cost of all housing in the area. If costs of construction are increased by government charges, existing homes will now be by default become more valuable c) No other “user pays’ system operates like this. For example when signing onto your electricity service or mobile phone service you are not charged a disproportionate charge (eg 14 times your yearly bill) to connecting to the service d) Development Contributions are levied against new home owners who have to pay for them, whilst the change in policy has caused existing home owners homes to be worth more for no consideration. It has shifted wealth from new home owners to existing home owners. e) Development contributions are disproportionately more expensive on smaller constructions on a per metre basis. f) All houses, both existing and newly built all have the potential to be used by new entrants into the area. As such it is inequitable to levy development charges on only new construction g) As each new residential unit is built it is able to take advantage of the economies of scale of pre-existing infrastructure, as such there is not a linear increase in the cost to council. Local councils should revert to the previous system whereby development costs were financed via annual rates. This would reduce the cost of new building whilst more accurately reflect the long term cost of services provided to the real estate asset class. 2. Local Planning Laws – Long term district planning provides land development companies specific information upon the development corridors of towns. This enables them to purchase and land bank land safe in the knowledge that these areas will increase in value as they are mandated by the local authorities as the next development areas. Once purchased they can be trickle fed onto the market to give the illusion of lack of supply. A way in which to mitigate this issue is that when companies apply for resource consent to subdivide new areas they must be mandated to release them to the market within a short period of time so that the real supply of land is factored into the market price. Also if resource consent is granted and the development is delayed there should be a time limit of ten years or something similar that precludes the company from applying for consent again on that same piece of land 3. Contruction costs – Labour costs in NZ are less than they are in Australia, yet building costs are over two times larger. This is due to the cost of building materials and the lack of competition in the NZ building supplies industry. NZ is a small country, with a relatively small population. We have a body called BRANZ that determines what building materials can and cannot be used and if they comply with the NZ building regulations. It defies belief that a country so small does not adopt existing building standards existing in other first world countries that have similar environmental extremes (UK, Germany, Australia, Canada and the USA). Some regions of these countries also have high earthquake risks – such as California which has a population nearly ten times of that of NZ. Due to the high barriers of entry to the NZ market as a result of NZ’s specific building regulations and requirement to validate all building materials many of the low cost options available from other countries are not available in NZ. NZ should synchronise our building regulations to those of larger markets so that we are able to source our building materials from a variety of sources at a fraction of the cost that is available in NZ. The current regime is a non-tariff barrier that rewards inefficient and uncompetitive business owners from international competition and the average kiwi is the one that is consistently footing the bill. Taxation as a tool for reducing Inequality. This is a misguided ideological driven aim that is quite dangerous in its implications and the basis from which it is derived. Taxation should definitely be used to ensure that all New Zealanders have access to adequate housing, food, health and education – but it should not be used as a hammer to drive down perceived inequality. Living in a free country, its citizens have the freedom to make sound, or unsound decisions, both personal and financial. The ability for women to also engage fully in business and employment over the last few decades has also enabled many households to generate wealth at a greater speed and magnitude that was previously not possible with single income families prior to the 1970’s. Increased natural result of increased freedoms results in increased inequality as some households take advantage of their freedoms in full in pursuing wealth, whilst other households may prioritise their lives that result in outcomes that are not as focused on their personal balance sheet We should at all times work to assist those less fortunate and to use the taxation system to facilitate in providing for these services, but the use of the taxation system to reduce inequality from an ideological perspective in an attempt to the right the perceived “wrongs” of our free market system is counterproductive. Inequality is the natural result of New Zealand’s level of freedom. Freedom to prioritise growing your wealth, or freedom to pursue other less financially lucrative yet just as personally rewarding options. The most equal places in New Zealand society can be found in our correctional institutions – this is the most pronounced example of how the two concepts are so closely interlinked. Any attempt made the current government to fight the new boogieman of inequality over and above providing for the less fortunate brings all of New Zealand’s citizens that much closer to the equality and freedom granted to those currently incarcerated. If you have any questions in relation to the above, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would like to present in person the above for discussion within any working group or hearings to be held.

Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand RE: The Future of Tax Submissions from the Public Dear Sir/Madam This Submission is made in good faith as collective suggestions as to how the future tax system may be made “Fairer” and more equitable in New Zealand. I do sincerely trust that you listen, and act on this notwithstanding the fact that you may have already pre- prescribed the working Group’s Policy Statement recommendations in readiness for September 2018, and this “public” forum is in all probability simply a public “PR” exercise? I have read, understood and accepted your Privacy policy. You have my permission to publish this entire document and my name on your website, but not my email or street address ( both of the latter for obvious privacy and security reasons) other than that, I have no issue with disclosing any thing in this submission from a privacy point of view and there is nothing commercially sensitive disclosed here, just the truth from a concerned taxpayer. How to use this document: Because of the contextual and technical nature of much of this Tax Policy statement I have decided to respond primarily and directly to the https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018- 03/twg-subm-bgrd-paper-mar18.pdf - “ TWG\_bgrd”, this means my response can be read in the context of your proposals and hopefully have more contextual meaning to you as a reader, so that I do not have to repeat any statements you have already made in the TWG\_bgrd. By reference to: My notation ref Ann ( Alpha , number number ) Section Snn Page Number Pnn Heading Head ( where appropriate) Paragraph Pann (if appropriate ) A1 Executive Summary P5 There are a lot of misrepresentations in your TWG\_bgrd document: \[1\] The Current tax system does not have “Horizontal Equity “ and does not treat “...the same treatment for people in the same circumstances....” Rather, the NZ Tax Base is a Socialist Transfer System that seeks to reward the unproductive, or incapacitated members of society by taking much higher amounts of tax from those who have tried to save and “get ahead” whether that be by saving, or starting a business and handing that over to the more ‘needy’ members of Society, and done on a fiscal yearly spend as you collect basis. That is fine and moral as far as it goes but is certainly NOT horizontal Equity “ The current NZ Tax system DOES modify behaviour, individuals use legal vehicles like Companies, Trusts, Partnerships, etc to minimise tax obligations, for example if they see or incur losses on the Stock Market they will buy property ( “safe” bricks and Mortar – though not in Christchurch!) An anecdotal personal example: I have never bought or sold a Company share or stock market share in my life - Why>? During 1987 I decided to informally study the share market behaviour, and taught myself some basic “charting” principles. In February 1987 there was an inverted “head and shoulders” in the share market. At the time I told my wife to get her super savings out of a managed fund her employer had originally set up for her, she lost 10% of it then, but if she had waited until October she would have lost the entire savings. We invested the three thousand dollars along with some further savings into a second property ( to live in, with a very hefty mortgage) and last year that property sold for $804,000 not a bad risk averse return for going into debt heavily. I knew of others who lost everything in 1987. That is why New Zealanders love property, it is SAFE, you will not lose in a share market crash. On the subject of New Zealand Tax Policy “NOT” being used to Modify Behaviour - I disagree. TAX POLICY MODIFIES BEHAVIOUR PUBLIC TAX POLICY STATEMENTS BY THE MINSTER OF FINANCE MODIFIES BEHAVIOUR Another Anecdotal Personal Example that the now Hon Sir Michael Cullen may well remember from his days as Minister of Finance 2003-2004 please ask him – it is materially relevant to what you are trying to do now in this Taxation Review process: And what follows, is a factual historical outcome submitted here as evidence of previous tax “policy” mis-applied via faulty legislation: Timeline> 2/7/2004 - Media Statement by Minister of Finance (Hon M Cullen) 5/7/2004 – Letter from John W Andrews to Michael Cullen – Minister of Finance Objecting to his provocative and inflammatory media statement of Friday 2/7/2004 that ....”on the Death of a Taxpayer...there would be a deemed sale at date of death” I have the physical newspaper article still, along with the Hon Michael Cullen’s press release, and personal reply.  Michael Cullen refused to answer my questions and issues raised re death and sale, or explain himself. All he replied was to give a depreciation policy 5/7/2004 – Letter from JWA to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Stating my objection to the word “death “ being a “deemed Sale” by Hon Michael Cullen, I advise IRD directly that I am –re-structuring my taxation position based on the advice of my solicitor  IRD do not reply To cut a very very long story short, the outcome of Hon M. Cullen’s tax “policy” statement ( read intention) was that I was hounded by IRD for some years over a “deemed”value of a property transfer that was not a “sale”. In 2010 I was taxed according to the Revenue’s “interpretation” of their Rule of Law and charged penalty interest retrospectively. I then did considerable research into the Revenue’s respective pieces of legislation. After some years of dialogue, communications and meetings they refused to accept my interpretation of the legislation. This culminated in my initiating court action against them (please see John Wayne Andrews v CIR TRA 001/2014 ) because my evidence exposed their mis-application of the law they quickly refunded the tax with interest to prevent the action going further in Court which would have exposed them to a class action from thousands of taxpayers who had been abused in exactly the same manner as I was. So, to the reader of this document - if nothing else is gleaned from this submission please be aware that your proposed Tax Policy changes will have embedded mistakes, your changes will be open to interpretation, arbitrage and the fair principles of legal tax minimisation because luckily there are unqualified people like me out on the street who will stand up to your “authoritarian” edicts and win legal cases with the truth. The full 350 pages of evidential legal submission, angst and personal cost can be presented and discussed with you – if you choose! Please JUST GET IT RIGHT and do not put members of the public through what I had to go through. Because you ( the then Finance Minister - Hon Michael Cullen ) got a few words of “Policy” wrong. A2 Executive Summary P6 Thinking outside the Current system Why would you as a tax policy working group want to suggest raising extra taxes based on ...” international debate about income and wealth inequality...” ? Please explain your ‘waffly’ and ‘woolley’ thinking ? Income and wealth inequality is based on a huge number of factors: Government policy : Immigration - admitting new migrants with lesser skills, or greater skills that displace existing workers. Political decisions not based on Cost benefit Analyses – eg. No further Oil and Gas Exploration to please the Green political party with a loss of 11,000 jobs Student Debt that hampers a whole generation of youths because the Government want to “feed the Education sausage machine” and make money out of foreign Students. Government Housing Policy that makes homes unaffordable, high bank indebtedness, inflated house valuations by QV. Those who have become “wealthy” have usually done so because of Hard Work, those who have not become “wealthy” are usually “poorer” because they have not worked hard or have not dared to go into business because the business climate or cost structure is too harsh, academic education is not necessarily a precursor to income or wealth creation. And you want to intervene into Human Choice ? and then tax some and not others ? because they have tried harder ? Unfortunately the Tax Working Group is not “God” and nor can you play at being “Gods” and intervene with an Orwellian Utopia feel good “policy”. I am sorry but you are beginning to sound like the Hon Michael Cullen in 2004 with his re-defining the legal meaning of Death. You will always have income and wealth inequality under Socialism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Fascism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Communism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Totalitarianism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Capitalism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Trumpism You will always have income and wealth inequality under AngelaMerklism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Leftism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Rightism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Globalism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Patriotism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Nanny Statism Any “......ism” you can think of – New Zealand is actually an amalgam of some of the above ...”ism’s” And the same for all these I haven’t thought of : https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List\_of\_forms\_of\_government You cannot change Human Nature – please be realistic! Your statement on Page 6 .....” Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform....” Sorry, but is a total LIE : Differential Entity tax rates of 17.5%, 28%, 33% IS NOT “quite uniform”. With regards to the taxing of online sales – yes I think that is a good idea, by all means charge GST on imported small value items –all this is going to do is force small New Zealand companies out of business because they are uncompetitive in this globalised commodities market – the result is and will be very simple and straightforward, NZ consumers buys overseas because the “cost” and “profit” structure in NZ is too high because we are so small and the compliance costs so high, that GST impact is, and will be minimal because the online sales are still cheaper relatively speaking. Another anecdotal example : I can buy a book from the Book Depository in the UK with free shipping across the world at half the price that local NZ book sellers will sell it at, it is courier delivered to my letterbox, then straight to my study. Also you might want to consider introducing a foreign workers company payroll tax – by this I mean all the large NZ corporates who take NZ jobs away from New Zealanders and award them to workers offshore ( outsourcing, etc) and to be “Fair” those companies should be taxed heavily for destroying New Zealand’s economic base. I can guarantee you will be too scared to implement that ? That is why Trump’s Patriotic sentiment is so popular – i.e to bring the US jobs back home and fight Globalisation, and this is why the trade ‘wars’ will continue for some years. There is no ‘Left’ or ‘Right’ any more in world politics – it simply comes down to Globalisation vs Patriotism. A2 Executive Summary P7 Specific Challenges Capital Gains tax: CGT Is simply a wealth tax and is already in place. What further taxes are to be introduced ? In any event the family home including those held by Trusts should be exempt. It will be political suicide for the party who tries to implement it , because of the overseas experience that it does nothing to alleviate the problem of housing affordability. People invest in their homes for SAFETY and security – the minute you start attacking that, and or introduce death duties on the family home or even investments then you will have a tax revolt on your hands as that is the height of unfairness and in all honesty is just a tax grab aimed at taxing the people in society who have worked and saved hard to buy a home or provide for themselves and families in later life . Instead of a blanket CGT why not tax the change in equity a Borrower makes when borrowing heavily to acquire an investment? Presently Savers are penalised in that they are taxed on savings income with NO allowance for inflation whereas Borrowers get off “scott free” and pocket the capital gain generated by their borrowing. A “Change in Equity” tax could apply to other asset classes as well like farms, or businesses that have to borrow heavily, but would only accrue when the farm or business is finally sold and where no other asset of the same class is purchased ( or exchanged) in its place. In short, if you are going to introduce tax “Fairness” then you need to balance the Saver – Borrower imbalance. If a person or tax entity is a Commodities trader, e.g. in stocks or shares, or fine art, collectibles etc then the capital gains made are ALREADY being taxed, as are the profits of traders in Property via the Bright Line rule. See www.ird.govt.nz/campaigns/2018/brightline.html You have already introduced the Capital Gains tax so please stop trying to mislead the public by this form of misrepresentation. Please acknowledge the facts of the current ACTUAL situation. I strongly suspect there is a further hidden agenda here ? that has not been published in your background paper?. Would it be fair comment to suggest that you are in fact putting forward a “wealth” or “death tax”? Even though that is not directly alluded to in the paper ? If you do, or intend to, then I suggest you set a tax free threshold of at least two million dollars, simply because if a taxpayer is an Aucklander and has saved or invested for their retirement then that figure is probably the only realistic benchmark for self responsibility. But on reflection I am not sure that the tax working group rewards or wishes to promote “taxpayer” Self Responsibility? Taxes collected should be fiscally neutral, 30% of GDP is actually quite high, from your statement, I interpret this to mean that for every dollar generated in the economy the government takes thirty cents in tax? You would do well to look at how prosperous are other countries who have adopted much lower rates e.g. Hong Kong at 16.5% - this actually supports my recommendation of a single tier flat 17.5% tax across all taxation entities mentioned below. You would do well to adopt a single tier tax system like Hong Kong: https://www.guidemehongkong.com/business-guides/supporting-a-business/hong-kong-tax-rates- and-income-tax-system Progressive Company tax: Taxes for all entities (Companies, Trusts, Maori entities etc ) should be set at 17.5 % (but not including the rate for GST) then there will be no unfairness, no arbitrage etc. Environmental taxation: You have NO right to Tax the air we breathe or the water we drink, you already tax food . You ( the government ) do NOT own the air or the water of the land – the people do, all of us – all ethnic groups and not just the Maori who originally murdered all the original Maoriori inhabitants and drove them off to the Chathams. By all means take a water tax off the bottlers selling the Canterbury Aquifer waters overseas – that water theft is criminal and I understand there already is a huge public outcry against it. You already have a carbon emissions scheme- deal with it , all that scheme is doing is making private organisations in Europe, and Eastern Europe especially, wealthy at the cost of the New Zealand taxpayer. Have the Tax working group really understood what is really going on with the ETS ? you need to open your eyes. Please excuse the analogy but .... https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/can-t-see-the-wood-for-the-trees Likewise, introducing “behaviour taxes” is quite intrusive and does overstep a basic human fundamental of the “Right to Choose”. The choice to (further ) tax fossil fuel vehicles has not been though through, by far the bulk of New Zealanders cannot afford to buy an Electric Vehicle (EV) , you could provide a tax incentive towards their purchase and like the German Republic you could provide tax incentives to convert to Solar or other forms of fossil free energy use. But current and past governments have refused to do this why? GST Exemptions: Will be costly to implement, but NZ has already the highest paying GST ( VAT ) rate in the entire OECD simply give the low income earners relief directly. B1 S2 P10 The Future Changing Demographics: Increasing Taxes on Capital Income and reducing PAYE income tax creates a deferential tax bias that penalises older taxpayers who have already spent the bulk of their lives paying taxes – that is extremely unfair. Tax has already been paid on the earnings of their usually fixed incomes. That sort of generational tax bias is not acceptable, and would be political suicide for whomever implements it. Raising taxes on spending i.e. by raising GST will affect low to middle income families much more than for retirees for example. Please see this crude but interesting analysis of generational spending shown below. I would add in New Zealand’s case for the age tranche of say 18 years to early thirties years of age that section of taxpayers are spending ( or borrowing ) money to purchase :- Education, Travel, High tech gadgets, Rent, and living cost consumables including entertainment Cars, Fashion and clothes, With the exception of retirement travel ( for those who can afford it ) by far the bulk of this spending is made by the age tranche 18-35 Vis - ” Harry Dent Aged Demographic Spending Curve” Excerpt Credit and Copyright acknowledgment for review purposes is accredited to Harry Dent. Retirees do not spend like young families or young singles do. Older Generations have ALREADY contributed to their future health care by the taxes they have already paid in their youth as New Zealanders for 40 or 50 years previously. The Major problem that all Governments of all generations face is that they do not Actuarially set aside taxes paid on a user or generational base to provide for their future drawdown - much like the ACC model or the original Cullen Super Fund that was stopped by a later Government. Governments “of the Day” spend all the taxes fiscally gained in one year on whatever they choose with no thought for the future use or who should actuarially benefit from the original Taxation Contribution. How about introducing a tax and savings policy that is CONTRIBUTORY based ? like the ACC model where taxes collected are ringfenced into areas of PRESENT and FUTURE use. E.g. current and future road use, a well made road has a life expectancy of over 50 years – amortise the tax over the life of the road, the same with taxes collected for future superannuation, and future health requirements. The “Spend as you Go” policy is foolhardy to say the least and quite irresponsible. You are correct, the tax system does NOT encourage saving for retirement and instead penalises savers or investors for attempting to provide for themselves and not rely on a so-called “Nanny State” ( which in all truth is a Transfer Payment Socialist State, not even capitalist, oh... never mention the “C” word in a tax policy working group  they’re so “evil” ) Savings are made from TAX PAID PAYE or business income The savings or investment income during its life is TAX PAID ( deducted at source) Why on earth would a Government be so greedy and inequitable as to TRIPLE tax retirement savings on drawdown when they are needed most? I don’t think even Robin Hood would see the “fairness” in that ? King John may have though  C1 S3 Page 19 Equity and Fairness You go to great lengths in this section and in many other areas of the TWG\_bgrd document stating that that the tax system is fair and should continue to be “fair” in the future. I would suggest that your version of “Fairness” is very subjective and the tax structure is basically UNFAIR. What is “Fair” about granting a Concessionary tax rate of 17.5 % to Maori owned businesses where the “pakeha” Company rate is 28 %, the Trust rate is 33% and the top personal rate is 33% with the average personal rate being somewhere between 20% and 25% depending on the weighting of the tranche being observed. And finally what is fair about the rort of the AIL by Foreign interest bearing investors ( Approved Issuer Levy ) Rate of 2% that has the effect of cheating all New Zealanders when they are forced to pay the full NRWT tax rate ? The AIL an unfairness that falsely uses lack of savings in NZ as the excuse to get supposedly cheaper funding from overseas. IT systems and processes do exist to ensure NZ savers have a chance to invest with an equivalent of AIL level tax regime. Can you please consider a tax law which insists that Corporates, Government and Individual businesses first seek ANY debt to be satisfied internally within New Zealand, and kick starting a virtual cycle of retention of interest flows within NZ and further investment of these returns taxed fairly i.e. no more or no less than overseas funders? Many years before the Panama Papers were published ( 9/5/2016) I had alerted a number of NZ Finance / Revenue Ministers ( Bill English, Peter Dunne, Todd McCLay and even PM John Key) of the Rort of Foreign owned trusts not paying tax in New Zealand, but as usual no listened to a very small resident taxpayer voice. So the question is raised are you really prepared to introduce “Fairness” From experience I actually doubt your ability to do this? On the subject of Foreign Owned companies the Chinese own a good portion of our sovereign debt, and have intentionally infiltrated a lot of our commercial and wealth creation vehicles, do you understand that you are allowing New Zealand to be ‘sold out under our feet’ ? What tax policy are you introducing to safeguard sovereign ownership of our assets for our own future generations? Do you understand what is about to happen when the tap of financing cheap money supply is turned off? I don’t think so? If you want to PROMOTE FAIRNESS why don’t you propose setting the tax rate for all companies, trusts, Foreign owned trusts and Partnerships at 17.5% especially new businesses for the first two years. Furthermore why is it that you penalise NZ Family trusts at a rate of 33%? These sorts of trusts are set up by self responsible settlors wishing to provide for their spouses and families? Instead of relying on the interference of a “Nanny State” these trusts are distributing Capital and Income without relying on taxpayer funding or engineered Socialist meddling. So why does the current and future proposed system actively penalise self responsibility so harshly? The Maori owned business concession tax rate is blatantly racist against all other ethnic groups in NZ except Maori, and contravenes the Bill of Rights Act and the Human Right Act by this overt discrimination. PLEASE CORRECT THIS anomaly that is really Intentional Political discrimination aimed at “placating” Maori even after they have been granted Billions of Taxpayer assets, income and tax transfers at the cost of all other ethnic groups in New Zealand. As an afterthought you might want to investigate why those tax breaks and resulting prejudiced profits are not filtering down to the iwi children who really need the financial help the most? With regard to the discussion over ...”vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax)..” I recommend that for Sickness Beneficiaries, war Veterans, Students and Superannuitants that there should be a tax free beginning threshold of say $10,000 (possibly 15,000) meaning that from 0- 15,000 is not taxed, and tax accrues only after that level. New Zealand does not treat these areas of society particularly well. NZ is a low wage high cost economy and in case you haven’t tried it, try living on a student allowance or pension, it is not easy ! C2 S3 P20 last paragraph This statement in your paper does not make grammatical sense ....”This is because a tax on profits (i.e. after allowing deductions for costs) will generally lead to firms continuing to make similar businesses decisions with a tax that they would without the tax....” Please explain? If you adopted my single tier flat tax all of the problems referred to on this page would go away. The tax Working Group needs to do a lot more research , and I mean a lot, before you can even consider introducing “Social Cost “ taxation, at the moment the logic you demonstrate is incomplete and not fully thought through, and your background paper does not go any where near addressing the issues and considerations with this form of a new “tax grab”. D1 S4 Page 24 Sources of Taxation Revenue After allowing for GST and sundries it is interesting to see that approximately 70 -74% of all taxes collected comes from individuals with only 26-30 % coming from Company taxes. You will have the exact breakdown, but what I have stated here is pretty close to the truth. So roughly three quarters of all revenue is paid for BY the people and hopefully USED by the people? For mostly Education, Health and Welfare etc. Time does not permit research of that here but I will investigate, if you can confirm that, then the balance appears fair, if it is not true then then you have an issue that you have not addressed? It would be an interesting calculation to establish how much of the NZ Generated GDP is repatriated offshore to the parent companies who own the 30% of GDP profits that is not benefiting New Zealanders? I would challenge you to publish those statistics? And establish “fairness” in that context? i.e. WHERE ARE THE PROFITS of New Zealand GDP are actually ending up ? D1 S4 P26 Taxes and Behaviour Again I totally disagree with you mis-representation of the Taxed – Taxed – Exempt argument concerning retirement savings ( TTE) : You statement is a total lie a) Retirement savings are saved from tax paid income originally b) The income from the savings is taxed through out its life c) On drawdown the retirement savings income cashed are cumulatively added to the owners taxpayer’s liability for the year realised This is TAXED, TAXED , TAXED ( TTT) You are SUCH LIARS and yet you think you can table a background document like this and go un- noticed ? And just for the record the KiwiSaver PIE incomes are Taxed , most providers simply offset some of the earnings for the year to offset the tax due, again another one of your lies! S5 P28 Individual Income tax All that figure 7 shows is that New Zealanders pay amongst the highest of all OECD countries in terms of top personal income tax rates – that is hardly an award winning precedence and totally inequitable when read in context with a fixed corporate rate, concessionary Maori rate and AIL levy? 33% is NOT a low personal tax rate! D2 S4 P28 Taxes and Behaviour Your statement that Corporates only contribute 4.6% of GDP in terms of Tax take, displays the extent of your tax base IN-EQUITY. By default the remaining 95.4% is generated from private individuals or private partnership businesses and of course government spending, which in NZ has always been traditionally over 40% of every dollar spent in the economy! (The GDP formula (Y) is personal consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports - Y = C + I + G + X ) If you cannot see the in-equity displayed by your own statistics then you do not deserve to be on the Tax working group panel. S5 P30 Company Income tax and GST Figure 8 Company income tax rates and revenues – simply shows that NZ companies are the best in the OECD at minimising tax payable – hardly equitable is it? Figure 9 Value-added taxes as a percentage of GDP on page 30 shows clearly that New Zealand has the HIGHEST rate of GST ( per GDP ) in the entire OECD THAT is APPALLING ! GST in New Zealand SHOULD BE REDUCED back to a more equitable 10-12 % but of course you will not do that as your brief is NOT really about equity is it? Let’s be honest? Figure 10 on page 31 is not properly explained – the deciles are not annotated as to what they mean, i.e the deciles are meaningless unless you show the weightings of that decile in terms of actual population taken numbers from the cohort. Again, a little ‘sleight of hand’ misrepresentation by the TWG On page 34 – the “targeted approach” has the effect of stifling any effort a low income household (i.e receiving benefits) will make to earn more because any income they earn above their benefit will accrue tax at 80 cents in the dollar – that is hardly equitable and the main reason why it is not worth them trying to work and get ahead. Please consider the reality of many New Zealanders Figure 11 similarly ? The statistics on page 36 are particularly damming, and EVIDENCE of the FAILURE OF YOUR TAX POLICY TO DATE Please learn from your past mistakes (also you should have defined ‘Gini’ in your document I couldn’t find any explanation there) But see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini\_coefficient It is now 11:25 pm 30/4/2018 and I have run out of submission time , so the document is now sent unfinished. So in conclusion my suggested tax policy I submit to you is summarised as : 1.Tax should be Contributory and Actuarially based so that the original contributors of the tax benefit from the tax as and when they come to use it in the present and in the future. 2.Tax across all commercial business vehicles and individuals should be equal. 3. There should be no Tax bias based on Ethnic preference or factional Favouritism. 4. Sickness Beneficiaries , Students , Veterans and Superannuitants should be granted a minimum tax- free threshold that supports a basic humanitarian living standard (i.e living wage). 5 Foreign entities should pay the same level of tax as New Zealanders with no political favouritism. Let us see if you can measure up, Fairly? Yours faithfully John Wayne Andrews

A Plea for the “Little” People A Submission to the Tax Working Group April 2018 By Wayne Hawkins, M.A. (Hons), APR \[1\] Introduction Taxation has an impact on all of us but some of us bear the burden while others who can employ smart lawyers seem to skip meeting their responsibilities. This is a submission for the “little” people, the people who have tax taken from their incomes at source and cannot claim for expenses as business owners can. This is a submission for people who work two or even three jobs to provide for their families and then find themselves smashed with secondary tax. This is a submission for people who try to save for their retirement but find that any income earned in their superannuation schemes is taxed. The $48,000 threshold is Rubbish When I became eligible for Superannuation five years ago, I elected to keep working but reduced my hours to 30 per week. On advice from WINZ my tax code was S. The code for tax on my employment remained as M. Based on this, my nett per week was around $600, considerably below the average. Towards the end of the financial year I was getting text messages from IRD telling me I owed tax. I wondered how this could be since all my income is taxed at source. When I went to the IRD site I found I owed nearly $4,000. When I sought advice I found that my Super was in the wrong tax code because I had grossed over $48,000 per year. No one told me about this during the course of the tax year, so I found myself in the unenviable position of having to find $4,000. Then when I changed my code to SH I found I was paying nearly $150.00 tax per fortnight just on my Super plus the tax I was paying on my employment. All this tax on a very moderate income is gouging. The $48,000 threshold needs to go. Abolish Secondary Tax Throughout this country there are thousands of people doing their very best to provide for their families by working two or even three jobs. Our tax system rewards their efforts by slamming them with secondary tax. This too is gouging. We should be rewarding effort not penalising it. Secondary tax must be abolished. Give Kiwi Savers a Chance. New Zealanders are often told by politicians and officials that they must do more to save for their retirement, but find that any earnings from their Superannuation schemes are subject to tax because of the principle that all income must be taxed. This is a bitter pill to swallow for salary and wage earners. The money they are putting into their schemes is from income that has already been taxed at source, so now they are paying a double tax. Lifting our rate of saving is ultimately good for the economy and will relieve a burden on the state. But if we are really serious about people saving we must give them an incentive. Earnings in approved Superannuation schemes should not be taxed. Goods and Services Tax GST has a serious impact on low income earners, especially since it appears to be beyond us to exempt essential food items. It is important that there is no increase of the current rate of 15%. Foreign Companies It is time that foreign companies front up and pay their share of tax. I am thinking particularly of Amazon, Microsoft and Face Book. Does Face Book pay tax on all the advertising it sells to New Zealand Companies? While I accept that this is a complex area I urge the Working Group to find a way to tax these companies on income earned within New Zealand. Tax Incentives for Exporters As a small country with a small domestic market, we must earn our money from exporting. I would like exporters to get tax incentives to help them maximise their reach and sales into foreign markets. Conclusion Our current tax system is loaded against salary and wage earners and favours those who can claim exemptions. Lower income earners are paying more than their fair share. People earning more than $150,000 should be paying more. The tax cut of 2010, which they didn’t need, cost us in social services. That cost has now become apparent. If we wish to remain a first world country, with modern infrastructure and adequate social services, those who can afford to will need to pay more, rather than those who cannot avoid it. Moderate income earners have been plundered enough. It is time for some equity in our tax system. Wayne Hawkins 30 April 2018.

These thoughts are generally a package, that is, are generally not stand alone items. - Whatever is implemented by Government, be it taxation or initiatives, it should be planned through systems thinking. Ad hoc social policy type tax changes often don’t work or have the opposite effect of what is espoused. - I suggest the GST Act should be simplified to remove measures of the past 15 years to “broaden the tax base”, because these create economic distortions. Examples include zero rating of commercial real estate coupled with the inability to claim GST on assets held when registering for GST. - The current GST rate is harming NZ business activity. I suggest reducing it to 11.11%. - GST should be applied to all items including financial services and residential rental. - Rather than applying Capital Gains tax measures, I suggest a Land Tax (i.e. a type of asset holding tax) is far more suitable to achieve the stated aims, and would also compensate for lost GST revenue were the GST rate to be lowered. Public amenity land, perhaps owner occupied (but not Trustee owned) “family homes”, and some Maori land should be exempt. - I am unable to genuinely suggest a sensible land tax rate because I have not obtained land value and use data for the country, nor have I performed detailed extensive economic analysis of the consequences. However, if the “Fair Dividend Rate” principle were broadly applied, 1.65%, being 33% of 5% would be a starting figure. - Provided Land Tax provides sufficient Government revenue, income taxes for low earners might be reduced. - A carbon emission tax may be more effective in discouraging CO2 emissions than an ETS. The following paragraphs are my more detailed answers to the questions posed. Q. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE MAIN CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TAX SYSTEM? HOW SHOULD IT CHANGE TO MEET THEM? A. The main challenge to the tax system is governments that impose ad hoc changes they would promote as solutions without applying systems thinking. For example, the recently imposed Capital Gains (Bright Line Test) Tax on residential rental property within the prescribed period from purchase was stated as being implemented to free up residential property to become available for home owners. Clearly this tax must act as a disincentive to \[1\] 2 sell residential rental properties, and so will most likely incentivise those who purchase residential rental property to hold it for longer, thereby achieving the opposite of the stated aim. Granted, this tax may discourage people from purchasing property for rental use, but this assumes the motivation is for quick capital gain. Similarly, a proposal to limit deductibility of interest on monies borrowed for rental property purchase, so that this deduction may only be applied against future rental income is dangerous because it creates a precedent of effectively disallowing a deduction for expenses incurred in deriving income. Q. SHOULD NEW ZEALAND USE THE TAX SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE BETTER CHOICES AND DISCOURAGE HARMFUL ONES? A. Generally no, but incentive effects must be considered in every tax raised. I suggest “targeting” only be used cautiously, and then only where boundaries are clear. For example, tobacco tax works well because tobacco and cigarettes are clearly defined, and the risk of having to force a distinction from similar products is almost nil. However, targeting taxes at residential rental property to increase availability of residential real estate to owner occupiers is problematic because this will discourage people from letting out their home when they are not using it, say when being overseas for some months, and despite government and local government’s best attempts, the distinction between residential, commercial, and other uses is not clear (and in my opinion should not be). Further artificial boundaries can be legislated to try to tidy up those boundary problems, but those additional distinctions create further problems. Designing taxes or the taxation process as disincentives or incentives almost always creates boundary problems, creates unfair and prejudiced distinctions based on usually narrow assumptions of how people should live or want to live, and may unfairly trap people. The tax system has increasingly become a quagmire over the past eighteen years. We do not need it made more so. Q. HAVE WE GOT THE MIX RIGHT, OR SHOULD WE START TAXING SOME THINGS MORE AND OTHER THINGS LESS? A. I do not think the current “mix” is perfect. I would suggest a lower GST rate, lower income tax, and application of a tax on the value of land. Income Tax Taxing labour (PAYE income tax) is a disincentive to work and be productive. I suspect this lowering of productivity may actually lower employment availability for those out of work and seeking work through the opportunities lost by those with skills avoiding applying those skills. Income taxes for lower paid people might be reduced. One approach might be to make every individual who does not have children eligible (subject to the same income test) for half the Working For Families Tax Credit for two children that would be received by a couple with two children (but not pay this extra amount to those already receiving WFF). As an aside, I observe that when the top marginal income tax rate was raised in late 1999, it was a mistake not to also increase the Trustee tax rate to match. Good and Services Tax GST at the high rate of 15% creates significant economic distortions. An examples of a GST distortion is New Zealand retailers being almost forced to charge 15% more than those selling to New Zealand out of Australia, or alternatively forcing NZ retailers to sell for lower revenue with a corresponding reduction in profitability and reduction in 3 product viability. Potential customers see additional cost as a major disincentive, and so (in this general example) purchase from the Australian supplier. Disparities of this nature with Australia and other countries are destroying NZ sellers’ businesses. Another 15% GST distortion is around commercial real estate. The 0% rating between GST registered parties creates its own problems. When an entity becomes GST registered, the current GST Act excludes claiming Input GST on assets held at the time of registration. It may be the case that the GST Act as it currently stands prohibits an entity registering for GST from ever claiming credit for GST it already paid on Commercial Real Estate. This is an example of legislation being overly complex through being written and distorted for a particular lobby group. Solutions I would suggest are: (i) The GST rate should be lowered to 11.11% (so that GST is close to 10% of the GST inclusive price). I understand there are historic studies that 10% seems to be the threshold above which people become much more cognisant of a tax. (ii) All traders that have a New Zealand (.nz) internet domain name should be required to be registered for GST in New Zealand. (iii) Commercial real estate should be rated at the standard GST rate. I strongly suggest and request no further exemptions from the standard GST rate should be added, such as various lobbyists promoting food to be zero rated, or even more complicatedly, food being GST Exempt. Land Tax I believe a Land Tax should be seriously considered to part replace GST and maybe entirely replace income tax. This would encourage greater productivity in use of land. A land tax forms a disincentive to hold land, or more importantly provides an incentive to either use land productively or sell it to someone who can. Of the three basic economic inputs - capital (i.e. the technological means of production), land, and labour – land is the only one that is naturally fixed. All capital can be either moved or decommissioned. Labour is mobile in all but oppressive regimes. Looking at a different consideration towards Land Tax, contrary to what many commentators espoused, the study released several years ago did not show only three percent of Auckland residential real estate sales were to foreigners. The study indicated a range of 3% to 48%, meaning the study indicated one in four sales were to foreign interests, albeit with a high margin of uncertainty. Some pundits and politicians also confused tax residency with residency. Anyone who has been in NZ for 183 days or part days in a given 365 day period is probably a tax resident. There is some evidence, which I accept is only anecdotal and therefore not conclusive, that some foreigners hold residential real estate, and don’t rent it out. A land tax would discourage owners from “land banking”, and would lower entry costs by reducing the overall return from land. Ultimately, landlords will rent dwellings for at most what the highest bidder is able to pay. Imposing a land tax would not cause rent increases. I would not suggest a property tax which taxes the full capital value because this discourages improvement, i.e. discourages the creation of capital. Issues to be considered are whether land tax should be universal, economic impacts to existing productive businesses such as farms, whether different land uses should be differentiated, and whether there should be exemptions for some uses, and the Land Tax rate or rates. I commenced a study about ten years ago, but did not find an accessible database of rateable land values along with areas, locations, and use types. If “the family home” were to be exempt, I would suggest this exemption should be limited to owner occupiers, and Trustee owners should be excluded from such an exemption. Other use 4 exemptions should perhaps be for wilderness, some but not all Maori land, and public amenities such as parks, roads, schools, hospitals, and libraries. Q. SHOULD THE TAX SYSTREM MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORADABLE? A. As noted above, I don’t think the current changes and proposed changes are the right solution. Over the last 15 years, it appears real estate values have been largely driven by foreign money. As noted above, roughly one in four residential property sales in Auckland have been to foreigners over recent years. That number of people with relatively deep pockets either moving to NZ or buying remotely are ample to have caused the inflated property prices observed, particularly in Auckland. A land tax would disincentivize anyone from owning land they are not using productively, and would lower property values so that entry costs would be lower. Other non-tax initiatives are also necessary. Systems thinking is required. Q. WHAT TAX ISSUES MATTER TO ME MOST? A. I consider the points raised in the Fact Sheet Capital Gains Tax Capital gains taxes are taxes on selling. They encourage owners to hold their assets in perpetuity. Ample evidence exists that such taxes do not meet the goal of achieving housing affordability, even in part. In order to ensure capital gains are taxed similarly to other gains, I suggest it would every bit as sensible to remove income tax. Land Tax As may correctly be inferred from what is written above, I strongly support the investigation of implementing a land tax to at least in part replace GST and income tax. I suggest if people are not using land adequately to afford (a reasonable) land tax, they are underutilising it, and should sell it to someone who can better use it. I understand that in the 19 th century, a land tax was very successful in encouraging owners of huge tracts of land in the South Island to break up and sell off smaller parcels of land that became the many farm titles in place today, and I speculate without this tax forced change, NZ would not be the prosperous place it is today. Progressive Company Tax No. Tax and the environment I suspect a carbon emissions tax will be far more effective than the ETS put in place by the previous administration(s). Should GST be on everything? My answer is ‘tentatively yes’, but given the systems already in place, it may be difficult to impose GST on financial services and residential rental. I also believe businesses should be able to claim GST on assets held at the time of registration. Maybe this reversion should be applied at the same time the GST rate is reduced to 11.11%, GST is imposed on residential rental, and a land tax of say 1.65% per annum is introduced.

Phillip Armstrong 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax 1. I own a few rental properties as a sideline to my usual day job – which is a 9-5pm working on a help desk. Contrary to popular belief I wouldn’t say I’m well off as have much disposable income as the press make out and seem to think Landlords have it easy. I do take pride in providing good quality homes for my tenants and have serious concerns regarding some of the proposals outlined by the Tax Working Group which could impact the affordability and availability of rental housing in New Zealand. 2. Thank you for the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand Tax System New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? 3. In my opinion the current broad based system is simple to understand and works well. The assumption that rental property receives tax advantages is untrue. It is well known that the IRD have repeatedly said that property investment does not receive any tax advantages. A study commissioned by the New Zealand Property Investors Federation, by financial and economic consultants Morgan Wallace, shows that the marginal effective tax rate for rental property is actually higher than the majority of other assets. 4. In each of the last five years NZ rental property owners have paid tax on approximately $1.5b of rental income. The importance of rental properties to a local economy should not be understated. In addition to the provision of a home for tenants, property owners contribute significantly to their local economy by employing tradesmen and service industries such as plumbers, electricians, painters, carpet layers, property management companies. They do this through their spending on maintenance, upgrading properties, banking, insurance, Local Authority Rates and all the other costs which will have resulted in substantial GST payments to Inland Revenue. 5. The current system provides a good balance of providing somewhat cheaper rental prices for tenants while still encouraging investment in property where yields may be low, while still contributing significantly to New Zealand's taxation requirements and local employment and property related expenses. Taxes and Behaviour: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? \[1\] 6. I don’t believe that targeting the rental property sector would help make housing more affordable. When the cost of providing a product increases then the cost of that good or service will go up too. Take for example the proposal to tax petrol in Auckland... which will hit the end consumer rather than the petrol stations. If we introduce a targeted tax at rental property then ultimately renting will become more expensive for renters. The rental property sector is often incorrectly labelled as an unproductive sector, but rental property contributes hugely to the local economy through employment in the property related trades and services, banking and insurance companies while also providing homes for these workers and providing tax to Government. 7. The majority of rental property owners are just regular people trying to make a living and provide for their retirement. They are contributing to society by providing much needed housing while contributing to the local economy. The government have historically seen the value of private investment in rental properties because the government is unable to provide all of the housing required. There now seems to be a shift in focus with proposed taxes specifically targeting property investors, which will strongly discourage this form of investment. It is hard to see the merit in reducing the available rental stock because private investment in rental property benefits society and should be encouraged. 8. Not everyone wants to own their own house. The majority of tenants I’ve had do not know how to maintain a clean house or have the inclination to save a deposit. They need the stability of a managed property with fixed monthly outgoings where all unexpected costs and surprise maintenance items are taken care of. Hard saving and Kiwisaver is a great help to those that do want property and need to get a deposit together to buy what is affordable to them. Retirement savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 9. I do not agree. A good tax system should not favour one investment over another or make investment in any type compulsory. There are many ways that people can provide for their retirement that suits their own individual circumstances and changing any taxes to penalise a sector of investors such as rental property owners may put groups of people off investing in anything at all. Discouraging personal accountability and ownership of investments for their own future may discourage people from investing or saving for their retirement. Kiwisaver is a positive step and maybe further positive options like this could be worked on (like bonds in Government housing stock) rather than penalising other saving options. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system. Fairness and balance: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? 10. Rental property owners already have an increased level of scrutiny through the IRD having a Property Tax Compliance Unit and a Bright Line Test. I fully support the Bright Line test as it weeds out the speculators effectively, however it seems unfair that there is not a similar level of focus on other speculative activities such as buying and selling shares. A bright line test should apply to all investment types to fairly tax speculation, not just focus on property. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system: What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? 11. It is important to note that the income derived from assets is taxed just as a person's labour is taxed and that assets are frequently purchased from income which has already had tax paid on it, taxing these assets again would be very unfair. 12. There can be a number of unintended consequences with the introduction of new targeted taxes for example if something like a Capital Gains Tax was introduced that excluded the family home in order to reduce other taxes, there could be large unintended consequences, such as the reduction of people willing to invest in income producing assets such as rental properties and would encourage more money going into higher priced but non-productive family homes. 13. No new taxes should be introduced for New Zealanders, but better enforcement of current tax laws in particularly around share market speculation would increase the tax revenue and promote fairness and consistency of investment types. 14. Ring fencing of losses should not be implemented. This is said to be a loop hole for rental property investors but this is not true as all business can offset their costs and losses against other income. To specifically disallow this for property investors sends additional discouragement to property investors and will dissuade new investors from investing in this much needed sector to increase supply of rental properties. Chapter 7: Specific challenges. Housing affordability. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 15. Allowing losses on rental property to offset other income tax payable is an important aspect which allows owners to provide and maintain their investment return while being able to charge cheaper rent than would otherwise be required. Additionally, not taxing capital gains on a long-term investment also allows rental property owners to maintain their investment return and charge less rent. It is regularly assumed that that the ability of rental property owners to claim expenses such as mortgage interest, council rates, insurances and maintenance costs means they have an advantage over homeowners when buying property. This is not true. A rental owner gets rental income and pays tax on the profit (after expenses) they make while a home owner gets accommodation to offset these expenses. 16. Higher taxes have had no effect on housing affordability in any country that has them. Higher taxes specifically on rental property will increase the cost of providing rental property leading to either a reduction in supply, an increase in price, an increase in overcrowding or a likely combination of all three. Capital gains tax: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 17. New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax. Many people will still want to invest their money into property and this would encourage spending on larger more expensive family homes and reduce the investment into farms, businesses, shares, rental property and other assets. 18. A targeted Capital Gains Tax would be complicated to administer and is unlikely to raise significant tax income. 19. If a Capital Gains Tax is to be introduced it should include the family home as well as shares and other assets. Land Tax: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 20. New Zealand should not introduce a Land Tax. A Land Tax excluding the family home would encourage more development of expensive homes on large sections of land which would not help alleviate the current housing and rental supply shortage and increase the stock of “unaffordable” housing. 21. A tax based on the value of an asset does not mean that the owner has the income to be able to pay for the tax. Local council rates on property in New Zealand are already expensive and many Landlords like myself already just scrape by wearing todays costs knowing that there will be some reward when I reach retirement age for the hard sweat and tears put into maintaining a couple of additional properties. A Land tax should not be introduced in New Zealand. 22. A land tax would increase the cost of providing rental properties, leading to reduced supply, increased rental prices, an increase in overcrowding and most likely a combination of all of these. 23. A land tax would increase business costs which would increase the price of all goods and services. 24. It would be complicated for mixed use premises, such as home and incomes, mixed-use commercial/residential properties and farms. 25. Most Landlords are hardworking and take their roles seriously. When many people are enjoying their weekends in various recreational activities many Landlords use their free time painting, or gardening to keep their rentals tidy in addition to their own home. I think targeted penalising of this group further because of the few speculators or overseas investors that slip between the cracks would be detrimental to the country as a whole. There are effective tools already in place which already make the market much less attractive than it was 10 years ago. Property is definitely not the free ride it is made out to be and we don’t need further disincentives making is less affordable. I do not wish to be heard in support of this submission. Yours sincerely Phillip Armstrong \[1\]

I would still like to contribute my small opinion for what it’s worth. And I apologise that I haven’t had the time to write this very well. Tax Educate New Zealanders about how we are taxed and what it is for, to foster a better attitude to the need for taxation. It is interesting that with the congestion problems in Auckland, people are acknowledging the need to pay to bring about changes and improvements. Get us better educated about what our taxes are used for. I think one of the down sides of not doing annual tax returns is that we don’t really think too much about it. Perhaps even just getting an automatic statement of earnings and a “thank you” letter would remind us of what we are doing and why. Spend our taxes wisely If the public does not trust the government to spend taxes wisely, on essential items first, then we will not be supportive of the system. Show comparisons with countries with similar populations and expectations. Lead by example Government and big business should show the right attitude to fiscal and social responsibility. PAYE earners always feel like a captive target for taxation focus whereas companies, trusts etc, can and do avoid tax. Simplify taxation. Sorry no idea how but I do wonder if we were able to start from scratch what our taxation system could be like instead of tinkering around. Income Tax – allow people to earn say the first $10,000 tax free. $10,000 is a large sum to people on low incomes who in most circumstances spend all their earnings on housing and living expenses. Any extra money would also be spent within the economy. $10,000 is the amount of money a family of 2 adults and 2 children would spend on food (basic level as per Otago University food cost study). Perhaps this is an alternative to trying to remove GST from “healthy foods” and the difficulties involved with that. However, if the reason for the GST to be removed from “healthy foods” is also to promote better health I could go along with that but hope it doesn’t become too complex. Allow couples to split their income to reduce tax particularly where one partner has stopped work to raise a family. We do not give any recognition to the cost of raising a family for those who are not entitled to benefits. Have just watched a Nigel Latta money programme where they estimated the cost to hire people to do all the jobs the stay at home partner does and it came out at approx. $142,000. Also, find some way to help stay at home partners access free or subsidised higher education so that they can reintegrate into the workforce more easily. It is interesting that for allowances such as tertiary study, retirement, rest home funding etc, suddenly joint incomes are taken into account, but no tax relief is granted when one income is earned as a couple. 2 Environmental and Green Issues Use a carrot and stick approach to reward companies who recover and recycle their products and tax those who don’t. Look at overseas examples such as Norway, to tackle companies who produce items that cause issues on disposal such as plastic. Consider legislation to reduce the number of different plastics that are produced or used in New Zealand to simplify the disposal issue and reduce the cost. If a company makes a product they should be responsible for its disposal. Concern that because families are operating on such tight budgets at the moment, they do not have sufficient income to maintain houses or make improvements to houses such as better insulation, more energy efficient etc. I am also concerned that the condition of housing stock in Auckland in particular is likely to decline as people stretch themselves too far financially just to get into a house and with no money left over for maintenance. (An echo of the Manukau DHB issue) Could there be tax deductions or access to low interest loans for things like insulation, double glazing? Student Loans – overseas repayments should be aligned to the income being earned and the interest rate should be less. A lot of young people go overseas straight after finishing their degrees when their balance is at its highest just to explore the world for a year or two, but may not be earning very much. We should be encouraging them to repay their loans and not making it so hard. Surely that is cheaper in the long run than chasing up defaulters. Submitted by Valerie McIntosh \[1\]

TAX WORKING GROUP – SUMBISSION Graeme Lance Turner Wiggs (Lance Wiggs) A: Ab out the submitter Lance Wiggs 1: This is a personal submission, and not on behalf of any of the entities with which I am associated. 2: I have a number of roles, including Manager of Punakaiki Fund, which has made over 65 investments in 20 New Zealand based companies (growth stage – post revenue), all of which have performed or are performing design, research, development and market development activities. As part of this role I am a director of 11 companies and an advisor to most of the m. These include several Software as a Service (SaaS) companies, a high tech hardware company and a digital medical company. 3: I am a director and investor in a number of other companies, including Define Instruments (IoT for industry), Authentic (digital platform for tours) and more. 4: I am a member of two Return on Science Committees, ICT and Physical Science, and am the former chair of the ICT Committee. These committees assist researchers and teams from research institutions across NZ commercialise their inventions. 5: I have performed well over 100 individual company workshops through NZTE’s Better by Capital and Investments programs with mostly growth stage companies that are seeking to raise capital. I was also an NZTE Better by Design practitioner, assessing through reports and helping companies through workshops using design thinking to create products and services that would be more easily sold and command higher margins. 6: I have a history of advising, as well as founding, high growth companies in NZ since my return from offshore in 2003. Before returning I spent time at McKinsey in the USA, obtained an Masters of Public and Private Management (MBA) from Yale University and I have worked in a wide variety of sectors and countries. My original degree is in product development – as one of the first three graduates of Massey’s BTech (Product Development) degree. 7: I was unable to allocate much time to this submission. I am willing to present to and answer questions from the group to express some of the opinions with more nuance. \[1\] Chapter 2 Questions In order of priority Carbon Cost Capture: At some stage the global economy will react to the need to sharply reduce carbon emissions, either by mandating a carbon tax or quotas on carbon use. The risk to New Zealand is that if we do not put ion place a carbon tax then we will send the wrong signals to businesses and society. We have a fantastic opportunity, on the other hand, to accelerate our own transition towards a carbon neutral economy, which will create structural advantages for our businesses and society. Real Estate Bias: We are spending too much on housing, and yet not enough on housing, with multiple factors causing the cost of new and existing homes and land to be unreasonably high. )ne of those factors is the beneficial tax treatment that investing in housing does versus investing in other products. This is especially galling for me as the manager of a fund that invests in New Zealand based high growth companies. We are at risk of this asset class plummeting in real value, and of a generation of people lose their livelihood. à Reduce the bias towards real estate Investor Behaviour Signalling: The correct behaviour for investors seeking strong risk adjusted returns is to own, over a very long term, a basket of different assets (including stocks, bonds, real estate and alternative assets) from across the globe, sectors and stages. The current tax system penalises investors who look for international diversification, and is reminder that our tax system is promoting poor investor behaviour. Maori investors with inter-generational perspectives understand the core principle of holding for the long term. à Treat all investment classes the same, and tax only when assets change hands to encourage long term investing. Blurring between companies, trusts, not for profits, charities and personal affairs makes life rewarding for the beneficiaries and their advisors, and comes at a cost of simplicity, tax structuring for avoidance and opacity. This has a flow on effect of increasing complexity for other participants in the financial system. A fair tax system would provide no incentive to structure affairs in a certain way. Chapter 3 Questions I agree with much of what is written. I would add a sense-check to the definition of fairness. It’s not fair, for example, for companies that have arranged their affairs in a certain way to avoid tax. Consider an Alternative Minimum Tax for all entities, perhaps even, for example, based on revenue for companies structuring their affairs to operated from offshore. Chapter 4 Questions I agree with the continued approach of a broad based tax system. I note that some of the taxes that raise less money are still required to prevent losses from the system as people restructure to avoid the main taxes. I also note the success of the ‘no exemptions’ approach for GST, and encourage the same mantra for all tax types. I am very happy to pay tax as part of a decent society. We are only as good as how we treat those who cannot help themselves. I agree that there should be consideration for taxes that modify behaviour, albeit with a high threshold for the benefit versus costs. Aside from saving (below), the one core behaviour to modify is to lower carbon emissions. The ideal tax would use the characteristics of GST to cascade emission costs to the end consumers, so that consumers in turn can modify their behaviour. Given the already substantial taxes on petrol and diesel there is scope for replacing them with a carbon tax to minimise the transition pain. I also agree, as a student of investing, that our tax system should be biased towards encouraging long term investment, especially in non-real estate assets. Note that I see that “long term” is far longer than the bright line test imposed on real estate investing – perhaps 10 or 20 years. A sugar tax would need to be many times the value of the sugar in order to have an impact. I am not necessarily against it, but we do need to be aware that the costs of the high-sugar goods need to increase to levels where, as with cigarettes, society cannot afford to purchase them. A great deal of care would be needed to avoid taxing naturally high in sugar fruit. Chapter 5 Questions   The vast amount (in real and percentage terms) of money spent on real estate in New Zealand is the systemic risk that needs to be addressed. The risk is twofold – of depreciation of those levered assets (and 1987 all over again) and the under-investment in other assets. As a fund manager we find it hard to compete with Australia and US systems that reward equity investment in high growth companies. While that’s distortionary, it does help soften the tax system bias towards real estate. Costs on businesses have improved, but there is still considerable scope to reduce complexity and burden. We (NZ) do seem to be making progress, but it is a long term war. One issue, for example, is where timing of GST invoices and payment is split across the end of a GST period. Another (more challenging one) is the artificial burden of a year-end – why not a rolling year end? Effective tax rates should be similar for all investments. However please do not charge tax until investments are realised – tying up cash for long period of time makes for better investor returns, and forcing ongoing tax payments lowers returns for all. All entities, including charities, should be taxed at the same rate – this applies the core principle of simplicity and fairness. Chapter 6 Questions Please see comments above. In addition: Tax cryptocurrencies as any other tradable asset – it’s all about the intent of the purchaser. The IRD seems to understand this. On the one hand I would like to see all capital gains taxed (for fairness), on the other hand as an investor and fund manager it is wonderful to offer that as a benefit. It’s not enough though when the system is set up to benefit housing investment even more. Perhaps the system could have some sort of regard for the purpose of an investment – is it risk capital that seeks to support companies that are creating local jobs and exports (and paying tax themselves)? Or is it simply part of a diversified portfolio of investments? Consider simply copying the initiatives that the EU puts on place for BEPS. Overall I am very disappointed that NZ has not exercised our sovereignty more powerfully – the companies that structure their affairs to deliberately and obviously avoid tax should be punished. Chapter 7 Questions Housing: Please see comments above. We need to eliminate the bias towards investment in housing. Capital Gains: For me personally - yes, provided it is low (e.g 15%) and/or is only payable when assets are transferred and there is liquidity (cash) to pay the tax. As a fund manager – no. We find it hard enough to raise capital as it is, and are heavily disadvantaged versus other places that investors can deposit funds. Land Tax: I live on a leasehold property and the landlords increase the lease price each 7 years, mooting increases of over 100%. So as someone who already pays a land tax I welcome it. A proper land tax would apply it to all land – including on and off street car- parks and streets, and society can then allocate the costs and reassign the benefits accordingly. Environmental taxation: A Carbon tax using the GST structure with steadily increasing (and signalled) costs per tonne of CO2e emissions. A progressive company tax may work in the long term but the reality is that companies have good and bad years, and over-penalising the good years should be rewarded with cash-back in the bad years to make things neutral. GST: no exemptions please.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 30 th of April 2018 Re: Submission on tax system Dear Tax Working Group, In this submission I outline my views on what a good tax system looks like. Firstly, the system should be built with a few basic principles in mind: • It should collect enough to cover desired services. • It should not be easily gamed. • It should ensure that all income is taxed equally. • It should not disadvantage New Zealand products/services. • It should be simple. • Tax discourages behaviours, tax-breaks incentivise behaviour. • It should be broad and adaptive to changes. • It is secular. Tax types and suggested changes: 1. GST should be reduced or possibly removed. At the moment NZ sellers are disadvantaged by online shopping that allows goods to be imported from overseas that are not taxed by GST. This will only increase and it is not realistic to tax all items couriered to New Zealand. Another option would be to only charge GST on high value items; however, this may encourage the trading of many small goods that when pieced together exceed the threshold for GST. • Capital gains tax. I do not support a capital gains tax because it will discourage the sale of homes, preventing first home buyers from entering the market. Furthermore, if the market drops then it is only fair the government pays the home owner the ‘negative tax’ – this is a bill we cannot and should not be prepared to pay. 2. Land tax. I strongly support exploring a land tax. Land is a finite resource and should be used efficiently. Conservation land must be exempt from a land tax. A land tax is paid each year, similar to rates, therefore there is no issue if land value drops as so does the tax. A land tax may drive owners to use land more intensively to cover the extra costs. In a city this may be a good thing as owners will seek to fill land with medium and high density housing rather than low density housing. In the rural environment, however, this may drive farmers to more intensive land uses (such as shifting from sheep farming to intensive dairy farming) which will negatively impact our environment. It may be worthwhile only applying a land tax to urban areas as this would prevent urban sprawl and prevent the rural environment from being intensively farmed. Ideally a land tax would be set at the same rate across the country (i.e., a certain % of land value). 3. Imputing a minimum rate of return on capital. I strongly support implementing this as soon as possible. At the moment, we pay tax on the monetary income earnt from capital, but not all the benefits from capital are taxed. I may own homes that are not bringing in rent or have capital that is not earning an income, though they may hold substantial value and could be of better use spent elsewhere, but they are kept because they hold some benefit to me. With a minimum rate of return, for any capital I have (above a defined value) it should be assumed that the benefits I’m getting from that capital are greater than if I had that money earning interest in the bank. The minimum rate of return should be set at a similar rate to a bank deposit interest. 4. As technology displaces and replaces jobs, the tax system will be critical in ensuring all citizens receive a healthy income. Given the stigma and unfairness issues associated with targeted welfare, I propose that New Zealand gradually introduce ‘Negative Income Tax’ that functions as a Universal Basic Income. A UBI provides certainty in increasingly uncertain times and gives power back to employees to demand fair work conditions by feeling comfortable to leave when they wish, rather than living at the mercy of their employer. 5. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Yes, particularly where ones activities have a significant on another. Taxes may be: a. Road tolls for motorways. b. Fuel taxes for general roading. c. A nitrogen tax to reduce fertilizer and imported feed use to help compensate for the consequential loss of ecosystem services. The money could back to regional councils and reduce rates; back into a fund for habitat restoration; or simply back into the general tax pool. d. A water abstraction charge to also help compensate for the consequential loss of ecosystem services. e. A sugar tax to help reduce obesity and help pay for increasing health care costs. 6. Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? a. No. The tax system already encourages retirement saving by subsidising Kiwisaver. Encouraging retirement saving could have the unintended effect of preventing money flowing elsewhere. E.g., retirement savings tend to be in conservative investment funds, encouraging more of this could deplete high risk start up investment. 7. Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? f. The current tax system does not fully account for the benefits of owning capital that is not earning a monetised income. As stated above, I do not support a capital gains tax but do support imputing a minimum rate of return on capital above a certain threshold. 8. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? Should the company tax rate change? a. I do not know enough about tax rates and business, but I do think that the company tax rates should be aligned with personal tax rates, so that no aspect of the tax system incentivises tax dodging. 9. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? a. No! The current tax currently gives tax breaks to those who pollute and use natural resources. As stated above, the following taxes should be investigated: i. A charge on nitrogen fertilizers and imported-feed. This will help reduce intensive farming, help compensate for loss of ecosystem services, reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and improve water quality. It would also be easy to administer. Finally, approximately 80% of nitrogen in our dietary protein currently comes from fossil fuels, this is not sustainable and a charge on nitrogen would help change that. ii. A charge on all consumptive water takes. This would need to be high enough to change wasteful behaviour and compensate for loss of ecosystem services. iii. Potentially a land-tax on all urban land. Reasons stated above. 10. Income tax. Whilst a stepped income tax system has the benefits of helping low income earners, it also provides an avenue for super rich to dramatically reduce tax paid by only paying themselves a very small income and keeping company money elsewhere. I support exploring a flat rate income tax and using a negative income tax (or UBI) to assist low income earners. 11. On exempting the family home. I do not support excluding the family home from tax; however, I understand it is within your terms of reference. If any tax is to help with housing affordability then I suggest that the definition of ‘family home’ be water-tight and include a maximum value (say up to $500,000), any value above becomes taxed. It is important to include a maximum value for a family home, otherwise it will become a tax haven and a place to pour excess capital. I could own an apartment building and call it my family home with many flatmates. Thank you for considering my submission. I wish to speak to my submission and discuss each point further.

Andrew Coleman Department of Economics University of Otago April 30 2018 Summary 1. New Zealand taxes different forms of capital income unevenly. • Owner-occupied housing, New Zealand’s biggest asset class, is taxed very lightly. • Real interest income earnings from debt securities are taxed at very high rates when there is inflation, as the inflation component of interest income is taxed. • Investors who finance investments with debt receive as subsidy when there is inflation as they can deduct the inflation component of interest income. • The absence of a capital gains tax means that assets generating cash returns at short horizons are taxed more heavily than assets generating cash returns at long horizons. 2. Because different classes of capital income are taxed at different rate, the tax system provides incentives to over-invest in lightly-taxed assets and under-invest in heavily-taxed assets. This can lead to a misallocation of capital that reduces the productivity of the economy and reduces living standards. 3. Standard economic theory suggests that the price of property is likely to be artificially high when property income is taxed at lower rates than the income from other assets. This induces an intergenerational transfer to the first generation of property owners and imposes large welfare costs on all subsequent generations who have to pay higher rents or higher prices to purchase property. Because the immediate cause of these welfare costs is the prices people face in the housing market, rather than the taxes they pay, these effects are often ignored in welfare analyses of the tax system. They should not be ignored, however, as they are direct consequences of the way property income is taxed relative to the way income from other assets is taxed. 4. The tax advantage of owner-occupied housing increased substantially after 1990 because of tax reforms adopted in the late 1980s, and because of a large drop in real interest rates. The increasing size of this tax advantage provides incentives for people to pay more for property and to live in larger houses. Since 1990, property prices (adjusted for inflation) have increased faster in New Zealand than other OECD countries, and the size of newly constructed housing has increased faster in New Zealand than other countries for which comparable data exist. This is not proof that changes in the tax system caused these extraordinarily large increases, for many other factors affect the price of housing. Nonetheless there are good reasons to believe that New Zealand’s tax system is contributing to artificially high property prices, and few reasons to doubt this relationship. Strangely, there 2 has been little research into this topic by government agencies even though economic theory suggests that taxing property income at lower rates than other capital income is likely to artificially increase property prices and impose high welfare costs on young people. Research I have conducted (discussed below) suggests these costs could be significant. 5. New Zealand’s tax system should be reformed to reduce the extent that different types of capital income are taxed at different rates. One way to do this would be to raise taxes on income from assets such as owner-occupied housing that are lightly taxed, and reduce taxes on income from assets such as interest-earning securities that are highly-taxed. This could be achieved by taxing the imputed rent on owner-occupied houses, by having a capital-gains tax on owner-occupied housing, and by exempting the inflation component of interest income from tax. Some of these reforms are explicitly ruled out by the Terms of Reference. The Tax Working Group should advise the government that if the Terms of Reference are followed, and capital income continues to be taxed on an income basis, large costs will continue to be imposed on young people because the price of housing will continue to be artificially high. 6. There is an alternative way to reduce the extent that different types of capital income are taxed at different rates. Income can be taxed when it is earned (an income tax) or it can be taxed when it is spent (an expenditure tax). Since Fisher (1937) and Kaldor (1955), it has been understood that it is possible to have direct progressive expenditure taxes by taxing income adjusted for the net purchase and sale of assets. In practice, a large number of countries do this by taxing income placed in sanctioned retirement income schemes on an “EET” or “exempt-exempt-taxed” basis: income placed in these schemes is not taxed when it is earned, any earnings are exempt from tax as they accumulate, but the funds are taxed when they are withdrawn. Assets placed in these schemes will be tax advantaged relative to some other classes of assets. However, they will be taxed on a similar basis to the way owner- occupied housing is currently taxed in New Zealand. By adopting an EET scheme for retirement savings placed in sanctioned schemes such as KiwiSaver, New Zealand would reduce the tax advantage that housing has over other assets. By reducing this tax advantage, the extent that housing prices are artificially high is likely to be reduced. 7. An EET tax system for retirement savings is proven internationally as many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, and Canada tax income placed in sanctioned retirement income accounts in this manner. New Zealand also had a similar scheme until 1989, when it was curtailed in the belief that it would (i) raise large amounts of revenue for the government and (ii) reduce inequality, as the tax exemptions are larger for high income people. Both of these arguments are likely to have been significantly overstated. The revenue argument ignores the value of the taxes that the government receives when the funds in the sanctioned retirement income accounts are withdrawn. The inequality argument ignores the inequality effects that occur when property prices increase because the income from property is taxed less than the income from other assets. 8. The Tax Working Group should commission independent research to investigate the merits of adopting an “Exempt-Exempt-Tax” regime for retirement saving schemes such as KiwiSaver. It is now nearly thirty years since New Zealand adopted a way of taxing retirement savings that is different from most countries in the world, yet it appears that neither the New Zealand Treasury nor the Inland Revenue Department have developed 3 technical models capable of evaluating the relative merits of these tax regimes. This is disappointing, given the importance of the issue. For more than forty years economic theory has suggested that the response of property prices to the tax system is a key determinant of the welfare effects of the tax system, yet this issue has been largely ignored in the advice the Treasury and the Inland Revenue Department have provided to the Government. . 9. Economic theory suggests that there could be significant economic advantages from adopting a tax system that has an expenditure basis for direct taxation rather than an income basis. Many countries, but not New Zealand, have responded to this evidence by taxing retirement savings on an EET basis. Other, more radical approaches are possible. For instance, New Zealand could consider the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, or the Bradford X-tax. The Meade Report (1978) discussed the relative merits of expenditure and income taxes at length and made other suggestions. The document “The Future of Tax” makes scant reference to these ways of adopting direct expenditure taxes. Even if the Tax Working Group does not believe these options can be introduced in the short term, they should consider whether the potential advantages of having these taxes in the long run warrant a proper investigation of these options in the future. 10. New Zealand taxes the inflation component of interest income and allows firms that borrow to invest to deduct the inflation component of interest income from their taxable income. Economists are almost unanimous in decrying this practice. When there is inflation, even low inflation, taxing the inflation component of nominal interest means that people who invest in interest-earning securities – a group that disproportionately includes older people and the least sophisticated investors – pay extremely high taxes on their real investment income. Similarly, firms that borrow to invest receive a large subsidy. The subsidy to residential landlords is likely to exceed $200 million each year, one of the largest subsidies to economic activity in New Zealand. The excessive taxation of real interest earnings is a more acute problem in New Zealand than in most other countries as the problem does not exist when income from interest-earning securities is taxed on an EET basis – an option that savers in most countries have, but which is denied to New Zealand savers. The excessive taxation of real income, and the subsidy to residential landlords who borrow, is likely to increase the demand to invest in owner-occupied and rental property. In turn, this is likely to place upward pressure on property prices, generate an intergenerational transfer from young households to older households, and lower home ownership rates. The current justification for these extremely high taxes on some of New Zealand’s least sophisticated investors, and for these subsidies to firms that borrow to invest, is that it is administratively difficult to tax real income. It is difficult to understand how it can be so difficult, given the complexity of some of New Zealand’s other tax rules. The Tax Working Group should request a proper justification from the Inland Revenue Department and the New Zealand Treasury as to why it is not possible to exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax, and why it is not possible to allow firms to only deduct real interest payments from their taxable income. Internationally, tax authorities have a long history of opposing tax reforms on the basis that they are administratively complex, and a long history of being wrong about these issues. 11. Standard tax theory suggests an income tax regime that does not have an accruals-based capital gains tax generates financial incentives that should distort investment patterns. A large 4 number of people also believe there are equity grounds for taxing capital gains – and many countries have a capital gains tax, although normally on a realisation rather than accruals basis. Capital gains taxes are administratively difficult. If owner-occupied housing is exempt from a capital gains tax, there will still be significant distortions that are likely to lead to artificially high property prices. Neither problem is sufficient to rule out capital gains taxes, but they bias the case towards other solutions. For instance, adopting a comprehensive expenditure basis for direct taxation (such as a Hall-Rabuska flat tax or an X-tax) would make a capital gains tax unnecessary. 12. There are several grounds for introducing a land tax on residential real estate, but they should be applied to both owner-occupied and leased residential real-estate. The reasons for a land tax need to be clearly articulated. It could be introduced as a method of taxing the income from residential property, which is currently lightly taxed. Alternately, it could be introduced as a separate tax on residential property, adopted because they have clear efficiency advantages over other classes of taxes such as income taxes. Either way they provide an easy method of raising revenue. If land taxes were to be introduced, the Tax Working Group would need to consider three issues. Firstly, is there a way of introducing them in a politically sustainable manner? Currently land taxes paid to local governments are politically sustainable because local governments have limited other means of raising revenue, and the services they provide are sufficiently valuable to the community that people prefer to pay land taxes and obtain the services than do without the services. This suggests that if the Government wishes to introduce land taxes, it may wish to devolve some expenditure classes to local authorities and have them raise the taxes to pay for this expenditure. Secondly, land taxes are likely to be capitalised into property prices, which would involve an intergenerational transfer from current property owners to future property owners (Palmon and Smith 1998). Standard economic analysis suggests the welfare properties of this transfer depend on the extent that current property owners are compensated. While a land tax is likely to be equity enhancing, because it would reduce the extent that New Zealand’s uneven application of income taxes artificially raises property prices, ultimately the willingness of the community to alter the current pattern of intergeneration transfers is a political decision. Thirdly, a land tax that exempted owner-occupied property would introduce its own set of distortions, and significantly reduce its ability to raise revenue. While the Terms of Reference prevent the Tax Working Group from considering land taxes applied to owner-occupied property, the Tax Working Group should include statements about the consequences of this exemption. 13. The document “The Future of Tax” makes only limited mention of social security taxes – and the Executive Summary of the document makes no mention of them at all. This is extraordinary, because the single largest difference between New Zealand’s tax system and the tax system of most other OECD countries is the amount of revenue raised by social security taxes. In 2016, New Zealand raised approximately 1.1% of GDP in social security taxes (the ACC levy): the OECD average was 9 percent. 14. A key aspect of social security taxes is that they are applied to labour income but not capital income. Because so little revenue is raised by social security taxes in New Zealand, 5 the amount of revenue raised from income taxes is very large by OECD standards. In turn, this means that New Zealand has relatively high effective taxes on capital income – or at least on capital income that comes from assets other than property income. To the extent that taxes on capital income distort the allocation of capital, and these tax rates could be lowered if New Zealand had higher social security taxes, New Zealand has adopted a tax system that distorts capital allocation decisions by an unusually large amount. One would expect this to result in low levels of non-residential business capital – and, indeed, New Zealand has unusually low levels of non-residential business capital relative to other OECD countries. 15. The absence of social security taxes reflects two factors. The first is that New Zealand has a retirement income system that is different from almost all other OECD countries. In most countries, the amount of retirement income is dependent on the amount of social security taxes a person pays – and so not only is it necessary to record tax payments, but these countries have chosen to record a specific set of tax payments, those paid as social security taxes paid on labour income. As New Zealand’s government pension does not depend on contributions, it has been unnecessary to record tax contributions. Of course, this does not mean New Zealand could not have a specific social security tax applied to labour income to fund New Zealand Superannuation – and, indeed, Ireland has adopted this approach even though the amount people receive from its government retirement scheme does not depend on the level of contributions. The second factor is philosophical: for many years, the Government and its departmental advisors have used the “broad-base, low rate” slogan to justify having the same tax rates on capital and labour income. In New Zealand, the concept of horizontal equity – “fair treatment of those in similar circumstances” (p19 of “The Future of Tax”) - is used to argue that income derived from capital or labour should be taxed in the same fashion. 16. The Tax Working Group should be prepared to question the assumption that capital income and labour income should be taxed at the same rates. There is very little theoretical justification for this position. Since the optimal tax literature was introduced by Mirrlees in the 1970s, it has been clear that there are few good reasons to tax capital incomes and labour incomes at the same rate. In practice, most OECD countries do not tax capital income and labour incomes at the same rates. In most cases, OECD countries use social security taxes to tax labour incomes at higher rates than capital incomes. In other cases, countries have deliberately decided to tax labour incomes at higher rates than capital income because any distributional gains stemming from taxing capital incomes at high rates are offset by excessively large efficiency losses. Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, countries with low income inequality, are all countries that deliberately choose to tax labour incomes at higher rates than capital incomes. The “Nordic Dual Income Tax” system these countries have adopted since the late 1980s has gained considerable acclaim from international tax experts. 17. The Tax Working Group should highlight the extent that New Zealand’s decision to tax capital and labour incomes at the same rates (i) is anomalous in the OECD, (ii) is unsupported by theoretical considerations and (iii) may be contributing to New Zealand’s low capital intensity and poor economic productivity. It is not to be expected that large changes to the way New Zealand taxes capital and labour incomes can be introduced in the immediate future, for changes of this nature take time to obtain political and community support. 6 Nonetheless, the Tax Working Group should signal that it is not necessary to tax capital and labour income at the same rates and that other tax philosophies such as the Nordic Dual Income Tax System should be considered as part of long term tax reform. 18. The Terms of Reference do not explicitly mention compulsory retirement savings schemes. However, the introduction of a compulsory saving scheme is probably the policy that best meets the objectives of the Terms of Reference. Consider a scheme in which people are (i) required to place funds in a retirement savings scheme such as KiwiSaver, and (ii) required to use these funds to finance part of their retirement. Such a scheme would automatically allow a reduction in tax rates, as these contributions would not be taxes but contributions to a person’s own fund. These schemes improve the efficiency of the tax system, not only because such contributions would reduce tax rates on capital income, but because the contributions are incentive-compatible as people keep whatever money they place in their own accounts. Moreover, it is straightforward to design a scheme to meet equity goals, and theory suggests that such a scheme would reduce long term wealth inequality. Compulsory savings schemes are intergenerationally neutral and would reduce the inequitable intergenerational transfers that occur when retirement incomes are funded through a pay-as-you-go mechanism. In New Zealand these transfers impose large and increasing costs on young generations. The Tax Working Group should signal that a compulsory saving scheme can be used to reduce the size of a tax-funded retirement scheme, to lower tax rates, to reduce the size of the intergeneration transfer implicit in New Zealand’s current tax-funded social security scheme, and to reduce wealth inequality. These advantages make it worthwhile to investigate further, even if it is not seen as a core element of future tax reforms. 19. New Zealand currently finances a large fraction of its government expenditures on a pay- as-you-go basis out of contemporary taxes. In general, pay-as-you-go funded programmes that provide resources to older people result in intergenerational transfers from young people to older people, while pay-as-you-go funded programmes that provide resources to young people result in intergenerational transfers from old people to young people. The size of these transfers is large. Moreover, because there is no inherent reasons why the transfers net to zero, pay-as-you-go funded programmes typically result in intergenerational transfers. These transfers make it difficult to change expenditure programmes, even when change is desired, because the changes have different impacts on different cohorts. In short, pay-as-you-go funding makes tax and expenditure system inflexible. The Tax Working Group should consider whether it is feasible to choose a set of taxes that allow some expenditure programmes to be funded on an intergenerationally neutral basis, to allow different cohorts to easily change these schemes as their preferences change. For example, the retirement incomes of successive young cohorts could be funded on a save-as- you basis so that different cohorts could pay different amounts of taxes and receive different sized retirement incomes, as they choose. Alternately, young cohorts could be asked to pay for a certain fraction of their education expenditures. Such flexibility could easily be introduced by having age-specific or cohort-specific tax rates. If New Zealand used intergenerationally-neutral age-specific or cohort-specific taxes to fund some classes of expenditure programmes, it would become easier to change the tax system in the future. This 7 would reduce the likelihood that future generations of New Zealanders get trapped with a set of taxes that are no longer optimal but which are difficult to change. 8 Tax reform and the housing market: the role of retirement income taxes. 1.Theoretical perspectives Ever since Mirrlees (1971), tax theory has analysed how a society’s equity objectives and the performance of its economy and are affected by its tax system. The theory of optimal taxes searches for taxes that maximise social welfare while minimising the extent taxes distort people’s economic choices including how much they work, how much they save, and how they invest. The literature uses formal general equilibrium models, as to calculate the welfare effects of a tax system as it is necessary to calculate how prices are affected by the tax system and how the final incidence of a tax may be quite different from the immediate incidence of the tax. Recent work has focussed on two related questions concerning the taxation of capital incomes (Meade 1978; Auerbach 2008; Mankiw et al 2009; Banks and Diamond 2010; Mirrlees et al 2010; Mirrlees et al 2011; Auerbach 2012; Diamond and Saez 2012): (1) should capital income and labour income be taxed at the same rates, or should they be taxed differently? (2) to what extent should the taxes be levied on an income basis and to what extent should they be levied on a consumption basis? If they are levied on a consumption basis, what types of consumption taxes should be levied? On the first question, the consensus view is that capital and labour incomes need not be taxed at the same rates. Thirty years ago, following Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), Judd (1985), and Chamley (1986) a much stronger view was popular, that it was optimal to have a zero tax rate on capital incomes. While the theoretical literature has largely moved away from this position, there is no theoretical basis for taxing capital and labour at the same rates. 1 The key issue concerns an equity-efficiency trade-off. Capital incomes tend to be higher for those with more income and wealth, and, importantly, for people with more income potential. This provides an ‘equity’ motivation to tax capital incomes at a higher rate than labour incomes. However, capital income taxes tend to be more distortionary than labour income taxes, which suggests capital income should be taxed at lower rates. 2 The balance depends on how much a government favours redistribution and how much it tries to reduce economic distortions. This may change over time: for example, if income inequality increases due to an increase in the size of capital incomes and an increase in the concentration of these incomes, a society may wish to increase the taxes on capital incomes for equity reasons. On the second question, the growing recognition that consumption taxes are less distortionary than income taxes has meant that an increasing fraction of tax income is raised through expenditure taxes in countries throughout the world. So far, two types of expenditure taxes have proved popular. Most countries in the world now use indirect value added taxes. A large number of countries also use generalised (Fisher) consumption taxes. These recognize that 11 There is still some debate as to whether or not it is optimal to tax capital income at all: for example, consider the contrasting positions of Mankiw et al (2009) and Diamond and Saez (2012). Nonetheless, most experts now appear to believe that while there is no good reason to tax capital and labour incomes at the same rate, the optimal tax rate for capital incomes is not zero. 2 See Slemrod and Bakija (2017) for an extensive discussion on the relative size of the distortionary effects of taxes on labour market decisions and capital allocation decisions. 9 consumption is equal to income minus the net purchase of assets, and levy taxes on income adjusted for the net purchase of some type of assets. In practice, this means retirement savings are taxed on an EET (“Exempt-Exempt-Tax”) basis: income placed in a retirement savings account is not taxed when it is earned, the earnings are not taxed as they accumulate, but the whole sum is taxed when it is withdrawn. Note that generalised Fisher consumption taxes are graduated and tend to be more progressive than a flat rate VAT, but less progressive than an income tax. Thus generalised expenditure taxes allow a country to have the equity advantages of a progressive tax system without all of the distortions of an income tax system (Kaldor 1955). Theoreticians have discussed other types of expenditure taxes, notably the Hall-Rabushka flat tax and the Bradford X-tax. 3 Both of these modify the way an indirect value-added tax is applied to make it progressive. While these taxes have yet to be adopted overseas, many tax theoreticians view them favourably as ways to simplify the tax system and improve economic efficiency without unnecessarily sacrificing equity goals. Note that consumption taxes can mean but do not necessarily mean that capital income and labour income are taxed at different rates. The optimal tax literature emphasises that the appropriate mix of taxes depends on the preferences people have over distribution as well as the efficiency costs associated with different types of taxes. There is no single correct answer. The literature also emphasises that all welfare consequences of a set of taxes need to be estimated. Since the incidence of any particular tax depends on the extent that wages and prices adjust to the taxes, economic models capable of calculating the way that wages and prices respond to taxes are needed to properly evaluate the welfare cost of taxes. These models can be quite complex to develop and estimate (see for example, Altig et al 2001). Many general lessons can be derived from models used to analyse the tax systems of other countries, or the relative merits of (say) expenditure and income taxes. Unfortunately, only a limited set of models have been developed to analyse the welfare consequences of New Zealand’s tax system. This would not matter so much if New Zealand had a similar set of taxes as other countries. However, New Zealand’s tax system differs in many ways from the tax systems of other OECD countries, making the models used in these countries less appropriate to the New Zealand situation. 2. New Zealand’s unusual tax system. New Zealand’s tax system has two big differences from the tax systems used in other OECD countries. The single biggest difference is that New Zealand raises an extremely low share of taxes from social security taxes. Social security taxes are typically levied on labour incomes but not capital incomes and thus are one way of taxing capital incomes less than labour incomes. In 2016, New Zealand raised about 1.1% of GDP in social security taxes (the ACC levy). The average OECD country raised 9% of GDP in social security taxes (see Table 1 and Table 2.) These taxes are largely used to pay pensions. One of the reasons NZ does not have dedicated social security taxes is that the size of pension receipts is unrelated to the size of 3 For a comprehensive discussion of these taxes see Slemrod and Bakija (2017). Auerbach (2008) also discusses the relative merits of these taxes. 10 the tax payments they have made. 4 In contrast, in most OECD most countries the size of the pension an individual receives depends on the tax contributions they have made over their lifetime. Table 1 : New Zealand’s tax revenues in 2016 Source: New Zealand Government (2016).

Author’s calculations. 4 One other OECD country, Ireland, provides a pension unrelated to the size of tax payments or contributions to a compulsory saving schemes. However, Ireland has social security taxes applied to labour but not capital incomes. Income tax$31.6b12.5% Corporate tax$11.1b4.4% Interest and dividends$2.3b0.9% GST$18.2b7.2% Other indirect$6.5b Petrol and road user $2.3b, Tobacco $1.9b, alcohol $0.9b 2.8% ACC$2.8b1.1% Total $74.3b29.4% 11 Because most OECD countries raise large amounts of taxes from social security taxes applied to labour income, they need to raise less revenue through income taxes that are applied to both capital and labour income. The difference is large. The average OECD country raises 11.5% of GDP in income taxes whereas New Zealand raises 17.5%. In most OECD countries, therefore, labour income is taxed at considerably higher rates than capital income because labour income is subject to Social Security taxes and income taxes, whereas capital income is only subject to income tax. New Zealand has not chosen this path. This means New Zealand raises a larger fraction of income from capital income and corporate taxes than other countries, as shown in Table 2. The second major difference between New Zealand’s tax system and the tax systems of most OECD countries concerns the taxation of retirement savings. New Zealand taxes retirement savings in a different way than most OECD countries, and this means New Zealand relies on income taxes rather than expenditure taxes to a greater extent than other countries. A large number of OECD countries (including the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Canada but not Australia) use an EET scheme for retirement savings placed in a sanctioned savings account. 5 This helps convert their income tax scheme into a generalised expenditure tax scheme. Until 1989 New Zealand also followed this practice. Since then, however, retirement savings have been taxed on a “Tax-Tax-Exempt” (TTE) income tax basis. This difference means the distortionary effects on saving and investment in New Zealand are likely to be different than in other OECD countries. In particular, as argued below, it may have large consequences for the way the tax system affects the market for owner-occupied residential property in New Zealand. It is also relevant for a second issue: New Zealand has more punitive taxes on interest income than most OECD countries as it taxes the inflation component of interest income. In contrast, if people interest-earning securities in a retirement savings account subject to an EET taxation regime, real interest earnings are taxed at the appropriate statutory rate. It is sometimes argued that countries that tax some forms of retirement savings on an EET basis subsidise retirement savings. The language behind this contention is not useful. Income can be taxed when it is earned (income taxes) or income can be taxed when it is spent (expenditure taxes). To say that retirement savings in sanctioned accounts are “subsidised” if they are taxed on an expenditure basis while some other forms of income are taxed on an income basis is to assume that income taxes should be the default type of taxes. There is simply no reason to make this argument. Most economists argue income taxes distort economic behaviour more than expenditure taxes. If a country prefers to tax sanctioned retirement savings accounts on an expenditure basis and impose more distortionary income taxes on other forms of assets, it is as equally valid to say that the country excessively taxes other assets as it is to say that the country subsidises retirement savings. 5 Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have a version of an EET retirement income saving scheme. Hungary has an alternative form of an expenditure tax, a TEE scheme, which. Denmark, Italy, and Sweden have ETT schemes. New Zealand and Australia are the obvious outliers, and Australia provides some ‘concessions’ to the taxation of retirement income saving by having low taxes on employee contributions and low taxes on interest and dividend income. See Whitehouse (1999) or Yoo and de Serres (2004). 12 3. New Zealand’s uneven taxation of capital income The differences between New Zealand’s tax system and the tax systems of most other OECD countries might not matter so much if New Zealand adopted a consistent approach to the taxation of capital income. Unfortunately it does not. Different forms of capital income are taxed at very different rates in New Zealand. • Owner-occupied housing, New Zealand’s biggest asset class, is taxed very lightly. • Real interest income earnings from debt securities are taxed at very high rates when there is inflation, as the inflation component of interest income is taxed. • Investors who finance investments with debt receive as subsidy when there is inflation as they can deduct the inflation component of interest income. • The absence of a capital gains tax means that assets generating cash returns at short horizons are taxed more heavily than assets generating cash returns at long horizons. When the income from different classes of assets are taxed at different rates, there is an incentive to invest in assets that have low pre-tax returns but high after-tax returns, and a disincentive to invest in assets that have high pre-tax returns but low after-tax returns. This can result in a misallocation of capital and lead to low productivity and low incomes. Feldstein (1977) pointed out a second problem that can arise if property is taxed at lower rates than other assets, as is the case in New Zealand. He demonstrated that the price of property is likely to be artificially raised when property income is taxed at lower rates than the income from other assets. This induces an intergenerational transfer to the first generation of property owners and imposes large welfare costs on all subsequent generations who have to pay higher rents or higher prices to purchase property. Because these costs operate through the prices people face in the housing market, rather than the taxes they pay, these costs have often been often ignored in welfare analyses of the tax system. However, they should not be ignored as they are direct consequences of the way property income is taxed relative to the way income from other assets is taxed. Various authors have developed theoretical models to flesh out Feldstein’s results including Calvo, Kotlikoff and Rodriguez (1979), Fane (1984), Chamley and Wright (1987),Skinner (1996), Batina and Ihori (2000), Gervais (2002), Petrucci (2006) and, in a New Zealand context, Coleman (2008, 2010, 2014). These papers all support Feldstein’s argument – that if land is lightly taxed relative to other asset classes, prices are likely to be artificially high and this induces an intergenerational transfer that adversely affects young and future generations. Some of the adverse effects can be offset if the older generations bequeath their property to younger generations. Even in this case, however, there can be adverse welfare consequences as young households may be forced to delay homeownership or the purchase of a large house until they inherit – and some people will not inherit at all. If the New Zealand Government wishes to tax capital income on an income basis, without artificially raising the price of property, it will need to do at least three things. First, it will need to raise the amount that income from owner-occupied property is taxed, most likely by taxing the imputed rent from property or by adopting property taxes as an alternative to taxing the imputed rent directly. This will go some way to raising the tax rate on income from 13 owner-occupied property to the appropriate statutory rate. Secondly, it should tax real capital gains, preferably on an accrual basis, to offset the way that an income tax system without capital gains taxes imposes different effective tax rates on investments which return cash income at different horizons (Samuelson 1964.) 6 Thirdly, it should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax, and it should only allow firms that borrow to invest to deduct real interest payments against their taxable income. Failure to make all three of these changes will continue to mean owner-occupied property and rental property are tax advantaged investment classes against relative to interest bearing securities. In turn, this means that New Zealand’s tax system will continue to impose large cost on young and future generations by causing property prices to be artificially high (Coleman 2017). As the Terms of Reference rule out increasing taxes on owner-occupied property, it seems unlikely that New Zealand will be able to enact a series of income tax reforms that eliminate the tax advantages received by the owners of owner-occupied property. This means it is unlikely that New Zealand will eliminate the costs the tax system imposes on young households by reforming the income tax system. Nonetheless, it would be possible to improve the situation by reducing the extent that investors in interest bearing securities have to pay excessively high tax rates tax on their real interest income when inflation rates are positive. This issue is considered at greater length below. 4. Does the tax system actually raise property prices? The theoretical literature is nearly unanimous that when the income from property is taxed at differently than the income from other assets, these differences will be capitalised into property prices, unless the supply of property is perfectly elastic (which it is not). Unfortunately the extent that property prices are actually affected by taxes is much less clear. It has proven very difficult to isolate the effect of taxes from a myriad of other factors that affect property markets. This is not to say that the tax system does not affect property prices: it is merely to say the evidence is unclear. There are exceptions to this rule. For example, there is increasingly strong evidence that exogenous variations in land taxes are capitalised in property prices (Palmon and Smith (1998), analysing property taxes in Texas; Hoj, Jorgensen and Schoe (2018), analysing property taxes in Denmark.) An increase in land taxes reduces the amount people are willing to pay for property to an extent that the incidence of the tax is nearly fully borne by the owners of the property at the time of the tax change. This means that even though subsequent owners have to pay higher taxes, they are compensated by paying lower prices for their property; and thus they are likely to be better off overall, to the extent that the high property taxes are used to reduce other taxes. Microeconomic evidence from these studies is fully consistent with the theoretical approach discussed above. Is it possible to discern whether New Zealand’s tax system has affected property prices? Here the evidence is less clear. Economic theory suggests that the distortionary effects of New Zealand’s tax system on property prices should have increased substantially after 1989, after 6 Samuelson demonstrated that an accrual based capital gains tax was needed to offset the distortions introduced into investment markets when capital income is taxed on an income basis. In practice, to minimise compliance costs countries that have capital gains taxes apply the taxes on a realisation basis. It is assumed that if New Zealand adopted a capital gains tax it would be applied on a realisation basis. 14 New Zealand changed the taxation of retirement savings from an expenditure basis to an income basis without simultaneously changing the way owner occupied property was taxed (Coleman 2017). The size of the tax distortion gets large as real interest rates decrease, so the subsequent sharp decline in real interest rates should have led to significant increases in property prices. Property prices did increase, with the size of the increase accelerating as real interest rates declined, as the theory suggests. Indeed, since 1990 New Zealand has experienced the largest real increase in property prices of any of the twenty-three countries for which data is compiled by the International House Price Database produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 7 This evidence is clearly consistent with the theoretical prediction that an increase in the extent that a tax system favours housing should increase property prices. Yet it is not possible to prove that this large increase in house prices was caused by the changes in the tax system rather than other factors. Quite simply, too many other factors have changed in the New Zealand economy since 1990 to be able to untangle the separate effects of each factor. There is, of course, no reason to doubt that the changes in the tax system were a factor behind this extraordinary increase in property prices. Nonetheless, it is not possible to accurately estimate the extent that the taxes were behind the increase in property prices, and thus it is difficult to assess the size of the welfare costs of the income from housing at lower rates than the income from other assets. The large increase in house prices means that residential property is now the largest class of assets in New Zealand. According to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s household balance statistics, the value of housing and land in March 2017 totalled $1031 billion, of which $771billion was owner-occupied property and $260 billion was rental property. At the same time, the net value of household assets was $1440 billion – so property was 73 percent of net household assets. 8 5. Taxation of the inflation component of interest rates. The Terms of Reference rule out taxing the imputed rent of owner-occupied housing, imposing capital gains on owner-occupied housing, or imposing land taxes on owner- occupied housing. These exemptions mean it is not possible to tax the income from owner- occupied housing at the same rates as the income from other assets, if capital incomes are taxed on an income basis. However, it is still possible to reduce the difference in the tax rates on interest-earnings securities and the tax rates on owner-occupied housing and on rental property by changing the way interest-earnings securities are taxed. For nearly a century, it has been understood that the inflation component of nominal interest income is not income (Viner 1923). It is universally understood by economists that if the inflation rate is positive and you tax the inflation component of interest income, the effective 7 House prices increased by 234 percent in inflation adjusted terms between 1990 and 2017, 6% more than the second highest country (Ireland) and 19 percent more than the third highest country, Australia. 8 The value of housing can be compared to other aggregates. In the March 2016, the latest year for which data are available, the value of property was $908 billion, or 69 percent of the value of net household wealth, $1311 billion. This includes the value of foreign assets owned by New Zealanders. The value of government assets was an additional $225 billion making the total value of assets owned by New Zealand entities (foreign and domestic) equal to $1537 billion. The value of assets located in New Zealand owned by New Zealand and foreign entities (including the New Zealand government) was $1696 billion. (The difference between $1537 billion and $1696 billion is the net foreign asset position.) Residential property is still the largest asset class when other, non-household, assets are taken into account. 15 tax rate on real interest income is increased above the statutory rate. Similarly, if you allow firms to deduct the inflation component of interest income from their taxable income, they are paying less tax than they ought. Even at low inflation rates, these distortions are substantial. In 2017, for instance, residential landlords borrowed $70 billion. Even if the inflation rate is as low as 1 percent, this means residential landlords can deduct $700 million of real principal repayments from their taxable income, a subsidy worth over $200 million per year. New Zealand households lend in excess of $150 billion. When the inflation rate is 1 percent, lenders are expected to pay tax on $1.5 billion more than they ought. Many people who invest in interest-earning securities are elderly, risk averse, or unsophisticated investors. For some reason the New Zealand Government believes these investors should pay more tax than any other class of investors in New Zealand. It is a strange country that taxes the simplest, most easily understood, and the most easily purchased financial security at the highest rates. It suggests the Government has little interest in equity, its protestations notwithstanding. The inequity of taxing the inflation component of interest income does not stop there. When the income from interest earning securities is taxed more heavily than the income from property assets, there is an incentive for landlords and owner-occupiers to bid up the price of land. When the supply of land is inelastic, this causes the price of land to be bid up to artificially high levels, causing an intergeneration transfer that lowers the welfare of young and future cohorts. Coleman (2008) used a sophisticated model to analyse the welfare implications of taxing the inflation component of interest income in the New Zealand context and suggested it would raise house prices, reduce home-ownership rates, and lower the welfare of most young households when the supply of housing was relatively inelastic. So why does the Government continue to excessively tax the incomes of widows and unsophisticated investors, and subsidise landlords who borrow to invest? Is it because they believe that it is appropriate to exploit widows and unsophisticated investors, simply because they are easily exploited? Is it because the efficiency costs of other means of raising taxes are so high that they believe they must ignore the equity consequences of their choices? Do they like subsidising landlords and driving up the price of housing? The standard argument given by tax authorities is that it is too difficult to exempt the inflation component of interest payments and receipts from tax, and that if it were not done properly the distortions of doing a half-hearted job would be so bad that the cure would be worse than the disease. The tax authorities could be correct. The problem is that they have never explained why it is so exceedingly difficult to only tax the real component of interest income that the country has to put up with a egregious set of distortions. Based on the experiences of Israel, Elkins (2007) suggests that it is not in fact that difficult. It is possible that the real reason for taxing nominal rather than real interest is simply bureaucratic inertia. Tax departments have a long record of stating it is not possible to introduce one particular tax or another – and then being proved wrong. A famous example is the US Inland Revenue Service opposition to collecting income taxes by withholding the money from firms. As Milton Friedman, the proponent of withholding taxes, later said “ One of the major opponents of the idea was the IRS. Because every organization knows that the only way you can do anything is the way they've always been doing it. This was something new, and they 16 kept telling us how impossible it was. It was a very interesting and very challenging intellectual task. I played a significant role, no question about it, in introducing withholding.” (Doherty, 1995) Or to quote Sir Josiah Stamp, the famous British tax investor and tax expert “The first argument that is brought against every new proposal departing from conventional lines is nearly always that it is ‘impracticable’,” (Stamp 1921, p95.) The Inland Revenue Department and the New Zealand Treasury should be asked to explain exactly why it is so difficult to tax the real interest income rather than nominal interest income, and what the consequences would be if they made an effort that was only a little less than perfect. The model developed by Coleman (2008) suggests that there could be significant welfare improvements from taxing real interest rather than nominal interest. It should be noted that the issue is more acute in New Zealand than in countries which offer their citizen retirement income schemes that are taxed on an EET basis. This is because the problem does not exist when income from interest-earning securities is taxed on an EET basis – an option that savers in most countries have, but which is denied to New Zealand savers. 6. The Taxation of Retirement Income Accounts There is an alternative way to reduce the extent that different types of capital income are taxed at different rates. New Zealand could tax funds placed in dedicated retirement income schemes such as KiwiSaver on an expenditure basis rather than an income basis, as it did prior to 1989. What is the key distinction? Income can either be taxed when it is earned (an income tax), or taxed when it is spent (an expenditure tax). Since Fisher (1937) and Kaldor (1955), it has been understood that it is possible to have direct progressive expenditure taxes by taxing income adjusted for the net purchase and sale of assets. Direct expenditure taxes are typically implemented by applying a progressive tax to a person’s income adjusted for the net purchase and sale of certain assets, on the basis that this total is close to a person’s expenditure on consumption goods and services. For example, if someone earned $100,000 and saved $15,000 in a retirement account, they would pay tax on $85,000. Capital income can be classified into three classes and if all three classes are taxed consistently on an income or expenditure basis the tax system will not distort investment choices. In practice, few tax systems are non-distortionary. Most OECD countries adopt an expenditure tax system but only provide expenditure tax treatment to two of these classes, for example. The first class is earnings that are placed in a government-sanctioned retirement saving fund. In the vast majority of OECD countries, these are taxed on an expenditure basis by adopting an ‘Exempt-Exempt-Taxed’ (EET) rule. Income that is placed in a fund is not taxed when it is earned; interest and dividend earnings and any capital gains are not taxed when they accumulate in the fund; but when assets are withdrawn from the fund upon retirement, they are taxed. The second class is owner-occupied housing. In this case, a prepayment or ‘Taxed- Exempt-Exempt’ (TEE) expenditure tax rule is adopted: the house is purchased or paid off from income that is taxed when it is earned, but no tax is paid on the imputed rent produced by the property or any capital gain that accrues to the owner. The third class is income from any other investments, including leased residential housing. This is taxed on an income tax or ‘Taxed-Taxed-Exempt’ (TTE) basis: income is taxed when it is first earned; it is taxed as it accumulates; but it is not taxed when it is withdrawn and spent. Overall this tax regime distorts against the ‘other’ investment class, but because it provides people with the opportunity to hold 17 many classes of investments in sanctioned retirement income funds on an equivalent basis as owner-occupied housing, it provides few incentives to over-invest in housing. If a country wishes to tax capital income on a neutral income-tax basis, it needs to do three things: tax on retirement income accounts on a “Taxed-Taxed-Exempt” basis; tax all capital gains (including those from owner-occupied housing) on an accrual basis; and tax the imputed rent from owner-occupied housing. New Zealand attempted to move to a non-distortionary income tax system in 1989. However, only the first of the three changes were implemented. As a result, rather than eliminating the distortions associated with the standard OECD approach, it created a new set of distortions. In particular, owner-occupied housing was taxed at much lower rates than other assets, and leased residential housing was taxed advantageously relative to debt instruments. Coleman (2017) adopted a ‘relative institutions’ approach to analyse the consequences of the 1989 tax change. He demonstrated that since 1989, the favourable tax environment for owner- occupied housing relative to other assets has provided incentives for households to live in larger houses than they otherwise would, and to bid up the price of land in locations that are conveniently located to desirable amenities. The favourable tax environment for investments in leased residential housing provides incentives for rent/price ratios to fall, either through a reduction in rents (if the supply of residential property is elastic) or through higher house prices (if the supply of residential property is inelastic.) Home owner-ship rates should fall. It is plausible that since 1989 the changes in the tax regime have provided incentives for people to increase the size of their houses by 25%, and to pay twice as much for land in areas where there is significant transport congestion. New Zealand’s property markets have changed in a manner consistent with these incentives since 1989. The average size of newly constructed houses has increased faster than in Australia or the United States and is amongst the largest in the world. Property prices have soared, rent/price ratios have declined sharply, and the number of private landlords has increased by more than 300 percent. However, it is not possible to definitively attribute these changes to the tax changes, as other factors that affect housing markets such as the international decline in interest rates and rising incomes have also changed since 1989. The paper attempts regression analysis to unpick the importance of the various affects, but concludes it is not possible to estimate the role of the tax changes. The evidence is consistent with the conjecture that the tax changes are part of the cause of the change, but cannot prove it. What are the distributional consequences of the 1989 tax change? When housing is taxed on an expenditure basis but other assets are taxed on an income basis, housing is taxed on an advantaged basis. Standard theory suggests this should lead to higher land prices and a boon for the first land owning generation. But the benefits accruing to the land-owners of one generation do not come for free. They are offset by large costs that are imposed on all generations born after the tax change was introduced. They generate a higher net international debt position than would otherwise occur. And they are regressive, falling disproportionately on first home owners with low equity and renters. Since 1989, several investigations of New Zealand’s tax system have concluded that it favours owners of housing assets by not taxing imputed rent or the capital gains on owner-occupied housing. These investigations have typically concluded it is not politically possible to introduce these taxes. This may be the case – few countries have these taxes. But it should not be 18 concluded that successive generations of New Zealanders have to suffer the distortionary effects of a tax system that is regressive, that places upward pressure on house prices, that encourages excessively large houses, and which imposes large costs on all cohorts than the first generation of land-owners. The root cause of the problem is taxing housing on an expenditure basis while other assets are taxed on an income basis. New Zealand could correct this distortion by taxing other assets on an expenditure basis, the solution adopted by most other countries. Why did New Zealand change its tax system in 1989? The documents from era suggest that the change would (i) raise large amounts of revenue for the government and (ii) reduce inequality, as the tax exemptions are larger for high income people. Both of these arguments are likely to have been significantly overstated. The revenue argument ignores the value of the taxes that the government receives when the funds in the sanctioned retirement income accounts are withdrawn. The size of these assets can be considerable – Isaksen et al (2014) estimated that the implicit value of these tax assets exceeded 50 percent of GDP in Denmark and the Netherlands in 2010. The inequality argument ignores the inequality effects that occur when property prices increase because the income from property is taxed less than the income from other assets. The Tax Working Group should commission independent research to investigate the merits of adopting an “Exempt-Exempt-Tax” regime for retirement saving schemes such as KiwiSaver. It is now nearly thirty years since New Zealand adopted a way of taxing retirement savings that is different from most countries in the world, yet it appears that neither the New Zealand Treasury nor the Inland Revenue Department have developed technical models capable of evaluating the relative merits of these tax regimes. This is disappointing, given the importance of the issue. For more than forty years economic theory has suggested that the response of property prices to the tax system is a key determinant of the welfare effects of the tax system, yet this issue has been largely ignored in the advice the Treasury and the Inland Revenue Department have provided to the Government. . In the document “The Future of Tax” the Tax Working Group appears to consider the arguments in favour of an EET tax system for retirement income but dismisses them on the basis “This approach ensures that economic distortions to save in a retirement account instead of through other savings are minimised,” and “If New Zealand were to switch to a system where income earned on the investment was not taxed, the fiscal cost would be significant.” (p26). Both of these justifications are flawed. The former ignores the difference between the taxation of retirement savings and owner-occupied housing, New Zealand’s largest asset class, in the current system. The latter appears to ignore the present value of taxes to be paid in the future (when funds are withdrawn) if New Zealand were to adopt an EET regime for retirement savings. The Tax Working Group has not provided proper justification for either of these statements, and neither seems to based on formal economic modelling. Given New Zealand’s unusual policy stance, and the potential importance of this issue, the Tax Working Group should be asked to clearly justify why New Zealand’s decision not to tax savings placed in sanctioned accounts on an EET basis is appropriate. 19 7. Capital Gains Taxes Standard tax theory suggests an income tax regime that does not have an accruals-based capital gains tax generates financial incentives that should distort investment patterns (Samuelson 1964). A large number of people also believe there are equity grounds for taxing capital gains – and many countries have a capital gains tax, although normally on a realisation rather than accruals basis. However capital gains taxes are administratively difficult, and almost never applied on an accruals basis. Coleman (2010) developed a model to analyse the possible effect of introducing a capital gains tax in New Zealand when the inflation rate is positive but relatively modest. At the heart of the model is a dynamic, forward looking maximization problem in which agents make choices about the type of housing in which they live, how much they consume and save, and how much they borrow and lend. These agents, who differ by income, age, and wealth, have choices over whether to rent or buy, to live in large or small houses, or to share housing with other people. They face realistic bank imposed constraints on the amount they can borrow and the repayment schedule they face if they a purchase a house, and they face a tax system that closely reflects that prevailing in New Zealand. Particular attention is paid to the various ways that taxes on housing income differ according to whether one is an owner- occupier of housing or a landlord. House prices and rents are determined endogenously in the model, and reflect the interaction of decisions by households, landlords, and a construction sector to supply or demand housing. The model calculates dynamic steady-state paths for house prices and rents, and a set of equilibrium housing supply and demand patterns that depend on fundamental parameters such as interest rates, construction sector supply elasticities, the inflation rate, and the particulars of the tax system. The paper examines how these prices and demand patterns change as taxes and the inflation rate change, and uses these results to evaluate the consequences of different possible tax systems. The paper examines the effects of four variants of a capital gains tax regime. While all four are accruals based, they differ according to whether owner-occupied housing is taxed or exempt, and whether capital gains are treated as income and taxed at households’ marginal income tax rates, or whether capital gains are simply taxed at a flat rate. Many of the results of the four variants are similar, although there are important differences, particularly in the amount of revenue that is raised by the tax. In general, when the inflation rate is moderate, capital gains taxes lead to an increase in rents, an increase in the home-ownership rate, a small reduction in number of large houses in the economy, and an increase in the net foreign asset position. It is possible that homeownership rates could rise by several percent if a capital gains tax were introduced. However, the effects on economic welfare are ambiguous, for many low-income households suffer a welfare loss from the increase in rents. Two other results seem general. First, a capital gains tax that exempted owner-occupied housing would raise little revenue, whereas one that applied to all households would raise enough to allow a sizeable reduction in the GST rate. For this reason, low income households that rent are better off when a capital gains tax does not have exemptions. Secondly, the increase in rents and the increase in home-ownership rates will be larger if the capital gains tax rates on owner-occupied residential property are lower than those on leased residential 20 property, either because the former is specifically exempted from capital gains tax or because landlords typically have higher marginal tax rates than households who typically rent. Beyond these general outcomes, the paper demonstrates that the welfare implications of a capital gains tax depend a lot on the detailed structure of the economy. It matters whether the supply of housing is elastic or inelastic. It matters whether construction costs are high or low. It matters whether people prefer to own rather than rent. It matters whether young people respond to rent increases by sharing with more people, or by deciding to buy a house themselves. Indeed, some of these factors matter so much that they determine whether a capital gains tax is largely beneficial or harmful. The paper ignored many of the practical and political issues that would have to be solved if capital gains taxes were to be introduced. While the simulations of the model suggest a capital gains tax that includes owner-occupied housing has better welfare properties than a capital gains tax that does not, the political and practical difficulties of introducing an accruals based capital gains tax should not be underestimated. Applying a capital gains tax only to realised gains has its own problems, notably the incentives it generates to remain in unsuitable houses or living arrangements in order to avoid the tax. The simulations also suggest that a flat rate property tax has many of the same properties as an accrual based capital gains tax with no exemptions, and if a capital gains tax is desired but not considered practical this may be a suitable alternative. The similarity between these two taxes will be greater if nominal property price appreciation is dominated by inflation rather than real factors, and if the inflation rate is relatively stable. Most OECD countries that have capital gains taxes exempt owner-occupied housing from the tax and only tax leased residential property when a sale is realised. This is a much more straightforward tax to implement than an accruals based tax, but still removes some of the housing market distortions that arise from taxing differently that inflation component of interest earnings and the inflation component of capital gains. Nonetheless, the simulations suggest the effects of this type of capital gains tax could be largely replicated by exempting the inflation component of interest income from tax, a strategy that may be easier to implement in practice. Such a strategy would have the added advantage that real after-tax interest rates and returns to capital are unaffected by the inflation rate. In short, since the welfare consequences of a capital gains tax applied to all households are similar to the welfare consequences of a flat rate property tax, and since the welfare consequences of a capital gains tax that exempts owner-occupied housing are similar to the welfare consequences of a tax system that exempts the inflation component of interest income from income tax, it may be easier to introduce these alternative tax regimes than a capital gains tax. Since the Terms of Reference rule out the introduction of a capital gains tax on owner-occupied property, the Tax Working Group should strongly consider exempting the inflation component of interest income from tax as an easier strategy than a flawed capital gains tax. 21 8. Land Taxes Land taxes have an honourable history in New Zealand, although they are currently applied by local governments rather than central governments. In 2013, land and property taxes raised $4.6 billion in revenue, of which 70 percent came from residential property and the rest came from commercial property. These taxes are levied on owner-occupied and rental property. Land taxes have been widely used in the past in other countries. Land taxes were the dominant source of government income in the United States from the 1840s to the 1930s (Wallis 2000.) Land taxes can be approached from two different perspectives. First, they can be considered an alternative tax to income tax. Their main advantages as a separate tax source is that they distort economic behaviour little, they can raise large amounts of revenue, and their incidence largely falls on people who own land when the tax is introduced, people who are typically relatively wealthy (Oates and Schwab 2009). From an optimal tax perspective, this makes them nearly perfect taxes – so much so that there are those who perversely argue that they are too good to use, for governments will never be able to resist the temptation to raise them to ever higher rates. Their main disadvantage is that they can be difficult to sustain politically. This is because the majority of voters own land in most societies, and they realise that they could engineer an intergenerational transfer from younger generations to themselves by reducing land taxes, for this would increase the price of land. Land taxes are most successful where governments have few alternative means of raising revenue other than land taxes, for voters are less likely to cut taxes if it means cutting necessary services. In New Zealand land taxes and property taxes imposed by local governments have been easy to sustain for this reason. The second approach is to consider a land tax as an indirect means for collecting income taxes on property assets that are otherwise subject to low levels of income tax. New Zealand does not impose income taxes on the income from owner-occupied property; land taxes can be considered an indirect means of taxing this income by means of a tax on the underlying asset, not the income stream. If a land tax is viewed in this manner (rather than as an exceptionally efficient means of raising revenue), the appropriate size of a land tax depends on the extent that income from property assets is under-taxed. In 2013, for instance, when local taxes on residential property raised approximately $3.2 billion dollars, the value of housing services in the economy was about $29 billion. This means the average tax rate on housing income was about 11 percent, a value that can be considered low relative to the statutory income tax rates. These figures suggest land taxes should be increased if they are to be used as a proxy means for taxing the services provided by land – but in this case they should be raised on all property, owner-occupied and rental property. The Terms of Reference rule out applying additional land taxes to owner-occupied property. This rather negates the purpose of using land taxes. Coleman and Grimes (2010) used the Coleman (2008) model to explore the possible effects of different types of land taxes in New Zealand. They did not concentrate on the case that a land tax would only be applied to rental property, for the model suggested it would lead to a significant reduction in the size of the 22 rental sector and little revenue would be raised. (The rental sector would shrink because it would become relatively cheaper to purchase owner-occupied property than to rent property for all who households that could raise a sufficiently large deposit.) In their examination of the effects of land taxes applied to all property, they showed the distributional consequences would depend on the elasticity of the supply of property. When the supply of property is inelastic, increases in land taxes would tend to lower property prices, reduce inequality, cause an intergeneration transfer from the first generation of property owners to all subsequent generations, and, in the long run, reduce the net foreign debt position of the economy. The main downside is the willingness of society to make such an intergenerational transfer. This is a political issue, but the willingness may be quite high given that the current tax system artificially inflates property prices and a land tax would merely be a means of reducing the extent that the current tax system imposes high costs on young people. If the Terms of Reference prevent the Tax Working Group from considering land taxes applied to owner-occupied property, the Tax Working Group should include statements about the consequences of this exemption. Rangel (2005) provides a different perspective on the use of land taxes. He explored the provision of intergenerational assets that are developed in one period and then passed on to another generation. He argues that while a middle-aged generation has an incentive to under- provide tax-financed intergenerational assets such as infrastructure or environmental assets that are valued by future generations, their decisions affect the price of land. When land taxes are used to fund intergenerational assets or reduce debt, they correct the disincentive to under-provide intergenerational assets and issue too much debt. This is because if a young generation has to increase taxes in the future to finance assets that should have previously provided, and it raises land taxes to generate the funds, it will automatically reduce the price the currently middle-aged generation will receive when it sells its land. Land taxes are thus the perfect type of tax to fund intergenerational assets as they prevent the under-provision of these assets. Rangel argues that if constitutional means could be used to restrict future generations to use land taxes to raise revenues to fund intergenerational assets, it would provide the correct incentives to the current generation to provide adequate quantities of intergenerational assets. If it is not yet clear, my personal preference would be to increase land taxes as an alternative to capital gains taxes, but only if the taxes are applied to all residential property. It would not be necessary to apply land taxes to non-residential property, so long as there were a suitable way of defining what was and was not residential property. The revenue from land taxes would be useful, and these taxes would correct the way the current tax system artificially raises the price of land and thus reduce inequality. Ideally part of tax revenue could be used to make contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. This would prevent the steep increase in future tax rates that will be necessary to fund future superannuation payments. 23 9. Miscellaneous other issues. This submission argues that New Zealand’s tax system distorts the way New Zealanders invest in different types of capital assets, and that these distortions are likely to raise property prices and impose large intergeneration costs on young and future generations. It points out that New Zealand has adopted a very different tax regime than most other OECD countries, resulting in particularly distortionary policies towards owner-occupied housing as these are systematically taxed less than other assets. New Zealand also has relatively high taxes on capital incomes derived from business, as the government attempts to tax capital income and labour incomes equally (with the notable exceptions that it imposes very light taxes on incomes derived from capital gains and owner-occupied housing). It has also argued that there is very little theoretical justification for New Zealand’s options. There are not particularly good reasons to tax capital incomes at the same rate as labour incomes, and most countries do not, preferring to tax labour incomes at higher rates than capital incomes. Nor are there good theoretical reasons to prefer an income basis for taxing income than an expenditure basis – and again, most other countries have adopted a partial expenditure basis because of the way they tax retirement incomes. The document “The Future of Tax” has very little discussion of the possible advantages of adopting much higher Social Security taxes applied to labour incomes as a means of reducing the taxes on capital incomes. This omission seems strange since that there are few good reasons to tax labour incomes and capital incomes at the same rates and few countries actually attempt to do this. By lowering the wedge between the tax on owner-occupied housing and the tax on other capital income, a social security tax could generate significant welfare benefits. Personally I don’t know if this would be the case – but the wider theoretical literature strongly suggests that such an outcome is possible. It would be sad if the Tax Working Group did not seriously consider these options, and perhaps commission independent groups to model these possibilities. (There are excellent economists overseas who could do this using well established models.) It is unlikely that such proposals would meet with immediate approval, but by widening the debate to include them the Tax Working Group could possibly stimulate future reform. Similarly, the document has very little about the Nordic Dual Tax model. This is another way of implementing a tax system in which capital and labour incomes are taxed at different rates, Since the late 1980s Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland have all adopted versions of the Nordic dual tax model which explicitly tax capital incomes at a lower rate than labour incomes in order to minimise the distortionary effects of the tax system. In the basic version of the model, capital incomes are taxed at a minimum flat rate and labour incomes are taxed at graduated rates that are at least as high. This tax system stems from a belief that for small open economies the distortionary effects of capital income taxes are much worse than the distortionary effects of labour income taxes. This model is garnering considerable praise. As Slemrod and Bakija (2017) write, “If the VAT is the world’s tax success story of the past half century, then a contender for the success story of the next fifty years is a Scandinavian innovation known as the dual income tax. ....The argument for the DIT, which is especially relevant for small open economies like the Scandinavian countries, is that a low capital income tax rate would lessen the incentive for domestic wealth owners to invest capital outside the country and to invest in hard to 24 measure types of capital that aren’t include in the tax base.....it may come as a shock that the Nordic countries, with a reputation for highly progressive tax and other policies would abandon a graduated tax schedule for capital income. Apparently, they believe that a highly progressive tax on at least some forms of capital income is an inefficient means of redistributing income. compared to a progressive labour income tax.” These four countries are all considered progressive, all have much lower labour inequality than New Zealand - and yet all have decided to tax labour incomes at higher rates than capital incomes. Surely it is worthwhile signalling that this is a tax philosophy that New Zealand could contemplate to see if it might be something that could be adopted as a means of improving economic efficiency as well as equity. Other issues received scant attention in the document “The Future of Tax.” Why shouldn’t New Zealand consider a Hall-Rabushka Flat tax or a Bradford X-tax. These ideas have a sound theoretical basis and are applauded by many of the worlds leading tax experts. (See, for example, Auerbach (2008) or Slemrod and Bakija (2017) and the references therein.) Once again, it is unlikely that they could be introduced overnight. But if they were discussed, people would get used to the ideas and may be prepared to consider them in the future. There are other long term possibilities for reform. If New Zealand wishes to treat capital income differently to labour income, but does not want to introduce social security taxes or a Nordic Dual Tax System, it could consider introducing a compulsory retirement saving scheme. Surprisingly, because I doubt the Terms of Reference were drawn with the view to adopting a compulsory savings scheme, a compulsory savings scheme is probably the reform option that best meets the Terms of Reference. A compulsory saving scheme is not a tax scheme, as funds placed in the scheme belong to the depositor or his or her estate, not the government. In the long run, income tax rates could be reduced, lowering the distortionary effects of taxes on labour and capital incomes. Coleman (2014c) discusses many of the efficiency and equity consequences of one particular compulsory saving scheme that was designed with the aim of reducing the size of New Zealand Superannuation by partially replacing government superannuation payments with money withdrawn from individual retirement funds. Based on a comprehensive review of the international literature, he argues that a scheme could be designed to meet most equity objectives, for instance by providing low income people with “top-ups”. Such schemes are likely to reduce long term wealth inequality by increasing the bequeathable wealth of low income people (Gokhale et al 2001.) The scheme could be grandfathered in to ease transition issues. The particular details of the scheme do not matter, but the possibility of fundamentally altering the way people are taxed and provided with social security could be revolutionary for New Zealand. International practice suggests these ideas can work – for example, it is worth noting that compulsory savings schemes for health care have been successfully operating in Singapore for some time. Finally, the Tax Working Group should search for ways to make New Zealand’s tax system more amenable to change, to ease the way that future generations can choose a set of taxes that suits their needs, not the needs of their parents or grandparents. The basic problem is that New Zealand currently finances a large fraction of its government expenditures on a pay-as- you-go basis out of contemporary taxes. In general, pay-as-you-go funded programmes that provide resources to older people result in intergenerational transfers from young people to older people, while pay-as-you-go funded programmes that provide resources to young 25 people result in intergenerational transfers from old people to young people. Since there is no inherent reasons why the transfers net to zero, changes to pay-as-you-go funded programmes typically result in net intergenerational transfers. These transfers make it difficult to change tax and expenditure programmes, even when change is desired, because the changes have different impacts on different cohorts. Pay-as-you-go funded expenditure programmes make tax and expenditure system inflexible. The Tax Working Group should consider whether it is feasible to choose a set of taxes that allow some expenditure programmes to be funded on an intergenerationally neutral basis, to allow different cohorts to easily change these schemes as their preferences change. For example, the retirement incomes of successive young cohorts could be funded on a save-as- you-go basis so that different cohorts could pay different amounts of taxes and receive different sized retirement incomes, as they choose. Alternately, part of the education choices of young cohorts could be debt funded, with the debt collectively repaid in middle age through age and cohort specific taxes. In the future some cohorts may want to raise the taxes on high labour or capital incomes to purchase capital assets for an investment fund that protects them from rapid declines in the labour income share or a rapid increase in income inequality significantly deteriorates. Who knows what young people might want to do in the future? Some of these ideas are discussed in Banks and Diamond (2010). If New Zealand used intergenerationally-neutral age-specific or cohort-specific taxes to fund some classes of expenditure programmes, it would become easier to change the tax system in the future. This would reduce the likelihood that future generations of New Zealanders get trapped with a set of taxes that are no longer optimal but which are difficult to change – and, this, as the Tax Working Group should appreciate, is an outcome worth achieving. Author’s Disclaimer The author currently holds part-time positions in the Economics Department at the University of Otago and the New Zealand Productivity Commission. He teaches courses on economic growth and public finance, including material on taxes and retirement income schemes. The views expressed in this submission are the author’s alone and do not reflect the views of his employers. The views expressed in the submission reflect work published in a series of papers about the New Zealand tax system written over the course of the last decade. These papers are based on the findings from large numerically-solved heterogenous-agent over-lapping generations models of the New Zealand economy that were designed specifically to consider how New Zealand’s tax system affects welfare outcomes when the endogenous effect of the tax system on property prices are taken into account. As far as I know, these models are the only models of their type in New Zealand. The models include a realistic depiction of many aspects of New Zealand’s tax system, a realistic description of the borrowing constraints facing people wishing to purchase property, a housing ladder describing how people can rent houses or purchase different sized houses, a property rental sector, and a supply function describing the construction of new properties. They model the decisions of people who differ in terms of their income, wealth and age who interact in a common property market. As models, the results depend on a large number of simplifying assumptions that will not be correct. This is the nature of modelling – it is a way of simplifying a problem in a manner that forces people 26 to be explicit about the assumptions they make and which allows the internally consistent, systematic evaluation of the logical consequences of these assumptions. In this case, the key purpose of the model is to trace how a large number of people might behave if property markets are competitive, property prices depend on decisions people make, and peoples’ decisions depend on the budget constraints they face. It is my belief that while models can be particularly useful because they generate internally consistent reasoning, the outcomes of the models depends on the modelling assumptions. If garbage goes in, garbage comes out, and internally consistent garbage is still garbage. While I am happy to accept that the model assumptions may be misleading and my conclusions may be irrelevant to the real world because of important factors that have been omitted, I also believe that arguments made without the help of models should be required to clearly identify the underlying assumptions on which they rest.

I don't wish to disclose my profession, but it involves advising on tax matters, and I have studied tax policies in other countries when I was at university. I believe that tax is a necessary instrument for any state to have. A good tax system is one of the key features of dynamic and prosperous economies. My submission will be divided into a specifics section and a general section. By specific I mean certain policies and legislation that need to be addressed. And by general, I refer to broader policy ideas and principles that the group can incorporate into the the tax system. I will begin with a the specifics. My job involves helping and advising people on their working for families tax credits. It hurts me whenever I encounter a situation where a struggling parent has had to adjust their income estimate several times in a financial year with different jobs and we have to tell them that they have been paid all that they are entitled to once their income estimate goes a bit higher. I was shocked to learn that people who receive sizeable payouts from inheritance distributions and divorce settlements do not have to have such payouts taken into consideration for their working for families. Our current legislation allows a family that get a $100k inheritance distribution to continue receiving working for families, even though that inheritance money will also be spent on the children of the family. In my opinion this is absurd and unjust, as we penalise people for getting a few thousand dollars and stop their payments and yet people who get a substantial increase in their financial position can continue like nothing has happened. I'm not saying that such distributions and payouts should be taxed, but, they should certainly be considered in calculating how much working for families tax credits the family gets. Another specific that concerns me involves the tax agents who boldly advertise refunds and take large cuts off of people's refunds. I don't mean to degrade tax agents - they are useful for people that have complicated tax situations (eg with trusts, businesses, and investments etc). But, the large swathes of the public that only have their salary and wages for income need to be informed about how easy it is to do their own tax returns and get all of their refunds. Their tax refunds are their own hard earned money and they deserve to keep all of it - especially if it involves working for families lump sum payments. I was appalled to learn that some tax agents discourage people from doing their own tax returns. I have proof of this in the screenshot attached to this email. The IRD and Commerce Commission need to do something to ensure that hard working New Zealanders aren't getting swindled out of their hard earned money by tax agents that exaggerate how how hard it is to do tax refunds. Now for some general points. I would argue that tax can and should be used to encourage some behaviours and discourage others. If we broaden the application of this principle, we would tax different industries at different rates. For instance, a strip club and a dairy farm should not be paying the same amount of tax. The dairy farm supports more spill over jobs and industries in contrast to the strip club. The dairy farm is more strategic within the broader \[1\] 2 economy and should be subject to fewer taxes as it is more productive at creating wealth. I'm not arguing for economic nationalism here - it would be good if we ensure that foreign companies enjoy lower taxes if they are in strategic industries like dairy too. NZ should always ensure that it is meeting its obligations in the World Trade Organisation. An example of the above can be seen with postwar Japan. One of the ways that they were able to build world class industries in consumer electronics and vehicles, was through selective tax rates for different industries. Strategic sectors like semiconductors and engine manufacturing were taxed at much lower rates to encourage growth and investment in these areas. Another area that the group should look into is removing GST from fruit and vegetables. Also increasing the In Work Tax Credit should be another thing to look at as it rewards hard working individuals and families and can fill in the gaps that employers aren't able to. Thank you for reading this. Feel free to contact me or ask questions. Kind regards, Amar Jakhu

Submission to Tax Working Group Submissions on Appendix 2: Design Issues With a Capital Gains Tax Assoc Prof Andrew M C Smith School of Accounting & Commercial Law Victoria Business School Victoria University of Wellington 1 Personally I don’t favour a comprehensive capital gains tax, however, recognising that consideration of one is core part of the TWG’s brief (and that certain members appointed to the TWG are publicly known to support one) I have following comments to the questions raised about the design of one in Appendix 2. (1) Should CGT be a separate tax or part of income tax? Submission: Best part of the income tax regime as it will enable better integration with existing income tax regime and the boundary that must be determined between income and capital gains provisions. Big Issue: How such capital provisions if introduced will stand under New Zealand’s existing double tax treaty network. Whether taxing capital gains is a tax on income or on capital could be important in litigation under existing double tax agreements. (2) An accruals based CGT is totally impractical and is not found elsewhere (other than one attempts by NZ earlier with its FIF rules - not a good experience). It must be realisation based for liquidity reasons and also that objective and accurate prices will be on hand to enable precise assessment without undue compliance/administration costs. Using realisation as the point of assessment will lead to the “locked in” effect. I strongly advocate a comprehensive roll-over regime not just for business assets but within investment portfolios. This will reduce this “locked-in” effect and also enable taxation to be levied when capital gains are used for consumption purposes. Rollover on death and matrimonial settlements is essential as there will be liquidity problems otherwise for taxpayers. Family farms and businesses would be vulnerable. (3) A comprehensive capital gains tax should be a as broad as possible as a trade-off for a lowish flat rate to apply (15% has been previously advocated by Labour at prior elections). I believe the tax should not be limited to a range of transactions that are likely to give rise to capital gains but to better approximate the genuine “capital” type return a taxpayer enjoys/suffers. Why should taxpayers be liable to CGT on a sale of shares but not be able to deduction a loss of loan principal when a bond issuer defaults? Ultimately for enforcement and administration reasons are practical limits how far a CGT can be 1 Rutherford House, 23 Lambton Quay, Wellington. PO Box 600, Wellington, 6140. Email: \[1\] extended especially when asset ownership is not formally registered (as is with land and shares etc). An unintended effect of a residential home exemption in Australia has been “land banking” of the taxpayer’s residence or the incentive effects of using one’s own home as an investment vehicle over other types of more productive investment because of the tax exemption. I believe the residential home exemption to be limited to sales of homes below a certain value (revised regularly) and above that the gain be apportioned between exempt and CGT. Kiwisaver (PIE) tax rules already have a preference for capital gains that are not available to other taxpayers. Continuing with it may have some merit to enhance the attractiveness of saving through Kiwisaver. Very few tax preferences currently exist for retirement saving in New Zealand. (5) Offshore assets be subject to CGT? To maintain consistency, equity and to avoid artificial incentives to invest offshore would suggest that they be subject to the same rules. But those falling under the FIF rules they should be removed from their scope to avoid double taxation. (6) FIF rules, imputation, land rules, CFC rules. Big decisions will need to be made here. The key issue to me is if a CGT is to be designed with any integrity, the current ITA needs to be comprehensively reviewed to find all those transactions which on common law principles would be regarded as producing capital gains but have by legislative intervention been deemed to be assessable ordinary income. The major ones: • Land sales - the rules currently found in sec CB 6A to CB 23B ITA 2007 do tax what are in essence genuine capital gains. Long-term subdivision schemes are probably the worst affected. I believe that long-term effect of these rules has been to increase the price of subdivided land since investors in those schemes require a substantial pre-tax return to overcome the tax burden applying to holding gains (largely due to inflation). Interestingly these rules were first introduced in 1973 allegedly to improve housing affordability when in fact they are probably undermining it (!) • Financial arrangement rules also need revision – they are obnoxious in that they lack transaction symmetry, gains taxable but losses arising the same situation are not necessarily deductible. These affect non-corporate portfolio investors primary where FAs are denominated in foreign currencies. The denial of a deduction for loss of loan principal when the taxpayer is not carrying on a business of dealing in FAs should also be addressed in a CGT regime. • If comprehensive CGT is introduced, there can be a case mounted to repeal the FIF rules or severely restrict their application to unusual types of interests where substantial deferral may occur. Imputation – under a CGT gains made are more than likely to attract a tax preference vis- à-vis ordinary income. Should that preference pass through to company shareholders under imputation? If so, should it be restricted to resident investors or non-resident as well (DTAs will affect this too). I believe that CGT preferences should be passed through to shareholders – there is a precedent for this with the R&D credit offered in the mid- 2000s. Non-residents should be subject to CGT if assets are situated/located in New Zealand. On practical grounds, portfolio trading of shares in NZ resident companies has to be outside the CGT net which is consistent with international practice. (8) If capital gains are to be taxed preferentially then they have to be quarantined. Another possibility might be to allow them to offset against ordinary income the same year incurred but using a discount factor or converting them into a tax credit against an ordinary income tax liability. (9) Comprehensive rollover should be provided and not just limited to capital assets for the carrying on of active businesses. One of the disadvantages of a realisation based CGT is the locked in effect where taxpayers defer selling an asset they would otherwise wish to sell because of the tax crystallising on sale. This is particularly so when the asset has been owned for a long time. It also stands in the way of reallocating portfolios in a more optimal way. By allowing rollover within a portfolio provides neutrality between selling and holding (realised vs. accrued gains) and taxation when the gains are realised for consumption are more appropriate and consistent with other types of income earned. (10) Gains at death should be rolled over to prevent liquidity problems in respect of gains made on assets not easily realised (or partially realised) e.g. family farms. Emigration and immigration issues would assumedly be dealt with using the usual residence/non- resident classification. If a class of NZ situated assets held by non-residents are outside the CGT (portfolio equity shares) then the issue arises of a deemed disposal – an option could be offered for New Zealand citizens to defer recognition of CG for a certain period after they become non-resident to allow for the prospect that they may become resident again a few years later. (11) Gifts should be left outside the CGT net. They are not capital gains. Major gambling and lottery wins should be subject to CGT. Why should gambling be tax preferred over long-term investment? A deminis exemption should apply ($50,000?) and beyond a certain level a standard % deduction in recognition of the likelihood of gambling losses been previously incurred. A source deduction by the gaming operator should be adequate – maybe as a final tax. This does the leave the problem of large wins by non-residents. The US may be able to provide som drection (12) Tax rate – the answer to this links to how the gain is calculated. If done on a straight historical cost basis, then a flat low rate would have to be offered - the Labour Party had previously mentioned 15%. The problem with the flat rate is that it would over tax low income earners on CG but would be much more concessional for higher earners. A better approach might be to tax only half the gain derived but at ordinary income tax rates. That would preserve the concessional treatment no matter what other income the taxpayer had. Taxing half would also act as an inflation adjustment without high compliance costs. (13) Adjustment for inflation – I don’t favour indexation for inflation as was initially offered in Australia with their CGT. It leads to high compliance costs. It would be much easier to tax half the nominal gain at the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate as Australia currently does. (14) A deminimis rule might have some advantages of targeting the CGT towards higher earners allowing a tradeoff between compliance and administrative costs. It would necessitate taxpayers keeping accurate records and that may be problematic. Canada at some stage had a life time exemption - how practical that proved I am not certain. (15) The provisional tax system is totally unsuited for paying tax on irregular amounts of income, the same would apply for CGT. There would have to be a simple way of paying CGT for isolated sales. Perhaps an option of paying directly by the taxpayer 3 months after realisation with a CGT return filed at the end of the year unless taxpayers wanted to use the provisional tax system. Revenues raised by CGT needs to be recorded separately so that revenue officials can identified how much is raised each year. CGT can be a volatile revenue source for a government and the usual risk is that a government uses windfall CGT receipts when markets are booming to fund spending programmes which are ongoing and long-term creating deficits when the CGT windfall ceases. Mandatory reporting and withholding taxes (other than the existing ones on land sales) should be avoided as the costs will passed on and end up being borne largely by small investors whose CG may be very small. (16) Transitional arrangement are extremely important. Any government contemplating a successful introduction of a CGT should be prepared to have concessional or generous transition arrangements which may cost revenue short-term but result in a much fairer and more acceptable system: Exempting assets owned prior to CGT introduction as in Australia is not a good option as it creates a gigantic locked in effect and sometimes perverse outcomes. For example, a property investor there can avoid CGT by renting out their existing home which was acquired prior to the introduction of CGT as a personal residence and buying a new property for renting out. If the original house is retained for personal occupation and the new property rented out, then CGT is liable. This seems very arbitrary. Using original cost would penalise those who have accrued large gains on assets held long term prior to the introduction of CGT probably leading to a mass stampede of selling around the time CGT would be introduced. Alternatively using market value at time the CGT was introduced could lead to over taxation. The only option to me is to allow the higher of original cost or MV at the time of introduction of the tax. Proxies for MV would have to be allowed for where historical cost is not easily ascertained. These should be done on a relatively generous basis. (17) Obviously assets held by family trust would need to be included in the CGT net. It is essential though that the treatment of trust assets should be no worse than assets directly held by an individual. Distribution of trust assets to a beneficiary should be on a roll over basis and not a deemed disposal. It needs to be borne in mind that trust can be used as a way of deferring recognition of CGT on long-term assets within a family. This has led some countries (Canada?) to have rules of trust assets been subject to deemed disposal every 20 years to prevent excessive deferral. I don’t favour such a rule but it indicative of the sort direction a “simple” capital gains might end up leading to significant complexity and compliance costs. (It will not be very popular with voters given the large number of holiday homes in New Zealand owned by family trusts.) Some warnings also need to be given to legislators about CGT: If a CGT is introduced in New Zealand, there will inevitably be embarrassing cases where non- residents are exempt from the CGT due to existing DTA obligations. This occurred in Australia and South Africa when they introduced CGT. It is difficult for politicians to explain to the general public why a wealthy non-resident or multinational corporation does not have to pay CGT when a New Zealand resident pensioner might have to. Much has been made of an alleged link between CGT and housing affordability. The 1973 Labour Government made great stock of introducing penal tax provisions for certain land transactions only to leave home buyers disappointed that the measures did not appear to improve assist housing affordability. A comprehensive CGT in Australia has not assisted housing affordability there. As long as capital gains are tax preferred over ordinary income, there is no reason to suspect an introduction of a CGT will reduce incentives to invest in rental properties. The proposed loss quarantining is potentially much better. On the other hand if a CGT was selectively imposed on land transactions but not other asset types, over investment in property could be discouraged although policing it could be difficult i.e. ‘land rich’ companies.

C. Moore 1. INTRODUCTION New Zealand has a long period with relatively low increases in productivity compared with many of our trading partners. In the recently published document “Beyond commodities: Manufacturing into the future,” a New Zealand sector report published by the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment, the Hon David Parker, the Minister of Economic Development, in his forward stated “The report also covers some significant issues. The manufacturing sector’s continued lack of productivity growth remains troubling and limits opportunities for development. Additionally, a lack of suitably skilled tradespeople may be hindering growth. Now the answers to some of these “troubling” issues are complex. However the continuing tinkling over many years in our taxation system has been a significant cause. Your review of our current taxation system is a real opportunity to rectify this and concentrate of a system treating the causes, rather than the effects of these problems. We all recognise the central government needs income to operate and provide the infrastructure in ensure New Zealand has a fair and sustainable economy. So it is important that your review concentrates on developing a fair and economical society. By this I emphasise economic growth in a sustainable way, providing fair and equitable opportunities for all sections of our society. Just to talk about tax cuts that give advantages to some sectors at the expense of other sectors of our society is both unfair and unreasonable. On the following pages I have noted and discussed three important issues which I believe need to be rectified. All I believe will be important stimulants to raising productivity and preparing New Zealand for the coming changes in working conditions being created by the economic changes from the electronic revolution. 4 Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018 from C. C. Moore 2.1 ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION We need to recognise New Zealand is a society of small and medium commercial firms. In fact about 98% of our employers have staff levels of 19 or lower. Traditionally machinery has been viewed as a piece of metal which has the capability of operating over a number of years before it physically wears out. Modern equipment now has a lifecycle governed by its competitive efficiency. The concept of wearing out only leads to static productivity levels. Efficiency is now governed by the electronic controlling systems on a piece of equipment reducing make ready, down time and wastage. Quality maintenance today is very much a controlled loop system as well as skilled operators. Because of their size, the investment decision for new modern and efficient equipment is difficult for many businesses. It is just not the into store cost of the item but it involves considerable added on costs in the first few years. The commercial risks relating to “start-up” costs are high. For instance: into store cost of the machine installation costs upgrading of services such as electricity, compressed air etc. often a change in layout of the factory to ensure efficient material flow recruitment of skilled staff training of existing staff in new skills developing new markets financing additional raw materials and WIP levels financing higher levels of debtors Many of these additional costs are capitalised and only recovered over many years by the current depreciation rates. You need to recognise these add to the risk of modernising equipment and place to restriction to lifting productivity. What I am advocating is not the ability to claim more depreciation, but to adjust the depreciation rates so a higher level may be claimed in the initial years, leading to reduced cash flows during the start-up period. Please note this is not a taxation reduction, but a movement of taxation during the initial set up period when cash flows and risk are at their highest to later years when the firm has settled to more 5 Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018 from C. C. Moore Accelerated Deprecation –continued stable times. In SMEs this risk factor is a major inhibiter of development and improved productivity. Many New Zealand firms are making conscious efforts to improve their current opportunities, but are inhibited with machinery which is now obsolete. Too often we concentrate of effects rather than on causes. SMEs worldwide are a major source of innovation and if we are to protect our standard of living and give a sustainable future to our new generation we must ensure they have the best tools to compete in a very competitive international environment. 2.2 RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT Our taxation rules are archaic relating to our commercial environment. We are predominantly an economic society of SMEs. SMEs rarely undertake research. What they do is product development to ensure they remain competitive. Under current taxation rules “development” must be capitalised and theoretically written off over the life of the product. What is the life of a product in this age of rapid change? We are constantly told our national level of R & D does not match that of the OECD countries. Firstly we do not have a large defence industry, nor a large chemical/medical industry and most firms carrying out ”development” to sustain their product in the market place hide their development cost in general factory expenses to avoid the taxation implications. What this does is removes the emphasis of the importance of R & D to firms as a necessary and important factor in their survival. Changes in the deductibility will also emphasise the importance of R & D in their pricing policies. 6 Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018 from C. C. Moore 2.3 TRAINING The western world is entering a period of uncertainty relating to work practices and employment levels as the electronic developments of the last two decades invade control systems in modern manufacturing and also in the service areas. We are all aware of the impact industrialisation made to the unskilled mainly agricultural workers as they moved into the towns of England. Living in cramped housing with poor wages due to the lack of skills, life was very miserable and it took many generations for their conditions of welfare to reach an acceptable level. Our own country benefited with the resultant emigration as they sought a better life. It is important we explore means of avoiding a similar situation occurring here in New Zealand over the next two decades or so. Many of our current employees do have basic skills and we must ensure they have every opportunity of constant up-skilling to ensure they can compete with the new demands of the new technology. Similarly young people entering the work force will be employed in an atmosphere of constant technological change and constant up-skilling will be part of their employment world. Recognising New Zealand is largely SMEs, we need to think how as a nation we equip our employers to operate in this changing environment. Of course we will need to ensure our education system plays a constructive role in this process. However post education training by outside organisations is expensive and employers lose valuable productive time whilst the employee is away attending external courses. Naturally there will be a role for both external and on the job training. Remember, training is a series of building blocks with each training session building on the previous module. In-house training fits this process well without impacting on short term productivity with the added advantage of ensuring specialised knowledge relating to the individual employer is retained and developed. 7 Submission to Tax Working Group 30 April 2018 from C. C. Moore Training-continued My suggestion is we are in need of an additional loading as a taxation deduction on training expenditure. This has been tried overseas and has been subject to exploitation, but better definitions can overcome this problem. I do encourage your taskforce to seriously explore this option as changing conditions in the future working environment is already on the way. 3. CONCLUSION You have a unique opportunity to review the taxation system. It is an opportunity not to be wasted. The need is to consider causes, not effects ensuring New Zealand recovers productivity growth and ensuring employment skills are developed so as to retain job opportunities and employment levels remain. 4. SPEAKING RIGHTS I would like the opportunity to speak to my submission. Cameron Moore 30 April 2018 8

I would draw attention to: 1.the competitive disadvantage this is to NZ businesses due to the greater tax burden they carry as a result; 2.the resulting increased burden on all taxpayers This submission presents a restructured approach to tax in NZ rather than applying issue specific “Band-Aids” to the current system Specifically, it: 1.Provides a comprehensive, internally and externally consistent tax system that addresses the current challenges with a future proof solution; 2.Builds on existing tax mechanisms; 3.Provides a simple, robust and cost effective approach. This submission is at a high level, intended only to outline the concepts. Should the Working Group be interested in exploring the proposal in any detail I will be happy to provide further material or discuss the submission. 3. Response to specific challenges - Don’t tinker The Government has directed the Tax Working Group to advise on a number of specific challenges: A capital gains tax. A progressive company tax. Environmental taxation. Assist low-income groups by introducing GST exemptions. Unfortunately the approach implicit in the above ‘specific challenges’ instruction is one of tinkering with the existing tax system rather than re- thinking it and making it truly fit for purpose and future proof. Addressing ‘specific challenges’ through one off tax tweaks produces: 1.A cumbersome, often internally inconsistent, difficult to manage system, benefitting only the tax advisors; 2.Distortions in the economy, usually with unpredicted (not necessarily unexpected) effects. 3.Latent problems which will require further patches to fix. The proposed tax system addresses all the considerations underlying the above specific challenges and does so with a composite, internally and externally consistent simple tax system; intended to stand the test of time. 4. Overview of proposed tax system It is proposed that a tax system be implemented with three primary tax vehicles, which all have their roots in the present tax system: 1.CGST, an extension of GST to a broader tax collected: i.As a fixed percentage from the payor on any and all payments. If money changes hands it pays CGST; ii.On a cumulative basis, not as net/value-added like GST. 2.Company income levies (CILs) collected as a percentage of income, not profit, specified by industry group and progressive with income levels. 3.Personal income levies (PILs) collected as a percentage based on progressive income levels for all payees (recipients). The proposed collection mechanism is simple. 1.All CGST and CIL/PIL levies are collected by the transacting banks. 2.Monies (including cash) payments out of the NZ banking system are not exempt from ‘income’ levies, except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. 3.Offshore, internet and multinational companies not registered in NZ for tax purposes are not exempt from revenue levies except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. Tax revenue is based on monies paid and received rather than the traditional ‘earnings’ or ‘profit’, devices which are being rendered unreliable in the changing business environment. 5. Relative share of tax revenue It is envisaged that the relative portion of tax revenue will shift as follows: 1.CGST will become the largest contributor estimated to rise to >50% of tax revenue. i.Estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and most likely below 4% ii.CGST. Although a lower percentage than GST it contributes a greater amount due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, financial transactions, FOREX, share & gig economy etc. b.Being cumulative rather than net/value-added. 2.Company Income Levies (CILs) are estimated to still contribute around 17.5% i.While total dollar amount is up, NZ registered business pay a lower tax rate 3.Personal Income Levies (PILs) are estimated to contribute around 25% i.Shift in emphasis to CGST ii.No levies on low income groups (subsidised via WINZ) 6. Primary benefit targets of proposed system The proposed system is modelled to target six specific areas: 1.Reduction in poverty, specifically child poverty, by reducing the tax burden thereby increasing the disposable income of low income families. 2.Eliminating the present system’s competitive bias against NZ based businesses. 3.Sharing the NZ tax burden with offshore entities by eliminating international e- businesses avoiding tax in NZ. 4.Improving the attractiveness of investment in NZ through low taxes, encouraging retention of money in NZ and fully taxing offshore entities. 5.Simplified and comprehensive tax gathering, avoiding “Band-Aid” taxes, with an all encompassing tax structure and tax collection by the banks. 6.A future proof system. The proposed system is cost effective for IRD and tax payers. The banks will whine but have the ability to deliver as they have can already levy charges on transactions. The cost to the government of bank collections should be nil. 7. Summary of response to extended list of challenges, risks, and opportunities Challenges, risks, and opportunitiesComment Reduces poverty, improves standard of livingIncreases lower income group disposable income Provides for demographic changes Personal levies for superannuation (Kiwisaver) health etc. and potential for means testing user pays services Competitive with falling international business tax rates Reduces tax for NZ tax registered business.

Progressive capacity for company taxProgressive introduction of levies. Discourages migration to cash economy Value of applied CGST and levies to money leaving banking system less than present GST. Simpler and more equitable than alternative solutions Preferable to capital gains, BEPS and other tweaks to current framework Encourages investment in NZ Application of CGST and levies to money leaving banking system and low NZ tax rates encourages retention of funds in NZ Discourages market speculation All transactions taxed - housing, equities, other investments and assets Accommodates global business trends Equal treatment of all businesses irrespective of domicile jurisdiction Accommodates environmental challenges Industry levies (e.g. carbon, tourism infrastructure & conservation levy) target outcomes 8. The cornerstone; Comprehensive GST = CGST At the core of the proposed system is an extended GST regime, called Comprehensive GST or CGST: 1.CGST is applied cumulatively not as net/value-added as at present. 2.CGST is applied to all transactions between bank accounts. If money changes it pays CGST. 3.CGST is paid by the entity making the payment (payor) not the recipient (payee). 4.CGST is collected by the banks as a charge on all payments/transfers made from a payor’s accounts – if money changes hands it pays CGST. 5.CGST is also collected on cash withdrawals – payments out of the bank. 6.CGST is also collected on all payments to accounts outside the NZ banking system. 7.CGST will drive economic efficiencies by eliminating GST processing/returns and as businesses respond with fewer steps in transaction chains. 8.CGST estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and 4% 9.CGST. As a % lower than GST, CGST will still contribute more tax due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, dividends, financial markets, FOREX, Share economy etc b.Being cumulative rather than net. The CGST revenue is not hypothecated (i.e. tagged for a specific Vote) 9. Personal Tax – meeting the challenges Tax inroads into the disposable income of the poor has a greater impact on their quality of life and economic participation than on the wealthy. The current personal tax regime is not doing enough to significantly reduce poverty in NZ. The current tax regime does not provide an effective tax progression wedge. Multi-national and offshore company uncollected taxes place greater burden on all NZ taxpayers, impacting the poor most. Reducing the tax burden on lower income New Zealanders will increase disposable income: Reducing poverty – child poverty in particular; Improving participation in the social economy; Improving health outcomes; Improving education outcomes ... •... leading to improved productivity in future; •... leading to greater participation in the digital environment. Income tax based on earnings is not future proof and will become increasingly inequitable (rich – poor divide) as current trends away from traditional wage/salary based employment accelerate more in higher paid sectors. 10. A new approach to personal tax It is proposed to shift from a tax on earnings base to a participation in part funding state personal insurance. All up the proposed levy is expected to total around 17% of income at the upper end. Individuals will be liable for constant percentage of income (subject to government subsidies) for contributions to: ACC insurance (earner levy). Kiwisaver. Health (public system) insurance (from ambulance to GP to tertiary care) whether accessed or not. Unemployment insurance (unemployment, maternity leave etc) Welfare insurance. National education contribution. Collection is through the banks and applied as a percentage (all levies summed) to all payments (note exemptions) into personal accounts. 1.Individual taxpayers are banded into annual income bands by IRD and registered as such with their bank. The band is reviewed annually (?) 2.The levies are applied according to the taxpayer’s band and are progressive. 3.The progressive nature reflects a government subsidy linked to income. At the lowest income level, below the annualised minimum wage, the subsidy is 100%. 4.Individuals not registered for tax purposes pay the highest levy. 11. Company tax shifts from ‘profit’ to ‘income’ based as levies In lieu of company tax a regime of levies is proposed. These levies are applied to the income (money into company accounts) for all NZ tax registered companies. The levies are collected by the banks from the payee on gross revenue/income into registered NZ business taxpayer accounts. Companies not tax registered in NZ have the levy collected from the payor, from all payments leaving the NZ banking system: 1.Domestically as cash 2.Internationally to accounts on non-NZ tax registered entities. All levies are summed, rounded to fit IRD established bands and advised to collecting banks to be collected on all inflows (i.e. gross income) into company accounts. A default (higher) levy is applied to all accounts not registered as NZ business taxpayer accounts. This tax system treats NZ and foreign companies the same and thus meets international trade agreement requirements. 12. Company income levy types Company/industry based levies, rule based and within IRD determined classifications. 1.Industry based levies: i.Such as the. fishing industry levy, intended to contribute to the regulatory, research and support functions of the Ministry. ii.ACC (employer levy), industry linked. Not related to employee numbers or payments 2.“Insurance” type levies: i.Staff based such as KiwiSaver (employer contribution) ii.Staff independent to include contributions to national (personal) insurance for health, unemployment (provides for paid parental leave) and welfare. iii.Environmental levies, (not unlike ACC in concept) based on company carbon footprint and/or other such as water use etc. These avoid the need for complexities such as carbon taxes or trading (which are broad brush, open to speculation and often avoid the issue of improvement through trading). See section 22 Environmental Outcomes. 3.Generic levies can be progressive, selectively applied at income thresholds. i.Specific infrastructure hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the core infrastructure Ministries such as Defence, Transport, Law and Order. ii.Social support hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the big social ministries such as Health, Education & Social welfare. iii.National infrastructure levy, not hypothecated. 13. Levies on monies leaving the NZ banking system, simpler & better than BEPS CILS and CGST applies to all monies leaving the the NZ banking system. A company levy on payments to companies not registered for NZ tax purposes or operating outside of the NZ Banking system will be added to CGST and collected from the payor. 1.Levy is collected on all payments leaving the NZ Banking system – cash or payments to offshore entities. 2.The levy is applied equally within NZ and to offshore entities – complying with trade agreements. 3.A single default levy is applied, which will be at the highest level applied to registered companies. 4.These “non-registered” levies are added to CGST and collected at the same time from the payor by the transaction NZ bank. 5.This method of collection (collected from payor) is different from that for tax registered companies which is collected from payee revenue. This “non-registered” levy, together with CGST, will effectively tax offshore businesses and entities with a commercial interest in NZ. As the “non-registered” levy applies to all payments leaving the NZ Banking system it will apply to all offshore and cash payments, including: 1.Dividends, royalties, professional and other fees, loans etc – if money leaves the NZ banking system. 2.Investments offshore and general funds transfers offshore. 14. Exemptions to CGST and levies. The system is intended to have the minimum of exemptions 1.Transfers from the Government (e.g. national super or wellfare payments) are exempt CGST and recipients from PIL charges 2.Payments by the Government for goods, services etc are exempt CGST 3.Payments to registered charities are exempt CIL on receipt, but CGST when paid 4.Money entering the NZ banking system as cash or from offshore is exempt CGST (as payor is outside the system) but CIL/PIL is collected in the hands of the recipient (maybe exempt??) 5.Transfers of capital (not interest) between bank accounts of the same account holder (e.g. cheque to/from term investment) shall be exempt of both CGST and CIL/PIL otherwise in the current low interest rate environment any benefit from placing funds in higher interest accounts would be lost, distorting investment decisions. Interest is subject to CIL/PIL when received. 6.Transfers (gifts) between family members are exempt PIL on receipt, and CGST when paid. Requires registration with collecting bank (& IRD) of linked accounts.. 15.. Additional taxes and fees The system is intended to have the minimum of additional taxes. 1.Tourist infrastructure and conservation tax. Levied as a dollar amount per person per month of stay on arrival, by arrival authority. 2.Existing excise taxes on specific public harm products e.g. tobacco, alcohol. Collected as at present from company supplying products and incorporated into sell price by them. CGST applies. Yes CGST double dips on this. 3.Existing user pay type taxes such as RUC/fuel tax levied at point of sale (CGST applies) and paid by vendor. 4.User pays fees. Certain public services (e.g. in health and education) may be subject to means tested user part charges. 16. Tricky areas still exist Some areas present problems gathering tax under any system. Examples. 1.Expenditure in NZ from overseas bank accounts. Example, tourist with UK bank VISA card. CIL is applied, and CGST is collected on the NZ processed transaction by the NZ bank processing the transaction on behalf of the credit card company. 2.Offshore company purchases goods/services from its wholly owned NZ registered company, without the transaction entering the NZ banking system. CGST and CIL are avoided. Solution is complex and requires applying a nominal value to the transactions and a withholding CIL until payment is received. Considering that CIL and CGST relatively low there is reduced incentive for these scams. However, imposing withholding or other measures complicates a simple system but cannot be ruled out. 3.Staff of offshore entities in NZ are paid minimum wage and balance of salary held offshore; payments of NZ expenses (e.g. rent) directly from. Avoids CGST and some PIL. Can be policed, but not simple. 4.How to properly collect tax revenue when the whole transaction is offshore: e.g. tourist package sold offshore and delivered in NZ by offshore owned providers. All NZ gets is CGST for inputs at cost. 5.NZ residents/businesses shipping $ offshore and operating all expenditure from offshore accounts. Solution is for it to be an offence to have undisclosed offshore accounts & disclosed accounts require reporting and application of CGST to all monies leaving the account whether back into NZ or offshore. 17. Hypothecating tax revenue. Transparency in the tax system is considered a causal driver of efficiency in Government. The levy system in particular creates the impression that specific government services are being purchased – e.g. ACC insurance. In the long term some of the services may be fully funded by the levies leading to the government departments having to operate on a commercial and competitive basis. With levies such as ‘health insurance’ individual accounts (like KiwiSaver) should be run BUT the levy (except for income progression) should be maintained at a universal level. The universal nature of the levy is perhaps contradictory to the ideal of no demographic cross-subsidy (e.g. age linked health levy) but rather supports the concept of whanaungatanga. 18. Housing affordability Speculation is the housing market is a causal driver of overpricing. A market with unsatisfied demand is highly vulnerable. Not only is the NZ housing market overpriced. Base demand (the number of people who need houses to live in) is a supply and demand mismatch ... but tax structures can incentivise speculation driving churn and apparent demand. 1.Capital gains tax is often touted a the solution. i.It requires quite complex rules. ii.It is difficult to apply to all capital transactions (e.g. collectable wine) – why only housing if it’s such a good idea? 2.By taxing all expenditure and every transaction: i.Churn is discouraged, suppressing one source of demand. ii.Any ‘tax free’ status is eliminated further reducing demand. iii.All investment expenditure has equal tax appeal reducing ‘preferred’ market demand. It’s a bit late to turn the clock back on the current level of housing affordability, but this proposal is a future proof against it happening again. 19. Market performance The proposed tax regime will have a similar impact on the equities market as that on the housing market. 1.Reduce churn. 2.Reduce speculation. 3.Reduce ‘tax-free’ status of some investment vehicles and transactions. 4.Provide tax parity between all investments. 5.Improve market stability. 6.Provide better linkage between value, yield and price ... 7.... providing increased confidence to investors. The tax treatment of multi-nationals in NZ will encourage the greater retention of earning in NZ, leading to greater liquidity and available capital for the market. 20. Capital Gains & Land Tax Capital gains and land tax may appear to be thinking outside of the current tax system, but in effect are little more than applying “Band-Aids” to mask other economic problems. An integrated solution as proposed is preferred. A separate capital gains tax is outmoded and considered an ineffective and distorting tax. 1.There are always problems distinguishing between income from trading in assets (e.g. cars – collectors’ cars) or investing for gain. 2.The CGST approach eliminates the usually arbitrary nature of tests for capital gains or trade activity. The bright line test is so arbitrary that it keeps shifting. 3.Depending on the arbitrary line between trade profit and capital gain different tax rules (e.g.rate of taxation, deductibility of expenses) may apply. 4.Depending on the definitions the market may be skewed to favour certain investments or trades. (e.g. PIE). 5.CGST applies a single rate to all transactions irrespective of their nature avoiding a bias towards any activity or investment. It’s all just money. 6.Discouraging investment in housing through a capital gains tax is likely to flow on to a restricted supply of rental accommodation and further rent escalation. 7.Given the low rate of the proposed CGST there appears to be no material issue requiring the exempting of family homes. Land tax is considered unhelpful and unnecessary 1.Again this is adding complexity. Land on a cross-lease section? 2.This proposal effectively taxes land as part of transactions included in the CGST. 21. BEPS The BEPS solution to uncollected tax from multi-nationals operating in NZ or offshore companies trading in NZ is a tax advisors dream come true. The solution proposed here is simpler and more effective. 22. Environmental outcomes The dominant thinking on influencing business and personal decision making on environmental issues hinges on tradable rights (e.g. water) or taxes (e.g. carbon credits). Creating markets for tradable environmental factors takes the focus of the issues and directs it towards the market. Buying carbon credits (dodgy ones aside) does nothing to reduce carbon emissions in NZ. The causal driver of good environmental performance is businesses taking the right decisions for the environment leading to actually delivering improvements. Common sense dictates that the positive drivers of good environmental performance should be rewarded, and the negative drivers (or absence of positives) penalised. ACC sets it’s levies this way – and it works. Hence the recommendation of industry specific levies with an environmental component. To illustrate: Polluting or high carbon industries should face a higher levy, but one which can be reduced (at a company level) by demonstrating: i.A plan to mitigate – level 1 reduction in levy ii.Successful implementation of the plan – level 2 reduction of levy iii.Create environmental positives and/or innovation – level 3 reduction of levy A. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 2 Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges and opportunities for the tax system? Which of these are most important? See sections 3, 6 &7 How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? Specifically the tax system should not be subject to ad hoc changes to address current ‘hot buttons’. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Tikanga Māori are an integral part of NZ culture and business life and the concepts of tikanga Māori can and should be allowed to influence thinking on a new tax system. One should not be captured by the sometimes expressed view that tikanga Māori are by their nature old and therefore irrelevant to NZ commerce today. The challenge the Working Group faces is to enunciate the tikanga Māori and envisage the extent to which there are specifics that should become objectives of the tax system and work towards them. In this submission an attempt is made to at least acknowledge the values of: Manaakitanga are in part recognised in the tourist infrastructure and conservation levy which recognises NZ as being a special place to visit and share with the people of NZ and should be protected as such. Whanaungatanga are in a small way recognised in the free movement of capital between linked family accounts and in universal individual levies. Kaitiakitanga are expressed to some extent in the progressive nature of the environmental levies and the they way they are applied – been seen to do good – rather than the market focus of tradable rights/credits. B. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 3 Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Equity, efficiency (cost of assessment, collection and payment),positive economic causal drivers, future proof, transparent Defining ‘fairness' How would you define ‘fairness' in the context of the tax system? The tax burden should be shared evenly (universally) by all participants in every aspect of the NZ economy. Those with less should not subsidise those with more (business or individual). What would a fair tax system look like? This submission proposes a fair tax system. C. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 4 Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? Broad-based and low rate yes. GST – not appropriate at present. Value-add based, too many exemptions. Income tax is ‘earnings’ (for individuals) and ‘profit’ (for companies) based. Both of these concepts are under threat with changes in the basis of internet and global commerce. If not, what approach should replace it? Simply put, the system proposed here. Specifically, if money changes hands it should be taxed (exemptions apply) and gross income should be levied to reflect the nature of the entity being taxed in their interest in government services. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Yes If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Multinational/offshore entity responsibility in NZ market & retention of income in NZ as proposed. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? Yes If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? As proposed compulsory KiwiSaver as a levy. D. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 5 Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? No, speculation in assets is encouraged. If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? CGST as proposed. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No, the proposal eliminates returns (GST & income tax) and the calculation of tax provisions. Plus cost of IRD under present system flows onto business. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? The proposed system, by focusing on money changing hands (CGST) treats all businesses equally as it should. However the assumption at work is that all natural capital is charged for appropriately – e.g. water. The tax system is not appropriate for address problems in government and local government setting charges. At best the tax system can apply some notional value to the resource and attribute a notional payment that is taxed. E. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 6 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? 1.Undue burden on NZ companies (and individuals) from non-collected tax from offshore entities. 2.Distortions between earnings from capital and production. Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Only in the context of a fully integrated system; no bolt-on or tinkering please! Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? This submission demonstrates thinking outside the current system. While all the taxes proposed have their root in an existing tax the overall system is new. F. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 7 Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? - See proposal section 18 Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains No - See proposal section 20 Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax? No - See proposal section 20 Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? - See proposal section 22 Progressive company tax - See proposal section 11-12 Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? No - See proposal section 16

Dawn Witheford 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz I am a Chartered Accounting working in a large public practice firm. I (along with my husband) have worked hard to get the assets we hold today in order to provide for our future retirement so as not to be a burden on society (or family) later in life. In order to complete my bachelor’s degree I worked full time and studied by correspondence, as the cost of papers was not subsidised and based on my parents income I was not entitled to any student allowance. We have saved and invested wisely in assets that typically grow in value to try and keep pace with inflation so as to future proof them. Part of our savings has been invested in rental property as we like to be able to hold tangible investments in which we can put some personal effort over time to protect and maintain. I believe there is already a high level of focus on property taxes in New Zealand and my view is that the current system is simple to understand and works well. The assumption that rental property receives tax advantages is untrue. The IRD have said repeatedly that property investment does not receive any tax advantages. Also, according to a study commissioned by the New Zealand Property Investors Federation by financial and economic consultants Morgan Wallace, the marginal effective tax rate for rental property is actually higher than the majority of other assets. The current system provides a good balance of providing for the needs of tenants while still encouraging investment in property. Yields may be low, but landlords are still contributing significantly to New Zealand's taxation. I am disappointed with repeated comments throughout the submission document on growing concerns about inequality, fairness and taxation on assets and wealth, with the comment of ‘a renewed interest in wealth taxes internationally despite the falling use of them in practise’, which implies that these will be focussed on in an attempt to appease lobby groups. These all look like an attempt at creating an environment to introduce Envy taxes with the sole intention of punishing people who have made sacrifices and choices to provide a strong financial future for themselves Taxes and Behaviour: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? I don’t believe that taxes should be used to try and modify behaviour of investors. They should only be used to protect society in general from things which are detrimental to people’s health or wellbeing e.g. tobacco and alcohol. \[1\] The majority of rental property owners are just regular people (like myself and my husband) who are trying to make a living and provide for their retirement. They are contributing to society by providing much needed housing while contributing to the local economy. The government have historically seen the value of private investment in rental properties because the government is logistically unable to provide all of the housing needed (as is demonstrated by the current housing crisis in many of our large cities). There now seems to be a shift in focus with proposed taxes specifically targeting property investors, which will strongly discourage this form of investment. It is hard to see the merit in bringing in taxes which would reduce the available rental stock, because that is what would happen if a ‘property tax’ is introduced. Not everyone wants to own their own house. Rental property contributes hugely to the local economy through employment in the property related trades and services, banking and insurance companies while also providing homes for these workers and tax to Government. Retirement savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? The system should encourage saving but should not favour one investment over another or make investment in any type compulsory. There are many ways that people can provide for their retirement that suits their own individual circumstances. Changing any taxes to penalise a sector of investors such as rental property owners may put groups of people off investing in anything at all. This worries me as it will create a greater reliance on government benefits in the future. The results of the current tax system. Fairness and balance: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? It seems unfair that there is not a similar level of focus on buying and selling shares as that placed on property. I think the bright line test should apply to all investment types in order to fairly tax speculators. Rental property owners already have an increased level of scrutiny through the IRD having a Property Tax Compliance Unit and a Bright Line Test. Thinking outside the current system: What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? No new taxes should be introduced, but I think there needs to be better enforcement of current tax laws in particular around share market speculation. This would increase the tax revenue and promote fairness and consistency of investment types. Ring fencing of losses should not be implemented. There has been a lot of comment that this is a loop hole for rental property investors, but this is not true as all business can offset their costs and losses against other income. To specifically disallow this for property investors further discourages property investors and will dissuade new investors from investing when further investment in housing is seriously needed in order to increase the supply of rental properties. The introduction of new ‘targeted’ taxes can create a number of unintended consequences. If a Capital Gains Tax was introduced in order to reduce other taxes (which excluded the family home), there would be a reduction in the number of people willing to invest in income producing assets such as rental properties and it would instead encourage more money to be invested into higher priced non-productive family homes. Specific challenges. Housing affordability. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Allowing losses on rental property to offset other income tax payable is an important aspect which allows owners to provide and maintain their investment return while being able to charge cheaper rent than would otherwise be required. Additionally, not taxing capital gains on a long-term investment also allows rental property owners to maintain their investment return and charge less rent. It is regularly assumed that that the ability of rental property owners to claim expenses such as mortgage interest, council rates, insurances and maintenance costs means they have an advantage over homeowners when buying property. This is not true. A rental owner gets rental income and pays tax on the profit (after expenses) they make, while a home owner gets use of the accommodation to offset these expenses. Higher taxes specifically on rental property will increase the cost of providing rental property leading to either a reduction in supply, an increase in price, an increase in overcrowding, or more likely, a combination of all three. Capital gains tax: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax. Many people will still want to invest their money into property and this would encourage spending on larger more expensive family homes and reduce the investment into farms, businesses, shares, rental property and other assets. A targeted Capital Gains Tax would be complicated to administer and is unlikely to raise significant tax income. If a Capital Gains Tax is to be introduced it should include the family home as well as shares and other assets. Land Tax: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? New Zealand should not introduce a Land Tax. A Land Tax excluding the family home would have unintended consequences (as already mentioned above) encouraging more development of expensive homes on large sections of land, which would not help alleviate the current housing and rental supply shortage. A land tax would increase the cost of providing rental properties, leading to reduced supply, increased rental prices, and an increase in overcrowding. A land tax would increase business costs which would increase the price of all goods and services. It would be complicated for mixed use premises, such as home and incomes, mixed-use commercial/residential properties and farms. Progressive company tax: Would a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) improve the tax system and the business environment? I don’t think the company tax rates should be changed. I think the system is fair as it is. The tax system and positive environmental outcomes: What role could the taxation system play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term? As mentioned previously, I believe ‘punitive taxes’ should only be used to protect society in general from things which are detrimental to people’s health or wellbeing. I think our environment falls into this category. We need to protect it for future generations and stop the degradation of our global environment. I think New Zealand’s ‘clean and green’ image is being eroded and efforts need to be made to curb behaviour by implementing further taxes on known detrimental factors e.g. fuel emissions and rubbish. We need to encourage better use of our natural resources. I would support further investigation into what should be taxed further in this regard. GST exemptions for particular goods: Should GST be removed from some goods and services? I think our current GST system works well and is simple and easy to manage. Any change to provide exemptions for particular goods will detract from that and likely cause unintended consequences. I do not wish to be heard in support of this submission. Yours sincerely Dawn Witheford

TAX180429SubmissionWG Submission to Tax Working Group from David Close 1.0 Personal background 1.1 I am not an economist but I have been a lifelong observer of the economic scene and an active participant in politics. I have Master’s Degrees in Latin and Political Science. I was a secondary school teacher for 28 years, but, of more relevance, I spent 30 years in public life, including 24 years as a Christchurch City Councillor, and time as a Director of Christchurch City Holdings, Director of Transpower, Member of the Electricity Commission and Deputy-Chair of the Canterbury Community Trust. Whilst at Essex University in 1971-72 I did research into housing in Britain. I have read the National Business Review for about 20 years. 1.2 I recall as a child the austerity of the war years and post-war years; as a teenager, the boom of the fifties, and as a young man the prosperity and consensus politics of the sixties. Whilst the economic conditions of the sixties cannot be replicated, policies for taxation and redistribution supported by both major parties in those years deserve attention today with a view to their re-adoption. 2.0 Relevance of Thomas Picketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” 2.1 I read the book in its entirety shortly after it was published. Its general conclusions are highly relevant to the work of the Tax Working Group, especially such lines as: • “Today.............inequalities of wealth that had supposedly disappeared are close to regaining or even surpassing their historical highs.” (page 471) • “ .....good economic and social policy requires more than just a high marginal tax rate on extremely high incomes. By its very nature such a tax brings in almost nothing. A progressive tax on capital is a more suitable instrument for responding to the challenges of the twenty-first century than a progressive income tax, which was designed for the twentieth century (although the two tools can play complementary roles in the future.” (page 473) • “........new instruments are needed to gain control over a financial system that has run amok.” (page 474) • “the tax and transfer systems that are the heart of the modern social state are in constant need of reform and modernisation.” (page 474) • “In contrast to what many people in Britain and the United States believe, the true figures on growth......show that Britain and the United States have not grown any more rapidly since 1980 than Germany, France, Japan, Denmark or Sweden. In other words the reduction of top marginal income tax rates do not seem to have stimulated productivity.” (page 510) 3.0 Government objective: A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability. 3.1 The information in the Background Paper shows the concentration of wealth in the top quintile (Figure 17) and the Government’s reliance on taxes on income and consumption (Figure 4). There is clearly lack of balance here between the treatment of income and assets. The paper points out that the top decile pays 35% of income tax, but also that GST, which is regressive in nature, contributes 31.4% of the total tax take. 3.2 With a view to dealing with the lack of balance as between tax on income and assets, the Working Group asks for views on a land tax and on a capital gains tax. I think it likely that a land tax would strike some problems in dealing with farm land. Local authorities manage the challenge by striking a differential rate, but that could be problematic on a national scale. It would also be inequitable to tax investment in land and not investment in other assets. A capital gains tax also raises problems, which the Paper refers to; dealing with gains and losses is complex. 3.3 On the other hand, a wealth tax, which embraced investments of all sorts, (land, buildings, shares, fixed interest investments, personal possessions) would be equitable as between one type of asset and another. A threshold could be set at, say, $1.2m. so that the family home would not be affected. A person owning an average family home and a modest rental property would likewise not be affected. Owners of multiple rental properties would be subject to the wealth tax. 3.4 The argument by property investors that any tax on rental property would be a disincentive to investment by landlords should be welcomed. It is demand by investors in rental property that has driven up the cost of lower-value homes and made purchases by first-home buyers much more difficult. 4.0 Government objective: A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families 4.1 The Paper makes reference to the fact taxes and transfer payments may have unintended consequences or benefit, or penalise, unintended parties. One such transfer payment is the Accommodation Supplement, which is paid to tenants to assist them to pay rent to (mainly) private landlords. The Supplement is an immediate help to tenants but it has the effect of increasing the rental value of the property, and pushing up the price of all properties that could be suitable for rent. It is similar in its effect to the notorious stock-retention scheme, under which farm land rose in value whenever the rate paid to farmers was increased. I understand that Treasury wrote a paper pointing out the perverse effect of the Accommodation Supplement but that it was ignored by the Government of the day. 4.2 The cost of the Accommodation Supplement is in the region of $1.5b p.a., but the Government’s direct spending housing is much less, according to Figure 6. In an earlier age, to which I referred above, Governments used tax revenue in a more economically literate manner to: (i) make transfer payments to first home owners by way of capitalising the family benefit to provide a home deposit, and by providing a concessional interest rate on loans from the Housing Corporation (ii) invest directly in building rental properties, thus increasing publicly owned housing assets. 5.0 Financial transactions tax 5.1 One of the striking features of the last few decades has been the development of speculative currency trading on a vast scale. A few years ago I read articles about the Tobin tax in The Guardian weekly; it seemed that its time might have come after the Global Financial Crisis, but nothing has happened, as far as I know. I assume that a number of countries would need to co-operate to advance it. I urge the Tax Working group to give it consideration. 6.0 The tax take 6.1 The demand for government services is increasing especially in health, with the advance of medical science and the increasing age of the population. It is foolish to imagine that reasonable expectations can be met for the health system without an increase in taxation. During the last election campaign, the electorate showed an unexpected acceptance of this fact, opting, by a narrow margin, for parties that proposed to cancel tax cuts in order to provide more spending in health and education. A modest increase in the proportion of GDP devoted to tax should be acceptable. 7.0 Summary of Submission That the Tax Working Group: (i) develop a proposal for a broad-based wealth tax to provide balance between the treatment of assets, income and consumption for tax purposes (ii) research proposals by which transfer payments currently made to tenants for housing might be phased out to avoid current adverse effects on the housing market and uneconomic use of taxpayer funds, and restructured to provide enduring benefit to tenants and first home buyers (iii) research the Tobin financial transactions tax and make recommendations as to how it might be implemented in cooperation with other countries. (iv) make the case to the Government for an increase in the total tax take in line with public expectations for Government spending on health, housing and education.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group Summary of major points & recommendations: 1) Significantly broaden the tax base to urgently rebuild an equal opportunity society in New Zealand, especially in the area of housing affordability 2) The purpose of tax is to raise necessary government revenue & to restore & then maintain a fully productive egalitarian society, through the redistribution of both income & wealth 3) Regular increases in tobacco tax have reduced smoking rates. The same tax logic should be applied to liquor 4) Reinstate the Social Contract between the NZ Government & its citizens What does the future of tax look like to you? 1) The introduction of income tax cuts & the increase of GST in the 2010 budget, significantly reduced the government’s net tax revenue. The table attached to that budget set out the resulting pluses & minuses in government revenue, showing an overall reduction in government income of c $700m per annum. It’s estimated that this annual shortfall in government revenue is now c $1.5 B 2) Consequently, there’s an urgent need to broaden our tax base & this can be achieved in the following ways: a) Close the NZ tax loopholes currently enjoyed by firms such as: Apple, Google, Amazon, Face Book, MasterCard, Visa, & the Aged Care industry b) Introduce a Financial Transactions Tax, (set at around .01%, or 1 cent per $100) which taxes all banking transactions. This would raise millions of dollars per year but have little effect on the banks’ domestic customers. In September 2017, the UK Labour Party pledged to introduce a FTT in its first budget after re- election c) Introduce a graduated & comprehensive Capital Gains Tax to tax unearned income. As part of this, reintroduce, on a graduated scale, death & gift duties d) To prevent tax payers who derive income from salaries, companies & trusts, from shifting income to the entity with the lowest tax rate, tax rates for all taxable entities, (both individuals & incorporated organisations) should be on a uniform, graduated scale e) This graduated scale needs a top tax rate considerably higher than our present 33 % for salary & wage earners. Our 33% rate, (introduced in 2010) is one of the lowest in the OECD. Mexico’s top rate, for example is 35%. Countries like ours, with third world tax rates, develop third world economies & societies, characterised by low wages & entrenched poverty. This has been NZ’s path over the last 8 years, following the 2010 tax cuts. Our top tax rate should be aligned to Australia’s top rate of 49% f) Sir Michael Cullen, in a recent interview with ‘The Spinoff’ stated, ‘If you look at the Nordic countries, they tend to tax more heavily – more of their transfers are universal, but it nevertheless achieves greater equality.’ Sir Michael’s views are borne out by the OECD’s 2017 survey, declaring Denmark as the happiest nation in the world. Denmark’s maximum individual tax rate is 56% What is the purpose of Tax? 1) Tax is the price we pay to live in a civilised society. In most modern societies, the principle of tax is, ‘from each according to his means, to each according to his needs.’ This principle originated with the early Christian Church in the New Testament, Acts 4, verses 32 - 35 2) Likewise, the justification for graduated or progressive tax rates is based on Luke 12:48, ‘For those to whom much is given, much is required.’ Everybody in society, including the wealthy, benefit from government spending in health, education, roading, etc. 3) The purpose of tax is to raise government revenue & to redistribute both income & wealth in order to maintain a socially just, cohesive society 4) The need for redistribution is vital. Oxfam NZ’s report of 22.1.18 stated that 28% of all wealth created in NZ went to the richest 1% of the population & 1% of that wealth went to the poorest 30% 5) Recent NZ indicators on economic inequality, child poverty, housing unaffordability, declining real wages & increasing imprisonment rates, point to breakdown in society. Unless urgent & significant financial redistribution occurs, we face social unrest on an increasing scale 6) What is required is a reintroduction of the Social Contract, (sometimes called the Social Dividend or Social Wage) which was successfully operated by both Labour & National Governments for the 50 years from the mid 1930’s to the mid 1980’s. The essence of the Social Contract is an agreement between the Government & its citizens, whereby, if the citizens pay tax, work productively, obey the law & raise the next generation to the best of their ability, the government will finance, through the tax system, a full employment economy paying living wages, free education up to tertiary level, affordable health care & housing, (whether to rent or buy) & financial security in times of old age or adversity. This use of the tax system during these 50 years, gave NZ one of the most productive economies in the world, through the elimination of entrenched poverty & the establishment of an equal opportunity society. Are we taxing the right things? 1) Tobacco taxes have increased significantly over recent years & are automatically increased annually. This has had the desirable effect of reducing tobacco consumption 2) Alcohol causes far more social & economic damage to NZ society than tobacco & a reduction in consumption would be very beneficial. Alcohol should carry the same rate of tax as tobacco, with automatic annual tax increases Can tax make housing more affordable? 1) Yes – The NZ Government needs more tax revenue to accelerate both the building of more State rental units & the ‘KiwiBuild’ affordable homes programme. These programmes should continue at maximum volumes until our housing needs are fully met & a housing surplus has reduced prices for both rentals & homes for purchase 2) When this happens, the $2 B accommodation supplements being paid annually to landlords, can be used for something more socially useful What tax issues matter most to you? 1) Since the 2010 budget, the significant annual reduction in government revenue has had a cumulative effect & has led 8 years later, to a housing crisis, declining educational & health statistics, disintegrating infrastructure & gridlocked cities with inadequate public transport 2) If only piecemeal tax raising measures are contemplated & if the structural underpinnings of wealth polarisation are not recognised, our grand children’s’ future is bleak 3) Reinstating the Social Contract between the NZ Government & its citizens, would reinstate a tax system based on fairness, equity & social justice – we would all benefit Biographical details for Dean Reynolds: 30 years in a Queen St Chartered Accounting firm, with 20 of these years as the senior partner, then 10 years in various corporate positions, then 10 years as a landscape gardener & mowing contractor, culminating in retirement in November 2017.

Page 1 of 7 SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP Tax Working Group Secretariat submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz. 30 April 2018 In summary, my submission is that:  Social "fairness" should be seen in the context of equal opportunity and reward for personal effort, rather than income equality as is presumed by the TWG.  The negative consequences of a wealth tax (capital gains tax or land tax) that excludes the family home would be significant.  Politicising the tax system to enhance social objectives, like racial privilege or environmental activism, will undoubtedly erode public confidence in the taxation system, and especially from the top 20% of taxpayers who already pay the majority of the income tax.  Applying further exemptions to the GST regime will increase compliance costs, and opportunities for fraud. The argument for exempting GST on building products is as compelling as it is for exempting GST on food.  A progressive company tax system would add further compliance costs to the dividend imputation regime, and add little if any practical benefit. General comments Money flows into the area of least tax. Typically tax reviews have been guided by tax efficiency principles. The mandate of the Tax Working Group (TWG) differs in that the Terms of Reference require recommendations predetermined by political objectives. In my view that seriously compromises the integrity of the recommendations and predetermines the outcomes that are likely to arise from the review. Those Terms of Reference are to report:  whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system;  whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment;  what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes;  whether to remove GST from any particular goods It is also significant that a purpose is to broaden the tax base, as is evident in the comment that, “The Government’s fiscal objective for the tax system is to support a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of gross domestic \[1\] \[1\] Page 2 of 7 product (GDP). If the Government is to continue providing healthcare and superannuation at current levels, then the level of taxation will need to increase.” The need to increase revenue is highlighted in the Group's report (page 10) when they forecast the government's primary expenses to rise from 28.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) currently, to 31.1% by 2030 and 33.8% by 2045. The key themes promoted throughout the Background Paper are:  Wealth redistribution,  Advantaging those engaged in what they call the "Maori economy",  Achieving positive environmental outcomes, and  Making homes more affordable by using the tax system to make investment in rental property less attractive. That signals a shift from the approach to date, and conventional thinking in prosperous countries, that tax policy is primarily about gathering revenue in a fair and equitable manner without killing the Golden Goose (who, in New Zealand, are the 10% of households with the highest incomes who pay 35% of all income tax, while the bottom 50% of income earners contribute only 19%). That's why most countries are lowering tax rates. Those rational thinking countries take the view that social objectives are achieved via government spending. Muddling those approaches will bring about a seismic shift in the way our central Government collects its revenue, and will, in my view, create multiple negative consequences that will manifest themselves in the long-term. Essentially the problem with increasing tax revenue is that the increased taxes will be paid by those who already bear the largest tax burden. There will come a point when that group baulks at being milked like a cash cow, and will return to the days when avoidance was a significant influence on business planning. Income equality and tax The Report states "Income inequality is often used as a measure of fairness across society", and makes reference to the ...... measure of equality internationally. Fairness is a matter for debate, it is not for the Working Group to take as a given. It seems the Group has already formed the view that fairness is a society where the tax system creates income equality. This I content displays a prejudicial position by presuming income equality should be used as a measure of fairness across society. The logical conclusion is the tax objective of equalising net income after transfer payments, regardless of skill or work ethic. To presume a fair society is one where everyone earns the same regardless of effort or skill should be abhorrent to anyone who believes people should be rewarded according to the results of their personal effort. What would be fair about an indolent spendthrift being rewarded, while those who are diligent and thrifty are penalised via the tax system, be it via income or wealth taxes? Housing The Paper notes the top 20% of households have an average net worth of $1.35m (including the home). The bottom 20% has a net worth of $8,000. When the home is excluded, those figures fall to Page 3 of 7 $601,800 and minus $100 respectively. Clearly, home ownership is a significant factor in wealth accumulation. That highlights the significant wealth disparity between those who own their own home and those that don't. Home ownership is the key to wealth accumulation and the sooner someone buys a home, the better. It's a truism that should be pretty obvious to those who seek an answer to the question, why do some people accumulate wealth while others remain poor? Another truism is, the more you save the more you will accumulate. Politicians would make better use of their time if they turned their attention to those truisms instead of focussing on new ways to squeeze more tax out of those who are already paying it. If they embedded these simple rules into their policy development process, they may come up with wealth creating policies like these:  Transitioning those who are out of work into work.  Requiring everyone to save part of every dollar they earn. The reality is that those who most need to save don't.  Incentivising people to own their own home as quickly as possible. In February there was media commentary about a state house in Remuera worth $3m. The 81 year- old tenant had lived in the property for 37 years. Turn the clock back to 1981. Had the then 44 year old tenant been required to save into a KiwiSaver account, and through that scheme, had purchased the house from the state, he would today be a multi-millionaire, and financially independent. Not only that, he may well have had a tidy sum to pass onto the next generation so they too can get a step up onto the wealth ladder. That lost opportunity is the true cost of government policies that perpetuate welfare. What is unfortunate about the Future of Tax is the underlying presumption that using the tax system as a lever for social policy is going to solve the major social issues of our time. It won't. It will simply mean the man in the $3m state house will have a few dollars extra a week to make his dependency a little more comfortable. I endorse measures that encourage home ownership, at an early age. However, this will not be achieved by creating further disincentives to invest in residential property on the expectation that private sector landlords will divest with the effect that houses will become more affordable to first home buyers. The housing shortage has been caused by supply constraints (regulatory controls, lack of skilled workers, restricted finance arising from the additional lending risks attached to the regulatory uncertainties of development), and demand pressures (record high immigration). Addressing those issues directly would be a more efficient way of addressing the housing issue than indirectly via the tax system. Taxing residential investment property With respect to the way property is currently taxed, the Report lists no fewer than five ways gains from the sale of residential investment property is taxed. Having detailed the multitude of unique ways that gains from the sale of property are treated as income for tax purposes (in contrast to the tax treatment of shares, farmland, and the sale of a business, which are not taxed), the report concludes, "real property held for more than \[five\] years is undertaxed relative to other investments when there are capital gains." Page 4 of 7 This conclusion is based on a table of marginal effective tax rates on savings (page 40). This table compares the effective tax rate on a range of investments based on the top marginal tax rate and the rate of inflation. However, when considering rental property they assume gains on the sale of a property are not taxed. It is notable that the Group's marginal tax rate comparison shows that the least taxed investment - the most advantageous from a tax perspective - is owning one’s own home. There is an inescapable truism in tax policy that no rational person, and few politicians, would dispute: Money flows into the area of least tax. Because the terms of reference have categorically excluded the Group from considering a capital gains tax on the family home, a capital gains tax that does not include the family home will result in the "mansion effect". The least tax strategy will be to invest in one's own home, with the intention of down-sizing at some stage in the future to provide a tidy tax-free nest egg. The inevitably consequence is that houses will be become larger and have more features. For many it will be the perfect investment - indulging oneself in luxury and escaping the tax net! That consequence will be an increase in "unproductive" investment into residential property. It is my submission that a capital gains tax that is not universal and excludes the family home will have significant negative consequences and increase investment in residential housing. Land tax Another wealth tax mentioned by the Tax Working Group is land tax (where owner-occupied land, or presumably a curtilage portion of it, would be exempt). More than likely, this tax would be in the form of an additional "rate" paid to central government via local authorities as a collection agent. With respect to Maori land in the context of a land tax, in my view there should be no racial discrimination in the tax system - every taxpayer should be taxed according to their means not their ancestry. I refer the TWG to the publication, "Background paper for Session 3 of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group", prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and dated September 2009. 1 Impact on land values A land tax would be expected to cause an immediate fall in the value of land by the net present value of the future land tax liabilities (and so constitutes a lump-sum tax on those who own land at the date of its introduction). An example provided in Coleman and Grimes suggests that the introduction of a 1% land tax should result in a 16.7% fall in land values. But greater falls are likely if there is some ongoing real increase in land rents. The expected fall in land values is very sensitive to the rate of tax introduced and to assumptions made in modelling. In particular, it will tend to be larger the greater is the expected real rate of growth in land rents. The calculation by Coleman and Grimes assumes no real growth in land rents. 1 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg/publications/3-land-tax-ird\_treasury.pdf Page 5 of 7 A deductible land tax of 1% in conjunction with a 1% annual growth in rents, a 30% marginal tax rate for investors but other assumptions as in the Coleman and Grimes example has been modelled by Inland Revenue, and produces a 26.4% drop in land values. Such falls in land values would have significant effect on existing land owners and others, such as investors and lenders. It might mean that people who currently have heavily geared land end up with negative net equity. This could in turn impact on the balance sheets of mortgage lenders, particularly banks. Fairness A land tax could be criticised as being unfair. It taxes one component of wealth. The impact on land values would be borne only by those who are unfortunate enough to hold wealth in one particular form. Retirees, farmers and Maori authorities would be particularly affected. Tax bases that use broader measures of wealth, income or consumption better meet social conceptions of horizontal equity. Cashflow issues In its simplest form, land tax would be payable on an annual basis. However, land tax does not relate to a flow of income (e.g. income tax) or a transaction (GST). Consequently, payment of land tax may give rise to cashflow issues for some landowners, particularly those who have significant land holdings but lower income levels, such as retired people. A land tax is not without merit, if applied universally which has been ruled out in the review's terms of reference. GST On the matter of GST, the Group says, "removing GST from some goods and services is often discussed...as a way to ensure people can afford more of these goods and services". No doubt, the calls for GST to be removed on food and other essential products will be renewed. If new exemptions are to be considered then an equally meritorious case could be put for GST exemptions to apply to with respect to ‘warmer’ and more ‘affordable’ housing by exempting GST on home insulation, heat pumps, and building materials. A GST exemption on building materials is consistent with the objective of more affordable housing. According to buildingguide.co.nz it costs about $3,000 per square metre to build a 150 m2 single story home on a flat section with a "medium" quality of fit out. That's $450,000, before GST. The government's tax take would add another $67,500, which takes the cost to $3,450 m2. Clearly GST is a significant detrimental factor in housing affordability. The only way the Minister will be able to make housing more affordable is to remove the biggest single cost which is GST on new housing. The GST on building materials is a significant source of revenue for central government, making exemption unlikely. Further exemptions to the GST system would complicate compliance and open the door for tax abuse. Page 6 of 7 Environmental challenges On environmental challenges, the TWG says, "Using the tax system to ensure that consumers and producers face the costs of emissions and other environmental harm could be one way we can meet our international obligations and encourage innovative ways to reduce pollution." Here they seem to be referring to farmers with greenhouse gas "emitting" livestock. The decision to include agriculture in the Emissions Trading Scheme appears to have already been made by central government. The TWG goes on to say, "Environmental challenges extend well beyond climate...New Zealanders' wellbeing is closely linked to the ecosystem services that natural capital provides. Indigenous biodiversity has rapidly declined and continues to be threatened, especially on private land. New Zealand now has one of the highest proportion of native species at risk, and in a review of 71 rare ecosystems in New Zealand 45 species were found to be threatened with extinction. It is possible for pricing and tax instruments to play a role in addressing these challenges" So it seems, the intention is to use the tax system to meet our climate change obligations and save our biodiversity. It is my submission that positive behaviour is best achieved through incentives, as this is in the nature of encouragement rather than punitive penalties through taxation system, which erodes social wealth when a product or service is demand inelastic. It is my observation that New Zealanders are favourably inclined towards positive environmental behaviours and respond better to a carrot than they do a stick. Tax and the Maori economy On the taxation of Maori owned businesses, the Group asks for Maori to comment on:  Whether the Maori authority tax regime supports or hinders Maori economic and social development.  Whether there are parts of the current tax system that warrant review from the point of view of te ao Maori  How tikanga Maori might be able to help create a more future-focused tax system. Clearly, the Group will consider whether tax breaks should be given to Maori, in addition to those that already exist. I oppose discrimination on the grounds of ancestry, and particularly as it applies to taxation. Not only is discrimination seen by most people as unfair, it also has the potential to undermine the tax system. Fairness is an important factor in establishing public confidence in the taxation system, and in ensuring compliance. The incidence of avoidance and evasion is likely to be less if a system is seen to be fair. Politicising the tax system to enhance social objectives, like racial privilege or environmental activism, will undoubtedly create dissent and extra work for tax lawyers and accountants. Page 7 of 7 Company tax Comment is sought on "progressive company tax", in other words, stepped tax rates based on turnover. In particular on how the scheme "might interact with our imputation system (and any proposed CGT on the sale of shares) and what consequential changes would be needed to counteract tax sheltering arrangements". The imputation system is already beyond the comprehension of most business people. Adding a further complexity in the form of multiple tax rates will inevitably add to compliance costs. I question the benefit of a progressive company tax regime, when in practice the proprietors of small companies already minimise their income tax liability by "distributing" company profits as shareholder salaries. - END -

Paid work, or labour, now occurs in both formal and informal workplaces and inside and outside of conventional working hours. 3 How we view work is changing. 45 With these fundamental changes, there is a need to develop new ways of remunerating work, both paid and unpaid. Is Basic Income the answer? 678 To optimise the levels of participation and engagement of those in precarious employment in the workplace and the community, present incomes with benefit support are examined and compared with potential incomes with a Basic Income. A Basic Income ensures that those with precarious employment have a level of regular income. Regular incomes help boost and stabilise local economies. As money flows through society: people with low incomes spend money quickly and locally on necessities while those with higher incomes, exceeding their immediate needs, tend to accumulate money or spend it elsewhere and internationally. Increasing the proportion of money available to those on lower incomes boosts local economies while increasing the velocity of money and government revenues. Alternatively, increasing the proportion of money available to those on higher incomes slows the velocity of money and consequently reduces government revenues. 9101112 What will a Basic Income look like and how is it funded? A Basic Income paid as a right of citizenship and not abated or taxed back on an individual basis provides an answer. A Basic Income Calculator designed to investigate and to compare proposals was developed. Parameters considered include: a tax free or taxed Basic Income, and a progressive or uniform tax? Two options considered in detail were a taxable Basic Income with a progressive tax, like the New Zealand Superannuation scheme, and either a taxable or tax free Basic Income with a uniform tax. A modest voluntary or opt-in Basic Income with a uniform tax stood out as a preferred option. Ways to implement this option are considered. Changing to a Basic Income will eliminate poverty traps and alleviate poverty. Introduction The primary focus of this paper is those with low incomes and in precarious employment; those without permanent employment; those with unpredictable employment or work hours; those who may not work a full week or a full year; and those who earn less than the minimum wage on an annual basis due to their limited hours of work. The way the state approaches issues involved with fundamental rights and a means of improving outcomes for those in the precariat are considered. The present benefit system is examined and compared with the alternative of a Basic Income. While many who are in precarious employment would rather have full time and well-paying employment, and see precarious employment as undesirable, there are others who seek this lifestyle. They are people who seek occasional work to provide just enough income to meet their modest needs. They may not wish to work a full week for various reasons: perhaps they are caring for family members in need, perhaps they are artists, or perhaps they are following further education. These people need to be recognised. The number of people in precarious employment is increasing as are the number of jobs in this area and seeking to eliminate this form of employment is unlikely to succeed. The present welfare system is examined to see how it caters for people on low-income and how it might be improved to increase general wellbeing. The primary focus of this paper is Basic Income as a solution to the problems of those on Job Seeker support or in precarious employment. However, Basic Income payments are universal, that is, paid to everyone. Consequently, a Basic Income when fully implemented will impact on all welfare payments and the incomes of all people. The impacts of those currently receiving higher welfare payments than Job Seeker Support are not considered in detail in this paper but similar principals apply. Where current welfare payments are larger than Job Seeker Support, Basic Income payments will be made up to current levels and any income earned treated in the same manner as is suggested in this paper for those who are at present on Job Seeker support. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 4 Fundamental Rights Articles 22 to 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, define relevant fundamental Human Rights. These articles specify the rights to: social security, work, rest and leisure, and an adequate standard of living. The articles are summarised below. Article 22 gives everyone the right to social security in accordance with the resources of the State. Article 23 states that everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment; without discrimination; with equal pay for equal work; the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. Article 24 gives the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay. Article 25 states that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well- being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection. How does New Zealand approach these issues? A raft of measures is in place to meet New Zealand’s obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions. Of particular interest is the benefit system, and how benefits such as Jobseeker Support are applied in New Zealand for those in the precariat. Benefits are targeted at those considered to be most in need to keep the cost of the system, and hence taxation, to a minimum. A high level of targeting is achieved, in part, by high levels of abatement; the reduction of benefits as other income increases. But there are unintended and counterproductive consequences from this high level of targeting. A Basic Income which does not target the benefit with high abatement rates is proposed as an alternative. Universal benefits in New Zealand New Zealand has a long history of universal benefits dating back to 1938. A means tested pension for those over 65 was introduced in 1898, funded from government revenue rather than individual contributions. The age of eligibility for the means tested pension was lowered to 60 in 1938 and in the same year New Zealand became the first country to introduce a non-contributory and non-means tested universal superannuation for those over 65. The universal superannuation was of similar value to the pension but taxed. With a progressive or graduated tax system, those with higher incomes received slightly smaller net incomes from the superannuation than those on lower incomes. The pension was retained for low income people who were unable to work beyond 60 due to their deteriorating physical condition. In 1977, superannuation payments were increased in value, the age of eligibility was lowered to 60, and the means tested pension was abolished. Between 1992 and 2001 the age of eligibility for superannuation was progressively lifted to 65. From 1938, apart from a period between 1985 and 1998 when superannuation was means tested, New Zealand Superannuation has remained non-contributory and non-means tested. A means tested family benefit, payable for each child aged over 2 years, was introduced in 1926. In 1946 the age of eligibility and means testing were abolished making the family benefit a universal payment. The family benefit continued to be paid as a universal benefit until 1985 when a degree of targeting was introduced. In 1991, family benefit was abolished in favour of more targeted benefits. Implementing a low level Basic Income will make New Zealand a world leader again. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 5 What is a Basic Income A Basic Income is sometimes known as a citizen’s income, citizenship income, citizen’s dividend, public equity dividend 13 , or social dividend, but it might also be called a New Zealand dividend, or a New Zealand Income, as it represents an equal distribution of a portion of government income to all citizens. The following definition of Basic Income representing the modern consensus is adapted from two recent publications by leading international experts on Basic Income: Guy Standing, Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, 2017 14 , and Philippe van Parijs, and Yannick Vanderborght, Basic Income: A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy, 2017. 15 A Basic Income is a modest and non-refundable amount of money paid unconditionally to all individuals on a regular basis, usually weekly or fortnightly. It is basic enough to survive on but not large enough to provide full security. Sometimes called a Universal Basic Income because it is paid to all people who are usually resident in a country as citizens or permanent residents, it is paid unconditionally without income conditions or means testing and is a right of citizenship that cannot be taken away except through due process of law. A Basic Income is a non-contributory payment financed through general taxation and not by directly taxing the payment back from the incomes of individuals or households that receive it. An important principal of a Basic Income is that it is paid to all citizens regardless of other income and circumstances. It may, however, be varied according to the age of the recipients. For example, there may be different rates for young children, those in their second decade, for younger adults, for adults, and for superannuants. For those in the younger age groups, a Basic Income may be paid to the principal caregiver rather than the child. New Zealand Superannuation, first introduced in 1938, is an example of a Basic Income in practice, as was the New Zealand child benefit from 1946 to 1991. When a Basic Income is set at the same level throughout the country it tends to promote regional development and counter population accrual in the largest cities. Some Basic Income advocates allow that some countries might vary a Basic Income by region to allow for different living costs in different regions, but others argue that this will further encourage population movement toward the larger cities and exacerbate problems associated with urban drift: rural and regional depopulation, and high population growth rates in the largest cities. While a Basic Income is paid to all citizens or permanent residents, Standing (chapter 1, page 7) and van Parijs & Vanderborght (chapter 1, page 9) allow that governments may feel justified in deducting the Basic Income from prisoners, or charging prisoners for their food and lodgings, as the cost of keeping them in prison exceeds the amount that would be paid to them as a Basic Income. Alternatively, their Basic Income might be paid to dependent family members. A Basic Income has many advantages and only a few are covered in this paper. Trials in Namibia and India indicate that Basic Income payments of as little as four percent of GDP per capita make a measurable difference. Setting the level of a Basic Income Recent authors, such as Standing, and van Parijs and Vanderborght, advocate a Basic Income near the subsistence level, and this would seem to be a reasonable level to use to introduce a Basic Income. A Basic Income removes poverty traps and disincentives to work that occur with targeted welfare systems, but a Basic Income of too high a value may itself become a disincentive to work and too expensive to implement 16 . While some say that a higher level of Basic Income, approaching that of a minimum income, or a living wage, will be sustainable in the longer-term, others have questioned this. For an introductory Basic Income, a level below that of both the minimum wage and the living wage would be appropriate. van Parijs and Vanderborght (chapter 1, page 11) argue that a Basic Income should be “both modest enough for us to dare to assume that it is sustainable and generous enough for it to be plausible that it will make a difference”. They suggest that “picking an amount in the order of one fourth of the current GDP per capita” will meet this objective, sitting on the border of modest and generous, and above the World Bank’s poverty line. They add that arguments may be mounted for higher levels on ethical grounds and lower levels on political expedient grounds. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 6 With the New Zealand GDP per capita now at NZ $54,110.00 (US $39,500.00) per annum, one fourth of this gives a Basic Income of NZ $259.50 (US $189.40) per week or NZ $13,531.00 per annum. Using 2018 gross figures and NZ dollars, this is 39% of the New Zealand Minimum wage of $16.50 per hour ($660.00 per week or$34,414.00 per annum), 29% above the current basic Jobseeker Support for 18 to 24-year olds of $200.49 per week ($10,454.12 p.a.), and 8% above the Jobseeker Support for those aged 25 and over of $240.60 per week ($12,545.57 p.a.). These figures indicate that the New Zealand Jobseeker Support payment levels are of the right order for a politically expedient and modest Basic Income. Long standing New Zealand Basic Income advocates generally support a Basic Income in the $9,000 to $12,000 p.a. range. Keith Rankin suggests a net value of $175 per week ($9,125 p.a.) paid in conjunction with a change to a 33% uniform or flat tax. 17 The $175 is sufficient to offset the $9,080 p.a. extra tax that a person with a gross annual income of $70,000 or greater would pay with the change from the current graduated or progressive tax to a 33% flat tax. Perce Harpham has suggested a net Basic Income of $210.95 per week ($11,000 p.a.) coupled with a 33% flat tax. 18 Gareth Morgan and Susan Guthrie have also promoted a Basic Income of $11,000 p.a. 19 The cost of a Basic Income The net cost to government of a Basic Income scheme is generally much less than many people suspect. It is not a simple matter of multiplying the amount paid by the number of recipients. A Basic Income will replace all benefits of equivalent or less value, and partially replace all benefits of greater value. See figure 1. A Basic Income simplifies the welfare system and substantially reduces administrative costs but will not completely replace all welfare payments. Combined with an appropriate taxation scheme, the money paid out as a Basic Income targets those on lower incomes. How this occurs is discussed in more detail below. When a Basic Income or a benefit is paid to those on lower incomes the money is generally spent rapidly on the necessities of life. Consequently, fifteen percent of the money paid to those on lower incomes is almost immediately returned to the government through Goods and Services Tax (GST). The extra expenditure from the Basic Income generates additional economic activity in the region where it is spent, increasing local employment and local profits. Consequently, a similar amount is returned to government through income and profit taxes and tax on dividends. The remainder continues to circulate returning more money to the government through GST and other taxes each time the money circulates. This is known as the multiplier effect. Increasing the velocity of money and economic stability Because a Basic Income increases the proportion of GDP supplied to and spent by those on lower incomes it also increases the velocity of money, further boosting the annual income of government, and allowing government to spend more annually. The increased velocity occurs because those on lower incomes spend money rapidly in the local economy, much of it on necessities, while those on higher incomes tend to accumulate money or spend it in other countries, slowing the circulation. As government takes a percentage of money as taxes each time the money circulates, the faster the money circulates the greater the annual government income will be. As the money is received by the government it is immediately available to be paid out again. Because a Basic Income is not targeted it increases the velocity of money more than highly targeted benefits such as Jobseeker support. Tax cuts with a progressive tax system can be counterproductive. They either involve shifting the income bands for the different rates, or lowering the tax rates, or both. Whichever way a tax reduction is implemented, those whose incomes fall into the highest tax band gain the full benefit of the tax reductions while those on lower incomes receive only part. This increases higher net incomes Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 7 while lowering the proportion of net income received by those on lower incomes, slowing the velocity of money and thus reducing the annual tax income of government. The reduced government income leads to calls for further reductions in expenditure which further reduces government income. Increases in Basic Income, as an alternative to tax cuts, increases the velocity of money and government tax revenue as it increases the proportion of income received by those on lower incomes. A steady stream of money paid to all members of society by government will boost local economies and the economy as a whole, and over time act to stabilise the economy. When there is an economic downturn, the money paid out by the government as Jobseeker Support or as a Basic Income keeps local economies going and continues to return taxation to the government. If, however, the government responds to a downturn by cutting expenditure it will result in a fall in government revenue and a call to further cut expenditure! Because a Basic Income is not targeted, it is a more effective economic stabiliser than targeted payments such as Jobseeker Support. Investigating Basic Income proposals Investigating Basic Income proposals requires many tedious calculations to determine taxation and net incomes for a range of gross income values. Comparison of different proposals requires simultaneous calculation and comparison of the different proposals over a range of incomes. To simplify this process, a Basic Income Calculator was developed that allows easy variation of input data while simultaneously viewing outputs in table form and graphically. Problems with the existing benefit system Tax and benefit systems transfer value, money, or benefit from those on higher incomes to those on lower incomes. By taxing incomes with either a uniform tax, also known as a flat tax, or with a graduated or progressive tax, those on higher incomes will pay more tax in total dollars than those on lower incomes. This gives governments money to spend on essential services or to supplement the incomes of those on lower incomes to ensure that they receive a basic or minimum level of income. Consider a line from left to right, figure 2, with highly targeted payments at the left and non-targeted payments at the right. The present targeted system lies to the left and a Basic Income at the right. The difference between the two lies in the degree of targeting. While a Basic Income is available to all, we find that Work and Income New Zealand say that the current Jobseeker Support is only available to “those who are not in full-time employment, who are available for and seeking full-time employment, have taken reasonable steps to find, and be willing and able to undertake employment, or would meet the above qualifications but are temporarily unable to because they qualify for an exemption from their work obligations, or not be in full-time employment, are willing to undertake it, but because of having a health condition, injury or a disability, are limited in their capacity to seek, undertake, or be available for full-time employment, or be in employment, but because of a health condition, injury or a disability are losing earnings because they are not actually working or are working at a reduced level and have no income or an income of less than the amount that would fully abate the benefit”. Jobseeker Support may be withheld from anyone deemed to not be seeking work. Those who have a working partner, albeit on a low income, may not receive Job Seeker Support. The reference to abatement is important. Those on Jobseeker Support are entitled to earn $80 per week before their Job Seeker Support payments are abated at the rate of 70 cents for every dollar earned. We would expect that many on Jobseeker Support would seek and find part or full-time work at or near the minimum wage to supplement their incomes. The $80 equates to just 4.85 hours work at the minimum wage of $16.50 per hour. Above this, any additional income is reduced by both the 70 cents abatement and standard minimum tax rate of 10.5%, an effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) of 80.5%. This leaves a person on Jobseeker Support and the minimum income with just 19.5% of their Figure 2 Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 8 earnings or $3.21 extra per hour after taxation and abatement. Their net pay will further reduce when they exceed 16.27 hours work as this takes them into the next tax bracket of 17.5% giving an EMTR of 87.5% and leaving them with just 12.5% or $2.06 net income per hour. 20 These low net pay rates may not cover the extra costs associated with working, such as clothing, transport, and other costs. In reality, the situation is worse as employers must deduct tax at a slightly higher rate. With other payments such as the accommodation allowance also abated from the first dollar earned, those seeking employment may end up with an EMTR exceeding 100%, that is, no extra income or a loss of income for working five hours per week! Speaking to those who have been in this position and former Work and Income staff reveals that many who find part time work suffer a net loss of income – an EMTR greater than 100%. Others report that the deductions calculated depend on the Work and Income officer who attempts to calculate them due to the complexity of the regulations. The system leaves people feeling disempowered and trapped at very low levels of income. In these situations, work avoidance is a rational behaviour. People either realise in advance that working will provide them with limited or no rewards or will reduce their net incomes and wellbeing, or they will learn so from experience, or from the experiences of others. Although part time jobs may be available in some areas, but not full-time work, and many beneficiaries may prefer part time work, the abatement system is ostensibly designed to induce beneficiaries to take up full time rather than part time work. Because of the high abatement, the rewards for full time work on the minimum wage are also small, just $8.88 net per hour or $355.07 net per week. Again, the abatement or loss of other allowances can result in little or no financial reward. The abatement system discourages those who would like to work and as a consequence many beneficiaries may just opt to not work at all. The benefit system discourages rather than encourages work. It becomes punitive with Jobseeker Support withheld from those not seeking work. Threats and coercion are used to try and encourage people to work in situations that may not be in their financial or best interests. High EMTRs are a major disincentive to work. They create a poverty trap where an increase in hours worked or earned income, results in a loss of benefits so that a person is either no better off or worse off. In these circumstances, the major focus of those receiving Jobseeker Support turns from seeking employment to seeking to maintain or maximise their incomes. They look for ways to continue to receive the benefit payment while adding to their incomes by whatever means they can. Some will work for cash and not declare their working incomes. Tax avoidance and evasion increases, and some turn toward illegal activities and earnings to supplement their incomes. Another problem arises because people on Jobseeker Support are asked to predict their hours of work so that their Jobseeker Support payments can be abated in advance. In practice, hours of work for those in precarious employment are unpredictable so adjustments must be made retrospectively and this amounts to a significant additional administrative cost and stress for those on Jobseeker Support. Dr Jess Berentson-Shaw, interviewed on Radio New Zealand, National, on 22 June 2017, stated that $280 m. p.a. is currently spent in assessing and collecting overpaid benefits. There needs to be a positive financial reward for hours worked to provide an incentive to work. In an attempt to “target” payments to those most in need, the abatement rates have been increased to the point of absurdity. The point where the disincentives to work for the recipients of the payments exceed the benefits of work, and to the point where the administrative costs of such a high rate of targeting exceed the presumed but dubious benefits of the high level of targeting. Rather than encouraging and rewarding work, the system appears designed to drive people into a life time of poverty, work avoidance, servitude and debt, tax avoidance and evasion, and other illegal activities. Long stand down periods before a person becomes eligible for Jobseeker Support also lead to hardship and encourage illegal activities and need to be reduced or abolished. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 9 To encourage workplace participation for solo parents, a lower abatement rate has already been applied. Earnings of $100 per week, rather than $80, are allowed before abatement begins and the first abatement rate is 30 cents for each dollar earned giving an initial EMTR of 40.5%. After $200 is earned the abatement rate rises to the standard 70 cents for each dollar earned. Taxation Governments tax back the payments they make from the population in general to achieve a net balance with payments over time. Taxation needs to be both equitable and rational. As with a Basic Income, a fundamental principal of taxation is that governments must apply the same taxation rules to all citizens. Taxation cannot be varied according to personal situations as this would be discriminatory. Neither should tax negate benefit payments by targeting those who receive them. Many countries, including New Zealand, have a progressive income tax system where the rate of taxation increases in graduated or progressive steps as income increases. However, some thirty-seven countries have a uniform or flat tax system that taxes all income at the same rate. A uniform tax is a special case of a progressive tax that occurs when all the steps of a progressive tax are reduced to zero. Changing to a uniform tax without other compensation for those on lower incomes will significantly impact on the net incomes of those with low incomes and is not recommended. However, when combined with a Basic Income a desirable progressive system is achieved. A progressive tax is one way of ensuring that when welfare payments are universal, those on higher incomes receive lower net payments than those on lower incomes. A Basic Income may be applied with a progressive tax in place, as is done with New Zealand superannuation. However, with a modest Basic Income, as proposed, a progressive income system can also be achieved through the combination of a Basic Income and a uniform tax with no or very limited allowable deductions. In New Zealand, welfare benefit payments are almost always gross payments with income tax deducted by government in accordance with the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system before the net payment is made. Consequently, as income increases the progressive tax system reduces the net payment. With a uniform tax, there is no reduction in the net payment with increased earnings as everyone is taxed at the same rate and the net payments to all people are the same. The reason that a Basic Income combined with a uniform tax produces a progressive system is because conversion from a progressive to a uniform tax will increase the income tax paid by all income earners. With the current tax scales with a maximum tax rate of 33% for all income over $70,000 gross p.a., conversion to a 33% uniform tax will result in all those earning $70,000.00 p.a. or more paying an additional $9,080.00 p.a. in tax. Those with no earnings pay no tax and no additional tax. Those with earnings between zero and $70,000.00 p.a. will pay progressively more tax up to the maximum of $9,080.00 p.a. If the Basic Income is set at a net value of $174.14 per week, $9,080.00 p.a., those on no income will receive the full amount of the Basic Income while those earning an income from paid employment will receive a net increase in income that progressively reduces to zero when their employment income exceeds $70,000.00 p.a. Proposals to couple a Basic Income to a progressive tax with a reduced maximum rate of income tax of less than 33%, or implement a Basic Income with a lower value of uniform tax, say 30%, would amount to a tax cut for those on higher incomes. Tax revenue will fall and the cost of implementing a Basic Income will rise as those on higher incomes will receive an increased benefit from the Basic Income. Extra increases in other taxes will then be required to pay for the extra cost of the Basic Income. Consequently, a cut in the maximum tax rate or reduction in the uniform tax rate is not recommended when introducing a Basic Income. The Basic Income gives increased income where it is needed. A modest Basic Income for New Zealand Governments must set taxes to balance payments over time. The larger the value of a Basic Income the larger taxes must be to pay for any extra cost resulting from the Basic Income. For this reason, it is desirable that a Basic Income be set at a modest level. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 10 Examination of net to gross income curves, figures 3 to 6, show that when low effective marginal tax rates are desired, the combination of a Basic Income with a uniform tax will work to alleviate poverty in the low-income groups while delivering smaller increases in income to those on high incomes than a Basic Income coupled with a progressive tax. Combining a Basic Income with a uniform tax will thus minimise the cost of the Basic Income scheme while achieving the principal objectives of better income distribution and the relief of poverty for those on low incomes. The graphs, figures 3 to 6, plot income after tax or net annual income (vertical axis), against income before tax or gross annual income (horizontal axis). In the graphs, the diagonal line “A” from zero net income shows net income with no taxation, that is, when net income and gross income are equal. Figure 3. Gross and Net Income with no income support and progressive tax. The lower curved line “B” shows net income or income after tax is deducted using the present progressive tax. Line B becomes a straight line above the threshold for the maximum tax rate. In Figure 3, line “B” shows net income with no income support. In Figures 4, and 5, line “B” shows net income with an added Jobseeker Support at the youth rate for 18 to 24-year olds of $200.49 gross or $179.44 net per week. In Figure 6, line “B” shows net income with the over 25 adult level Jobseeker Support of $240.60 gross or $215.34 net per week. 21 In figures 4 to 6, line “B” includes the added Jobseeker Support with an $80.00 per week earnings threshold, and a 70 cent per earned dollar abatement 22 . It shows how the Jobseeker support lifts the net incomes of those with no or small earned incomes, and that over the range where the Jobseeker Support is abated the gain in net income with additional hours worked is very small, providing very little or no incentive to work.

With the Basic Income, net incomes increase for those earning over the current income threshold of $80.00 per week or $4,171.50 p.a. but do not increase significantly for those in the highest tax bracket earning over $1,342.47 per week or $70,000 p.a. The objectives of adequate reward for hours worked and enhanced incomes for those with lower earnings are achieved without significantly increasing the income of those with higher incomes. This minimises the cost of implementing a Basic Income. The most significant increases in incomes occur with earned incomes in addition to Jobseeker Support between $144.00 per week or $7,500.00 p.a., and $863.00 per week or $45,000.00 p.a. This will substantially alleviate poverty in this critical range. Figure 5. Gross and Net Income with Jobseeker Support for under 25 and with a BI with progressive tax. In Figure 5, the curved line “D” shows net income with a Basic Income of the same net value as the Jobseeker Support and with the present progressive tax system. While the net incomes of those on lower incomes increase and adequate rewards for work are achieved, those on higher incomes also receive a significant proportion of the Basic Income. This provides additional income to those who least need it or do not need it and significantly increases the cost of providing a Basic Income. Figure 6. Gross and Net Income with Jobseeker Support, and with a BI for 25 and over with a 33% uniform tax. Figure 6 shows the higher level of Jobseeker Support paid to those over 25 of $237.37 gross or $212.45 net per annum, and line “C” shows a Basic Income of the same net value with a 33% uniform tax. Those on higher incomes continue to receive a small net portion of the Basic Income, encouraging them to accept the Basic Income but delivering some increased income to higher income earners.

From the graphs, we can conclude that a Basic Income with a uniform tax, as shown in Figures 4 and 6, will best meet the objectives of providing a reward for and incentive to work while improving the incomes of those with low incomes or in the area of precarious employment without significantly increasing the incomes of those on higher incomes who do not need additional income. Basic Income with a uniform tax is the most equitable, or fair, and least expensive option for the introduction of a Basic Income system. While the proposed Basic Income would replace Jobseeker Support, in order to prevent hardship other supplementary payments that those on Jobseeker Support receive at present must be retained, as must expenditure on other government services such as hospitals and education, as any reduction is likely to undermine or reduce the benefits to be gained from the introduction of a Basic Income. Existing regulations, such as minimum wages and laws and regulations designed to protect those in employment, must be retained to prevent exploitation. Proposed tax systems that vary taxation rates according to the composition of households or to ensure that individual or household incomes do not change when a Basic Income is introduced are discriminatory and not consistent with the fundamental principal that taxation should be applied equally to all people. Such proposals are likely to partially or completely negate the purpose of introducing a Basic Income. Reducing Effective Marginal Tax Rates with the present system To overcome existing problems with high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs) for those on Jobseeker Support (JSS), the rate of abatement must be reduced to give a degree of equity with those on higher incomes. Reducing the abatement rate to 22.5% will result in an initial EMTR of 33% with the initial tax rate of 10.5% added. This is the same value as the maximum rate of taxation or EMTR for those earning income of $70,000 p.a. or greater. Equity, or fairness, would suggest that the EMTR for those on Jobseeker Support should ideally be lower or no higher than the maximum marginal tax rate for those earning income without support payments – the present maximum tax rate of 33%. However, Jobseeker Support does not fully abate before the second tax bracket occurs, so the EMTR will rise to 40%, 22.5 % plus 17.5% tax. To ensure that the EMTR does not exceed 33% for those in the second tax bracket, the rate of abatement needs to reduce to 15.5% for those in the second bracket. But a two-stage abatement further complicates the administrative of the scheme and adds to the cost. Lowering abatement rates to give an EMTR of 33% will largely remove disincentives to work. Those working at the minimum wage of $16.50 will receive a net income of 67% of their earnings or $11.05 for each additional hour they work. This is a positive financial incentive to work and is significantly greater than the $3.22 or $2.06, depending on their tax bracket, that they receive at present. Lowering abatement rates eliminates the poverty traps caused by high abatement rates but does nothing to reduce the costs and difficulties of administrating the welfare system. Reducing administration costs and difficulties can be achieved by conversion to a Basic Income. Conversion to a Basic Income Comparing the present youth or under 25 Jobseeker Support paid with the reduced abatement rate of 22.5% and the present progressive tax system, giving an initial EMTR of 33%, with the alternative of a Basic Income of the same net amount, $179.44, coupled with a uniform tax of 33%, shows that the difference in net income between the two alternatives is less than 3% over a large range of incomes. The difference occurs because of the increased tax rate for annual incomes over $14,000. With a two- stage abatement to limit the maximum EMTR to 33% the difference falls to less than 1.25%. The Jobseeker Support with the reduced abatement rates and a progressive tax system thus closely emulates a Basic Income with a 33% uniform tax. Comparing a Jobseeker Support paid with the reduced abatement rate with a Basic Income paid with the present progressive tax system does not give this close correlation. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 13 Paying a Basic Income with a 33% uniform tax on all income is administratively very much simpler and less costly than a Jobseeker Support payment abated at 22.5% with a progressive tax. A Basic Income is also more difficult to defraud. Once in place, the cost to maintain a Basic Income system is very low. Consequently, replacing the Jobseeker Support with a Basic Income of the same net value plus a uniform tax of 33% is the obvious thing to do. This would require the introduction of a single new uniform tax rate of 33% to sit alongside the existing progressive tax system and tax rates. A single extra uniform tax rate is easy to implement. An optional Basic Income A change to an optional Basic Income is possible, an opt-in system, with those seeking Jobseeker Support given the choice of the present Jobseeker Support with all its problems or the alternative of accepting a Basic Income of the same value with a uniform tax of 33% on all income. This option could be made available to all people who are on Jobseeker Support at present, or just sufficient numbers to allow a trial of a Basic Income system to see how a Basic Income improves outcomes. The trial could easily be made as large as thought necessary and need not be restricted geographically. A trial of this nature is however probably unnecessary and a fully available Basic Income could be implemented immediately. After all, New Zealand has been trialling the New Zealand superannuation scheme since 1938 and knows that it works. Some international experts are now voicing the opinion that there have been enough Basic Income trials already to demonstrate the value of a Basic Income and further trials are unnecessary. The introduction of a non-abating modest Basic Income payment with a uniform tax rate may be sufficient to significantly change behaviour leading to increased work participation, the elimination of tax avoidance and evasion, an improvement in health outcomes, a reduction in illegal activities, and the many other benefits that result from universal rather than targeted payments. The suggestion that a Basic Income might be implemented on an optional basis in conjunction with a uniform tax was proposed by Susan St John in 2015 in her paper, Improving the affordability of New Zealand Superannuation. 23 The proposal was to tax anyone receiving New Zealand Superannuation with a flat tax while allowing a voluntary sign up. This proposal will reduce but not eliminate the payments to those on higher incomes and hence reduce the overall cost of New Zealand Superannuation while maintaining payment levels for those on lower incomes. Making Basic Income universal Once established, a Basic Income could be made universally available. At present, New Zealand Superannuation is optional. You do not have sign up for it, but most do. Receiving New Zealand Superannuation requires a person to actively apply for it, and while most do so as soon as they become eligible there are some who do not or delay their application until after they retire. Similarly, most benefits may be considered voluntary. You do not have to apply for them and there are those who do not. The Basic Income could be the same, voluntary. However, the granting of a Basic Income would require those who receive it to also accept a 33% uniform tax on all income. With the 18 to 24-year-old gross Basic Income of $200.49 per week ($10,454.13 per annum) and a uniform tax of 33%, a person with no earned income would receive the full net weekly amount of $179.44 per week, as they do with Jobseeker Support. A person on the minimum gross wage of $660 per week ($34,424.28 p.a.) would receive an additional net income of $58.31 per week ($3,040.70 p.a.) after taxation, and those earning $1,342.47 per week ($70,000.00 pa) or greater would receive an additional net income of just $5.30 per week, or $276.51 p.a. Regardless of income, a Basic Income provides a degree of security, a small income that will always be there should circumstances suddenly change, such as loss of employment. While everyone is better off with a Basic Income, it is seen that those on lower incomes will be the main beneficiaries. The proposed scheme targets the benefits to those on lower incomes. As everyone benefits, particularly those on low to mid incomes, there is an incentive for people to sign up for the scheme. In time it could be made compulsory if most people accept it. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 14 There are, however, arguments for retaining the present progressive tax system for those who may not be eligible for the Basic Income, such as non-citizens. Without a Basic Income, changing to a uniform tax can result in significant increases in taxation and loss of net income as a percentage for those on low incomes while having little impact as a percentage for those on higher incomes. Introducing a Basic Income with the present progressive tax system will make those on higher incomes substantial beneficiaries and the net cost of implementing the scheme will be substantially higher than it will be with a uniform tax. To counter this, income tax levels must rise significantly with resulting increases in EMTR, or alternatively other taxes must rise significantly or new taxes introduced causing other distortions to the economy. A Basic Income with a uniform tax is the simplest system to implement and the fairest or most equitable and affordable option. As previously noted, a Basic Income may vary with age. At present those over 25 receive a larger Jobseeker Support of $240.60 gross ($215.34 net) per week or $12,545.57 gross ($11,228.44 net) per annum. There are two ways to tackle this. The first option is to make the lower gross payment of $200.49 for those age 18 to 24 the Universal Basic Income and provide a top up for those over 25, but this is administratively more complex. The second and simpler option is to make the higher sum of $240.60 gross the Basic Income payment for those aged over 25. For a gross Basic Income of $240.60 per week, $12,545.57 p.a., those receiving no other income would receive the full benefit, as they do with Jobseeker Support. Those on the gross minimum wage of $660.00 per week ($34,424.28 p.a.) would receive an additional net payment of $94.21 per week ($4,912.63 p.a.) and those receiving $1,342.47 per week ($70.000.00 p.a.) gross or greater would receive an additional net payment of $41.20 per week ($2,148.44 p.a.). Again, the increases in income are greatest for those on lower incomes but everyone will receive something. If the level of a Basic Income is greater than the current modest over 25 Jobseeker Support level, costs begin to rise significantly as recipients on higher incomes receive the benefit of each additional dollar paid out. It is therefore important to limit the value of a Basic Income to modest levels. Proposals to implement higher levels of Basic Income require significantly greater increases in taxation to pay for them creating problems with high Effective Marginal Tax Rates or the reintroduction of high abatement rates that may negate many of the benefits of the Basic Income. Overall a modest Basic Income is politically expedient as it will meet less political opposition than a higher value Basic Income. Another possibility to minimise the cost of a Basic Income is to increase the rate of the uniform tax as the level of the Basic Income payment increases. Thus, a person aged 24 or less receiving the youth Basic Income is taxed at a uniform 33%, but a person aged 25 or over and receiving the higher adult Basic income might be taxed at 35%. As the rate of payment increases further, the rate of the uniform tax might be increased to minimise the net gain in income for those on higher incomes. Consequently, a persons individual uniform tax rate is tied to the level of the Basic Income they receive. As there will only be a limited number of different Basic Income payment rates there will be a limited number of uniform tax rates. Susan St John proposed that for higher levels of Basic Income, such as those for New Zealand Superannuation, a two-tiered progressive tax with a lower rate of 17.5% tax for those earning under $15,000 and a higher rate of 39% for those earning greater than $15,000. This reduces the impact of a change to a uniform tax for those on superannuation earning low to middle incomes while limiting the increase in income for those on higher incomes 24 . A similar two-tiered tax system might be considered for those on an adult Basic Income. A disadvantage of a two-tier system is that the lower the rate of the first tier the higher the required rate of the second tier and hence the higher the effective marginal tax rate. A Basic Income, once implemented, must be indexed in line with inflation to maintain its value and may be progressively increased in real value over time if this is considered desirable. Increasing the real level of Jobseeker Support and similar benefits before a Basic Income is implemented may, however, make it more difficult to implement a Basic Income at a later date. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 15 Increased payment levels for a Basic Income after introduction may require the retention or reintroduction of abatements and again result in undesirably high EMTRs. Overall, reduced abatement rates and EMTRs are more important than providing higher levels of Jobseeker Support or a Basic Income. Changing to a Basic Income with a uniform tax is equivalent to giving a tax cut with the greatest increase in income received by those on the lowest incomes. This differs from tax cuts under the progressive tax system where the greatest gains in total dollars are always received by those on the highest incomes. Costs and Funding The above calculations and graphs show that the most cost-effective way to improve the present Jobseeker Support system is to change to a Basic Income system with payments of the same net values paid in conjunction with a uniform tax. This gives the greatest income increases to those with the lowest incomes. Trials of Basic Income in various countries indicate that unemployment falls because poverty traps are removed, and because the local economy is stimulated creating more employment. Tax evasion and avoidance and crime rates in general, reduce. Consequently, government tax income rises providing additional funding to use to fund the Basic Income. There will be some increases in government expenditure. There are some on low incomes at present who do not receive Jobseeker Support, but who will be eligible for Basic Income. There will also be some who receive increases in net income. Government must meet the increased expenditure levels, but increased tax revenues will partially or fully offset the increased expenditure. As previously mentioned, most increases in income are only marginal increases as the Basic Income will replace existing payments of equal or less value and partially replace larger payments. With a uniform tax, net income increases, the Basic Income less the increase in tax, for those on higher incomes will be relatively small. Existing taxes such as GST, income, and profit tax, without increases in tax rates, will quickly return a portion of the money to the government so that the money may be paid out again immediately. As the incomes of those with lower incomes increases more than those on higher incomes the velocity of money increases, increasing the number of money circulation cycles per annum, and thus increasing the annual tax revenue of government, allowing a corresponding increase in annual payments. A Basic income is largely self-funding over time, but to cover any shortfall some have promoted increases in income tax, GST, the implementation of a land tax, a more comprehensive wealth tax, or other new taxes as a means of raising any extra money required. The merits of particular tax proposals are beyond the scope of this paper but spreading any tax increases over various options would reduce possible distortions to the economy. In the same way that a Basic Income might be introduced to replace Job Seeker support, Basic Income payments might be introduced to replace other welfare payments using the same net values as the payments they replace and using a Uniform tax to limit the payments received by those on higher incomes. Conclusion The present benefit system for the unemployed, part time workers, and others with low incomes emphasises cost containment above equity, consistency, simplicity, positive incentives, financial rewards for work, and the wellbeing and empowerment of those seeking work. High levels of targeting with high abatement rates with the current Jobseeker Support system produces high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs), significant disincentives to work, and a poverty trap. Lowering the abatement rates to give an Effective Marginal Tax Rate similar to the current maximum tax rate would remove the poverty trap, increase low incomes, alleviate poverty, encourage work participation, and ensure wellbeing, but remains administratively complex and expensive. Basic Income: a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment 6 th International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers 31 January 2018 – 2018 version - V180422 16 Replacing Jobseeker Support payments with Basic Income payments of the same net value paid in conjunction with a suitable uniform tax maintains the level of the payments and achieves the same results as lowering abatement rates, but also removes significant administration costs. This change would create an efficient and low-cost system targeted to those most in need. The Basic Income levels proposed are modest and in line with international recommendations. Based on current rates for Jobseeker Support and similar payments it is both politically expedient and acceptable, and capable of being implemented without major impacts on current financial structures while bringing many benefits of a Basic Income such as general wellbeing, improvements to health, boosting local economies, while reducing tax evasion and avoidance and crime. The proposed optional or opt-in system is easy to understand, simple to implement, and fair and just. For those who choose to receive a Basic Income a uniform tax on all income would be mandatory. For others who do not choose a Basic Income, the current income supports would remain along with the progressive tax system. Being optional enhances political acceptability of the proposal. With the many advantages of a Basic Income a high uptake rate is expected and might be encouraged. The proposal makes it possible to easily conduct trials of any size, if a trial is considered necessary.  References 1 Work after Globalisation: Building Occupational Citizenship Standing, 2009, Chapter 4. 2 Precarity: Uncertain Insecure and Unequal Lives in Aotearoa New Zealand edited by Shiloh Groot, Clifford Van Ommen, Bridgette Masters-Awatere and Natasha Tassell-Matamua, 2017. 3 Basic Income : And how to make it happen Guy Standing, Pelican 2017, page 160. 4 Basic Income : And how to make it happen Standing Guy Pelican 2017, page 182-83. 5 A Precariat Charter: From Denizens to Citizens, Guy Standing 2014.

What does the future of tax look like to you? a. The Changing Nature of Work and the ‘gig’ economy. A Basic Income provides an answer to this. See the attached paper titled: Basic Income - a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment. This paper presented at the sixth International Conference on Precarious Work and Vulnerable Workers at Auckland University of Technology on 30th January 2018 this year shows how a Basic Income and appropriate changes to the tax system provide some answers to the problem. b. Environmental Challenges. Tax may be used in an appropriate manner to mitigate environmental challenges. Any such taxes need to be applied with care to avoid undesirable impacts on the economy and on the wellbeing of New Zealand citizens. c. Technology. A Basic Income and appropriate tax system provides some answers to increasing technology and the automation of work previously performed by people, and to a consequent loss of income tax revenue from those formerly employed. However, automation tends to promote a shift in employment to new industries with no loss of tax revenues. Attention needs to be given to ensure that new technologies do not lead to significant reductions in tax revenue and avoidance and evasion by companies using the new technologies. d. Improving productivity. Improved productivity is desirable and should be encouraged as it leads to higher living standards and the tax system should encourage this. e. Globalisation. Increase globalisation and international companies operating and trading in New Zealand while avoiding paying tax in New Zealand is of concern. Appropriate measures must be taken to compensate for the loss of tax income. 2. What is the purpose of tax a. The purpose of tax is to allow governments to ensure the wellbeing of citizens of the country by financing essential and fundamental services such as health, education, defence, and so on, while ensuring an equitable distribution of wealth and support for those in need. 3. Are we taxing the right things a. Long term property investment. Consider taxing at moderate rates the capital gains made on investment property sales that exceed the normal rate of inflation. b. Sale of a business. Consider taxing business sales at moderate rates on any capital gains that exceed the rate of inflation. c. Charities: Businesses owned by charities should always be taxed. Allowing charities to compete tax free with other businesses give charities an unfair advantage, sometimes putting their competition out of business. In some cases, charity owned businesses provide little in profits to the owning charity for redistribution in the public good or the charity itself provides no public good or restricts the distribution of funds to a select few. Others provide little in the way of benefit to the general public while giving significant \[1\] 2 benefits to a restricted number of individuals such as the company managers and senior employees that may be well above industry norms. Religious charities are of particular concern as they receive automatic charity status. They may tithe the church members so that there is a net flow of money from the church members to the church. The church uses the money to buy businesses and income from the businesses may be used to pay managers at high or above market rates or profits that are returned to the church may be used to buy more business with little or nothing returned as welfare (charity) to the church members or to the public generally. The church becomes increasingly wealthy while it continues to ask its members for funds. d. Owning stuff. In general, there is no need to tax stuff. However, consideration could be given to large scale property ownership. A tax on excessive holdings of land or shares might be considered or an equal but low tax applied to all land on a tax per land value basis. e. Businesses with no New Zealand base. These should definitely be taxed. In some cases, companies have been known to employ staff to sell products in New Zealand using eftpos terminals with the payments going straight to foreign bank accounts with the employees working in New Zealand also paid directly into foreign bank accounts avoiding both GST and income tax payments. GST also needs to be applied to significant purchases from overseas. f. GST should be applied to all sales as it is now. Giving exemptions for some items, such as fruit and vegetables, while superficially attractive, will increase compliance costs and require increases in other taxes to compensate. To meet the extra compliance costs, the net result may be the lowering of net disposable incomes for those on lower incomes resulting in a reduction in well-being. g. Transaction tax. Consideration could be given to a low value transaction tax as an alternative means of raising tax revenue. While raising revenue this might also act to discourage large scale and speculative movements of funds that can destabilise economies. 4. Can tax make housing more affordable. a. Short answer no. The underlying problem is a lack of supply – a housing shortage. b. A capital gains tax will have no impact and will do nothing to increase the supply of houses or encourage the building of new houses, and may encourage some people to hold on to their empty houses for longer to get even greater capital gains. A capital gains tax may even discourage investment in housing increasing the lack of supply and price increases. c. A regular taxes on empty houses purchased purely as investment properties to stand empty while making capital gains may however have a marginal impact encouraging people to either occupy the house, rent it out, or sell it, and thus increase the percentage of occupied houses. Family homes and perhaps holiday homes should be exempt. d. The affordability of houses might be controlled to some extent by controlling the availability of credit. Low interest rates and easy credit allow people to bid up house prices to the point where they become unaffordable. But when credit is limited they still need a home so they compete for rental properties and rents will rise. The answer is to improve the supply either by building more homes or limiting population increases in areas where housing is short – either by limiting urban drift or population movements into the larger centres or immigrants arriving from other countries. 5. What tax issues matter most to you? a. Effective Marginal Tax Rates. There is a major problem with high Effective Marginal Tax Rates EMTRs for those on low and very low incomes. Those in the unreliable incomes, in the ‘gig’ economy, and earning low incomes are often on Jobseeker Support, and face high abatements of their support payments that can give EMTRs exceeding 100% for every dollar they earn. High EMTRs create poverty traps. This is because they face abatement of their support payments at 70%, tax at 10.5% or 14.5% and abatement of their housing allowance and other payments all of which can add to over 100%. This encourages a cash economy, and tax avoidance and evasion. The attached paper, Basic Income – a means to combat the marginalisation of vulnerable workers in precarious employment, discusses this problem and how a Basic Income with an appropriate tax system might be used to overcome this problem. b. Health. There is an argument for increased taxes on products that are harmful to health, such as alcohol, cigarettes, and sugar in processed foods, soft drinks, and so on but not in natural products such as fruit. c. Environment. Taxes might be applied to limit CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions but a great deal of care should be taken regarding taxes on agriculture and in other areas that might have negative impacts on the economy. 3 d. Capital gains tax. Any capital gains taxes should be limited to those areas where there are likely to be proven positive outcomes rather than just seen as a way of increasing the tax revenue. As mentioned above, it is better to tax empty houses to encourage occupancy than it is to apply a capital gains tax that will not encourage occupancy or increase the supply of housing. If applied, capital gains tax should only be on increases in real value allowing for inflation, and not on absolute increases in value. I B Middleton \[1\]

YVETTE MORTIMER YVONNE CURTIS ZAC ALI ZACH BALDWIN ZACH EVANS FELICITY DURAND W000021 14 Mar 2018, 11:37 AM We should be closing loopholes for the wealthy. It is not fair for everyday New Zealanders to be required to pay significant amounts of tax each pay check while wealthy investors and companies don't pay their fair share despite having the finances to accommodate it. We need to get smarter about how we tax. ANONYMOUS W000028 14 Mar 2018, 12:38 PM Need to tax higher incomes at higher rate. Need wealth/asset tax. I would be hit by both but it is the correct thing to do. Pollution tax/environmental tax. Also need tourism levy. DANIEL CHORLEY W000037 14 Mar 2018, 1:54 PM Secondary income for lower income earners should not be taxed at a higher rate, nor should we be taxing products/services that we wish to incentivise the purchase of, e.g. healthier food, education, etc. We should be taxing overseas companies if they are making profit in NZ as well as on any resources taken from NZ, e.g. water. All investment income should be taxed, otherwise this is just a mechanism by which NZ become more polarised; those with more equity can gain even more preventing many poorer people from developing any equity for later in life – i.e. through property ownership. A persons primary property/home should be exempt. SAM WALLACE W000058 14 Mar 2018, 4:52 PM Learn form overseas examples. If you introduce a wealth tax, the wealthy have the resources available to remove their wealth from the tax system altogether. Meaning that less revenue will be held in New Zealand and less tax available. It will also incur New Zealand's top skilled specialists who earn the most to leave effecting a new "brain drain". Regards, Sam ADAM UJDUR W000071 14 Mar 2018, 5:45 PM More tax is required on luxuries and capital. Too many people make huge profits off capital that is unproductive. If you dont contribute enough via the work you do then you should pay more via tax (for example, property or Forex) EUGENE PARKER W000089 14 Mar 2018, 6:51 PM Regressive taxes like GST should be reduced if not abolished: they tax the poorer members of society (i.e. the ones who can least afford it) disproportionately high, which is the opposite of how a progressive tax system run for society's benefit ought to work. Adding higher tax brackets to the income tax scheme is something to consider, for the same reason: it places more of the onus of taxation on those who can afford to part with the money. Our personal income tax rates are low by comparison to the rest of the OECD, so the wealthy can certainly afford the loss! A. RILEY W000093 14 Mar 2018, 6:58 PM -Capital gains tax on the sale of property in New Zealand STEPHEN STIRLING W000102 14 Mar 2018, 7:22 PM Tax property, tax property, tax property, like most other countries do, #toptaxrules ANTHONY MEEHAN W000119 14 Mar 2018, 9:57 PM New Zealand has limited space and natural resources. Taxing road congestion can promote use of public transport and cycling, while taxing water can prevent exploitation by bottled-water companies. Taxing land value can encourage people to invest in business instead of speculating on existing property. CRAIG DALTON W000130 14 Mar 2018, 10:42 PM We are largely taxing the right 'things' however we should absolutely be taxing churches, that is an absolute joke that we don't in 2018. We should also be taxing overseas companies. SIMON VELVIN W000142 15 Mar 2018, 1:39 AM Tax inheritances, tax business conducted in New Zealand, regardless of where that business is located. There needs to be a way to tax the massive donation that Apple Ireland provides to Apple NZ that prevents the latter from contributing to the wellbeing of our society. We don't tax land. Please tax land. That's where the wealth is. Tax all land, based on its value, maybe allow for some variation so the farmers don't wholesale revolt (or maybe have their taxes pay for waterway remediation, they're not really doing it well enough right now. Sure, they are maybe doing it hard, but that's not an excuse to cause widespread environmental damage. They should not be allowed to privatise the profits while being able to socialise the costs without some form of targeted tax (and a break for waterway plantings?)). ROBYN CAREY W000150 15 Mar 2018, 7:19 AM I think that largely the government is taxing the right things, although outlawing the ability to claim depreciation on residential investment properties unfairly singled out a particular type of business against others. I think a capital gains tax in acceptable. We live in a provincial South Island town and have very little capital gains anyway, particularly when the capital value of improvements is considered. Any such tax would need to be matched by a commensurate decrease in tax on earnings. It is unlikely that a capital gains tax would substantially increase the tax take and overseas experience shows that such a tax does not reduce house price inflation. A wealth tax, based on the annual value of investments, is most unfair and is a disincentive to saving - whether in the form of mortgage repayment or other assets such as business holdings. Where are people supposed to find the cash to pay the tax? I absolutely do not support this tax proposal. M B W000165 15 Mar 2018, 11:48 AM I spend equal time between 2 properties. Which classifies as my family home? My view is both should as time is, on average, equally spent in both on a weekly basis. KAREN COURTIS W000172 15 Mar 2018, 1:29 PM Mostly OK as is. CGT is too hard to administer and has achieved little overseas. Company tax should be kept low to attract business. All the talk of wealth tax, land tax etc just stops people from trying to get ahead. KAREN COURTIS W000176 15 Mar 2018, 1:35 PM CGT - why exclude the family home? The traditional way kiwis get ahead is to buy a small, run down house, do it up, sell and move on to something better, then repeat. It's how most of us started off. How is that different than an investor? Make some money, trade up. Also, CGT would need to encompass the Bach, shares, art, wine investment, jewellery and so on. In fact, anything people buy as an investment, even if they enjoy it in the meantime. What about losses? Do they get a tax refund for those - only fair really! EVE PRICE W000191 15 Mar 2018, 3:06 PM The business ventures of charities should be taxed, at a lower rate so they can mainly re-invest what they earn in the charitable work they do. the property market needs better taxing in place, to ensure it doesn't contribute to the housing crisis. Foreign owned profits should be taxed too. CLAIRE CHAMBERS W000197 15 Mar 2018, 4:08 PM Clearly some things are not taxed that ought to be. However, I would be extremely cautious about taxing rental properties more highly. This will penalise ethical landlords who will barely make any return on their investments, and all tenants, as the costs will be passed on. However, unethical landlords will do even less maintenance and tenants will have to put up with this in the rental crisis environment which will result. I have two rental properties and maintain these to a high standard. I charge rentals that are slightly lower than I could, in order to keep great tenants and develop trust between us in the long term. However, the gross return on these investments is barely 1.5 - 2.0% per year. Taxing the land would make these investments completely untenable. This policy would result in fewer rental properties, all in less good condition, and a rapid rise in rents. This is clearly not a good idea during a nation wide housing crisis. This tax would need very careful thought. ANONYMOUS W000204 15 Mar 2018, 4:40 PM So many so called charities are not charities as most would think of them, they are fully fledged businesses, run strictly for profit! Tax them all. Why should any religious organisation escape tax when atheists, free thinkers, evolutionists, cannot! Overseas companies should be taxed on profits made in NZ, repatriation of proffits to their so called HQ's should be stopped. If you make it in NZ you should pay tax on it Period. ANONYMOUS W000215 15 Mar 2018, 8:01 PM Tax system could do more to effectively transfer wealth to lower income NZers. To this effect, the tax system does not effectively tax wealth, hidden income or assets. Wealth and asset taxes should be introduced for many reasons, including reducing inequality, adjusting tax take for an aging population and ensuring that all forms of wealth generation (gains, income, etc) are appropriately taxed. There appears no fundamental reason (other than political support) to not tax an owner occupied dwelling/allotment. The Govt should consider targeted taxes to incentivise or discourage behaviour (environmental, productive investment, health and wellbeing) to benefit future generations, not strictly our aged population. Agriculture (dairy) should not be exempt from taxes, New Zealand needs to diversify its productivity base, taxing dairy would incentivise this and would allow NZ to better respond to climate, economic and cultural changes. CHRIS SHAW W000225 16 Mar 2018, 12:11 AM Tax social ills like alcohol and gambling higher. Reduce or eliminate tax on essentials like fruit and vege HAMISH SCOWN W000242 16 Mar 2018, 3:48 PM Tax religious organisations, remove or lower tax on essential consumer items, remove tax on feminine products, stop taxing cigarettes, remove tax on organic products ILSE BOTES W000265 17 Mar 2018, 8:44 AM All profits accrued in New Zealand must be taxed if they leave the country. If money is made here, it must be taxed here to ensure foreign companies no longer have an advantage over local companies. This will incentivise local business as they can then compete with international firms who have no base here - a misnomer as their trading here implies a base to extract profit from New Zealanders. Churches are money making entities and their income must be taxed, we no longer live under the oppression of The Church and the exemption has become a relic of a previous era. The government has taken over the role of looking after the poor and needy from the churches and they should no longer be allowed to operate their businesses free from a tax obligation. LORRAINE PELLS W000278 17 Mar 2018, 11:12 AM In 34 years of owning a business, I have been taxed to death - GST, PAYE, Kiwi Saver for employees, ACC (both compulsory government directed take), company tax, personal tax, rates, water rates, dividends tax, interest tax - if it breathes the government taxes it. I have employed thousands of people over 48 years at work, and paid a mountain of taxes - I am deeply concerned that a capital gains tax and a wealth tax is even being considered. Capital gains is the only thing that allowed me to provide for my own retirement, and that will be so for the vast bulk of small and medium business that are the biggest employers overall of labour in NZ. When you work 80 hours a week, year in and year out, there has to be an incentive to do this. If the government keeps taking more then that erodes. This government needs to live within its means like ordinary people do - and be more circumspect in its spending. DAVID LEBERKNIGHT W000300 17 Mar 2018, 8:26 PM It is obviously wrong that New Zealand does not tax wealth, putting the burden to pay for government onto wage earners and consumers instead. There is plenty money in NZ to pay for government, but the biggest concentrations of money are not being taxed at all. Consider housing wealth. There is a strong evidence-based argument that our housing crisis has been driven by tax incentives to invest in housing primarily - because the gains are not taxed, and the subsequent wealth isn't taxed either. It's not an accident that we have the world's least affordable housing (relative to average income) - the housing crisis is a direct result of tax policy. Fix this by taxing wealth - and yes that means housing wealth - exclude the family home only if you must. NEIL CASWELL W000306 17 Mar 2018, 9:30 PM No gst on food is my primary concern - low income earners are the most harmed group by gst on food - increasing the minimum wage will only result in businesses passing on price increases which perpetuates the issue. Increasing min of age also puts at risk many small businesses. Better to have people use the savings from removing gst from food on other discretionary spending. There is also the issue of tax on tax, or gst on taxed items, fuel being the one that most springs to mind. Further ensuring overseas based corporations pay tax on local earnings, especially the large corps like Apple etc - close the loopholes. MEREDITH PARKIN W000320 18 Mar 2018, 2:17 PM tourists should pay a little more tax to enter the country, which should then be spent on environmental protection. Rubbish should be taxed more which should pay for recycling - both in terms of collection, as well as processing (we need to be doing this in Nz) People should not be able to offset their carbon footprint by buying credits! We should be taxing them more. International Businesses who do not have a base here should be taxed as they rely on our economy, so should contribute socially. NEVILLE EVANS W000332 18 Mar 2018, 6:07 PM All the current taxes are just, but could be tweaked to some degree, depending on ones unique perspective. Capital gains on the other hand are not taxed in New Zealand and allow many people to make gains that are not taxed. Given a lot of wealthy people make a living out of investing in assets that gain in value, one should consider taxing capital gains. However any capital gains tax should make allowance for inflation, or one risks far more resistance to the tax. On the other hand a tax on wealth would be a tax on money already taxed and would undoubtedly result in tax payer resistance. In late 2017, the Financial Times wrote an article on taxes changes in France under Macron, under the headline "Macron slashes France’s wealth tax in pro-business budget" One quote in the article goes "Since 2000, France has experienced a net outflow of 60,000 millionaires, according to research group New World Wealth". One would have to expect the same to happen in New Zealand. DYLAN FLETCHER W000340 18 Mar 2018, 9:51 PM Income tax needs to be reduced to encourage people into the workforce and allow those who are reliant on wages alone to live comfortably. This would have to be offset by greater tax on assets such as houses. People will not invest in businesses when housing remains attractive. Houses are to be lived in, not invested in. BEVIN BRETT W000346 19 Mar 2018, 8:33 AM Taxes skew economics, causing behavior to change. We should not be taxing wages, because it handicaps domestic labor compared to foreign labor. We should not be taxing spending, because it changes spending behavior. We should be taxing the use of both non-renewable and renewable resources. Water consumption, land occupancy, air pollution (including with greenhouse gases), mineral consumption, land pollution (including with land fills), water pollution (including with farm runoff) - these are where people are benefitting at the expense of others, and the others should be compensated for their loss. We taxed income and expenditure because it was easy and, in a world before a global economy, reasonably fair. There is a global economy, and income and expenditure are no longer the appropriate things to be taxed. ANONYMOUS W000355 19 Mar 2018, 9:22 AM the role of charities with businesses needs to be worked out - maybe around level of business? TIM O W000367 19 Mar 2018, 10:34 AM There needs to be an appropriate capital gains tax on every home outside of the family home, something longer than two years - 10 to 20 at least. The highest tax brackets need to rise to reflect inflation. Fresh vegetables, fruit and meat need to be gst free. Nz made should have a small tax break. Luxury cars should have a tax increase. CELIA MCALPINE W000372 19 Mar 2018, 10:56 AM Capital gains tax is needed, hands down. And GST should be lowered. Without a capital gains tax, millions of dollars are being kept from recirculated into our economy, and a high GST unfairly penalises the poor, who are unable to spend large amounts of money at once (like those with a very high income can to avoid certain taxes). GARRY FERGUSON W000386 19 Mar 2018, 12:12 PM scrub income tax and rely solely on a broad range sales tax and import tariffs. STACEY BIDDICK W000392 19 Mar 2018, 12:29 PM We need to start taxing churchs. While poverty is rife in this country, and the pastor lives in big fancy houses, shouldn't that raise the question as to why pastors are so rich? Collecting money from church goers, whilst next to nothing is forwarded to the community. Why should churches be tax exempt when they operate like a business? PHILIP WELLINGTON W000405 19 Mar 2018, 2:49 PM I think religious organisations and any businesses they have should be taxed. Superannuatants should pay a lesser amount of tax as superannuation is difficult to live on in many cases. Tax loopholes should be closed. Tax should be paid on profits made on the sale of real estate property as it should be classed as income. ANDY DAY W000417 19 Mar 2018, 5:40 PM We need to reduce the tax burden of the poor. GST for basic necessity’s is wrong. Any company that sells for a profit in nz needs to be taxed. Also an asset tax needs to be considered on second or more homes. Just need to close all the loop holes which allow expensive accountants to shuffle money around. Needs to be made simple ANONYMOUS W000440 19 Mar 2018, 9:16 PM I don’t think women’s sanitary items should be taxed. SIOBHAN KEOGH W000476 20 Mar 2018, 10:51 AM I think there should be an additional, higher tax bracket for those making $150,000- $200,000 plus. In some areas of New Zealand the highest tax bracket is enough for people to be comfortable but certainly not wealthy, and on one income in areas with housing affordability issues the highest tax bracket is not even comfortable. People who are legitimately well-off should pay more in tax to balance out social inequity. I also think we should have capital gains tax. MARC SPARKS W000497 20 Mar 2018, 2:53 PM We are currently taxing consumption and revenue, these are broad based and well understood taxes. Likewise the cost and administration of these taxes is low and well understood. Aside from specific user pays taxes there is no need to expand the tax base. MICHELLE COOPER W000513 20 Mar 2018, 7:05 PM Take tax off fruit and vegetables- it’s wrong that we can buy a bag of chips for cheaper than fruit or Veges. Any investment properties should be taxed - how can young people and first home buyers afford to buy a home when some people own 5 or 6 properties! It’s ridiculous! ROSS HEBNER W000520 20 Mar 2018, 7:41 PM Introduce asset tax a la Gareth Morgan and Universal Basic Income! GREG MCINNES W000542 20 Mar 2018, 10:14 PM I feel that too much taxing goes on for goods. The end customer for a trade could be paying for goods that have been taxed 4 or 5 times through each partys purchase. before they even get goods installed. JAMIE W000549 20 Mar 2018, 11:06 PM I would like to see higher taxes on multinational corporations such as Facebook, amazon water bottlers, or online retailers. They currently pay very little and take new Zealand money offshore. I think GST should be taken off fresh fruit and vegetables and potentially other food products which meet rigorous health standards. Taxes on tobacco products should continue as they have proven yo have great health benefits. In the same vein I think a tax should be introduced on RTDs over a certain percentage. I think a tax should be introduced on foreign tourists to New Zealand to contribute back to the maintenance of national parks, freedom camping, tourist roads, acc visitor claims and other tourist infrastructure. I also think a tax should be introduced on property speculation. It has been going on for far too long unchecked, especially in Auckland and ties up the housing market. Currently it is enables rich to get richer and only grows inequality. ANONYMOUS W000554 21 Mar 2018, 6:17 AM The statement above is to Misleading you tax 30cents in the dollar plus 15% on goods and services = 45% plus fuel, alcohol, Tobacco, ACC, resident withholding tax on earnings on savings + more You need to tax less much less. Remove all these stealth taxes. If you must tax then it should just be GST at 10%. OR a low flat income tax and nothing else. If you want multinationals to pay tax here then slash the corporate tax rate. Be tax competitive they'll soon be scrambling to pay tax here, better to have a small piece of a massive pie than no pie at all. Definitely NO to a capital gains tax. Or any wealth tax it's hard enough to pay all these taxes out of cashflow what's it going to be like when you're trying to pay based on value when there is no cashflow. LINDA SORENSEN W000576 21 Mar 2018, 9:58 AM Changes I would implement in taxes, etc.: Add capital gains, but exclude kiwisaver and family home (can prove residence for at least 3-5 years). Alter business taxes significantly to support income equality and help mom and pop shops. Base the tax on the variance between the highest paid and lowest paid individuals (taking into account add-ons like travel, share options, annual leave etc). The higher the variance, the higher the % tax for that company. Make it such that they can't "farm out" executive pay. Require that overseas companies (like ANZ) reinvest any profits made in NZ back into NZ - improve wages or expand your business here - rather than sending profits overseas. Tax exiting $ at max rate. Allow for funding of central activities (that are not repeated at a local level), but the rest stays here. All tourists should have to have travel insurance to cover medical issues. Other countries require visas, we already require an exit ticket. This is fair and reasonable. PETER ELEY W000581 21 Mar 2018, 10:25 AM Let's separate wishes from reality. CGT on investment properties is great, in principle. But it would be unethical purely to apply CGT to those. So CGT on shares? KiwiSaver, retirement funds, credits when shares are sold at a loss, Black Friday, GFC... And of course properties are often sold at a loss. What about mum's jewellery, the boat, vintage cars, that 1989 Hermitage? A wealth tax likewise. The super rich wouldn't care too much, and would find a way to avoid it. And it would alienate many aspirational middle class families. Avoidance would become a major industry, income splitting, gifting, sham companies, goats, kiwi fruit, alpacas ... Income tax, consumption tax and property rates are simple, effective and very hard to avoid. Progressive tax is a must, and 33c in the dollar is probably too low for super income income earners. 17c is too high for low income earners. Tweak those bands. GST hits the poor hardest, so a lower bottom tax rate would alleviate that. MARCUS PICKENS W000590 21 Mar 2018, 10:44 AM Hello, I think that charitable entities such as religious organisations who have business empires should be contributing to the tax take. I cannot remember if the latest census had a question relating to religion, but I recall from previous census's that there is a large and increasing percentage of the population who declare no religion. Therefore, is it time to look at some form of regulation regarding tax on companies affiliated to religious entities (Sanitarium and Destiny Church spring immediately to mind). There seems a outdated and out weighted form of benefit to some of these 'businesses' versus the majority of other businesses. Thank you. THOMAS MORRISEY W000597 21 Mar 2018, 10:52 AM GST is an unfair and non-progressive tax that treats all goods as though they are of equal merit. GST should be reformed to actively subsidise goods that are beneficial to society, such as fruit and vegetables, and be applied at higher rates to goods that are bad for Society such as fast food. FRANCES COOK W000599 21 Mar 2018, 11:08 AM Unfair to place a tax on a tax. Rates should not attract GST, this is double dipping. Overseas companies should be taxed on the profit they make in NZ. Overseas investors pay a much lower tax contribution on any interest they receive in NZ eg 2% while residents who live and work in the country pay the going rate. They invest here as they get a better interest rate, so tax this at least at 10%. Overseas investors have made serious money from buying land in NZ and then selling at a huge profit, they should definitely be paying tax on that profit. Diabetes is a serious concern in this country yet fruit , vegetables etc are taxed. Exempt the first $20k of earnings from tax, this would benefit everyone. NZ has a high household debt, then encourage savings, lower the tax take on savings , the money used for saving has already been taxed. MATTHEW SAMPSON W000619 21 Mar 2018, 11:59 AM Businesses owned by Charities should still be taxed in the same way as a non-Charity owner would. Overseas businesses should also be taxed on their local profits RICHARD MAUD W000634 21 Mar 2018, 12:49 PM We should definitely be taxing all overseas companies that operate in New Zealand and close loopholes that allow many highly profitable companies to avoid paying tax in New Zealand. There should be a capital gains tax on land and housing, exempting the family home, buying and selling land and buildings is a profitable business for some people and should be taxed as such. Tax should definitely be used to change behaviour in people and companies, such as polluters and antisocial behaviour , like smoking and problems caused by excess alcohol. WILLIAM GIRIMONTI W000639 21 Mar 2018, 1:04 PM \* We should eliminate taxes applied to government levies - this equates to double taxation. \* We should eliminate taxes on non-discretionary spending (ie. food, clothing, electricity, healthcare) \* We should never consider capital gains taxes for New Zealanders as that will stifle investment activity which is good for all of New Zealand. \* Capital gains taxes should ONLY be considered for foreign investors. \*Consider shifting a portion of the tax burden off of New Zealand residents & citizens and onto foreign interests instead. ANONYMOUS W000656 21 Mar 2018, 1:41 PM It's not just about looking to see where else a tax can be added or increased (look at the impact on crime the tobacco tax has had, dairies being robbed for something that is so expensive due to high tax), why not consider more ways of reducing a tax. For example introduce a tax-free income similar to that in UK. Yes this will benefit everyone including the millionaires, but its impact will be most strongly felt by the low income earners. In the UK it is something like 12k. If the first 5 or 10K earned here was tax free that could transform lives. And as that money would be spent, tax would still be gathered. Look really carefully at the tax of savings. There is no incentive to do so. Maybe introduce some tax free accounts. If pension contributions and growth were not taxed, people , through compounding, would have much healthier balances. Then withdrawals would be taxed as income, just as the sale of investment properties (no matter how long you have had them) should be taxed. RAYMOND STEIN W000671 21 Mar 2018, 2:20 PM If we are going to introduce a CGT, then it makes sense to also introduce a 'Stamp Duty' tax (suggested rate is 1% max) on the sale/purchase of a property/house/land/commercial building. This 'Stamp Duty' tax can then go towards the upgrading of underground infrastructure (waste water, drainage, high speed broadband etc.) which is not coping due to age old infrastructure coupled with the increase of people and housing into NZ, Auckland specifically. LUKE COPSEY W000686 21 Mar 2018, 3:04 PM We need to tax the rich more and reduce the income tax and GST for the poor. When national came into office I was shocked at how they reduced the tax on the higher incomes and increased GST. That was a really terrible move for the majority of the people. The argument is that the rich are already paying more than their fair share, but this is rubbish and the politicians are included as the rich so it won’t change. The higher income families have more money left over after expenses than families on minimum wage. The percentage of tax being taken from the Poors income after expenses compared to the rich is a huge difference. It’s not fair and the rich need to pay more. Make a new tax bracket for the people earning over a million and make it 60% and increase tax for the people easrning over 100,000. STEWART FINLAY W000702 21 Mar 2018, 4:02 PM As New Zealanders we should pay our fair share of all the costs associated with the infrastructure and the governance of our country. However we should not be making a way for big international companies to replace our efforts in production, paying almost zero tax, and taking the profits to offshore bank accounts. We should not be giving tax incentives for those who want to buy up housing as investments, causing the values to rise far above realistic levels and making those individuals rich at the expense of the ordinary New Zealand citizen. I myself was given the opportunity to purchase a home in 1976 under the Labour "house and Land' package, at a time when I could not save fast enough for a deposit. This simple, low cost move set our family up for a secure future, and provided the basis of a enjoyable retirement. It did no make me rich but gave the helping hand that enabled me to work and live comfortably in my own country and care for my children. REBEKAH HAWTHORN W000718 21 Mar 2018, 5:15 PM We need to remove the tax on fresh New Zealand produce, as a teacher I see first hand what poor nutrition is doing to our children. We are paying for this obesity epidemic in medical fees. Time to try something new. K W W000729 21 Mar 2018, 6:23 PM I think there is too much dependence on taxing hardworking people - income tax is too high. I also don't like the idea of a capital gains tax unless it is aimed at professional property developers. Everyone should be contributing to more tax, rather than just wage earners. I think the tax on alcohol and tobacco should be higher. I would definitely support a sugar tax. ANONYMOUS W000741 21 Mar 2018, 6:58 PM We should diversify tax revenue streams in New Zealand, so that more things are taxed at a low level, to increase revenue (so we can cater to a successful, growing population) while minimizing the impact of tax on New Zealanders' everyday lives and our investments in our futures. NICOLA GRAY W000765 21 Mar 2018, 8:50 PM Yes to some kind of tax when properties are sold. Yes to taxes on charities- perhaps those earning over $xx or selling commercial products/ services or just those running businesses. Yes to taxing multinationals. JOCELYN ALESANA-RENNIE W000773 21 Mar 2018, 9:10 PM I think we should look more closely at what Scandinavian countries do in regard to tax. They have a great health system and education system. They seem to live well; they pay more in tax, sure, but hey live well. Higher income earners should pay a proportionately higher tax. Not popular but makes sense. Private schools should not have government funding from public purse. Private hospitals should be closed. Public hospitals and freee health would bffordable with a fairer taxation system. GREG MUNFORD W000779 21 Mar 2018, 9:40 PM We need a more stringent polluter pays approach to agriculture and industry. Rather than taxing their profits (i.e. post-pollution; public cost for cleanup) you could better incentivise businesses to invest in cleaner tech/systems/processes in the first place - e.g. with harsh fines and/or incentives. DAVID CHING W000789 21 Mar 2018, 11:58 PM some overseas items to not attract GST mainly because of collection costs, but this could be added to the annual Tax returns SYLVIE KERR W000796 22 Mar 2018, 6:41 AM All churches, and any charities who run a side business should absolutely be taxed. GST needs to be reduced or removed from fresh fruit and vegetables as it disproportionately impacts the poor. The fact of the matter is, people earning via salary and wages cannot avoid paying tax, but those with other forms of income can and do. What you do needs to be radical and stop the wealthiest NZers hiding their income and paying SFA tax (this includes corporations). Property Investment should be taxed so insanely that people drop it, and NZ homes return to places to live not money-makers for the few. This would also level the playing field, and encourage investment elsewhere into more productive areas (e.g. businesses). If you actually collected tax from all the current untaxed sources (legal or loopholes), you would have enough money to reduce taxes on the poor and turn NZ into a paradise. BERNARD KLOS W000803 22 Mar 2018, 7:41 AM Why do we tax fresh fruit and veges? and the tax chain need to be acted upon. Business get taxed, who pay employees, who then get taxed, who spend their remain income and get taxed... CHRIS PATTISON W000815 22 Mar 2018, 8:57 AM In principle, I am against taxing (GST) basic food. However, I am also pragmatic about this issue, and feel that if there is a split introduced between taxing some foodstuffs, and not taxing other foodstuff, it will introduce a whole complicated lobby group and expensive controlling structure which will be counterproductive. In fact, the controlling structure might cost more money than leaving the system alone as it is. This can be seen in countries such as the UK, where I believe bread is not taxed, but put a bit of fancy icing on it, it suddenly becomes a luxury item and is taxed. This type of system is a farce. The KISS principle overrides this. BRUCE MERRETT W000831 22 Mar 2018, 11:00 AM We should tax consumption by increasing GST. Income tax should be simple...one tax rate for all & a generous personal allowance. Housing (seen as an investment by most) should be taxed (I own 3 properties so I would pay up). Housing is dividing society more than anything else & that resentment will grow until Kiwis have a greater sense of fair-play. SAM HADLEY-JONES W000842 22 Mar 2018, 12:12 PM Regarding tax duty, this could be most cost-reflective compared to the social cost of these 'undesirable' consumables. There are also more efficient mechanisms than taxation to handle some types of social consequences if implemented properly ie: ETS vs carbon tax. If the ETS was more cost reflective of the forecast impact of carbon emissions, the ETS would have a more effective nominal price and desired outcome would be achieved. Instead we cap the price and exclude whole industries because they have a powerful lobby. Regarding income tax, I think our system is unfair in that sole traders and small businesses are able to protect themselves from tax liability with a good tax consultant. There is no escape for wage earners. The loop-holes need to be closed. International tax policy is a real concern and more so in the future with more globalisation and digital services. B LEE W000862 22 Mar 2018, 1:55 PM Lots of talk on removing GST on essential items. This should benefit those on the lower income. Capital gains tax should be an issue in NZ as far too many have got away with paying any tax on owning multiple houses. If NZ were to go down this path, BE SURE to follow the CGT models of Canada. I've seen too many landlords in NZ that get away from paying CGT by selling 1 house every 2 or 3 years and move into their previous rental house, then repeat sporadically every 3 - 10 years. Imagine the capital gain for a landlord that disposes several houses over a 20 year period? In Canada the CRA tracks tax payers on their principal residence. Buying a house requires tax #, the 1st question they ask when they file a tax return (and by law every resident has to file a tax return regardless if $0 income) is that they put down their address of residence. Their house is matched into the computer so it knows if you acquired a new home, or moved into a rental home you use to own). CALEB EVANS W000869 22 Mar 2018, 2:13 PM More tax needs to be applied to things like soft drinks and fast food dont we have the highest number of obesity compared to population? fruit and veges should have tax taken right off ROGER BAXTER W000878 22 Mar 2018, 3:22 PM Water exports for commercial gain, capital gains, freedom camper clean up ( entry tax for non residents) and sugar tax. Previous govt wouldnt listen -"its too hard". I dont care, theres plenty of govt breaucrats who can find the way to make these work, thats what we pay you for. ANONYMOUS W000884 22 Mar 2018, 3:57 PM Please lower or preferably remove all tax for part-time (i.e. Reserve Force) service personnel! As Reservists who (mostly) have separate full time jobs, we often find ourselves paying secondary employment tax on our Army incomes, which can be upwards of 50% of our pay in some cases. For context, Reservists in Australia don't get taxed on their military pay, and don't get taxed at all when deployed. It would be a relatively inexpensive measure but would do a lot to raise the morale of those who sacrifice their spare time in service of the nation. ZAC ALI W000886 22 Mar 2018, 4:03 PM Taxing the Right Things - On top of PAYE, we have 15% GST on everything. In light of poverty and wealth gap in NZ, i strongly believe basic food and hygene items should be GST exempt. These should include things like flour, rice, milk, sanitary pads and the like. This would go a fair way to ensure families with financial difficulties can afford to feed their children. Secondly, I believe we need to re-visit property tax. Non-resident buyers should be charged stamp duty. Vacant properties bought for the sake of capital gains by speculators should be taxed as well to discourage the practice. Same should apply to landbankers whereby property that could be developed should either be sold to developers or taxed if proven to be kept as a landbank. ANDREW ROBINSON W000895 22 Mar 2018, 5:30 PM Shouldn't be adding GST to healthy food and other essentials. For the most part GST is a tax on poor people. Should have a 0% tax band for the lowest earners. Should be taxing capital gains. Should be taxing investment earnings, businesses and salaries at the same rates. Should be taxing multinational corporations on the money the earn in New Zealand rather than allowing offshoring. THOMAS SALDANA W000901 22 Mar 2018, 5:59 PM I would strongly recommend that religious institutions should lose their exempt status and be required to pay tax, just like any other business. If anything, they should pay more. Their entire business model consists of exaggerated claims and broken promises. They undermine scientific literacy and education with their demonstrably false claims, and they harm society by promulgating some obscene ideas (homophobia, sexism, violence as a way to 'discipline' children, an authoritarian "do as I say, or else" paradigm). None of these behaviours or attitudes are things which should be rewarded with tax exemption. It's true that religious groups do some good, in the charitable work which some of them do, but this charity work can be given its own exemption, without spreading that tax-exempt status to all activities a religious institution is involved in. STEWART LAWRENCE W000907 22 Mar 2018, 7:27 PM 1. Tax wealth, possibly in the form of an inheritance tax. 2. Tax capital gains 3. Tax people who hide their wealth away in trust accounts. SUSANNAH RODDICK W000916 22 Mar 2018, 7:50 PM We need to be taxing any profit that people make from property capital gains, outside from the sale of the single family home. I pay tax on my income as a self-employed person and am happy to do that. But I don't have to pay tax on the income I've earnt through my properties. That is not fair. Why do I benefit by paying lower taxes on my income, much more than people on lower incomes, and more likely to not have the ability to own 2 or more properties. I know that implementation would be a bit complicated. But everything that is important, with details that affect all of us is complicated. We still tackle it! Other countries do it. I believe that we could solve this one. Surely! LLOYD MEIKLEJOHN W000922 22 Mar 2018, 8:06 PM We need to tax accumulated wealth, and land as a proxy for this. It is the true divider in New Zealand between poverty and plenty. JANE SMITH W000933 23 Mar 2018, 6:51 AM Taxing hard work has never worked in the big picture. Taxing good choices is wrong. From the age of 16 I worked and saved every cent to buy my first home, continued to live on nothing and put up with 2 flatmates to help pay the mortgage. my pairs partied and travelled and then in their 30's complained about house prices and didn't want flatmates and it was inconvenient. Next, If I sell my rentals and modest house and purchase a big expensive home, that will not be taxed for capital gains, if I live in a modest house and leave my rentals as they are for my children,I will be taxed on the sale of the homes - inconsistent and unfair. Next, Tax fast food , sugary drinks and foods which cause Obesity . 1. it pays for the cost on the country 2. it deters bad food choices. Next, the flood of foreigners buying up our property is what has caused the suddenly problem of housing. For 100's of year investment property has not caused a housing shortage. Fix the actual cause ! JOHN BROUGHTON W000942 23 Mar 2018, 11:01 AM There needs to be a review and tightening up on the operations of charities and trusts, many which seem to be using them as facades to the disadvantage of legitimate businesses operations. KEN MORISON W000956 23 Mar 2018, 12:54 PM Taxes must be unavoidable but what we tax should encourage appropriate responses. GST works because it is unavoidable; I do not support lots of exemptions as then you get distortions as seen in the UK. Small women don't pay VAT if they buy children's size clothes; you can't eat takeaways inside as then it makes it a restaurant meal with VAT. I support carbon-based energy taxes as we need to discourage their use. I'd prefer to have less tax on effort (labour) and more on carbon-fuels. I support taxes on capital gains (even though I would suffer) but with consideration for inflation and consideration for those who cannot convert capital gains into cash. We do not want taxes to discourage saving. We need to think globally about tax so I support GST tax on overseas travel and goods. RACHEL BELL W000973 23 Mar 2018, 4:47 PM -Multinational companies that earn money from NZ should pay tax in New Zealand. Google, Facebook, Starbucks, Apple -Menstruation products should be classified as a necessity and not taxed, or tax should pay for reusable menstruation products to be provided as part of a comprehensive nationwide sexual education for schools. -Start a sugar tax (reduce future costs of diabetes and obesity, increase revenue that can be spent on other needs) -Increase environmental levies, incentivise a clean dairy industry, tax plastic, hold businesses accountable for the health/ environmental impact of their goods/ services -Subsidize clean energy alternatives- make solar power more accessible and desirable for new built buildings and make retrofitting excising buildings easier -Reduce tax on agriculture products such as fruit/veg (encourages these industries and promotes healthy eating) -Promote circular economy CATHERINE OLSEN W000981 23 Mar 2018, 6:02 PM We need to tax residential property. This will move us away from wealthy people land banking. BRENDON FAIRBAIRN W000991 23 Mar 2018, 7:50 PM We need to tax capital gains on everything other than the family home. NEIL BOSMAN W000999 23 Mar 2018, 9:39 PM Why do we get taxed on government maternity leave? We’ve already paid years of tax to allow the government to “support” us while we have a newborn baby to look after. I was appalled to find out that my wife’s government maternity leave payments are taxed. That’s just plain double dipping. The tax money is what is being used to pay our matirnity leave, but then the IRD takes tax from that?? $350 a week after tax is nowhere near enough to support a family in our current climate. If there was no tax on the maternity leave payments, the $500+ a week would be far closer to what is needed. ANONYMOUS W001006 24 Mar 2018, 6:45 AM Stop taxing fruit and veges no wonder half the population is fat , crap food is cheap LYDIA STANDEN W001019 24 Mar 2018, 11:08 AM I think it is very important that we tax overseas companies as we continue to move into a time of extreme globalization. EDWARD SIDDLE W001045 24 Mar 2018, 3:54 PM We need to stop taxing labour so much through income taxes, and tax things like land (to make it used more efficiently), driving cars (to discourage their use), and carbon (to help shift to a low-carbon economy). I think GST is a valuable part of our tax system because it is hard to avoid. GEORGE JASONSMITH W001053 24 Mar 2018, 4:22 PM While many of the right things are being taxed there seem to be too many that are not. In particular realised capital gains (from all sources) after allowing for inflation, incomes transferred to avoid tax, and illegal earnings just to name a few. With regards to the latter, it is well known that tax evasion is what brought Al Capone down; how often do we hear of drug dealers, for example, being prosecuted for tax evasion? While a case can be made that GST should be zero-rated for some essential items, it is my view that it would be more efficient in dollar terms to keep a uniform (albeit considerably lower than present) rate of GST and to ensure that the overall tax system, benefit rates and minimum wages ensured that all people can afford to live. M S W001059 24 Mar 2018, 4:47 PM To be fair to the working group every income should be tax. There's a cereal brand that i refuse to buy because it part of church/charitable institution but They producing product under their institution and gain money out of it. Any investment property thats being sold need to be tax. BEVERLEY AUSTIN W001074 24 Mar 2018, 6:13 PM If Gst was paid on financial transactions, there would be a substantial increase in the take. Buying and selling the family home should be included. This should also be deductible ie. If I buy I pay. If I sell I claim. This would be almost be a capital gains tax me thinks, but would not be called such. JASON MCQUINN W001092 24 Mar 2018, 8:22 PM new zealanders resources new zealanders taxs. the current debate around ownership rights needs to be wrapped up, all new zealands resources need to be owned by the current living citizens of this country. oil, water, gas, coal, minerals, wind, air, fisheries etc etc all duties or levys paid for collection of these resoures should go into the 'Kiwi Fund" whereby the fund is reserved for and distributed to the citizens, not for government spending, not for grants, to ensure the betterment of new zealand citizens. the only exception where levies or duties should be unpaid is when a resource is utilised for non profit personal use ie wind for power generation or water for power or irrigation collected at personal expense. SAM STONE W001107 24 Mar 2018, 9:44 PM Tax should be focused on wealth. Taxing income does not necessarily enable a fair collection from the whole population, as many individuals and organisations with great wealth are able to pay minimal tax, when they have the greatest means to afford it. We should be taxing people based on their net worth, not hourly income. HELEN MONGILLO W001123 25 Mar 2018, 5:46 AM The current system allows the rich to avoid paying their fare share of taxes. The rich will still be rich even if they are taxed fairly. A capital gains tax and tax on profits by overseas companies will help New Zealanders have a better spread of wealth. ANDREW BOYCE W001133 25 Mar 2018, 7:48 AM No other comment. BECKY MITCHELL W001142 25 Mar 2018, 8:57 AM Tax should be lifted on NZ fresh produce, so anything grown here is tax free, yet high sugar/salt/fat foods should be taxed more, the encourage all to eat healthier. CAMRYN BROWN W001149 25 Mar 2018, 9:51 AM Given the high price of housing, it seems likely that many other families are in the same position as mine. We are renting a home suitable for us to live in and have invested in a more affordable asset - a rental property that is smaller we could live in. As such, the prospect of a family-home exemption on any future CGT is not only disheartening but borderline offensive. To me, this would appear to be a punishment for saving for my family's future to the best of my abilities, but falling short of that investment being a family home. I'm not a landlord because I want to be but because I can't afford to stop being a tenant! It strikes me as pulling the ladder up behind those already able to own a home suitable for their own living needs. Should the tax working group recommend a CGT, please be aware of this situation and those in it... and either have no family- home exemption or allow the exemption to apply to any assets up to the current value of a family home. ANONYMOUS W001159 25 Mar 2018, 12:10 PM We need a Capital Gains Tax on investment properties. It is ridiculous how much money a certain few are making in Aotearoa, while others cannot even afford one home. BILL CURLEY W001167 25 Mar 2018, 1:04 PM I have pointed out elsewhere that the Tax system is flawed. We need to abolish income tax and move to a Land/Property tax system. This will mean everyone in NZ will pay there fair and full share. It will prevent overseas companies from removing $m from these shores. The wealthy will pay there full share on assets rather then income. Remove the charitable status from religious organisations especially those that are using the tax windfall for proselyting and not for helping the disadvantaged in our society . HEATHER SAYER W001173 25 Mar 2018, 2:03 PM We should look at taxes on use of our natural resources. Water supply is one - rural use and bottling plants often may minimal fees or taxes. Water pollution is linked with this . Plastic waste is a huge problem - tax incentives for better design, alternative material use and collection and recycling could influence behaviour of manufacturers and consumers. Tax incentives could also encourage changes in land use, tree planting and pest control. MICHAEL RILEY W001183 25 Mar 2018, 2:38 PM Continue to pay on every dollar of wages, company profits and every time something is bought and sold in New Zealand, but the proportion of this to the whole is too great. Continue to tax quick profits when people trade things like property or shares. And those who own land or property should pay their local rates, but their should be more accountability for where rates are spent - referendums/online polls etc. I don't believe in taxing the money people make from things like art or fine wine, unless you give a rebate for losses made on such investments. I agree with Capital Gains Tax on income-producing property. I do not support Capital Gains Tax on the primary family home or, in the case of a family trust, where a home has been occupied by the settlor in a lifetime license or similar. Things like airbnb might be complicated. We don't tax the income of charities, even if they own businesses. And we don't tax the profits of overseas companies with no New Zealand base. DAVID ECCLES W001188 25 Mar 2018, 2:59 PM Tax is treated as a punishment. Are the things that we are taxing the things that we want to punish people for? I would prefer to have a system where income is only taxed beyond that which is necessary to maintain a minimally-sustainable life. Could a tax system work if people and businesses were not taxed if they were living sustainably and within their means? Would there still be enough tax to support the needs of people who didn't have sufficient capability to support themselves? I expect so. I expect that there are sufficient numbers of people who enjoy making money that they can support people who need additional resources to live. REECE MOODY W001197 25 Mar 2018, 3:35 PM Firstly, I am of the opinion that the Tax Working Group is a facade. Rather than 'how can we overhaul the tax system', I think it is a front for 'how can we increase the tax take'. Because that is how Labour works. So my answers may seem somewhat cynical since they are in that context, but are no less valid. Quick answer: just tax less things. ANDREW METFORD W001207 25 Mar 2018, 4:43 PM When I buy items on the internet from overseas, I have to pay a tax to Customs before the items are released to me. This is unfair, because I am only buying the items from overseas because I cannot buy them in New Zealand. I understand that if the item in available in NZ, buying it from the NZ retailer helps their business, keeps people employed, and contributes to the NZ tax, but if the item is not able to be purchased here, I am not denying a NZ business of a sale, or putting people out of a job, or denying the Government the tax on that item, so why should I have to pay tax on it? I buy items from NZ retailers when I can to support local business, but often they do not have the items I need so I have no option but to buy from overseas / the internet. If the time is available in NZ, and I choose to buy it from overseas, then I have no problem paying tax in it. COURTNEY PRATT W001209 25 Mar 2018, 4:52 PM GST should be removed from fresh fruit and vegetables. GST should be removed from feminine sanitary items. OLIVER KROLLMANN W001217 25 Mar 2018, 5:35 PM One of the biggest tax loopholes is the well-known one around property, particularly owner-occupied property, but also investment property. It has led to speculation, land- banking, house price inflation, and contributed significantly to growing inequality. It's all well-documented, but because it is such a controversial topic, nobody wants to talk about it. This has to change, no matter what the public opinion is. Most Kiwis treat their properties (owner-occupied or not) as an investment, thus they should be taxed as such. Everything else is inherently unfair. Taxes should also be levied on products, items, behaviours, consumption etc. that causes harm, e.g. alcohol and drug use, carbon usage and fossil fuels etc. The additional revenue should go directly and fully towards mitigation of the respective harm that is done, e.g. alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs, investment in alternative energy generation and elimination of fossil fuel mining, import and consumption. DAVE SMYTH W001226 25 Mar 2018, 6:03 PM Remove furtherment of religion as a charitable activity and tax it! It is obscene that entities like Sanitarium pay no tax. SAMANTHA TRIEU W001228 25 Mar 2018, 6:18 PM We should be taxing churches and church /religious owned companies like Sanitarium. ARIC THORN W001232 25 Mar 2018, 6:34 PM The tax system needs to be a more balanced asset /capital tax and income, rather then focusing so much on income alone DEIDRE BUTLER W001238 25 Mar 2018, 7:49 PM This needs to be fair. Quick profits on land or property (under two years) should be taxable as it would be assumed this was achieved as if a business transaction - barring scenarios of e.g. death/estate, relationship separation. Long term “Capital Gains” should NOT be taxed. How can you be fair in doing this when there is natural property and market movements that is not fair to tax! Owners would have paid rates throughout, very likely have been providing a rental, and in my experience, it is not easy nor necessarily lucrative doing this! No brainer that charities SHOULD be taxed if they are obtaining revenue! Absolutely if they own a business! Overseas companies SHOULD be taxed if operating in NZ IRRESPECTIVE of not having a NZ base! DO NOT tax people on personal items - art, wine, collections, vehicles ... that is ridiculous and nanny state! Again, this is not fair and invasive to privacy! KEVIN KLEMPEL W001246 25 Mar 2018, 11:25 PM Income tax in NZ has really had its day and is stifling business owners, workers and development and the complexities of the current tax laws are not even well understood even by the IRD who now choose not to advise unless paid well in advance and then with a no guarantees answer. income tax has also generated a myriad of tax minimisation networks and processes that are wasteful of business time and resources which are in effect are a productivity drain. Expenditure based taxation properly implemented (including tax on capital shifted of shore no matter the source) would allow for better direction of capital use, the ability to provide for layers of tax appropriate to need or greed and the ability for government to encourage or discourage to a much finer degree the expenditure or the provision of saved capital for use within the economy. Taxing all consumption, including property, and providing for levels of consumption tax while removing income tax would make tax less complex. KAY TRACEY W001264 26 Mar 2018, 10:54 AM There should be fewer exception to what is taxed. This is creating confusion and encouraging practices that give some an unfair advantage over others. Charities should not be tax exempt. Not taxing charities comes from a different time when many or most of the people where donating their time and expertise to the charity. This is no longer the case, charities are in most ways operate the same as businesses. Many businesses contribute to our society while still paying tax. Treating all sales as a taxable event rather than a capital gains tax would be fairer and easier to understand. As with the current GST there could be a threshold before GST registration was required. GST registration and payment should be required for all who do business in NZ. Overseas based companies who do not pay NZ tax on profit should have a higher rate of GST. JILLIAN JOHNSON W001280 26 Mar 2018, 2:05 PM Churches do charitable work, should not be taxed, however if they own businesses not involved in charitable work, they should be fully taxed. Tax evasion is rampant and white collar workers are getting away with it cos they can afford to get the best advice to avoid tax. Speaking as a pensioner, aged 75, (so in my own self interest) I have worked all of my life, as a single, and married woman, as a widow, and as a pensioner (still working). I would like to see DOUBLE TAX abolished. If I am willing to get off my butt and work at 75, why should I be penalised. There should be some concessions for those who work after 65. Also those families who have to do two jobs to make ends meet, should not be double taxed. J H Johnson KATE KENNEDY W001293 26 Mar 2018, 4:39 PM Remove GST from fruit and vegetables and sanitary products. Tax property speculation RICHARD LIN W001303 26 Mar 2018, 6:59 PM Tax the churches! ALEXANDER JAGO W001305 26 Mar 2018, 7:44 PM More tax on overseas investors and property owners, a water tax, a tax on commercial cannibis (pending legalisation (which should be legal, come on), capital gains tax) ADAM RANSFIELD W001309 26 Mar 2018, 9:43 PM Tax Churches Under New Zealand law, churches are exempt from income tax because they have a charitable purpose – they promote religion. Bulls#\*t. We need to close this ridiculous and archaic loophole. Churches are a business plain and simple, they charge their clients for their service. They rely on the income. They support their employees and assets with that income. This loophole is being exploited everywhere. Think Sanitarium, Destiny Church. They should be taxed like everyone else, and pay their employees like everyone else. If, as a business does, they decide to give away their profits to a charity then that is tax deductible for them but that other charity then needs to declare their income and be taxed on that. Level the playing fields, plan and simple. Maori Trusts and Not for Profits Etc all need to follow suit. Those that don't earn much and effectively spend all they earn doing their work won't pay tax either way. But the crooks who exploit the loophole will be caught BUTCH STRAUCH W001311 26 Mar 2018, 9:59 PM Do not change the GST rate of 15 %. If you would decrease it, nothing would get cheaper. All prices would stay, only the profit for businesses ( supermarket etc.) would rise. ANDREW ELPHICK W001329 27 Mar 2018, 8:46 AM Yes as a percentage of GDP it is comparable with other countries. This may change with the recent dropping of corporate tax rates around us.... we have already seen Xero move to the ASX it seems there will be more that follow. I bright part on the horizon is taxing of the internet players. DARCY HAGGART' W001345 27 Mar 2018, 10:52 AM Less wages more art wine and over seas JC DC W001352 27 Mar 2018, 11:32 AM I think where people are using investments e.g. property, art, collections as an income earner they should be taxed on the profits the same way we are taxed on interest earned in the bank. Definitely overseas companies should be taxed on profit they make in NZ. Take GST off fresh fruit and vegetables. MARK SCOTT W001365 27 Mar 2018, 12:44 PM Ad hoc carve-outs from GST should not be made in respect of fruit & vegetables, nor for any other common grocery products. Anyone can argue for taking the tax off this or that. So who do you listen to? And when does the parade stop? Someone said to me that you should not tax "culture" - so should we take GST of pies and beer? Millions would agree to that... Having GST exemptions (or zero-rating) for certain grocery items: a. will add disproportionate complexity to our current GST system; b. will not necessarily translate to lower prices; c. will be poorly targeted, as those who will likely benefit the most from the removal of GST will be those who actually don't need such tax relief. d. will not significantly impact on consumers making "healthy choices" (one commentator has said that there is no evidence that lowering the rate of GST has ever increased a consumer's IQ). Human nature is such that we would all enjoy a tax break - but the TWG should not go there with GST exemptions. ROB HENDERSON W001381 27 Mar 2018, 3:14 PM A transaction tax on all transactions would ideally replace revenue while transitioning away from PAYE and GST. So lifting the lower socio economic class incomes significantly, while testing their propensity to save and avoid spending so as to reduce welfare dependency. At the same time restructure the housing system in NZ so that incomes increased by way of transaction tax replacement are allocated to a national housing scheme for earners to generate funds to buy a home. STEPHEN OSBORNE W001404 27 Mar 2018, 5:51 PM Shop bought food and drink should be 0 rated for GST Increase GST on luxury goods to balance the books Benefits the poor and puts the burden on those that can afford to buy luxury goods LUCAS DAVIES W001420 27 Mar 2018, 10:20 PM There is no reason not to tax capital gains as if it were any other type of income. Probably a tax on value realisation would be the easiest to implement. DAVE BULL W001433 28 Mar 2018, 8:07 AM The tax system has, for generations, strongly incentivised putting capital into unproductive assets such as the family home - pushing up house prices, favouring the wealthy, minimising business investment. At the same time, it has not incentivised maintaining those assets. This must change. A capital gains tax is not the answer because it is easy to avoid - simply do not sell the asset. It disincentivises fixing the problem of too much capital sitting in unproductive assets. The solution must involve taxing wealth in houses, not taxing sale of houses. In my view the most likely consequence of a capital gains tax is to drive house prices up, as sellers seek to have buyers pay their capital gains tax for them. It would be counterproductive. Smoking and driving are, rightly, taxed, because managing them costs the taxpayer. For the same reason, I look forward to carbon taxes, a far simpler and more effective tool than the ideologue, game-able ETS. Sugar taxes should also come in. J S W001444 28 Mar 2018, 9:40 AM I would like to discuss "secondary tax". In my opinion this should line up with how much you are earning as opposed to how many jobs you have. Those in society that have 2 or more jobs are generally only being paid minimum wage and therefore do what they can to earn a "liveable wage". And they are being penalised for this by paying secondary tax. These people, even with 2 or more jobs, will still only be bringing in enough to live on (and possible still being under $30k). Once again, those that can least afford it, end up paying more tax. However, if this lined up with how much you are earning, lets say $60k, and you went and got a second job, secondary tax should then kick in. KIPI WALLBRIDGE-PAEA W001457 28 Mar 2018, 11:58 AM We aren't taxing the capital tied up in residential property enough. We aren't even taxing it. We are taxing wage earners too much when much benefit accrues to property owners who may not pay any tax at all. SCOTT ESSER W001472 28 Mar 2018, 2:39 PM The confiscatory excise tax on cigarettes and tobacco falls on those who can least afford it. It has the negative affect of leading to crime on retailers. The war on tobacco has been won, smoking rates are at an all time low. Lets refocus our taxation efforts on environmental concerns such a green house gases. JANE DE BORCHGRAVE W001485 28 Mar 2018, 4:59 PM Some key thoughts about our tax system. 1. The tax system has the ability to facilitate social good without stigma. Remove GST from all fresh fruit and vegetables (to qualify, fruit and veg needs to be 'unpackaged') so that 'healthy good food' is a 'basic', tax 'poor nutrition' like sugar 2. Multinationals need to pay tax. They depend on our national, tax funded services of education, roading, medical etc to have a healthy, educated workforce. This is not just a 'Google' tax for digital corporates, this is a multinational issue with e.g. 'profit shifting' etc. I have worked for x4 different multinationals over 20 years and each has avoided significant tax due to 'clear corporate organisation'. 3. Revisit charities. How Sanitarium has managed to evade tax based on 'religion' yet be one of the largest FMCG corporates in NZ is a mystery to us all. Come on!! WAYNE ATKINSON W001490 28 Mar 2018, 5:59 PM Smoking is one of the highest tax take .. by 2025 nz is going smoke free .... As nz have not given smoke a tax break in year but the tax have been going in to the big pool of tax ... smoking is a choice.... people make.. but will are tax so high... STEVE SUTTIE W001504 28 Mar 2018, 9:13 PM We need to tax charities and churches who have businesses hiding behind them. For example the Exclusive Brethern Church is just a front for businesses. We need to tax them or aspects of their operations. F M BELL W001516 29 Mar 2018, 7:20 AM I think that food sold as a single ingredient should not be subject to GST, eg: a bag of flour or a sack of potatoes would be untaxed, a loaf of bread or a bag of chips would be taxed. CGT should be charged on real estate sales profits, adjusted for inflation, excluding the main residence (or main residence plus one holiday or rental home for families headed by two adults). The percentage of tax should also be reduced by each year the asset is owned. I do not think that an inheritance tax would work. Overseas the wealthy can afford professional advice and structure their asset ownership in order to avoid the tax which is therefore mosly paid by middle income families. I think that GST should be removed from council rates. Paying tax to central government on a tax charged by local government is unusual. Local taxes are already high, particularly in poor areas (in Horowhenua it can be over 2.5% of the GV each year) and adding GST to the rates takes money away from poor areas. SCOTT TAYLOR W001524 29 Mar 2018, 9:07 AM The tax at moment is pretty good. It could be freed up so home owners who want to improve their homes with insulation heating etc get to claim deprecation. Otherwise works well. When i worked overtime in past to get ahead i was penalised. As i went above 70k a year so alot of my money went to the government. Dont increase upper tax brackets . They dont help middle nz. The rich people just move money around so they dont get paid above the higher threshold. So only people working hard and doing over time get pinged. A good question to ask is of people on the pay above 70 k tax rate... how many of them are doing so on overtime. GREGORY COOPER W001548 29 Mar 2018, 1:21 PM Tax has to fair Pay according to your means not your needs Tax assets before income Tax income before expenditure Tax expenditure as a last resort Need to make it socially toxic to avoid taxes - as a corporation or as an individual Use taxation as a means to reduce wealth inequality ERIN STAGG W001553 29 Mar 2018, 2:08 PM HI think we need to tax small business starting out and certain products, like fruit and vegetables, less and then tax other goods, including the sale of investment and second homes and businesses, more. This way we would encourage innovation and investment in small business, rather than housing. I also think not taxing low income families as much is a good idea. ANONYMOUS W001579 29 Mar 2018, 5:22 PM Introducing a capital gains tax MICHAEL JONGENEEL W001598 29 Mar 2018, 10:03 PM Please: - introduce a tax free allowance - tax property and other assets, or tax capital gains on assets Ta GREIG WILSON W001603 29 Mar 2018, 10:32 PM Yes, we should have capital gains tax in NZ. Its simply NOT FAIR that wage earners have to have pay tax on income, yet some fat rich prick can own a house somewhere in a posh area and it grows in value by heaps and then they dont pay a CENT of tax on that profit! We need better balance in our tax system. This the opportunity to get it right. ANNA HEINZ W001610 29 Mar 2018, 11:40 PM I feel that we are not redistributing wealth properly as we have too many people who are struggling too much. We need to have a capital gains tax. In this new digital environment, I favour looking at ideas like a small (micro) tax on all digital transactions. Somehow, we need to find ways to compel business interests, who are based elsewhere but sell in the NZ market, to pay taxes in NZ. Taxing the buyer just raises the price at point of sale. Maybe we need a tax or cost for accessing the Nz market, The idea that overseas interests can exploit NZ resources within our country, with minimal cost and little tax to us because they sell overseas, feels wrong in every way. I do favour a check on national well being alongside monitoring things like GDP and national debt, MELANIE KILFOYLE W001625 30 Mar 2018, 9:26 AM Increased threshold for GST registration to $100,000 turnover to make life easier for small taxpayers Remove the requirement to deduct DWT from fully imputed dividends paid by close companies. The DWT doesn't improve the tax take, it just shuffles cash around. If you're serious about ring-fencing rental losses, consider a reasonable limit of losses to claim (say $10,000). A total ban may have unintended consequences like reducing the rental stock, making it even harder for low income earners to find a home to rent. Legalise and regulate and TAX cannabis. This means serious growers can be dragged into the tax net and pay tax on their profits. Add a special tax (like tax on alcohol and cigarettes) for an even bigger take. Clarify tax treatment for shareholder employees of coys that contract to Labour Hire coys. It's messy and under-explained at the moment, and the shareholders seem to be trapped into paying prov tax AND having WHT deducted from their income. Maybe let coy's to exempt. JAMES CLARK W001657 30 Mar 2018, 7:25 PM To many commercial activities are sheltered under "charity status". Churches which own commercial property, and iwi groups which own businesses and commercial property, should pay tax on the profits. They can then use tax paid profits for charitable work if they choose. But it is not fair that others without charity status have to compete in the same market with an organisation that pays no tax. VIVEK REGMI W001675 30 Mar 2018, 11:05 PM Yeah, I am pretty satisfied with tax government imposed in. MARTIN COULSON W001682 31 Mar 2018, 6:27 AM Fresh fruit & veg & all staple foods no tax. High fats, sugar, meats &dairy high tax. Pollution tax. more packaging =more tax, High tax on any polluters, including forestry, resource extraction, waterway pollution,&corporate dairy. Maximum tax on profits of banks, &financial usury and any system that gives huge profits to executives. Maximum wage culture to be abandoned No CEO to be paid more than ten times their lowest employee. ANONYMOUS W001695 31 Mar 2018, 11:31 AM Those things mentioned in the video that are not currently taxed, should be. Essential healthy foodstuffs should not be taxed. ANONYMOUS W001702 31 Mar 2018, 11:48 AM All the elements referred to in the video that are not currently taxed, should be. BRIAN YATES W001713 31 Mar 2018, 3:49 PM Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this subject. I have concerns about a death duty or inheritance tax being implemented. I am 5th generation and sharemilker on our families organic dairy farm in Karaka. It has happened before in our family, back in the 80's when my grandfather died at the age of 32. The family business was nearly ruined. A mortgage had to be taken out to pay the death duty, and it was a heavy burden for many years. The same scenario, at todays land prices, would be so crippling we would absolutely have to sell our precious family land. We are surrounded by farm land that has been cut up, and sold off. Where everyone else has seen the dollar signs from foreign investors, we have stayed true to ourselves as people of the land. Farming organically since the 80's, for the future generations. In short, a death duty would be unfair to those of us who have a relatively low return on a significant capital asset. Punishing, just like our rates bill. JAMES EMPSON W001724 31 Mar 2018, 11:29 PM Ruc should be included in fuel prices, healthy food should be taxed less than unhealthy food, capital gains tax on secondary dwellings increased and a tax cut benefit for all employees in nz. CHRIS WONG W001739 1 Apr 2018, 9:36 AM I want New Zealand's tax system to be more progressive. In Australia, low income individuals are exempt from income tax, and the top bracket is 45%. I believe that this system is more fair and better reflects reality, where many low income people are paid under-the-table regardless. I also want the Tax Working Group to look at reducing GST. The last National Government increased GST from 12.5% to 15%, which hurt the kind of people who are most sensitive to prices. It feels wrong to tax people for buying the things they need to live. Finally, I would like the Group to consider a capital gains tax. Investment income is still income, and should be taxed the same way. Not taxing it punishes the poor for not having enough money to invest. JASON DOYLE W001770 2 Apr 2018, 3:02 PM I feel the wage-earners (and to an extent, business), pay a disproportionate amount of tax. Should definitely look at different tax streams (asset, overseas companies etc.) to help reduce the reliance on wage earners. Especially as a large part of our population moves towards retirement and not earning a wage DANE TATANA W001783 2 Apr 2018, 6:33 PM As a small business owner, we employ 25 staff. As with many of my peers in business ownership it’s really hard to get ahead with the tax rates as they are. It’s so demotivating to work really hard and then be taxed aggressively on it and have less tax breaks for a things like computers and vehicles than ever. Needs to change otherwise where’s the incentive to be entrepreneurial? BRENTON NORTHCOTT W001794 2 Apr 2018, 10:54 PM I would like to see multinational companies paying more tax in NZ, some of the amounts getting paid is just silly with the amount of revenue that they have earned off us is ridiculous... PETER MCDONALD W001806 3 Apr 2018, 10:44 AM Given the ever growing inequality in NZ, I would look to tax the rich and super rich more and give the middle class a break. If someone earns over $300,000 PA they can definitely afford to pay more. That would allow the middle class to have a tax break. I earn a decent amount of money but we struggle as a family. This month I have a $15000 tax bill to pay and it seems nearly everything I earn is going to IRD. Tax the rich and super rich more and give us a break please! NEIL HOGGARTH W001824 3 Apr 2018, 3:04 PM Charities Should not be tax exempt. This 'well meaning' loop-hole allows $billions of legitimate business to dodge tax almost entirely. My morning Weetbix is a tax free company. This is wrong. There are major roading/construction firms, (owned by Brethren's for example ) that pay no tax. This is wrong. Some of the biggest dairy farmers' to phrase it loosely, are tax exempt because of there religious affiliation. This is wrong. The Maori economy is strong & successful. Every member of it uses hospitals, schools, roads etc as well.To tax this would be fair in the context- 'NZ' should be thought of as a whanua for all. That means taxes cant be relevant only for some business & individuals but not others. Facebook/google or other multi national should pay tax here or a levee or fee' to operate- if they are to clever to catch with general taxation rules. There is also things such as monopoly & oligopoly.. takling these businesses would help the general public need less tax breaks.. SIMON WILLIAMS W001830 3 Apr 2018, 5:50 PM Briefly: 1. Some kind of capital gains tax on investment properties will raise revenue and reduce the influence of speculators on our housing market. However, because most rental owners have considered the ownership of a property or two as retirement savings, it would be counter-productive, long term, to penalise them for this. Solution: Have a scaled tax, based on number (or value) of properties owned... much like with income tax. 2. Charities and religions should NOT be exempt from taxation. Exemptions lead to loopholes, and loopholes are the domain of the shrewd and the disingenuous. Sanitarium, for example. However, don't tax donations. 3. Find some way of taxing those offshore corporates who are blatantly milking our economy. 4. Eliminate redundant and inefficient systems between departments. We pay beneficiaries and then tax that pay. How inefficient is that? 5. Many countries now have forms of transactions taxes to mitigate speculating. Let's explore that. WARREN HARRIS W001840 3 Apr 2018, 8:01 PM Things that should be taxed that are not taxed now - Purchases of goods or services at point of sale (to capture international transactions). This can be done via paypal or credit card companies. Capital gains on the gain in value of all transactions over 10k. Dont have exclusions. Collect tax at sale. Losses to be offset against other gains (beware of gifting). Keep it simple and make it easier to administer. Remove provisional tax. Use GST to preempt future terminal tax if necessary. If provisional tax is to stay at least set the use of money interest the same in each direction. "Its our job to be fair". DEBORAH WALL W001861 4 Apr 2018, 8:15 AM Not taxing internet business is ludicrous and has resulted in huge losses for small business and small commercial property investors. If gst was paid on all internet purchases and tax was taken from all companies that sold products to NZ then it would be a fairer playing field for all business. RICHARD CLARKE W001867 4 Apr 2018, 8:44 AM Companies based overseas must pay the same tax as everyone else. GST should never have been applied to food, power and rates (a tax on a tax). NOAH BUNKLEY W001877 4 Apr 2018, 12:25 PM Increase taxes on the highest income earners. New Zealand has one of the lowest tax rates on high income in the OECD. Countries such as Denmark have a tax rate of 55% and even the USA has a top tax rate of 46%. We should increase income taxes to allow for more public spending on schools, infrastructure and healthcare. Similarly we need a better capital gains tax to reduce investment in housing. Housing should not be a speculative investment market but rather a commodity for living. Increase capital gains to disincentivise investment in houses. Similar to Australia we should make healthy foods GST-free and increase taxes on unhealthy options, incentivising healthy living. A healthier population will be more productive, increasing GDP, and will save costs on healthcare. As a doctor the higher tax rates will disproportionately affect me but these increased taxes could be used to benefit society. With less income inequality comes greater social cohesiveness and a better country for all. DEVAN KESHA W001884 4 Apr 2018, 1:05 PM Income tax should be reduced significantly. The tax focus should be on what people choose to spend their income on. The test should be whether the good or service improves or reduces the greater good. An example is healthy food makes people healthier therefore no tax, cars make people unhealthier therefore more tax. ANONYMOUS W001892 4 Apr 2018, 2:14 PM I agree with WInston's idea of GST off fruits and veggies and I think GST on essential clothing items can get too much at times. I like that we do not tax grieving people like some other countries do. There should be even more tax on alcohol and cigarettes those things just cause illness and misery. But the companies producing those things should be taxed higher as well not just the victims ingesting those poisons. VOMLE SPRINGFORD W001898 4 Apr 2018, 3:22 PM I believe NZ should have a capital gains tax on things like bach rentals, investment properties, passive income earners. I also think overseas businesses that make money off New Zealanders need to pay tax. DAN YOUNG W001912 4 Apr 2018, 6:22 PM Lower tax LEE HARRISON W001925 4 Apr 2018, 7:05 PM I think tax or GST should be lowered on essential food items such as fresh vegetables, meat and staples such as baked beans etc and this reduction could be off set with an increase on tax or GST on alcohol, tobacco and gambling income including pokies, lotto and scratchies. Taxing capital gains on investment properties on an annualised basis will only result in an increase in rent paid by the tenants. I know many landlords who will put up rents to compensate adn I will be doing so too. The only way it can work is with a capital gains tax on realised gains at sale time, the same as any other investment. MAUREEN SHARP W001943 5 Apr 2018, 6:56 AM I strongly feel gst should not be on food thanks DENNY BOOTHE W001966 5 Apr 2018, 6:00 PM Tax should be a system benefitting all society through redistributing income to those who need it the most - those who spend most of their income to live on. So Remove GST on all but luxury items. Introduce transaction tax to tax the very rich. No capital gains tax on first or even second home, but have a CGT on multiple investment properties, overseas investors(like a special stamp duty?) and any property bought for speculative purpose, (because speculation drives up prices). Capital gains tax on investments should be tiered so that those on low incomes eg retirees dependent on investments/savings interest don't have their income eroded. Provisional tax system in NZ is invidious - tax is paid in advance of earning and is very discouraging punishing to someone on a low income from investment who is not on PAYE. GARTH BARLEY W001972 5 Apr 2018, 8:29 PM The only thing I feel very "iffy" on is not taxing external companies. I understand our situation as being off to the side of things, and not really having anything unique or rare to offer to the world beyond our identities and cultures, but I am more worried about the consequences of trying to be apart of "the bigger picture", especially with how international relations are going. I'm concerned that we're inviting corporations with obligations to other countries and companies that we don't want to be involved with. It is hard enough to be aware and conscientious within the economy without concerning yourself with whether you're funding (at least in a small part) wars/genocides, military expansion, ecologically damaging projects, and anything else that is in that grey zone of technically not illegal but if we were 100% informed we would disavow in a heartbeat. HANK (HENDRIK) OPTLAND W001983 6 Apr 2018, 1:23 AM I believe that the things we tax are correct but I would like the relative emphases to change. For instance, middle income earners are taxed at the highest rate of 33% for the last few dollars they earn. GST is 15% and I think that this should change at the rate of three consecutive increases from 15.0% to 18.0%. Income taxes should drop simultaneously to keep the middle income earners out of the highest tax bracket. Beneficiaries' payments must increase accordingly to compensate. At present, there are few exemptions from the GST net. One extra thing that should be made exempt are local government rates (or tax) because it is essentially a tax on a tax. This would be a politically palatable package. A greater reliance on GST and a smaller reliance on income tax is that this would tax international tourist's spending without affecting wage earners; they spend $12 billion per annum. Increasing the GST captures some of this for everyone's benefit. No other taxes should be introduced! NADINE SEIDEL W002010 6 Apr 2018, 4:06 PM Overseas companies and businesses that don't have a base in New Zealand should be taxed at least as much as NZ companies (which don't pay enough tax in my opinion). NZ should not allow international companies to "profit share"And therefore spread their income to pay as little tax as possible. It makes me angry when I hear one of the richest companies in the world like Apple paid less tax than me personally! CAMERON BATES W002029 7 Apr 2018, 9:43 AM We have got most things right. Only thing that could be better is user pays. If you want rail from the city to the airport get the people who use it to pay for it. I use the toll roads and am happy to pay but I don’t want to pay fuel tax and the toll we already pay lots of fuel tax. I want the big roads they are awesome and will save many lives. (Remember how many white crosses were Mercer to te kauwhata there use to be) Tobacco tax is prob responsible for 40% of the decline rest would be public perception and heath. Don’t go with sugar tax it won’t work. What about as part of working for family’s and benefits there is a food bag with lots of heathy food. Buy in bulk save money. I know it would come with headaches would also create jobs. Call in kiwi food. But most of all keep building stuff it is cheaper today than it is in 5 years. STEFAN ROMIC W002051 7 Apr 2018, 3:12 PM Capital gains and inheritance should be taxed at much higher rates while regressive taxation (such as GST) should be decreased. KERRY JONES W002057 7 Apr 2018, 4:03 PM The GST on fresh fruit and vegetables should be removed, they manage to have this system overseas so there is no reason why it cannot be done here. Tourists should not be able to claim the GST back on purchases they make here. In order to make houses cheaper the rate of GST on building products should be reduced or the purchaser given a tax credit. LIAM SULLIVAN W002066 7 Apr 2018, 5:33 PM i think we should tax charity's that have business W002072 7 Apr 2018, 6:35 PM The profits of overseas companies should most definitely be taxable in NZ even if they have no NZ base if they are conducting business and trades in NZ. There should also \[1\] be taxes for things such as art and fine wine. Capital gains tax is also necessary. Churches should pay tax. People who are not in NZ should pay extra tax on property. Increase tax for higher wage earners. Please stop taxing sanitary items. BRIAN TAYLOR W002078 7 Apr 2018, 7:58 PM Taxation in NZ is a travesty. There is no justice in current tax law or application. The National Govt (aka Key) campaigned prior to the 2008 election that it would reduce income tax if elected. On winning the election, it did too, though principally to the advantage of the well to do, while it never heralded it was going to increase GST from 12.5% to 15% at the same time. The free lunch given Iwi in respect to their tax-free business empires is ethically and morally wrong and totally inconsistent in fairness to other taxpayers. Tax-havens need to be abolished. JK was not keen to address that issue, one wonders whether he had reason to avoid the matter. Tax breaks on rental properties need to be abolished. Not sure about capital gains tax though - Governments are instrumental in creating inflation so I don't think it fair that the man in the street has to pay for governmental short-term politicking excesses rather than their setting a long term agenda. THOMAS BURTON W002098 8 Apr 2018, 10:34 AM We should tax single use plastic to producers/businesses who use it for their products. We should subsidies organic food, biodegradable packaging materials (assuming we develop the capacity to break it down properly). We should tax refined sugar as heavily as cigarettes. We should tax anything with microbeads in it heavily. GRANT FARRELL W002122 8 Apr 2018, 4:26 PM We should have Wealth Tax as our predominant source of Tax. JAREK W002126 8 Apr 2018, 6:17 PM Profits on real estate transactions really need to be taxed MICHAEL RADLEY W002129 8 Apr 2018, 9:33 PM 1. income tax. Currently heavy machinery is human controlled and income tax is collected on his work. If his machine is now controlled by a computer (ie autonomous) , there is no income tax or equivalent tax. So as more workers are replaced with GPS, robotic autonomous machines, why isn't this WORK being taxed. If you are going to tax human input, why isn't robotic input taxed. Further. Repairs to the robot are deductible expenses, whereas human health costs/ injuries are not. Income tax should be scrapped and replaced with a production tax. 2. Heaping more and more taxes on property owners through council rates is wrong. Every body who lives in Auckland should be billed directly for services that they use. There should not be GST on council taxes. SUSAN PRYOR W002140 9 Apr 2018, 9:39 AM It seems too easy for big business and wealthy family's with trusts to hide income from being taxed. Can we make this fairer and ensure that all income generated in NZ is taxed appropriately regardless of other offsets or if it is difficult to draw a line between the income and an individual or business. LUKE SCHNEIDER W002147 9 Apr 2018, 11:14 AM Government serves the interests of the people. No taxation without representation. That means corporations should not be taxed since that is just passed on to consumers and they can't vote. In exchange for no taxation, which will attract more investment and growth, corporations can't contribute to election campaigns or provide separate political ads. Similarly, sales tax and fixed assets should not be taxed. Income of all NZ sources is taxed at the same uniform rate above a poverty line. AMRISH KHANOLKAR W002156 9 Apr 2018, 12:50 PM Maybe consider bringing in some taxes to reduce land banking. Also consider additional taxes for the super rich. Need to be careful at this as you do not want to totally disincentivise and punish capitalism thereby discouraging investment, entrepreneurship, and productivity improvement. There should be no capital gains tax on new houses sold within the bright line test, as do not want to discourage investment going into building houses. Maybe consider capital gains tax on people buying and selling more than one existing house or land in a financial year regardless of the bright line time period, as this indicates they are running a business out of it. However people who are selling one house and buying another should not be taxed, as this would lead to equity erosion - people shouldn't be taxed to change houses, they should be taxed only if they are running a business out of it. CATHERINE JOULE W002159 9 Apr 2018, 12:58 PM I don't believe tampons or pads should be taxed - or should have a lower tax applied as these are necessary. JAMES SANDALL W002164 9 Apr 2018, 3:01 PM Would like to see a tax on unhealthy food and sugar tax on drinks. This can then be used to make healthy options more affordable. MURRAY ELLIOTT W002171 9 Apr 2018, 4:22 PM I believe that there is Overtaxing of the Very Low Income earners, and can not understand why some very high Income earners pay very little if any tax at all. There has to be some accountability and equality. Inequality can push people in to using cash to avoid taxes, which in it's self is counterproductive for Government. JASON ARCHER W002184 9 Apr 2018, 8:01 PM I support the introduction of capital gains tax for business assets, including investment properties. Owner occupied residences should be excluded from capital gains. A higher tax free threshold for income tax would be a fair mechanism to assist low income earners. RYAN BENSBERG W002191 9 Apr 2018, 9:56 PM As a New Zealand citizen, i believe that the government of New Zealand has a right to tax, and i quote "BUSINESSES WITH NO NEW ZEALAND BASE". The taxes collected would add to the treasury allowing the New Zealand to spend the extra income on essential utilities, feeding the money into our economy. MARGARET WALKER W002202 10 Apr 2018, 6:54 AM The tax of 17.5% taken from interest on Term Deposit is unfair as this is a tax on money which has already been taxed. This is making many older people, who were brought up to save for their "old age" the new poor. We have paid tax, P.A.Y.E for many years and saved what we could so that our retirement years would be reasonably comfortable. To be taxed twice is far from equitable as we are aware of the number of tax evaders who feel they are entitled to dodge paying their fair share. To add insult to injury, those of my age (82) who support Voluntary Euthanasia, are forced to stay alive due to the insensitivity of the successive Governments. We face constant medical bills, constant pain and a lack of respect for many politicians. Why are they allowed, by a so-called conscience vote, to dictate that we cannot be relieved of our suffering - and save the country some money re hospitals and ambulance service? I would appreciate your comments. Margaret Walker. TIMOTHEUS FRANK W002208 10 Apr 2018, 8:47 AM A land tax should not be introduced. I find it offensive to regard land as primarily an economic asset. Land is kept for many more reasons. If a land tax is introduced, there need to be many exemptions, for example for land that is set apart for conservation (even on private land), for land that is sustainably managed, for land kept for heritage purposes, for charitable purposes, for land for recreational purposes. CGT should be considered, but it needs to be carefully applied, so that someone whose house increased in value does not need to sell it, just to pay the taxes. The speculative economy needs to be taxed more, including currency trading. Charities should continue to be tax exempt. Charities need to be able to advocate for particular worldviews, so that organisations like Greenpeace can do their work and charities are not scared to speak out. Environmental taxes, such as taxes on carbon emissions, on water takes etc. also need to be considered. ANONYMOUS W002223 10 Apr 2018, 10:10 AM I think tax should be increased on items that are harmful e.g. anything relating to smoking. Don't just tax the cigarettes, put a very high tax on the licence to sell cigarettes. Also Increase tax on alcohol and increase the tax on the licence to sell alcohol. Excess of the above two examples has been shown to kill, therefore, in my opinon, whilst there isn't a tax high enough to eradicate the above perhaps it will reduce it. IAN ROBERTS W002226 10 Apr 2018, 10:21 AM The concept of taking GST off "healthy food" is flawed and shouldn't be considered on the basis that defining what foods get exemption and what don't would be a logistical nightmare. It may be easy with one or two items, but who defines what eg bacon> Considered by some as "unhealthy"...- chicken.eg. assuming that a raw chook is "healthy", and presumably take-away KFC chicken isn't, but what about coated crumbed and spiced chicken pieces bought at a supermarket? If a farmer/grower can claim GST on their production costs and that claim system works through, transport, storage and to the retailer, then how does exempting a product at point of sale get allowed? Who would track it and how would probably cost more that just leaving the system as it is. It's a sounds great idea, but logically is pretty impracticable. JOHN CARTER W002241 10 Apr 2018, 11:00 AM Business including farms that increase in value. Farming and horticulture charged for taxpayer funded irrigation,water and to ratepayers for flood,pumping stations like the hauraki plains. Ratepayers pay towards those systems and farm values go up massively. Tourists taxed for using facilities like national parks etc. SIOBHAN MULLINS W002245 10 Apr 2018, 11:05 AM Overseas companies operating in New Zealand should be taxed. Basic food items should be exempt from GST. JEN WATT W002253 10 Apr 2018, 11:28 AM I think NZ does tax the right things on the whole. One area which I do have reservations about is the proposal to add GST on items bought online from overseas, and digital tax on audio/video. I buy a lot of items online from overseas, for the simple reason that those products aren't available for sale in NZ. If GST were added to these purchases, I'd still buy them (because they won't magically be available for sale locally!), but I'd end up paying more and so would have less discretionary income to spend locally. So local businesses will miss out. I bet a lot of NZers are like me in this respect. We're a tiny country, so we don't have the widest range of goods available for sale. That's just the reality. Let's not penalise consumers and businesses alike because of it. DENNIS SOSNOSKI W002268 10 Apr 2018, 12:11 PM The idea of a tax on property transactions is good, and a higher rate should be applied on sales to non-residents (when allowed). Businesses should absolutely be taxed regardless of who owns them. If a charity wants to run a business they should do so on equal terms with regular business owners. The only exception might be for charities running retail sales stores for donated goods. Taxing of large overseas companies doing business in New Zealand is absolutely needed. Taxing just their profits isn't going to work, because multinationals use a wide range of strategies to hide their profits and/or make them appear in jurisdictions with little or no tax. Instead there should be a tax on sales, at a presumed rate of profit set by the government. To make this reasonable it should only apply to companies doing at least some minimum level of business in New Zealand (say $10M). TERRY HALL W002278 10 Apr 2018, 12:39 PM Of course we are not taxing the right things. Why tax people who work ? Why tax people who provide the jobs to start with ? Why not just tax us, ALL, as, and if, and when we spend. NO INCOME TAX AVOIDANCE, POSSIBLE !!! OR REQUIRED. CAROL SUMNER W002292 10 Apr 2018, 1:06 PM Businesses operating in NZ or with accounts in NZ must be taxed, even businesses that aren't based in NZ but sell products here should be taxed. Religious organisations should also be taxed which would also contribute a lot to the community. Health food (fresh produce), and health services (specialists, doctors, nurses, natural health providers) should not be taxed. NIKKY PARLEY W002297 10 Apr 2018, 1:14 PM Overuse of GST on essentials. Currently people to use their taxed earnings to pay another 15% on essential goods and services. In my mind this means that I am actually paying 48% tax (33% +15%). I support a degree well thought out, dedicated taxing going for example to healthcare, police, education, infrastructure (roads, sewage plants, water treatment plants, ...), conservation, rather than it being allocated only from an amorphous pot. Support a visitor tax that goes to DoC for use nationally. PETER HENSON W002320 10 Apr 2018, 2:04 PM Take GST off fresh vegetables; salad items, fruit, fish and meats. This should promote healthier eating and help those at the bottom end of the wage bracket. Place a capital gains tax on all investment properties, except the main family home. ALAN MATTEUCCI W002324 10 Apr 2018, 2:15 PM - Churches should be taxed. - Iwi or Maori organisations should be taxed. - Charitable organisations should be taxed. - There should be no exemptions from a tax regime. eg: - Iwi now is a multi-billion dollar business and should contribute to NZ. - churches are capable of raising their own funds, and should contribute to the tax pool. - charitable organisations do not need tax breaks, eg Kellogs or other big organisations don't pay tax? NOT fair. RICHARD BROWN W002333 10 Apr 2018, 2:28 PM As soon as you start to widen your tax need you waste government, individuals and business money on compliance. If anything, make the gathering and compliance simpler. Avoid confusion, avoid taxing for the sake of it without having a clue what it costs to get that money in, which is a major failing any government who wants to increase taxes falls into. Drop income and business tax to zero and increase GST to 20%. All income gets spent at some stage and with GST there are fewer collection points, making it easier to Police, and everyone pays. Make taxation simpler, NOT more complex. ERWIN WEE W002346 10 Apr 2018, 3:19 PM The impact of technology will make the current taxation inefficient. Taxing on wages in the future when the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics is realized will make an unbalanced taxation system. The government must develop a productivity index and base its taxation on the productivity index. If an industry is fully automated and multiplies its productivity by 1000% then it is rightly that that productivity is taxed in this way multinationals cannot use a double dutch sandwich technique to offset cost and pay minimal tax as its productivity index is high. ANGELA BERRY W002351 10 Apr 2018, 3:30 PM I think we should be taxing large overseas companies operating in NZ. Companies that give nothing back to NZ and companies that have Charity status. I would hate for a wealth tax on land and assets. If we are not able to have a pension when we are older then we should be able to amass funds to support us. We work hard and take risks, we should not be penalised for it. I think that people with multiple rental properties should be taxed or not allowed carry forward losses, as should airbnb rentals. Hotels cant compete against these if they don't pay tax. Lots of people have had an increase in the value of their property. This doesn't mean that their cash flow has increased. Rates are a huge burden and a large amount of money to find for pensioners that have been in their houses for years. I think that it is wrong if another tax is applied on the value of the house. Many people would not be able to afford to live in their property. ISOBELLE GOSLING W002358 10 Apr 2018, 3:39 PM Introduce a tax free threshold and we know GST is a deterrent for some lower income people to eat well - hence no GST on fruit and vegetables and reduced GST on items that have a healthy heart tick to encourage enhanced food choices GREG XAVIER W002367 10 Apr 2018, 4:31 PM I'm mostly ignorant on what we do and do not tax, but based on the information on your fact sheet I feel we need to make some adjustments. The profitability of real estate has contributed to a housing economy that vastly favours the 'haves' over the 'have-nots'. Everyone deserves a family home for their family. Property owned beyond the 'family home' (I'm not sure how to define that) should attract a capital gains tax. Likewise selling a business for a profit should be taxed. I don't know enough about payroll tax to form an opinion. Charities that run for profit business should have that business taxed in the same way any business is taxed. Sanitarium is a perfect example. I'm not sure how to effectively tax stuff we own so wont forward an opinion on that. Businesses with no base in NZ should absolutely be taxed. Steam (online gaming distribution platform) applies GST to purchases but more needs to be done. Companies like Apple benefit from local infrastructure and should pay for that. GEOFFREY HINDS W002389 10 Apr 2018, 7:59 PM I would favour taxing charities that own businesses but only on the income derived from that business. I would ensure that all investments are taxed including long-term COLIN TREVELYAN W002397 10 Apr 2018, 10:47 PM Increase GST also all lotto winnings should be taxed at least by 30 percent .Auckland and Wellington should also tax all vehicles entering the city ,,same as Singapore does . A bed tax or daily tax should be charged on all visitors entering Nz not using Nz passport . AMOL TELANG W002400 11 Apr 2018, 5:00 AM Reduce tax for locals and start charging the foreign investors or investors who do not stay in this country for more than 9 months of a year. Tax the foreign companies with no base in New Zealand. Stop taxing the small property investors with less than 3 properties as they have worked hard for their families future which will remove investment options for small families. Stop taxing healthy fresh produce and food as this will help with reducing obesity in this country. Tax the charities who have businesses like other businesses. Promote green energy by providing tax benefits on solar power or electric cars. ELDON BENNETT W002403 11 Apr 2018, 7:32 AM Money is wasted left right and centre, I am a tradie I work hard for a living and I don’t want see the money we are putting in go the wrong places, for starters the hand outs for winz is being exploted big time , any money being made by overseas investors from our land needs to be taxed. MARIANNE BISHOP W002409 11 Apr 2018, 10:21 AM I do not think we should be paying G.S.T on certain things such as fresh vegetables, milk, bread and fresh meat. People on low income's struggle to buy some of these items due to their low wages. Lets make them a little more affordable so everyone can buy them. RICHARD BURGESS W002412 11 Apr 2018, 11:16 AM It is about time company's, churches, large corporates, overseas traders working in our country all paid there fair chunk of tax. Middle income workers are getting taxed for too much, while the rich just get richer. Time to make tax a lot fairer. Close the loop holes on creative accounting. ROBERT W002414 11 Apr 2018, 11:27 AM The 30c to the dollar tax is creating a working poor. More emphasis needs to be made on taxes on investments including the family home. In Australia they call it a stamp duty tax but this still falls short of the mark - tax based on the equity of the investment is a fair and balanced way to ensure that all investments are taxed appropriately and so the poverty gap does not continue to grow. The middle class currently pay for both sides of the poverty line and this needs to stop. ANONYMOUS W002422 11 Apr 2018, 12:33 PM Passive investments like Housing and land ,because we have a weak capital gains tax ,do not , in most cases ,create wealth or jobs ,just the opposite applies , the glaring example is the housing market where houses ,except for some, is not a starter for young ,and not so young individuals. RHYS TISSOTT W002435 11 Apr 2018, 1:42 PM I work 6 days a week 11 hours per day and have to be drug and alcohol free so I can unvoluntarily have money taken off me to go to tax. Why should scumbags who are on the dole who spend there money on drugs and alcohol not have to do drug and alcohol testing. Single mums out there that don’t do anything have flash houses and more money than people who work long and hard because the government gives it to them. If they can’t afford a kid, get desexed or aborted. DAVID ALLARD W002437 11 Apr 2018, 1:43 PM In my opinion our current tax system is satisfactory. What s needed is more focus by the IRD on those activities which should attract capital gains tax but are often not collected. PETER MULLEN W002441 11 Apr 2018, 1:56 PM We have some of the highest food prices in the OECD, remove GST on food. While politically unpopular following 30 plus years of good times for some, tax loopholes on property need to be closed. In short a phased introduction to capital gains tax on all properties needs to be implemented - helping make investment in R&D and Business more attractive and taking speculation out of the housing market. Introduce a compulsory national savings scheme. PAUL CALLISTER W002449 11 Apr 2018, 2:34 PM I would like to see a tax on carbon. I would also like to see a visitor tax levied on all non-NZ passport holders arriving in NZ. As someone heavily involved in volunteer work in the conservation area daily I see overseas visitors enjoying the NZ landscape and associated facilities (such as walking tracks like the Paekakariki escarpment track) without directly contributing to the protection and upkeep of these areas/facilities. JAMES BUFFET W002457 11 Apr 2018, 4:35 PM I feel like we tax Margarita's too much, but we still don't tax churches that make their pastors millionaires. Come on guys, let's all get on island time! CRAIG SMITH W002460 11 Apr 2018, 4:57 PM We need to be lowering GST on essential goods, raising GST in luxury goods. We need a comprehensive CGT and we definitely need higher tax brackets : my suggestions are 39% over $150k and 45% over $300k We need to invest as a country in opportunity eg education health and infrastructure if we are to break the poverty cycle. Best quote “ those who pay more tax, should be thankful that they can!” JOSH HIGGIE W002469 11 Apr 2018, 5:47 PM Hi, One point I wanted to raise was looking at tax around people who are paying off a student loan. I understand there is a special tax code for those with a student loan where this may already apply. I would like to see if you would look at decreasing the income tax for those who are paying off a student loan as combined, the two make up a fair chunk of each pay. ANONYMOUS W002471 11 Apr 2018, 6:03 PM We should tax charities - why can religious organisations operate like a business but pay no tax? Other than that I agree with how we tax everything. BRETT ANDERSON W002475 11 Apr 2018, 6:55 PM I believe we need to do better at taxing overseas-based companies operating in NZ, as well as preventing the continued use of offshore tax havens by multinationals, trusts and, individuals seeking to avoid tax. Tax needs to be focused on capturing more from corporate profits and less from everyday working people. Tax should also be used more specifically to incentivise environmentally, socially and economically beneficial activities and used to disincentivise environmentally, socially and economically destructive activities. ANDRE HULSE W002487 11 Apr 2018, 8:32 PM Taxing the "richer" does not mean people who make 100,000 a year. To take away 33% of gross income, before property tax, sales tax... We are not the richer, we are the new working class. We should be prosperous if you want to attract qualified, expert working force. Not taxing foreign companies for their profits is gross. Gross. We left an era when we needed their business to the time where we have more to offer. We have good people (see above) and a good environment. They don't need tax breaks. Taxing property value gains is also bad. Imagine I buy an apartment for 100 and sell it for 300. I have to pay tax. But if I want to buy another apartment of the same size, it costs 300 so I gained nothing. Think about taxing people who trade more than one property per year. Then its a business not property. Finally, I can't believe how lucky I am to be able to just leave NZ with any money that I am eventually able to make. Tax all money that leaves NZ, profits should be encouraged to stay. JUSTIN MUSCHAMP W002494 11 Apr 2018, 9:53 PM Keep gst on food but have a tax threshold so low incomes get a tax break so the basics in life are then effectively gst free. This would be easier and cheaper to administer than having the basics of life gst exempt. ANTHONY BREESE W002505 12 Apr 2018, 6:08 AM NZ has an unfair tax system which burdens the lower/middle class with a vast amount of tax. They can’t hide their money or dodge tax like the wealthy while on PAYE. New income taxes are needed on very high top brackets, such as $150,000-$299,000 @ 39% and $300,000+ at 45%. While giving everyone a tax cut of making the first $25,000 tax free. Cut secondary tax as the poor are the ones who usually need second jobs. Get rid of GST (and income tax altogether, as the numbers line up) and introduce a Transaction Tax on all transactions. This could stop confusing taxes and just have a tax on pay as you go. But that will never happen as the government will have to slash jobs at the IRD, a govt entity who always create work for the sake of creating work. SUE GREEN W002510 12 Apr 2018, 7:15 AM gst removed from food and toiletries medicines doctors/dentists visits bus fares and other items that make up the basics for poorer NZ AND doubled (or more) on eating out, luxury items such as expensive cars and furniture ,electronic gadgets Paye lowered or scrapped on minimum wage to "living wage" and the deficit shared fairly across the other tax brackets a tax on any property whether on sale or on a yearly basis including family homes if this would help those without homes to get one To increase the supply of rental property reduce/remove the tax payable on income from rental properties as an incentive to landlords to continue in what is a problematic venture To improve the roads I would make all state highways toll roads with remission for freight companies and/or road user charges on all vehicles not just diesel and remissions for freight companies tax equivalent to acc for treatment /income equity between accidental or poor health infirmity Sugar tax on producers Thanks ALAN STEEL W002516 12 Apr 2018, 7:51 AM Free education for uni is supposed to be an investment just like a house either work and save up or borrow ADAM WINTER W002519 12 Apr 2018, 8:25 AM I believe our high international rate of GST is a great income stream from our international visitors. NZ has become a destination for wealthy tourists, super yacht owners and their crews who spend large amounts of money on boats, restaurants, cruise ship charters, back packers, skiers, thrill seekers, fishing tours, etc. These dollars and the GST they attract are so valuable to all of us. Why would you change this. We pay a lot of income tax already. The more money in our pockets the more we all spend. You can’t keep taking from NZers when your public service businesses are running inefficiently. Please spend more time on looking at saving money rather than spending more. Trimming your overheads is your best opportunity to turn a profit. MIKE ROBERTS W002527 12 Apr 2018, 9:58 AM Remove GST on fresh food. It really isn't too hard- the UK manages it fine, just lift their legislation as NZ does with so much other law. This will immediately help with many health issues and alleviate some of the pressure on the health services, so may be tax neutral. Also remove any tax on tax, e.g. GST in Rates. This is totally iniquitous. PAUL JACKSON W002541 12 Apr 2018, 1:58 PM I would like to see overseas companies pay tax on their NZ earnings. I would like to see tourists pay a boarder tax to cover their impact and provide more facilities for them. EWEN CAMERON W002546 12 Apr 2018, 2:25 PM GST Zero gst on fruit and vegetables, sanitary towels, electric cars and solar panels and higher gst on inefficient cars, sugary drinks alcohol, cigarettes, high plastic content foods. CGT Tax the capital appreciation on investment properties or/and stamp duty. Income tax Zero tax band to $10k 10% 10-25 25% 25-50 30% 50-75 35% 75-150 40% above 150 need to model the numbers ANONYMOUS W002555 12 Apr 2018, 2:56 PM We need a major overhaul with more taxes on property investment to correct the balance of investment from unproductive assets to productive assets. Financial transactions should also be taxed E V W002567 12 Apr 2018, 3:27 PM A lower tax should be imposed on fruits and vegetables and higher on foods/drinks that can lead to greater health problems in the future. PATRICIA JACK W002569 12 Apr 2018, 3:32 PM I do think we should tax sugar drinks and I don't think we should be taxing fresh food as so many NZ'ers are struggling to make ends meet and are having to eat fast food as fresh food is quite expensive. I also think that they should teach cooking real food in schools so the next generation know how to look after themselves. We seem to have lost those essential life skills. ANONYMOUS W002576 12 Apr 2018, 3:50 PM We should tax things that we want to discourage like environmental destruction , obesity i e sugar tax. Regressional taxes are terrible like GST and fuel taxes. Not the things we want to encourage like earning an income , healthy food, environmentally friendly products like electric vehicles , solar etc SHELLEY GILMAN W002583 12 Apr 2018, 4:32 PM We have been too careful not to offend the MN companies that operate under various trade agreements in NZ. This is a huge concern, and the amount of lobbying that goes on in order to block taxation and other changes that may affect them is disgraceful. GARETH HUTTON W002596 12 Apr 2018, 5:27 PM The tax burden is not spread in the correct manner the tax burden is too weak on the top earners and those with large scale investment whilst those making between 50 and 80k feel ripped off such as myself JOYCE SHOTBOLT W002604 12 Apr 2018, 6:10 PM I Don't think it would be fair to tax capital gains on property (except in the case of traders) unless that also applies to other businesses eg when someone sells a business or shares etc. Maybe if the owner was an overseas resident that would be ok. It would be unwise to discourage local people from investing in property here because we already have an extreme shortage of rental accommodation. It seems that somehow overseas owned-companies should be made to pay tax. For example I have been aware that it is common practice that such companies which sell goods in NZ just put up the costs of goods they import so that on paper they don't make a profit here so don't pay NZ tax. A percentage of their sales in NZ should be considered profit and taxed accordingly. Similarly there needs to be a way to tax on-line purchases from overseas because its unfair on our local traders that they pay tax but their competitors do not. NICK MUIR W002606 12 Apr 2018, 6:35 PM We should be taxing capital and in particular the way in which we tax equities needs to be improved. The current “intentions” rule is hopeless and far too easy to cheat. Meanwhile the FIF regime which was supposed to make it easier for people to invest in offshore shares is so complicated that it has achieved the exact opposite. Many people who do invest in foreign companies simply try to stay under IRDs radar for this reason. This whole area needs a complete overhaul to make it simpler, more consistent and fairer. CAM MACINTYRE W002614 12 Apr 2018, 7:29 PM Currently you receive about $1.3 billion from tobacco tax. Health related issues and other associated costs do not amount to this figure. Tax on alcohol is only millions. Yet the associated costs for alcohol, policing, harm, health. Cost way more. You should tax alcohol through the roof. Make it expensive to drink to excess. DOUG THOMSON W002620 12 Apr 2018, 8:19 PM Income should be taxed at a much lower rate. We need a wealth tax to stop a disproportionate amount of taxation from falling on the lower and middle classes. Most of all we need a government with balls. A government that cares more about the country and fairness than it does about popularity and power. People who will stand up and do the right thing. Speak to Gareth Morgan for half an hour instead of wasting more taxpayer money. Put your prejudices aside, forget about his hair lip and cats, he’s not popular but he knows what he’s talking about. Do the right thing for my children! ANONYMOUS W002626 12 Apr 2018, 8:32 PM Taxes on income from labour are too high. Tax on capital is almost non existent. Taxes on externalities like pollution are insufficient or non existent. Introduce land, capital, carbon and sugar taxes. Use those revenues to reduce income taxes starting with the lowest tax brackets which every wage earner pays. Tax cut for almost everyone. HAMISH PETERS W002628 12 Apr 2018, 8:38 PM We need to start taxing property with the exception of the family home. Tax non citizens who both buy (at purchase) and sell land in nz. Tax businesses that trade in nz but don't have a presence here. PETER BONE W002630 12 Apr 2018, 8:44 PM We are a nation of small business owners. It is essential that we minimise complication. LARA HODGSON W002633 12 Apr 2018, 8:53 PM Taxation should be viewed both as a revenue collection to fuel the state and as a system of behavioural economics; nudge theory. Whilst the overall funds gained through taxation are important, there are significant positive externalities for society to be gained if we look at tax as a mechanism for creating positive behaviour on an individual level. The current system is outdated. Income tax should be structured to encourage what our state values; entrepreneurship and hard work. The current format encourages mediocracay and state reliance. The same is true for our corporate tax rate; corporations are our employers, and the more they are taxed the worse it is for those on minimum wage as they are the first to be fired when profits need to be maximised. We also place a focus on taxing demerit goods rather than subsidising merit goods, cigarettes are significantly over taxed - A tax on fast food & sugar would be a major step in the right direction. B HOPKINS W002637 12 Apr 2018, 9:19 PM I would like to see foreign own business paying their fair share of tax on profits leaving this country. Private business that dodge tax through loop holes, eg small business declaring small profits by buy new car for the wife calling it a work vehicle, small salaries being paid to wife and children to hide profits. I know of a business that employes 40 staff and they all have company vehicles, company cellphones, fuel cards etc etc for personal use. His wife is the H&S adviser driving around in 100k car and going to university, she does zero work for the business . Have you noticed the amount company vehicles on the roads these days, everyone has one CORY MURRAY W002644 12 Apr 2018, 10:40 PM I believe at the moment we are taxing the right things. However a capital gains tax would also be appropriate to ensure tax is fair and equal between homeowner and non- homeowners. What I mean by this, is that if people invest in properties, they should be taxed; like tax on term deposits. Also, I believe there needs to be a reconsideration on income tax. I suggest that we consider removing tax on low income earning - such as under $15,000. I would also suggest and increase in tax brackets to extend 33% on over $70,000. I believe the current tax system unfairly discriminates again middle to low income earners as people who earn high wages are taxed at the same rate when they could afford more. A suggestion would be to match other European countries, or even Australia and raise the top tax rate to around 50% to 60% for incomes around 200,000- 300,000. JEFF RAY W002654 13 Apr 2018, 6:53 AM Most important is we should not tax staple food items. I'm a single income family of 5 and our food bill is nearly$200/wk! This could be reduced by $30/would very easily. Also, I come from a country with capital gains tax and unfortunately it's setup to tax the family home as well as investment properties. Please avoid this as it's pretty useless. W002661 13 Apr 2018, 9:00 AM The maximum rate tax rate kicks in at too low an income, and every dollar of income is taxed, there should be a tax-free threshold. There are an increasing number of middle class working poor. There are a number of 'charities' that aren't taxed. They should be. Its not fair for religious groups or ngai tahu or other similar entities to be given tax breaks, effectively meaning that they have an advantage over other nz businesses. (please withhold my name from this submission - you may use intitals only or my first name only) TAHER MOHAMMED W002667 13 Apr 2018, 10:19 AM New Zealand should not differentiate between the class of assets. A Broadbase Capital Gains Tax is the solutions to all the bright line/shady line/grey line tests on all the properties with exemption to owner occupied house, but not a farm. OLIVER ASHBY W002674 13 Apr 2018, 11:21 AM Keep it simple guys. Complex stuff like banding, exemptions for companies undergoing certain activities etc will end up turning your tax code into a mess. Just look at the UK and US. If anything you should continue to maintain one of the fairest and simplest tax systems I've encountered. I do find it frustrating how expensive import duty can be. EMMA BRODIE W002679 13 Apr 2018, 12:32 PM 1) I think we should tax over seas company's that operate out of NZ, while they produce jobs the profits ( majority) go overseas while they use our land, resources and our NZ clean reputation 2) I don't think we should tax property sales, art , etc but I do think we should remove the tax on healthy food, fruit, vegs etc not sure how you would do this but especially for children, aged and ill. 3) taxing charities that are actually have profits going to the people they support fine low or no tax but companies or churches, should pay tax. \* ( destiny church etc,) KANA BORDER W002684 13 Apr 2018, 2:17 PM Everything is taxed these days, except for the loop holes that big businesses can exploit. If these were tightened up we wouldn't have to pay as much personal tax, or even GST. Stop our beautiful country from being a tax haven. Also, I believe that a capital gains tax on investment property sale is nescisary to facilitate better housing prices, and rental rates. \[1\] RICHARD MEDRI W002691 13 Apr 2018, 3:43 PM I believe that we need to adjust our income tax brackets (more like Australia) and that we should not tax necessities like groceries. FEN MOY W002700 13 Apr 2018, 4:37 PM There should be an income threshold which is tax free - this will benefit people who are low income earners. GST should be removed on unprocessed fruit & vegetables, eggs, meat & fish. This will help reduce the cost of healthy foods and encourage people to buy fresh. Capital gains tax should be reviewed and probably introduced, for property and other items which have gained in value ( collectibles). There should be a higher tax on smoking and alcohol - and that tax re-injected into healthcare - there is significant morbidity with the use of these products which ends up costing in health. Trust laws should be reviewed and taxes be introduced when a threshold value is reached - some businesses operate as trusts and avoid paying taxes that way. Charities should not be taxed, provided there is good governance of what constitutes a charity. ANONYMOUS W002704 13 Apr 2018, 4:55 PM Tax is hitting the people who need the money the most, families are suffering and I think if you are a couple and have low paying jobs, your incomes should be combined and taxed as one. KELLY BROADBENT W002713 13 Apr 2018, 5:37 PM I believe on the whole we're taxing the right things, but I'd welcome an adjustment to the way income is taxed, with a view to reducing inequality, especially for international businesses. I'd also be interested in exploring our options as far as getting tourists to contribute to our state sector economy to help maintain our national parks etc. A review of GST would be good, too. ANONYMOUS W002716 13 Apr 2018, 7:18 PM Capital gains tax on second and holiday homes should be introduced . Also a tax on airbnb profits , and finally introduce income spliting MORGAN KOOMAN W002718 13 Apr 2018, 7:39 PM We need higher tax on most things (companies specifically) and perhaps an additional tax bracket for individuals earning over $100000 per year IAN HARTLEY-DADE W002726 13 Apr 2018, 8:21 PM Capital gains tax over complicates process and may affect the mid earners of society. It would be better to increase the threshold and rate of tax for those earning $200k plus should be explored. A GST reduction on essentials such as veg, milk, healthy foods should be implemented and funded on a tax on unhealthy foods and sugars. SAMARA KRUSKOPF W002737 13 Apr 2018, 9:59 PM Can you please make a capital gains tax. Even on family home. I know it is a big one for us to get our heads around but it’s the only one that makes sense to make a positive difference. Can you please add another bracket to the progressive tax for the highest income earners. Just to keep inline with other like countries. (Increase the %. Sorry I can’t remember the specific % increase) Close loop holes for tax avoidance. PAUL HURLEY W002747 14 Apr 2018, 1:08 AM If King for a day I would create a fairer tax system for tenants and owner/occupiers of property. When landlords charge and tenant pay why should the landlord get all the tax perks? If landlords can claim tax rebates for rates and maintainance why shouldn't owner occupiers be able to do so too? How about telling landlords "the party is over, no more perks" It's someone else's turn; give those same perks to owner occupiers and tenants! This policy would restore sanity in the property market. Landlords would sell their houses and invest in more productive enterprises and tenants would be able to step up into the property market to become part of a healthy community. Neighbourhoods where people own their own homes are far more stable. DENHAM KONI W002749 14 Apr 2018, 5:23 AM Introduce new personal tax thresholds. $0 - $20k is not taxable. 33% tax threshold kicks in later. $130k and above is taxed at 35% or higher. Abolish secondary tax as it harms low income workers (or at least lower it). Property investors with a net worth of more than 10million to pay more tax. Law and policy around what a charity is should be looked at. Hard to say if tax is necessary for them as they fulfill functions which the govt is not capable of performing. MNCs and companies without a NZ base should be taxed the same as domestic companies. Remove GST from certain basic food groups and increase tax on items deemed unhealthy such as tobacco and alcohol or provide an allowance to all NZers to cover for the provision of basic necessities (eg. $35per person(per week) contribution towards the cost of food/power/water etc). Remove GST from the purchase of new/used electric vehicles to encourage people to buy them (long term environmental gain) TONY MACKENZIE W002755 14 Apr 2018, 7:26 AM Church's should be taxed, they should not be able to be registered as a charity. JANE MULLANEY W002765 14 Apr 2018, 8:48 AM Companies without a nz base get around paying tax and this is unfair to all nz companies. And unfair for nz people who are overseas working. When I lived in Australia but still owned my home in nz I was considered a resident in nz for tax. I filed tax returns for nz to check whether I was paying enough Australian tax to cover the nz rate and if not, I had to pay tax to IRD even though I did not earn any money in nz and family were living in my home there. Why aren’t companies who have “relationships” with nz and their “base” country also treated the same? ADAM MILLS W002771 14 Apr 2018, 9:55 AM For income tax, I propose we move closer to the UK system: An untaxed 'personal allowance' up to $20,000; A basic rate of 20% for income between $20,000 and $50,000; A higher rate of 40% for income between $50,000 and $100,000; and An additional rate of 45% for income above $100,000. These brackets would result in: a $2,200 increase in net income for those earning the current minimum wage; no change of income for those earning $70,000pa; and a $14,000 decrease in net income for those earning $200,000pa. This would have a significant effect on income inequality. For GST, I propose three categories: An untaxed 'necessities' category, including fruit and vegetables, milk, medicines, feminine hygiene products etc; A 'standard' category, taxed at 10-15%; and A 'luxury items' category, taxed at around 20%, including things like confectionery and fizzy drinks, but also video game consoles, TVs priced over $1000, new cars priced over $50,000 etc. This too would aid in reducing inequality. DREW HIKUWAI W002784 14 Apr 2018, 3:22 PM I pay too much tax.i work bloody hard to earn my money, being self emoloyed I also pay acc, being a smoker I also pay a stupid amount for tabac products of which a stupid amount is tax, call an excise if you want, to me it’s tax. On Fridayevening I enjoy a beer at my local to catch up with frnds an 2 look for work, every year the price of my handle goes up in part due to tax! When in Auckland I may have to buy fuel, haha yip there’s more fuel tax coming for fuel purchased in Auckland.This country really is turning to crap.Sometimes I feel like stopping working, and becoming part of the humane breeding program industry in nz, where you breed baby humans with a willing female (or multiple females) and are monetarily rewarded for your inability to provide for the offspring produced. A decent tax cut is needed for the hardworking people of nz. I’m not talking about tax credits and working fir family’s rubbish, I mean genuine lower tax rates. Isn’t labour for the working man? BRAD HUTTON W002790 14 Apr 2018, 5:13 PM We tax the crap out of anyone who works hard to get ahead. ie: people who work long hours with maybe two jobs but we don’t tax the people who are in lower hour but higher pay per hour bracket enough ,lawyers , doctors, fontera directors . It’s frustrating especially for me working two jobs and doing 80 hours a week to pay for a good life for my family when there are people who won’t work who my tax pays for their hand outs and let’s not pretend that they are victims of bad luck and circumstances. A small percentage are but most are career bludgers, so instead of taxing the working class to breaking point .... here’s an idea make drug testing compusary to beneficiaries as it is to most workers and stop their benefit just like what happens to workers. watch the money stack up when they fail and push them to make better decisions KIRSTY STEEGHS W002806 14 Apr 2018, 8:47 PM My thoughts are.. Mums and Dads/Partners should be able to have their income (for tax purposes) shared between them, i.e. if you are a stay at home Mum and your husband earns 50k, it should be taxed as 25k each adult, otherwise you are better off both going back to work part time and earning 25k each, and I don't think a family should be penalised for the way they structure their working arrangements. Secondly, I would like to see tax rates aligned to hourly rates - it seems unfair that someone earning minimum wage but working 90 hours a week might pay as much tax as a high earner only doing 10 hours. If you are working that hard on min wage, it is hard when you get to the 33% tax bracket and realise you are only earning $12 or so an hour, wheras top earners might still be earning $90 after their 33% tax so it's still worthy for them to continue working into that tax bracket. Don't remove tax on some items - the cost/time to administrate and the loopholes will make this counterproduc JAMES FLOCCHINI W002813 14 Apr 2018, 9:08 PM Significantly changing the way we are taxed or adding new taxes without significantly reducing taxes on income will be nothing more than a tax grab. In my view there needs to the continued encouragement for people to take risk in new business generation. There also needs to be some encouragement into property development and investment. JOHN RUSSELL W002818 14 Apr 2018, 9:27 PM NZs tax system is too PAYE and company tax focussed. NZ needs to tax the massive wealth that exists outside the scope of PAYE and company tax. The two classes of wealth that are inadequately taxed are land and other assets. Capital gains is one way of taxing these assets - but the tax revenue generated happens too spradically. Direct annual land / asset taxes collected annually are the best way to provide NZ with consistent tax revenue. Even low tax rates of this kind generate signifcant revenue and would likely allow for a significant reduction in PAYE PAUL HERD W002825 14 Apr 2018, 9:44 PM cigarettes and drink should be taxed at the GST rate and no I'm not a drinker or smoker . fresh fruit and vegetables and unprocessed meat should the GST free . churches and religious organizations should be paying taxes as should companies like sanatarium and kellogg's. anyone who earns less than 20k should not have to pay tax and it's rediculas taxing benefits as they do . luxury items should have a higher GST on them AMANDA FOUNTAIN W002831 14 Apr 2018, 11:20 PM Taxining incomes is ok but could be reduced for middle class and lower class slarary bands. An additional band could be made for the super rich. Taxing fresh fruit and veges is silly and makes it difficult for those on low incomes to afford healthy food. Taxing cigarettes and alcohol could be even higher as it is a luxury and a big impacts for our health system. Taxing clean energy and healthy home products should be reduced. Such as electric cars and house insulation. Taxing profit from house sales should only be on a non-family homes. Taxing business sales should be implemented based on how much profit was made. Taxing feminin hygiene products should be removed. It is socially unacceptable not to use them and therefore a neccesary health product. Tax on petrol productsis ok. Taxing public transport should be reduced to reduce fairs and encourage people to use it. Especially electric trains (clean energy). Tax non nz based businesses at an rate that won’t send them elsewhere. DONNA OLIVE W002833 14 Apr 2018, 11:44 PM I think we should remove GST on basic food essentials on necessities like gas and electricity or have a much lower rate 5 % for e.g. Also remove gst on sanitary products and medicines. Have a proper capital gains tax apart from the family home. Also have a tax free threshold before income tax sets in. It is £10,000 in the UK now. Maybe we could have a special tax to fund the health system like Australian Medicare say 1% but on a sliding scale up to 2 or 3 % if you are on very high income. SHANE MUNN W002835 15 Apr 2018, 12:15 AM I'm opposed to any increase in taxes. As a family we struggle to pay mortgage and would not want to pay any more tax dollars . RICHARD HIDE W002839 15 Apr 2018, 7:21 AM Tax organised religion. GST minimum. The faithful are paying for goods or services. Block the funnelling of profits by multinational corps offshore so you can get the tax take off them. Give the wage slaves some relief. We are not an endless source to be bled dry. Sugar tax is a great idea. Balance it with removed or reduced gst on base foods. Increase RUC on trucking. Maybe we’ll get smarter with using rail. DHBs are not an effective use of our tax. Centralise health again. More efficient. Raise tax thresholds on paye. All you do by raising minimum wage is raise your tax take as the threshold doesn’t move. Little benefit is seen by the people. SARA PERLEY W002842 15 Apr 2018, 7:49 AM GST is an equitable tax on paper, not in reality. There should be no gst on fresh food or on utilities. Overseas corporations are difficult - if we want their investment we need to encourage their presence - however this does not mean we could not tax them a token sum - as most other countries do We need a higher corporate tax rate and an additional tax bracket for those earning over $150,000. Research suggests once you have a certain amount of money more does nothing to increase your happiness - so let’s increase the happiness of the less well off and allow them afford healthy food - in the long term it’s beneficial to our health system too RK RK W002852 15 Apr 2018, 9:43 AM You need to look at who is making lots of money. Why keep taxing joe average who is busting there guts as much as the dudes raking it in but is only just scraping by. The tax rate is phenomenal on the average earner. 10.5 to 33% tax on wages and 15% on everything they purchase its absolutely criminal. Australia has there hands in so many pies over here and all the money they make is going back to Australia. Hit them hard and if they leave then that opens a opportunity for a New Zealand based company. Overseas businesses need to pay up. Water bottling plants need to pay up, companies that produce waste that councils have to clean up need to pay up ( KFC, McDs, Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc) how many days can you go without seeing there rubbish, Tyre produces ( We dont even have a plan to get rid of tyres) Companies pumping into the rivers and oceans. People with more than 1 house, they cant live in more than 1. Time to share. PETER LINTON W002856 15 Apr 2018, 10:33 AM These questions are misleading n clearly constructed so the recipients can use them for any means you want. Your claim the average tax rate is 30%. Did u just make this up? Income tax is 33% GST is 15% Add fuel, road, local guvamint taxes n 60% is more like it. WRT your questions you left out the most important question: Is tax too high? At 60% or more it clearly is too high. Lower the tax rate n the economy will boom producing an overall tax take that is higher. Or will u just continue to punish ordinary people with exorbitant taxes? ANNICA LEWIS W002862 15 Apr 2018, 11:12 AM There are a few things New Zealand could improve on when it comes to taxes. For one the highest tax bracket is too low, and low in comparison to other countries similar to New Zealand. Long term investments such as property should be taxed. At the moment there are too many loopholes when selling property. If a profit is made it should be taxed regardless of perceived intention when purchasing the property. ANGELA PHYN W002865 15 Apr 2018, 11:59 AM I think tax on fruit, vegetables and meat is ridiculous. It’s making it hard to feed our family’s good food. WARRICK WALTER W002868 15 Apr 2018, 12:16 PM Don't start taxing long-term investments or residential property. These kind of investments are made by average working New Zealander's trying to get ahead in their lives. It might make sense to look at the tax laws around international companies, especially with no New Zealand base. It isn't fair to be taxing New Zealand companies which are trying to compete with international companies that get a free run in our country, that's inequality. ALAN STOHR W002872 15 Apr 2018, 12:41 PM Why are RWT rates based on PAYE instead of RWT earned with more reasonably structured tax rates. This may encourage savings from all walks of life. Increasing PAYE in any form will be a backwards step. As it is higher earners don't get any more bang for their buck than others. BRENT K W002877 15 Apr 2018, 1:05 PM One thing I do not agree with is the running of businesses under a "charity" to avoid paying tax. Why is Sanitarium (for example) allowed to get away with this? If you are selling goods for the purpose of profit, you should be taxed the same as any other business is. And also the tax issue around church's need to change - especially when you have church's such as Destiny Church flaunting money around and not paying tax. BRONWYN DRYSDALE W002886 15 Apr 2018, 2:18 PM Water rights ....this is a decisive issue of our time. Water management is crucial to all of our wellbeing, but currently is being managed in a way that overly benefits a few over majority well being. Water in NZ should not be shipped out of this country for profit. Definitely not okay to allow overseas companies to buy land with bores on it and extract millions of litre s a minute of fresh water for export. We are killing the golden goose if we allow that. Also swamplands ( water purification zones) and native bush should be protected and not allowed to be affected by businesses e.g. proposed quarry at Plimmerton , exploitation/ removal of fossilized Kauri stumps in Northland. We need to tax businesses for the true cost of their end point pollution and then we can incentivise innovative ways to become aa carbon neutral economy. I for one would be happy if my kiwisaver only invested in investments that were carbon neutral with the majority of that investment in nz. ISAAC MINOGUE W002890 15 Apr 2018, 2:48 PM Capital gains needs to be a thing! MIQUEL VAN DER WEES W002895 15 Apr 2018, 4:10 PM How about a tiered tax system for businesses? If you make little profit less tax than when you make more profit? This makes it easier for smaller businesses as the lower tax rate could be less than 30%. Profit made in nz not to be offset with losses overseas . No capital gains tax please. Equal taxes for maori and others. Why don't churches have to pay tax? They take in enough money. JOHANNA HOBO-TUCK W002897 15 Apr 2018, 5:23 PM I don't believe that sanitary items should be taxed. It is exclusively females who have to buy these products and it is well documented that women are already victims of the wage gap. When women then have to pay tax on essential sanitary items, this is more money that women lose out on just because they are women. New Zealand led the world in giving women the vote. We can lead the world on addressing this smallest of changes with a big impact. CHRISTINA HOULIHAN W002911 15 Apr 2018, 8:20 PM I generally don’t know much about tax or tax implications but I do have one opinion. Remove GST from food items. All food items, it doesn’t matter if it is healthy or not. We shouldn’t be putting tax on the essentials which people need to survive. JAMES RYAN W002913 15 Apr 2018, 9:16 PM Tax charities who are operating businesses why should they get a leg up on other enterprise. If they deserve to be in business they will stand on their own feet competing against other enterprises on a level playing field. If you raise the tax rate/fiddle with the thresholds please think carefully about what is a decent income in 2018. I know as a young person who is saving for a house that although I am on a decent wage I need all I can to get on the property ladder. Investigate some of TOP's ideas about tax and wealth. I am not sure if tweaking what we have will be enough it is time to think outside the square. Might be time to consider a property tax rather than a capital games tax. If we tax every home people won't be able to afford to hang on to them to collect rental income. A CGT only becomes relevant if property is sold. STEVE PRYCE W002925 15 Apr 2018, 10:10 PM To make tax fair and reduce distortion then a broad tax is needed to be implemented. Reduce income tax and introduce capital gains for example. I am strongly for lower taxes but if that isn’t going to happen then at least broaden the tax base so certain taxes can come down. CHRIS JENKINS W002930 15 Apr 2018, 10:46 PM The loophole around property is way too large. All property investment should be taxed, whether a family home or not - treating renters and property owners fairly as they should be. T W W002933 15 Apr 2018, 11:37 PM I don’t think the current taxation on imports ( online shopping) takes into account how many things just aren’t available here. Sure you can buy gumboots, but not in very many styles or colours. The same with make up or other clothes, it’s all very well to encourage shopping within the country. But we just don’t have the range and a particular item of makeup that is the right shade and doesn’t give you a rash can’t just be swapped for something similar. Also there is no refund on the duty if you send things back. GURWINDER SINGH W002940 16 Apr 2018, 6:37 AM If u guys have once taken tax from income. Why do we have to pay tax again on buying things. This is ridiculous. I pay something like 50 percent of my income in just texes.. DANIEL SCHEALLER W002943 16 Apr 2018, 7:17 AM I agree with the tax policy positions of The Opportunities Party. NEIL VAN DER STAR W002951 16 Apr 2018, 8:48 AM Why aren't we taxing charities and offshore businesses? If they are taking in revenue in this country they should be paying tax. Capital gains tax would be ok to implement depending how it was done... It should be payable as a lump sum when an asset is sold rather than being required to be paid annually. NYE GOODHUE W002955 16 Apr 2018, 9:30 AM All business which turns a profit in NZ should be taxed. Capital gains tax should be introduced on all property with value higher than 500,000. (Combined value) Start taxing churches. They should not be classed nfp. Tax an additional 20% on all wages And profits sent offshore. Tax luxury items (vehicle over 100,000, boats over 50,000, etc). Remove GST from food, refuse, water, petrol, healthcare. Tax all visitors to NZ (pay by the day - exit fees). All bicycles using the road shoukd pay road user charges by way of registration. Double all taxes for businesses who are caught polluting or dumping. Make the big boys pay standard nz tax rates (Google, FB, Amazon, etc). Child support is a glorified tax. Make that system fairer. Accept all children in all homes as dependants and adjust rate accordingly. RACHEL TOMPKINS W002961 16 Apr 2018, 11:21 AM Two areas I think changes would be helpful: Charities that own business should be taxed. The exemption from tax for true charities does make sense, but not for groups that go on and develop profitable businesses. GST should be taken off fresh fruits and veges to make ten more affordable. J SHARP W002970 16 Apr 2018, 1:37 PM Most importantly: 1.) create a better tax system to mitigate tax avoidance particularly seen in large multinationals and wealthy organisations/individuals. 100’s of millions is avoided through legal means. 2.) tax religious organisations and their entities like businesses are taxed 3.) increase tax on everything related to property, while simultaneously decreasing tax on investment in New Zealand businesses 4.) lower taxes/gst on fruit and vegetables, as well as other goods/services that benefit the greater population 5.) higher tax on private vehicles in urban areas ROBERT ANCELL W002976 16 Apr 2018, 2:55 PM We are not taxing the right things. Our tax is mostly on income, which negatively affects all those who are struggling to get ahead. Those who hold many assets are growing their wealth without significant tax. This is most evident in those who are lucky enough to own property - those without it are loose income to tax and rents and the prices of property are growing out of reach. We allow too much property to be transferred between generations. Those who win the birth lottery can inherit huge amounts of wealth which is not significantly taxed. For this to continue we will end up with a highly unequal society of rich dynasties and everyone else fighting for scraps. You can already see this change in NZ society from the baby boomer generation to the current generations. TP ANNETTE W002991 16 Apr 2018, 5:34 PM We need to tax more things. We need higher tax. Cigarettes need to be in machines not at dairys. It is good we have a higher petrol tax to reduce people making frivolous trips. It reduces Co2 pollution. Reducing the speed to 80km will also reduce fossil fuel use. Ban motor sports like racing. We need to bring in safe ways to ride share to work and back. All electric vehicles need to be tax free ! GST needs to come off fresh fruit and vegetables. Lower income people need to be able to live with dignity. Super rich people need to be taxed higher. Up to 50% or 90%. We need to look after all the people in NZ from the cradle to the grave. TP ANNETTE W002993 16 Apr 2018, 5:34 PM We need to tax more things. We need higher tax. Cigarettes need to be in machines not at dairys. It is good we have a higher petrol tax to reduce people making frivolous trips. It reduces Co2 pollution. Reducing the speed to 80km will also reduce fossil fuel use. Ban motor sports like racing. We need to bring in safe ways to ride share to work and back. All electric vehicles need to be tax free ! GST needs to come off fresh fruit and vegetables. Lower income people need to be able to live with dignity. Super rich people need to be taxed higher. Up to 50% or 90%. We need to look after all the people in NZ from the cradle to the grave. ANONYMOUS W002999 16 Apr 2018, 6:10 PM Foods should have different tax groups. I think fresh fruit and veg should be taxed alot less. And bad foods should be taxed more. As someone who is conscious of what they eat it is a lot more expensive to eat healthy than unhealthy. Charities with businesses should also be reviewed. As there are alot of very profitable businesses out there. And they should have to pay tax if they are making income. ANONYMOUS W003001 16 Apr 2018, 6:22 PM Tax Churches. We are moving away from religious beliefs so our tax system should reflect this. A church should not make any profit if it is a charity. The priest wage should be capped and all profit should go back to community projects. They should not be able to become massive empires. BETH LENIHAN W003017 16 Apr 2018, 8:49 PM I think we should introduce a capital gains tax. I also think overseas companies trading here whether they have a base here of not should pay some tax depending on their income from nz sources. SARAH DICKSON W003023 16 Apr 2018, 9:49 PM Companies should be taxed a lot more. Those who own more than one property should be capital gains tax ANNE-MAREE HECKLER W003030 17 Apr 2018, 12:43 AM By biggest tax concern is the disadvantage of being a stay at home parent. My husband goes to work and earns well so that I can stay home with the kids. If he were to earn $130k which is a reasonably good amount for a family, we would see $96,180. However when you compare this to a family who choose to send 2 parents to work, they would take home $104,960. Because they are taxed on $65k each and hit a lower tax bracket. When you consider our income at $65k per person suddenly it seems a lot more average. How is it fair and how does it encourage families to do what is right for kids? By staying home I am effectively loosing $8,780 every year. In all instances except income tax the government considers both partners financial situation (benefits etc). Why then is it not considered for income? I would happily add my ird number to his payslip so that the income could be taxed proportionality across us since it is our sole source of income. OLIVER POSTINGS W003036 17 Apr 2018, 7:42 AM I believe that we need to look at changing the way we, as a country, collect income tax. I think that we need to consider a tax free amount to every salary, say the first 6000$. This would make life a lot easier for those on minimum wage- this could be off set by removing some family tax credits or other form of benefits. I also find that the fact that charities can operate like businesses and not pay tax to be a little galling. Why the likes of Sanitarium and The Mission Winery, both profitable businesses in their own rights, pay no tax even though they are selling products seems wrong, when at the same time we are looking at taxing off shore digital businesses that sell only data seems not right. I would also like the government to consider some form of capital gains tax for the buying and selling of businesses and properties. KAELA JANITEN W003042 17 Apr 2018, 9:32 AM I don’t believe we are taxing the right things within New Zealand. People who have had the opportunity to make investments in the past get free tax write-offs indefinitely. This keeps the already limited amount of properties and businesses within New Zealand being passed around between a lucky few. To ensure equity for all New Zealanders today and in the future, we must tax private assets. ANONYMOUS W003046 17 Apr 2018, 11:46 AM It seems you are leaning towards taxing property more, this is a very bad idea as property values tend to go up together as the market goes up. So if I was own a house for many years then decided to sell my house and buy another one in the same market, the buying power of my house will have decreased as I would be forced to pay a capital gains tax. I could therefore not even be able to buy back the same house I just sold as the government would have taken their cut from the sale. This means each time I change investments I am loosing a considerable portion of my investment even if the buying power has not changed. It is already hard enough to get on the property ladder this will just make it harder to stay on it. The fuel tax is also extremely inequitably punishing those who live further out of the city who tend to have lower incomes. Nz should be focusing on staying competitive internationally with lower tax rates especially with USA expected to lower its corporate tax rate. JULIAN VESTY W003051 17 Apr 2018, 1:19 PM I would argue that taxation should not be placed on fruit and vegetables. It is all very well to tax sugar, fat and alcohol, but it will not be of any use unless healthier foods become more affordable. CONOR WILSON W003056 17 Apr 2018, 1:57 PM Income tax seems a good way to raise the majority of taxes and it would be hard to move away from this. Our no exemptions GST system is efficient. However if new revenue is going to be raised then taxing things we want to discourage such as carbon or other environmentally harmful things is a good addition to our current tax system. This could be offset by lowering other taxes if the cost to business is too great. Taxing any profits made by foreign companies in NZ is a politically palatable way to raise revenue and would make foreign companies compete more fairly with NZ companies. Looking into ways companies hide profits is important too. some sort of tax on profit from capitol is important as profit from capitol tends to benefit those who already have money while struggling people are always taxed on their labour and can't avoid tax in the same way profits from capitol can. An added sugars tax would be nice. Also can you please tax Brian Tamaki. Just specifically him. ANGIE BENN W003061 17 Apr 2018, 3:00 PM 1) Exempt the following goods and services from GST: a) Basic foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, milk, cheese and whole-wheat bread b) Feminine hygiene products c) Dental care d) Toothbrushes and toothpaste Exempting these goods and services will help the most vulnerable in our society to live better and healthier quality lives. 2) Energy-dense foods and sugar-sweetened beverages need to be taxed this will not only add revenue to government coffers but will a useful public health measure. Countries such as France, Mexico and UK have introduced these taxes successfully. NZ urgently needs to address its obesity, diabetes,cardiovascular disease and tooth decay rates, a sugar tax will assist in this as the tobacco tax has reduced smoking rates. The revenue raise can be used to provide basic dental care for vulnerable adults in line with the government policy "Good Oral Health for All, for Life" which was adopted in 2006. The "for All, for Life" remains undelivered! STACEY GARMONSWAY W003065 17 Apr 2018, 3:44 PM I believe that the government is taxing most things well. I do not think there should be GST on essential items such as fruit, vegetables, meat and alternatives or dairy, or period related products such as tampons, pads or alternatives. I think we should be doing more to help low income households such as considering a lower tax rate. CRAIG PONTIFEX W003075 17 Apr 2018, 5:39 PM New Zealand taxes purchases of food. I suggest GST should not apply to the purchase of food that is not pre-prepared ie restaurant food. This would mean an end to GST on most things in the supermarket and would encourage people to eat healthier. The cost of fruit and vegetables in this country is too high and competition reduction (thus lower prices) is unlikely any time soon. Thanks ANONYMOUS W003080 17 Apr 2018, 6:29 PM I don't think imports should be taxed so heavily for businesses, it makes it impossible for nz shops, especially small business, to compete with online global shops. And with the $400 loophole, nz consumers can have things shipped from anywhere in the world for less than local retailers are able to sell things for. This penalisation of brick and mortar shops ultimately hurts the economy. HILLARY KNOWLES W003083 17 Apr 2018, 6:55 PM I really feel that one of the things that is hitting the poorest people in our society is secondary tax. They are working 2 or 3 jobs to try and put food on the table and a roof over their head and are paying huge amounts in tax. If there was a threshold for secondary tax (and I mean a significant amount e.g. $90 000/year), I think that would really actually start to help people out more than things such as Working for Families etc. because there are a lot of poor people out there without kids. Additionally, I think things such as fruit and veg, milk and bread, as well as sanitary products and condoms, shouldn't be taxed. This would save money in the long run as people would have higher levels of quality nutrition and consequently cleaner bills of health and thus would rely on the health system less. NAREN KUMAR W003087 17 Apr 2018, 7:05 PM We dont want new taxes....life is already hard please dont make it more hard. Also there is no way housing will become affordable if we play with tax system. GARETH STYTHE W003096 17 Apr 2018, 8:38 PM Concerned that income tax shoulders too much of the tax burden. Think that capital should also be taxed. Capital in the form of land and property other than principle private residence (no tax on your home). Capital in the form of machinery and robots. I think there should be a capital gains tax in NZ. If a person sets up a business that facilitates selling other peoples stuff and sells that business for a large sum the capital gain should be taxed. The person would not have benefitted without the systems, goodwill and structure of a sound NZ. In order to continue to provide this environment for future entrepreneurs a tax on the gain needs to be paid. No inheritance tax, tax people while they are alive and can vote. BILL WRIGLEY W003101 17 Apr 2018, 8:55 PM We tax interest received as income in the hands of the lender, and allow the interest expense as a deduction in the hands of the borrower, provided that the money borrowed is used to purchase assets that earn income. Income is defined as a periodic return for one's work ,or use of one's asset that does not require the sale of that asset. In practice, the distinction between earned income and value appreciation is blurred. Many companies involved with real estate, e.g. rest home operators and farmers revalue their assets periodically and where gains have occurred pay out the proceeds as tax paid dividends. In many cases the interest expense incurred is set off against operating profits with the net result being that little if any tax is paid. In these situations the interest deduction becomes a subsidy from the taxpayer to the borrower. Whilst recognizing that this makes a case for a capital gains tax I believe that there is also good reason to review the deductibility of interest. HANNAH WELSBY W003104 17 Apr 2018, 9:45 PM This country has a tax structure that makes you feel like you are the bad guy if you earn more than $50k a year. It's not nice. We could put lower taxes on multiple items, effectively pay the same and feel less like a villain. People get angry when they feel like they are paying more than their fair share. Look at what's costing us and tax that. Don't make working people feel like what we earn is being picked clean. TINA EMGEE W003115 18 Apr 2018, 12:24 AM I believe we should NOT tax the basic necessities, including feminine hygiene products, fruit, veg, and milk, but tax the luxuries, including soda, chocolate etc. I also think we should be taxing capital gains on investment property, perhaps a low rate. I also think we should either stop taxing unrealised investment gains, allow paper losses to be written off against other tax obligations or do something to make tax fairer when market values fluxuate so investment profits aren’t significantly eroded by repeated taxation. Otherwise, housing will continue to be the only investment that makes any sense in the longterm. RICHARD BUTTERFIELD W003118 18 Apr 2018, 7:36 AM Removing GST on essential goods such as food, sanitary products, electricity etc GWYN JOHN W003131 18 Apr 2018, 8:41 AM There are too many ways that big business and the very wealthy can avoid paying tax so the burden lies to heavily on the poorer wage and salary earners who cannot avoid PAYE and also have to pay tax on every purchase through GST, Petrol TAX etc.....these costs are avoided by the wealthy and big businesses who pay people to make sure they pay as little as possible by playing the numbers. Stop taxing the little people and get some tax back from Global Corps, big business, the Financial Market, Banks! They are not contributing thier fair share......transaction tax, removing the "tax concessions" sorting the Investment Model of property investment will all help.....but don't increase PAYE, SME or individual tax DAN GREGORY W003145 18 Apr 2018, 10:08 AM Charities should pay tax on profits no exceptions. Profit is profit. If they are a true charity they won't make the profit. If they make a profit from their activities then they are a business. Offshore corporates should pay tax on all income in NZ. They should not be allowed to move costs incurred from offshore bases to their NZ operation. Let them make a loss in their offshore locations and get a refund from the country they make the loss. We should pay tax on the profit made from selling property/houses/art etc Don't charge tax on any profits on the primary home, family bach or one investment/rental property per person. MATHEW BAYLISS W003156 18 Apr 2018, 11:57 AM I don't support taxing property or unrealised capital gains, this would just penalise me and many others for making good decisions early in my working life. Also, assets would just be hidden within trusts and holding companies creating an industry dedicated to setting these up and detecting and unraveling them. Companies large and small can declare large revenues yet only pay tax on their calculated profits, this results in a direct incentive to declare the lowest possible profit and obscures the capacity of the business to assume a fairer share of the tax burden. This should be an area of focus for any changes to our tax system. SHASHI JANSON W003159 18 Apr 2018, 12:12 PM Start taxing religious groups, stop taxing groceries, tax ALL corporations who sell products in NZ whether they are based offshore or not (remember a few years back Apple only paid around $4000 in tax for the year!). Crack down on the fact that NZ is still a tax haven. Small businesses or new businesses should be taxed much less in the first 5 years of operation. GST should go back down to 10%. Secondary income tax should not exist until you exceed a total 40 hours a week for both jobs. Also the income tax brackets need to shift, 0-$14000 should be untaxed, $14001 - $48000 should be 10.5%, $48001 - $70000 should be 17% and so on (even if the tax percentage went up slightly I'm sure this would be helpful to most Kiwis). Almost 1/5 of the average persons wages goes to income tax, this doesn't leave much for the bills since the cost of living has become so high. Thank you for considering my opinions. J B W003172 18 Apr 2018, 2:45 PM New Zealand taxes the things that most countries around the world would consider standard. Extending the scope of what we tax will only lead to a more complicated system and more paperwork and red tape. If anything we should tax a smaller number of things and simplify the tax system, not tax more and make it more complicated. GARRET HUELSON W003175 18 Apr 2018, 3:34 PM The tax system in nz is designed to tax those with the least disposable income. Income tax and government spend should be reduced while a capital gains tax should be applied to every property sale beyond a families primary residence. The windfall from capital gains should be deducted from income taxes. There should also be a consilidation of council services to cut down on exhorbinant rates made up mainly of management salaries and council building maintenance. DAVID SPRAGGS W003178 18 Apr 2018, 4:09 PM I wonder if we tax all income regardless of business or not at a simple flat rate of 40% and the remove get on fruit vegetables and meat and bread but not other things. The increased tax could then be used to do infrastructure work. Companies seem to minimise what they make and this needs to be seriously addressed. Otherwise the little person carries the burden and this is NOT acceptable. Everyone flat rate. Make it ok to try and get ahead without making it unwise because of tax hikes JAMES MCKEAGE W003189 18 Apr 2018, 6:53 PM I believe we desperately need a capital gains tax. A significant proportion of new zealanders make a living from property and they deserve to be taxed for their income like anyone else, or at least as much as income made from other investment options like the share market. I also think we should be taxing companies who do business in New Zealand. We need to make sure New Zealand companies at least get a level playing field (if not an advantage!) when doing business in our own backyard. Ideally, profits made doing business in/with New Zealand should be paid in New Zealand. DANIEL SEVERINSEN W003194 18 Apr 2018, 7:20 PM Increase GST on imported goods to 20%. Increase fuel tax Remove tax and employer obligations from temporary, part time jobs. The jobs which are currently paid cash, make this legal up to $180 per week. Similar to Germany's 450€ per month system. Regards Daniel DENI DUMAINE W003197 18 Apr 2018, 7:42 PM Please do not imitate the failure of European countries who have increased taxes on companies, and as a result unemployment has skyrocketed. Be wise, be different. ANONYMOUS W003204 18 Apr 2018, 8:44 PM I believe we need to move to a model where we tax wealth more so than income. The current system is not fair when comparing a middle-class salary earner on PAYE to a more wealthy individual earning money from assets and accounting for those earnings using favourable mechanisms. The current system is causing wealth to become more concentrated towards the top 1% and worsening inequality in our country. The book Capital in the 21st Century by Thomas Piketty lays out a highly researched case for moving to a wealth tax model and I hope this book is referenced by the tax working group. SARAH-JANE B W003211 18 Apr 2018, 10:41 PM I think allowing for a ‘personal allowance’ similar to the Uk system before you pay income tax would help people earn a little before paying tax. It means those receiving benefits could get back to work on lower income jobs and not worry about tax rates. I am a mum trying to re start my career part time but the mount of tax I am paying on such a small salary is making it hard, given that my earning has also taken us out of the tax credit bracket and my partner is also paying a high tax. Right now we are a young hard working family struggling to just make ends meet and paying out so much tax for our dollar each week. Being able to earn a small allowance that wasn’t taxed first, would give us a little bit left over each week to either save or cover the little extras that pop up. Ie my daughter needing a new pair of shoes JEREMY HAINES W003213 19 Apr 2018, 12:07 AM Tax Financial transactions. Tax Assets. With international companys. Importers and exporters and international tech companies like google and Facebook you could tax their nz income less their nz expenses. And you could do the same for nz companys that export tech or other services and goods. AIDAN VAN DER WERFF W003219 19 Apr 2018, 1:23 AM We need less/no tax on fruit and vegetables (not a sugar tax, because people are struggling to buy healthier options already). And secondary income tax needs to be reduced, people trying to make ends meet are being punished! M HAWKINS W003222 19 Apr 2018, 7:30 AM I believe a capital gains tax, and a tax free income threshold, no gst on essential items would be fairer. Maybe who can claim charity status needs to be looked at, or perhaps charities should pay tax. Offshore companies making profits in Nz should ideally be taxed for this in Nz. I don’t think stamp duty’s are fair especially if capital gains tax are in place, and inheritance taxes if introduced should possibly have a tax free threshold and a tiered tax structure. ANONYMOUS W003228 19 Apr 2018, 8:12 AM Income tax brackets need to be reexamined. When 2 full time jobs barely pay the bills, something needs fixed. Introduce incentives for lower-middle income workers. There is little reason for people to work when the unemployment benefits is similar to working wages. People are barely better off going to work. The same can be said for beneficiaries trying to start studying. People are better off on WINZ than studylink. More workers = more productivity = better economy = more money. Reduce taxes on the working poor. Provide tax incentives to boost the economy. PEYMAN MOMENAN W003232 19 Apr 2018, 9:26 AM New Zealand tax is based on income (or more accurately described, on profit). So gains regardless of their sources (e.g. long term VS short term, property VS other sources etc) should be taxed. However, for long term gains there is the issue of fairly calculating the gain. Such gains must be calculated on the purchasing power of a given amount of money and not based on the nominal values. E.g. if a piece of land was acquired 20 years ago at $100k and is sold today at $400K, the nominal gain is $300k. However the purchasing power of the land seller is unlikely to be 4 times of their purchasing power 20 years ago. Provided that the gain is adjusted for purchasing power, then it will be fair to tax these long term gains (including property). Also gains should be taxed on realisation only. Finally, all relevant expenses must be allowed as deductible so these gains are calculated on the same basis as short term gains (e.g. companies' annual income). EMMA LAWSON W003254 19 Apr 2018, 3:09 PM Having GST on fresh fruit, veggies and meat really bumps up the cost of buying these things at the shops. It would be nice to see lesser tax on these items (maybe only 5- 10% instead of 15%). It would also be nice to look into the benefits of a sugar tax - please look at Jamie Oliver in the UK. Upping the tax thresholds would be good too. The cost of living has gone up substantially compared to wages and salaries. Having so much tax come off of your wages is heartbreaking when you can’t even afford to see the doctor anymore. Where is our tax money being spent??? Perhaps the 33% bracket should start at $90,000+ ... maybe even a higher bracket of 38-40% for those earning over $200,000 p.a. I would also love to see a government/treasury document released annually showing what every tax payer dollar was spent on. We need to invest in hospitals, health and schools and this is not currently happening, we all know it. Show us where our hard earned money is being spent please! ANONYMOUS W003257 19 Apr 2018, 3:23 PM It is clear that some things that are being taxed are right and everyone is paying it. However, again what IS NOT being taxed benefits the well off only. HELEN SMITH W003272 19 Apr 2018, 6:28 PM Capital gains tax definitely needs to be implemented. When a first-home buyer has to compete against third or fourth home buyers who have the equity of their existing properties, prices are driven out of their reach and they become stuck in a rental loop. Also the untaxed profit when they then flip this property further widens the gap. Home loan assistance for first homes is a great scheme, but most are still unable to compete against pure investors. MEREDITH GUY W003276 19 Apr 2018, 7:20 PM I work two jobs however my second job immediately gets taxed secondary at a high rate even though both jobs contribute to what would be a normal working week for most. I would like to see secondary income tax changed so that if you are working more than 1 job, you should not pay high secondary tax (PAYE) until you work over, say, 50 hours. That way if you work more than one job you are not getting penalised. I understand that other secondary income like interest on investments etc could easily stay a bit higher but i feel if you are working hard for a regular amount of hours a week over 2 jobs - the same effectively as a person working one job - then the tax should be the same. ANONYMOUS W003286 19 Apr 2018, 9:48 PM Tax foreigners more! The ones who buy up our houses, the ones who own businesses and treat this place like a tax haven. Legalize marijuana then tax the shit out if that! Legalize hemp for clothes and insulation. Dont tax that But tax plastic crap! For a government working group, youre all pretty farkn thick if youre asking us what to do! JOHAN BATELAAN W003289 19 Apr 2018, 10:07 PM NZ needs to tax the rich more and the poor/working class less. The working class who provide much of the consumption of goods and services are taxed too much leading to them spending less. I would like to see NZ tax it’s resourses such as mining, businesses such as farming and the wealthy with a $200,000+ high tax bracket of 45%. It should also be pertinent that overseas investors who buy up NZ should be taxed heavily. Overseas companies that do business in nz such as amazon also need to be charged higher tax. Taxing overseas incoming goods would encourage divestment and growth in nz manufacturing where nz cannot compete with overseas labour. Such import taxes on goods would ultimately help NZ even if initially it hindered us. NAOMI POCOCK W003298 19 Apr 2018, 10:51 PM The bulk of our tax comes from wage earners and small businesses. They are the people/ entities struggling in our society. We should be taxing rich people more (and closing the loop holes they use to avoid tax) and big business / investors. This system needs a compete about turn. I own 5 properties and earn no wage so I'd be disadvantaged by this change. However, if it meant fewer poor people, better preventative healthcare and better education overall, it'd be money well taxed! CATHERINE BINDON W003319 20 Apr 2018, 11:21 AM GST is a regressive, cruel and unfair tax. It effects all people regardless of income or ability to pay for life's essentials such as food, medicine, dentistry, rates, and all repairs and trades services. Because of it's broad sweep it places a burden low income earners, middle income earners and single income households. It needs to be scrapped completely with the exception of remaining on unhealthy products such as cigarettes and alcohol. On the other hand companies like Sanitarium pay no tax due to their charitable status, yet they are one of NZ's largest companies. Exemptions for operations like this need to be lifted and company tax introduced. This would make it fairer for other companies. Capital Gains Tax should be introduced, as has been suggested by policy makers on investment properties. The sale of these houses is a transaction that needs to be taxed like other transactions. ANONYMOUS W003329 20 Apr 2018, 1:38 PM I think you need to remove tax on fresh fruits, vegetables and other healthy goods to encourage the consumption of quality foods. you could compensate for this loss of GST by adding more tax to goods deemed unhealthy. this would lead to less health care needed as many more citizens would be healthy. PHILLIP HART W003342 20 Apr 2018, 4:29 PM Taxation should encourage work and enterprise. Capital Gains Tax (and Death, Gift Duties) should not be considered as they are effectively double-dipping and discourage people from generating wealth and being self-sufficient. ANONYMOUS W003350 20 Apr 2018, 7:16 PM You should not be taxing feminine products - tampons, pads. Period related pain refielfs should be subsidised the same way viagra is. Feminine hygiene is not a choice or luxury. It is a necessity. A sugar tax should be applied to help reduce obesity. Vegetables and fruits should not be taxed to make them more accessible and help families be healither. WILLEM VAN DER STEEN W003352 20 Apr 2018, 7:18 PM TAX, GST and LEVIES are too high. We work hard to provide for our families not the lazy buggers, thieves etc. And what a leading suggestive quick poll.. The obvious option is left out, tax too much. So you tax the right things but too much. BRENT MCCLURE W003354 20 Apr 2018, 7:32 PM I don’t want to see an inheritance tax. Our kids are struggling to afford their own home as it is and the ability to leave them something when we die and our house sold shouldn’t be taxed. Tax on our income, tax on our investment and savings, tax on what we buy. At least let us keep what we save as by the time it becomes inheritance over half of it has already gone to the government. I also think there should be a tax free threshold for kids working part time and those on very low incomes. In addition the thresholds need to be adjusted a lot higher than they are. Years ago the top tier tax rate was for upper income earners, now it’s middle income paying those rates. I don’t think those with good accountants are paying their fair share. Target the corporations syphoning money offshore like Apple and people buying money in clever accounting practices that are super rich. We should all pay our fair share but increasingly it’s the middle income carrying so much of the burden. ANDREW REEVES W003357 20 Apr 2018, 8:11 PM You need to be looking at trusts. Legislation that allows the ird to monitor them effectively and avoid tax evasion paths. Also charities. Do we even need a charities commission and a charities tax entity? If a business does not make a profit it pays no tax. So why have a separate entity. Its another avenue to avoid tax. Nai tahu have 20 plus charities which should be normal businesses. Destiny church is another prime example. ANONYMOUS W003366 20 Apr 2018, 10:39 PM Tax churches and certain kinds of charities. Tax the top ten percent of NZ that has 60 percent of our wealth. GREG DUNCAN W003370 20 Apr 2018, 10:55 PM My suggestions. Tax property sales. Different tier for different value and volume. We need to discourage people from driving the price of houses up. Allow for tax free savings accounts like they do in the UK. We need to encourage people to save. ANGELA ROSE W003374 20 Apr 2018, 11:38 PM No commercial venture should be exempt from taxation simply because it is owned by a charity. Property investors make profits via capital gains on their holdings which can go completely untaxed. In pursuing property as a tax effective investment they also price home buyers out of the market. The bright line and determination of running a business rules are ineffective and easy to work around. A catch all tax policy, like Australia's capital gains tax but simpler would solve these problems. Benefit recipients should not be taxed on benefits received. It makes no sense for the government to pay benefits then take some back. Again, Australia is a good example, their benefits are tax free and even if they weren't there is a tax free threshold. Taxing those on the lowest incomes for both income and consumption creates deeper poverty, NZ should establish a tax free threshold even if it means the % rates for other tax levels rise on paper (eg. no net effect on tax for higher income earners). NICK HEWETT W003379 21 Apr 2018, 7:01 AM How about addressing PAYE. The tax thresholds need to be raised to allow for inflation since the date of inception. "Taxing the rich" is the wrong way to think going in to this tax "problem", how about stop spending so much!? Also the rich don't earn their money through PAYE. CARISSA KAVENEY W003381 21 Apr 2018, 7:28 AM Hi there, I think the taxes should be decreased on healthy foods and raised in fast food, unhealthy snacks, fizzy drink, alcohol, cigarettes etc. It is important that our nation can have the best chance at fighting smoking and obesity and all the medical conditions that accompany an increased BMI. I think the government should be helping and supporting people to make the right/better food choices and making them the cheaper option would definitely be a step in the right direction. Thanks, Carissa JAMES STOKES W003390 21 Apr 2018, 8:57 AM The whole premise of this group is to find ways of taking more of my hard earned money. I am already worse off under this government as a lower middle income earner. The easiest way to make things better for the harderst working New Zealanders is to take stock of what you are spending as a government and get rid of the waste (such as 75 plus working groups) I’m sure the money from this would have been plenty to keep the lumsden maternity centre open and increase investment in rural healthcare and education. The more you tax the electorate the more they resent you. We all have to do our but to pay for services but it is generally accepted outside of the ranks of communism that we deserve to have something left at the end of it for our families KENNETH TRASS W003395 21 Apr 2018, 9:14 AM We ought to consider higher taxes for non resident earners and overseas companies. We should tax businesses more, but use that revenue directly for community and infrastructure projects. We should acknowledge businesses who invest in arts,community and environmental projects (note-not sport...New Zealand has a history of over supporting sports to the detriment of Arts and Culture). Tax should primarily be invested in long term infrastructure and technology projects. CARON PASCOE W003398 21 Apr 2018, 9:49 AM The Australian Govt is it is about to charge 50% tax when foreigners sell their property. I think it would be a good way to slow foreign ownership of our country and a good tax revenue. SHANNON BOLLAND W003405 21 Apr 2018, 10:11 AM I feel that tax should be be eliminated on student allowances. A student who is entitled to $130/week quickly loses a good chunk of that to tax. Taxing student allowance seems strange when it is a form of benefit that comes from the government. SARAH W003414 21 Apr 2018, 10:55 AM There should be no GST on necessities like veg, fruit, bread, etc or sanitary products. The UK supermarkets managed to calculate this before computers so saying it's too hard is rubbish. GST should also not be on second hand anything. Double dipping is greedy. Someone has already paid GST when that item was new! HANNAH BANDY W003423 21 Apr 2018, 1:05 PM I say stop taxing people’s wages and increase tax on goods and services. That way the people who use the service end up paying for it. MAX ROBITZSCH W003429 21 Apr 2018, 3:59 PM We need to tax capital gains more. We need to tax speculative (especially short-term speculative) gains more. We also need to consider taxing unhealthy or unsustainable actions more (such as carbon-emissions). A tax-way of discouraging land banking in areas zoned for intensification would also be desirable. SHANE COLEMAN W003448 21 Apr 2018, 6:58 PM The tax system has not adapted to the changes in wealth generated in property (non productive sector) if rentals were attractive investment then why so few landlords bothered to build new rental stock rather than absorbing existing stock? HEIDI WRUCK W003458 21 Apr 2018, 8:58 PM I say most things as there are many things as there are some things that shouldn't be taxed; - Fruit - vegetables - sanitary items; menstrual cups, tampons, pads, toilet paper - nappies (those that are eco friendly/ sustainable e.g cloth & modern cloth nappies and biodegradable nappies - Childrens clothing - underwear; bras, knickers, undies. - school uniforms and uniform shoes. - school stationery from the schools stationery list - could be achieved by allowing school to buy the stationery approved by the school board, at GST free price and then the families purchase directly from the school. In my work with low income families, these are the things that make a difference; being able to put a nappy on your child and wear knickers that don't have holes in them and a bra that holds we everything in its proper place does a world of good to people's self esteem, there outlook on the world and confidence to achieve in life. HASH ALI W003462 21 Apr 2018, 10:57 PM Charities need to pay taxes just like all other incomes that do. Just because some people see them doing good things in one area shouldnt mean they get off their part in another. Investments? Nah. Only once they sell it shoud the sales be taxed. Overseas markets perhaps should be taxed but international law would make that diffixult and we could lose intl trading partners if we tax them so perhaps not. CHRISTOPHER HOWES W003469 22 Apr 2018, 6:52 AM ...GST is totally out of control....It is absolutely legalized THIEF on a grand scale.... The essentials of Human Life should be free of this TAX or Thief... ANDREW MARTIN W003473 22 Apr 2018, 8:42 AM Tax free allowance on earnings with higher rates for top earners. No GST on food! No capital gains on property value increase as result of refurbishment. Encourage NZ residents to buy investment properties to ‘do up’ and sell on, creating decent homes for people. Capital gains should only kick in after the first year of ownership. Tax big corporations more! A lower rate tax on turnover instead of the current rate on profit for any company with a turnover over a set amount. TANIA SHORT W003475 22 Apr 2018, 9:09 AM Perhaps companies that sell over a high threshold amount could be taxed? Not small businesses - but listed companies that are valued in the multiple millions. Even if it were .5% that would provide some benefits to NZ? Tax is complicated and every decision has a flow on effect. I’m also keen on fresh Veges having no tax. NICK WESTGATE W003479 22 Apr 2018, 9:50 AM Too much of the tax burden is on PAYE payers. GST also doubly taxes those who earn (or own) the least. We should tax wealth (e.g. any investments over a certain limit) and use that to reduce PAYE. On another note, it seems extremely unfair to me and my wife that a childless couple whose dual incomes add up to equal (or even exceed) mine pay less tax than I do, as my wife is the primary caregiver to our children and can't work a paying job. This is a strong disincentive to have a family - effectively a tax on parents of the next generation of taxpayers. Regards, Nick. AVERILL DICKSON W003486 22 Apr 2018, 11:02 AM There should be a capital gains tax on property, excluding the family home. LEONTIEN VAN DER BEEK W003509 22 Apr 2018, 5:56 PM Tax farms when sold or passed on to children. Also dont use taxpayers money to support farmers due to expected even if unusal weather conditions. Tax goods bought online, tax tourists a one off at entry for use of infrastructure . RENEE NAUDE W003511 22 Apr 2018, 6:56 PM Make staple food i.e bread, milk, rice, patatoes, certain vegitables and fruit ect tax free. Also to be made tax free is womans sanitary products. If you are single and earn a middle class income there is no tax break or assistance despite the fact that you still need to pay for a house, car, insurance ect. A tax rebate on disability, health and income protection contribution fees , because if needed such personal insurances means less pressure on the public welfare system. ALLAN HURST W003514 22 Apr 2018, 7:43 PM Charities owning a business and not paying any tax is a wrongful act and unfair for others supplying and operating in the same market MARGARET CHAN W003516 22 Apr 2018, 9:08 PM 1. Capital gains tax needed on property owners who sell on within 5 years. 2. No GST on food. 3. Tax anyone who makes money in NZ ... no more overseas owned companies taking 100% profit out of NZ. 4. Pensioners and beneficiaries no tax. 5. First 30k earned is tax free. No more loopholes or rebates so those who excessive salaries and pay almost no tax. DANIEL LANDERS W003524 22 Apr 2018, 10:59 PM We should be taxing charities if they own businesses and also companies like Netflix that make money overseas without paying tax otherwise should be forced to setup an opperations so they can pay tax. OLIVER CROOKS W003532 23 Apr 2018, 4:23 AM We need to tax overseas companies and property sales ADRIAN DELAHUNTY W003541 23 Apr 2018, 9:50 AM Kia Ora - See below suggestions to improve how/what we tax. > Introduce a Capital Gains Tax on property (excluding the family home). > Apply company tax to profits from the commercial activities of charities (i.e. apply company tax to the profits of companies such as Sanitarium). > Abolish provisional tax and introduce a PAYE type system to replace it. > Keep GST simple. 15% tax applied to all products and services. DIANNE BEETHAM W003554 23 Apr 2018, 11:35 AM Taxing food is counterproductive, healthy food is out of reach and all you are doing is to contribute to health issues later costing the health system. Healthy people are out their earning and paying tax, cut tax on food and tax non essentials, dog food ,cat food, soft drinks, snacks (potato chips,corn chips) confectionery, beer,wine as examples. Work out the basic items for a weeks groceries and cut out the tax, ie eggs,bread,milk products,meat,fish. Reduce tax load on low incomes and increase for those on high incomes. ANDREW BOYCE W003558 23 Apr 2018, 12:33 PM The Tax system is working OK as it is. JASON MCQUINN W003564 23 Apr 2018, 1:39 PM Business tax needs some reform, Good employers who hold high staffing levels and fair renumeration should be taxed at a revised rate of business tax. There has been a surge of outsourcing to overseas and redundancies as the last government had no respect for those employers that kept multiple familys in NZ fed. This would help slow the widening gap between low cost import products and kiwi made. Kiwi businesses need a break and a hand up. Give Kiwi businesses the advantage against foreign interests looking to tip our industries over. CRAIG HANSEN W003578 23 Apr 2018, 2:24 PM This "exercise" is a futile waste of taxpayer time, money and resources that will achieve no practical thing for the tax payer, it will provide a vessel for you to attempt to justify your existence at further cost to the ordinary hard working New Zealander supporting all the civil serpents living off our backs who are such a costly burden to us, so much so you need to go in search of more money to squeeze out of us. 30c my foot! and at that rate we work for a minimum of 30% of our time every day before we even get you off our backs to do some thing for ourselves and should we wish to access a service for our tax it is a case of get in the que and waite and or get your own pension. You have got it wrong you should be a workin group that looks at reducing costs not increasing tax. Reduce cost not increase tax. Concider resigning and get a propper job that produces genuine income of your own instead of living off mine and other productive New Zealanders like me. Craig. excuse errors ANTHONY LAST W003588 23 Apr 2018, 4:03 PM It is wrong for seniors to be taxed on superannuation. Seniors have paid tax all their working lives, it is morally wrong to tax them on their pension, particularly as most no longer work for a living. There should be a one off windfall tax on all international companies to help pay for EQC payments FLEUR HARDMAN W003595 23 Apr 2018, 4:31 PM However we need to close the loop holes that allow the rich to often avoid paying their fair share of tax. For example introducing a capital gains tax MARK JONES W003607 23 Apr 2018, 5:08 PM We should not tax interest, any expenditure for research and development of any kind (In fact this should be a credit to the taxpayer paying for this) also on rates or and council, police or Govt fees or fines if applicable. GAVIN WEBB W003628 23 Apr 2018, 6:40 PM GST should not apply to healthy food such as fruit and vegetables, it makes it too expensive for the poor. We should tax all investments, as they are all income deriving. Overseas companies should pay tax on all goods they sell here, they currently have an unfair advantage over local manufacturers. Charities that run businesses should pay tax on the businesses profits. STEPHEN HACKETT W003632 23 Apr 2018, 7:01 PM I would like to have my views taken into account on the following Tax issues. PAYE: The rates that each tax level kicks in need to be adjusted in line with the change in wages each year. Our top rate kicks in to low so clever people just become contractors and avoid tax. Land Tax: A persons property / properties (as long as they are the only ones using them) should be free from taxation other than council rates. I agree that investment properties should be subject to taxation just like my wage income. GST: I support GST as it is payable by everyone. I do however think that food and water (two basic human needs) should be exempt from GST. I don't think GST should be increased as 15% on top of PAYE tax is more than enough for any government to operate with. Corporate Tax: We need to have a corporate tax rate in place that encourages big business to have bases in NZ to provide jobs to us the people. Bottom Line: Have a fair system in place that allows people to get ahead in life! GREG FORDE W003648 23 Apr 2018, 8:09 PM Cut the gst on fresh fruit and vegetables and put it on unhealthy food. Increase gst and reduce income tax especially on the low brackets. These are people who need the most. Plus petrol tax only for Auckland as that is were the money will be spent ALISON WITHERS W003658 23 Apr 2018, 8:35 PM The time to tax New Zealand's top percentile is well overdue! Like every other, hard working New Zealander, they need to pay their fair share. A Capital Gains Tax is needed for those who own more than two properties, inclusive of rental propeties, an Inheritance tax should be introduced for those who inherit Property, assets and businesses exceeding 2 million dollars, a Financial Transaction Tax on money being sent both on and offshore and finally, taxation avoidance loopholes: Shell Companies and the ability for businesses to hide behind charities, need to be closed. ATHENA COTIDIS W003669 23 Apr 2018, 10:00 PM For most smokers, higher taxes on cigarettes is not a deterrent. It never has been and it never will be. Unfortunately, the victims of these taxes are not only smokers but dairy owners who should not have to fear for their safety. We need to be sensible, here. JOANNE MCFADYEN W003675 23 Apr 2018, 11:31 PM • Firstly a Financial Transactions Tax (set at around .01%) which taxes all money going through our banks. This won’t be noticed by any of us day to day but will bring in large sums of money from corporate billionaires and speculators who move billions in and out of New Zealand every day. This tax would replace GST – a vicious tax on low incomes. • Secondly, a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax which would tax the unearned income of the wealthy and the super-wealthy. Wage and salary earners can’t avoid tax. We are taxed on every dollar we earn and every dollar we spend. Why not the billionaires? • Thirdly, we need a much higher top tax rate – currently we have one of the lowest in the world. Why should corporate CEOs pay just 33% on their vastly inflated salaries in tax when much more is demanded in other countries? (Eg Denmark 55.8%; Australia 49%; USA 46.3%; France 54%; UK 45%) HELEN W003679 24 Apr 2018, 7:47 AM Like tobacco and alcohol, sugar should be taxed, actually more, in such products as cola, fizzy drinks and raw white and brown sugar, and Fructose corn syrup, so they don't slip past the net. The huge, and I mean huge, wave of health problems already building up as result of sugar ( and fast foods, but that is harder to stop) will cost the health services millions more than it will have ( looking at kidney failures, leg amputations and blindness only). The tax on fossil fuel in cars is excellent, force more people to public transport and electric cars. The maximum tax rate of 33 cents could easily go back up to 37 or 39 for people earning over a certain amount, even say, $100,000/yr, but families can summate their incomes and divide total to reduce this... Do not tax fat...that has no basis at all...but we are caught up by Big Business again, trying to push limelight off them, Sugar is the bad one..you'll see. JORDAN JOHNSTON W003690 24 Apr 2018, 9:16 AM I think we should scrap secondary tax...people who work a second job need the money. Fruit and veggies and bottled water (only recyclable plastics and other environmentally friendly options) should have a lower tax and those that have a devastating impact on our environment taxed higher (and that money allocated to environmental clean ups). ALCOHOL should be taxed higher. The HPA levy should be higher. Alcohol causes significant harm to our communities and across Aotearoa. I recommend all alcoholic beverages be increased by 50%. Wine excise tax should be brought in line with other beverages, it is strange that it is taxed differently. Funds should be allocated to addiction and mental health services - for a fair and supportive system. For some bottles of wine this increase will only amount to less than a $2 increase therefore it doesnt have significant cost differences but in tax revenue, it will. this in time could potentially reduce harm as we have seen with ciggaretes. JACK CRAW W003696 24 Apr 2018, 9:37 AM NZ needs to tax assets and income earned by overseas companies. I don't favour payroll tax as it intuitively seems to be bad for employment and wage levels. LEE NICHOLLS W003721 24 Apr 2018, 12:21 PM Our tax does seem very low, the state should consider taxing more. Tax is just a reinvestment back into the country to give everyone a better foundation for themselves, their children and wider society. CHE SOFFE W003733 24 Apr 2018, 1:34 PM Get rid of gst as it is a regressive tax that hurts the poor disproportionately. Start taxing wealth and foreign companies that sell their goods here. Also taxing financial transactions should be considered and a payroll tax could help. ADAM JARVIS W003750 24 Apr 2018, 2:55 PM I would ask the TWG to consider changes to the fringe benefit tax system. Currently the framework informing FBT creates a range of perverse transport related outcomes. In particular: 1) the exclusion from FBT of provided onsite carparks 2) the exclusion from FBT of company vehicles provided to individuals. In practice, this means many employees are provided with utes/heavier vehicles rather than smaller, more appropriate vehicles - further while these vehicles are supposedly only used for work purposes, it is an open secret across the country that they are a perk of the job. Head along to any supermarket in the evening and see how many company vehicles parked outside. 3) the inclusion of FBT for public/active transport incentives The result of these policies is that companies are incentivized to provide employees with congestion/pollution/CO2 causing options, while being disincentivized from providing support for employees to cycle or take public transport. SALLY GATES W003763 24 Apr 2018, 4:25 PM Large companies making profits in NZ without a NZ base employing people need to be paying some tax in my opinion. There should be a lower tax free threshold but above $100K needs to be more than 33%. MARIAN SIMONS W003780 24 Apr 2018, 5:14 PM I feel that GST on fresh food should be removed to encourage those on limited incomes to be able to buy better choices in their weekly food basket and to ensure that young children are getting the good foods they need to help their growing bodies. This also includes: 1. Fruit and vegetables 2. Milk and other dairy products 3. Protein - meat, poultry & seafood in the raw uncooked state. Some greater importance be given to looking at how non-dairy products e.g. coconut or soybean products (yoghurts, milks etc) can be subsidised for those children and young people who have a dairy/lactose intolerance or allergy. In a similar fashion for young people who have a gluten intolerance/allergy. Maybe families of these children who live with intolerances could be registered through Families First and receive assistance through WINZ to help pay for these alternative products. ANONYMOUS W003789 24 Apr 2018, 6:30 PM Tax international companies making profit in NZ. Tax activities that have a negative environmental impact. ALASTAIR WHITEFORD W003800 24 Apr 2018, 8:29 PM You do not need to tax anymore things. Government needs to learn to spend the money they have not just tax us more when they run out ANSELM HAANEN W003813 24 Apr 2018, 10:10 PM The tax system is unfair. Wealthy people don't pay their fair share, while poorer people pay too much. Reducing the tax burden on low income earners would better reward them for their labours, reduce related unemployment (which results in a huge drain on the taxpayer), & take many of them out of the degrading welfare system. Increasing the tax burden on the wealthy would have little negative impact on those people - the 'trickle down' effect is a lie. As a society the wealthy seem to feel a sense of entitlement, and that they have obtained their wealth through their hard work. Yet many low income workers work incredibly hard and yet struggle to live. Forcing them to ask for help through the welfare system is degrading and affects their self worth. This flows on to their children. Many of the ills of our society would be reduced if we used the tax system to more equitably spread the wealth. Rather than follow the US model (capital rich) which should follow the Scandinavians. ANONYMOUS W003817 24 Apr 2018, 10:56 PM I've always been hard working, and a proud kiwi. I don't like the idea that me working hard and buying something that will help me make passive income, like a property or an art work, should be penalised. Yes I'm trying to get ahead but shouldn't everyone be incentivised to do so. Not just wait for the hand out. The more hand outs you give, the more dependent we will be. Income tax is already high, and pointed out, a low threshold for the max tax bracket. Why should we be penalised for becoming an educated professional. Lets not become a hand out society like the UK, even Wayne Rooney's family is on benefits, because not working, means you can. DIANE W003823 24 Apr 2018, 11:45 PM We are taxed enough in NZ in one form or another tax on fuel twice possibly 3 or 4 times as government is allowing councils to tax again for roads, short sighted as will add costs to everything through transport of goods and services, rates another tax, increases yearly, middle income are being squeezed for every extra dollar they earn with more tax. No we shouldn’t be taxed on rentals or businesses sold, if you work hard you shouldn’t be penalised for your hard work, government should encourage people to get ahead handouts don’t help anyone long term. Foreign companies should be paying tax, people buying goods from overseas companies must pay gst and milk,fruit vegetables should have no gst JOHN STROH W003833 25 Apr 2018, 4:01 AM Please consider: 1. a Financial Transactions Tax (set at around .01%) which taxes all money going through our banks. This won’t be noticed by any of us day to day but will bring in large sums of money from corporate billionaires and speculators who move billions in and out of New Zealand every day. This tax could allow GST – a vicious tax on low incomes - to be removed from subsistence goods such as food. 2. a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax which would target the unearned income of the wealthy and the super-wealthy. 3. a much higher top tax rate – currently we have one of the lowest in the world. Why should top salary earners pay just 33% tax when much more is demanded in other trading partner countries? (Eg Denmark 55.8%; Australia 49%; USA 46.3%; France 54%; UK 45%) 4. a environmental taxes to combat intensive farming and other unbalanced (mono-cultures) exploitation of the New Zealand environment (such as mussel farming). VIRGINIA LUBELL W003852 25 Apr 2018, 8:07 AM How has the wealth accumulated upwards since the mid1980s? 1) people/corporations hide their money so they are not taxed so stop all tax havens 2) Corporations have merged (Coca Cola for example 'own' 500 brands and they are able to avoid HUGE amounts of taxes through fancy work-arounds and those should be stopped. Humans create economies. Economies since the Great Global Restructuring of the mid1980s intentionally aggregated money upward so it could 'trickle' down. Tax the huge wealth that's aggregated! GRACE MAIRI JAY W003873 25 Apr 2018, 10:30 AM What we are taxing right: - all income; it means we should include interest on capital as income, and it means a capital gains tax. - companies; - GST for services as well as goods, but not essential foodstuffs. What we are not taxing right: - we should not tax foodstuffs deemed to be essential for a healthy diet (e.g. milk, bread and fresh but not processed eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruit, and meat) - we should not tax savings except as they emerge as income; - we should tax COMMERCIAL CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES including: ----- water used for commercial purposes; ----- land used for commercial purposes (that means land not used for commercial purposes, such as native forest and scrub, is not taxed; and capital improvements are not taxed); ------ air - impose a pollution tax; ------ minerals, including aggregate and sand; ------ marine and coastal - tax the occupation of space within marine and coastal areas and tax fishing licences and mineral extraction; A.G. TALBOT W003881 25 Apr 2018, 11:08 AM Overall I am NOT in favour of reducing the total tax take. NZ is a low tax country within the OECD, despite what people think. Policymakers must look to the EU and Scandinavia, not the Anglosphere, as they usually do. NZ needs a wider diversity of taxes to broaden the tax base and reduce significant inequalities, poverty, and to increase the narrow export capacity of the economy. There are MANY options. I support consideration of: a financial transaction tax over $1000 or similar, a wealth tax, significantly increasing the top tax rate over $150K. We have very low top tax rates compared to most other developed countries. Reduce GST to 12%, and remove from fresh fruit and vegetables, as in many other countries. Impose revenue tax on digital multinationals such as Air BnB and Uber. With Air BnB legislate to allow TLA's to levy Air BnBs as part of rates, particularly whole house rentals. A tax on sugar is well overdue, and a big disincentive tax on bottled water for export. PAUL DAIGNEAULT W003886 25 Apr 2018, 11:27 AM I am strongly in favour of keeping things as simple as possible and this means a broad based system. There are however some things that we shouldnt tax or shouldn't tax as heavily as we do. a couple of examples are Superannuation Savings. Currently these long term savings are paid out of tax paid money. An option here is to not to the savings or gains on those savings but to encourage the saving and accelerated compounding which would create a great source of capital funding. You could tax on withdraw and given the 15% GST the government will eventually get its cut. Health Insurance. People who carry health insurance currently pay twice. There should be some tax concession for people to cover thier own health. Similarly people who own multiple vehicles are paying ACC twice. It is time that we had all vehicles on RUC and took the tax out of the fuel. BERNARD WONG W003897 25 Apr 2018, 12:06 PM 1) Recommendation: Revise GST Rate lower and rebates for tourist purchases First, a GST reduction to 10% (from 15%). Second, full GST rebates for eligible purchases for departing tourist. In theory, the shortfall in resulting GST revenue, can be offset by increased income tax revenue from overall economy growth. 2) Problem Solution Summary 2.1) Government/Tax Payer Benefit: Reducing GST to 10% The first benefit will be a more competitive appeal for international students considering New Zealand (NZ) over other education hubs. Meanwhile kiwis will have more savings to invest back into the country. 2.2) Government/Tax Payer Benefit: Full GST rebates for eligible tourist purchases The intended outcome is making (NZ) a competitive destination for international travelers. This sector will be growing competitive with tourist feedback being NZ is being really expensive and has no VAT/GST rebates program for purchases (when compared to other destinations e.g. Australia, Singapore). PHILIP TREMEWAN W003910 25 Apr 2018, 1:36 PM Under our current system, tax heightens inequality rather than reducing it. It also targets just a few areas rather than working across the economic system. We should have some form of wealth taxation - whether though capital gains tax, inheritance tax or land tax. We also need transparency and fairness in our international tax system so the largest companies in the world aren't left paying the smallest share of tax. Our government should work with other governments on transparency eg of trusts - and also to set up a UN tax body to tackled tax avoidance. ELLEN BLAKE W003922 25 Apr 2018, 2:30 PM Taxing income is ok if it is proportional to the ability to pay. So for example 30% on $20,000 is not proportional to 30% on $200,000. Some income levels should not be taxed at all as they are too low, eg $30,000 and under. GST should be reduced as its impact is bigger on lower income people. Owning a home is ok. Owning other houses and investment properties should attract a higher tax rate. Money earned in NZ should be taxed in NZ - so overseas companies pay tax here too. Should support local production of things so that NZ has resilience to global issues, say support a NZ clothing and shoe industry because we have (hopefully) proper wages and working environments rather than the exploitative situation overseas that allows cheap prices. PETER MAYNE W003928 25 Apr 2018, 3:31 PM Tax large global multinational companies and large polluters to increase tax base. Remove GST on food and introduce 0-$20K payee tax free threshold. Tax more on unhealthy items smoking, alcohol. Tax profit on high end items fine art, fast cars, boats. Increase company tax rate to increase tax base. Utilise increased tax from above to increase productivity, wages and incentivize electric vehicle use. Do not introduce any property investment tax. BHAVNA BEN W003933 25 Apr 2018, 4:54 PM The tax system should be simple as possible, low and fair to all humans living and working in nz. Paye- tax rates should be fair and people on minimum to average pay should pay minimum tax. However all must pay tax. eg up to $40k should be lowest tax rate...e.g. 15% $40k-$80k 25% $80-$160K 30% $160K + 35% Most tax policy end up penalising paye employees. Company tax should ideally follow paye rate. We should have capital gains tax on all property/business on sale and follow paye rates. Income should be looked as a whole and offset allowed. Tax should not be charged on subjective value changes of land property or shares, nor on gifting /inheritance as that is double dipping by the state. penalties should be charged to polluters where it is directly traceable. However I see this as penalty not tax. Taxing sugar is pointless and only increase admin. Gst should be flat line and the current system is the best...any changes will only increase beurocracy and Lawyers fees. RICHARD VAN DER JAGT W003943 25 Apr 2018, 6:12 PM I would like to see a reduction in company and individual tax and an increase of tax in areas that impact our environment or health. Areas such as; -introduction of a sugar tax to assist in improving our children's health - tax increase on car tyres and glass, plastics to assist with subdidisiing recycling programs - tax reductions on green energy and cars. - tax reduction on research and development KELLY HENDERSON W003952 25 Apr 2018, 7:34 PM We need a capital gains tax, asap. THERESA REID W003958 25 Apr 2018, 8:05 PM I think GST is good. I don't think we should tax income. We should tax wealth. It would be a simple system once we worked out how to Track wealth. Anything else is a half pie step. However land tax, death duties and capital gains tax would all be an improvement to what we have now. It is important that we encourage investment in productive enterprises rather than houses. ANONYMOUS W003977 26 Apr 2018, 7:03 AM The family home must be included for a fairer NZ KYN DRAKE W003996 26 Apr 2018, 11:57 AM Tax the offshore companies doing business here, especially Facebook. Reduce taxes on peoples essentials, income, vegetables, water etc.. Tax churches and all religions. They do not benefit the communities or the country. MARK GROOS W004017 26 Apr 2018, 5:10 PM tax undeveloped land being land-banked. Increase land supply. councils identify area for expansion, then landowners given a time period to develop until taxes for non development apply. MARIANNE HOLM W004022 26 Apr 2018, 8:22 PM Remove gst on basic foods and kids clothes,/uniforms...and essential hygiene needs.. tampons/towels deodorant soap..basic essentials...water should NOT cost more thank fizzy ...let kids eat cheese fruit and drink water...healthier options .. please JOANNA WELLS W004033 26 Apr 2018, 10:35 PM Definitely should NOT have secondary income tax - that is SO incredibly unfair to people that work two jobs to make ends meat Should not tax vegetables Agree with high cigarette and alcohol tax Houses should be taxed absolutely ALLAN RAMSON W004042 27 Apr 2018, 6:10 AM In the thirties and forties the burden of tax was borne far less by wage and salary earners. Tax was raised on imports by way of tariffs and duties and business profits. As our population grew in the forties, through seventies, the tax take shifted to taxing workers. And in the eighties the tariffs and duties were largely removed from imports. This trend follows population growth and also follows accepted world norms when population growth rate is increasing. Now that our growth has dramatically reduced and doesn't show signs of this trend stopping, a taxation system based heavily on wage and salary earners clearly cannot work long term because of shrinking population growth. There are hundreds of documents on-line that show that taxes need to shift to other sources when we have lower population growth. New Zealand is fixated on it's tiered tax rates for workers, probably due to the misguided belief about fairness. Forget percentages, to be truly fair, look at the dollars contributed. JUNE OSBORNE W004049 27 Apr 2018, 8:38 AM Introduce a 'land' tax, annually for all land which is not being lived-on (excluding arable, farm land etc) to incentivise land-bankers to sell or develop for housing. Local rates incentivise land banking. Introduce income tax for overseas companies who make profit from New Zealand people and businesses, whether or not they have a New Zealand base. If an overseas company is making a profit from New Zealanders, the company should be contributing to New Zealand via tax. DANIEL SHANAHAN W004063 27 Apr 2018, 12:45 PM Everyone should pay the same percentage of their income in tax, it's unfair to make rich people pay a higher percentage because they'd already be paying more anyway even if they paid the same percent. Rich people use way less public services than poor people so they shouldn't have to pay a disproportionate amount for services they don't use like public transport and public health and public education. If the tax rate was a fair percentage for everyone, that is the same percentage, then you would see less tax avoidance from rich people because they would be more willing to pay in a fairer system. The tax system is too complicated, everything and everyone should be taxed equally and universally and quite highly so the government can subsidise highly and make everything free. Like everything should be taxed at 20 percent, anything you earn, buy, own, sell and that should be used to pay for free universal healthcare, education, transport, housing and healthy food, and free to air nz sport JENNIFER NATOLI W004071 27 Apr 2018, 1:38 PM I'm not sure i clicked the right one here. we should not have GST. it's regressive and disproportionately taxes those on lower incomes who spend most of their earnings week to week. we should absolutely have a sensible, simple capital gains tax with some exceptions like family homes. we should tax overseas investors with no NZ base. we should tax the income gained from wealth in some way. luxury items (yachts, really flash cars) should be taxed but let's be sensible - everyone basically needs a computer AND a smart phone AND a decent car AND flat screen TVs. those really aren't luxury given what they're used for in our families. a boat may not be luxury, but a yacht that's used for pleasure not for making a living .... CRAIG W004078 27 Apr 2018, 2:44 PM Better capital, environmental damage and wealth taxes - don't exclude the family home, you could allow some refunds, but avoiding it altogether misses a large chunk of the value in housing. Tax emissions, tax commercial water extraction properly (who cares if Maori want a cut? Do it and pay them a share). We need real reform to balance out the economy and help fix inequality, if you don't do it now, the damage will be even more significant soon. RICHARD JAMES W004094 27 Apr 2018, 3:43 PM Please dont complicate things. We dont need a wealth tax, the wealthy pay plenty thru income tax and consumption tax (GST), both are geared to extract more from the wealthy. Increase those rates if you want to tax more, dont add complexity and feed lawyers and accoutants. On Property, speculation should be (and is) taxed. There is nothing wrong with owning rental property that makes a positivereturn, dont vilify landlords, they provide a service. Vilify speculators, they do nothing for society, in fact they cause harm. "Stuff": what would be the purpose of taxing "stuff"? It requires valuation fees and paperwork and doesnt solve any social purpose unless e.g. you are taxing plastic. Besides, e.g. art and vintage cars is generally a bonus for those who get to see it/them without having to buy them. Just raise GST if you want more revenue from "stuff". KAREN BETONY W004106 27 Apr 2018, 4:10 PM Absolutely businesses that generate income in NZ should pay tax...if I earn money with an overseas organisation I have to pay tax, so should they! The tax free status of charities needs to be looked at. Some criteria is required for individual charities to be eligible for tax free status. Businesses owned by charities should be taxed. KATIA DE LU W004124 27 Apr 2018, 6:22 PM GST is flawed, as it disproportionately affects the poor. Remove GST from food like other countries have. Tax exemption for charities should only be for charitable work and NOT commercial activities; Sanitarium should get taxed on its profits like any other company. Introduce the following taxes: - Estate tax. - Tax on luxury investments like art and fine wine. - A 'Robin Hood' tax on financial transactions (stocks, bonds, currency trading, etc.): small enough to not hurt ordinary people who occasionally need to make a transaction, but enough to dis-incentivise financial traders who make money without adding value. - Tax on the profits of overseas companies; multinationals like Facebook and Google shouldn't be able to profit from us without paying tax. I support Oxfam's proposal of a UN Global Tax Body to ensure multinationals pay their fair share. - Tax companies for the pollution they cause - companies should not be able to externalise environmental costs onto the tax payer! BRENDON CAMERON W004129 27 Apr 2018, 7:09 PM Income tax for the most part works fine, but Secondary Tax penalises those with more than one job (as many NZers now work more than one job), which doesn't balance with the small amount of people who earn a lot from capital gains without paying tax. Additional tax on super and related schemes is very undesirable and anti-saving. Extra banking taxes, deposit and withdrawl taxes are not good at all - our system is much more simple than Australia, so don't overcomplicate it. Additional excise taxes on petrol are excessive when the revenue is not being redistributed evenly to regional NZ. I shouldn't have to pay extra in Southland for Auckland roading when petrol prices are cheaper there. Fuel tax needs major revision - the diesel vehicle road user system is open to abuse and manipulation while there are currently no exemptions for off road petrol vehicles (eg recreational boats, motorcross bikes). GREER LEES W004133 27 Apr 2018, 7:54 PM Tax should be removed from sanitary items. An alternative option is that they are funded through pharmacy so that basics can be provided to those who can't afford them ( perhaps those with a community services card). INDRAVADAN PATEL W004143 27 Apr 2018, 9:56 PM hi? i am a wage earner. my employer deduct paye which is personal tax from my wages. i also pay gst on anything i buy. after paying for my living expeases if i save any money and if i invest that money in term deposit and earn interest i have to pay tax again on interest which is wrong in my opinion. there should be no tax on such return. the money which i invested was already taxed. if this is done people will be encouraged to save more. i hope my suggestion will be taken into consideration. thanks PHILLIPA LAMBORN W004160 28 Apr 2018, 4:14 AM Basically taxing the hell out of citizens isnt going to help our nation. In law we need to define between our citizens and others and start making it work for us. Lets talk about Businesses with no nz base or foreign investors . Put bluntly they are coming in raping our country of resources and taking off with the the profits tax free. From the example that i have see very close to home this must be happening on a MASSIVE scale and nz isnt even recording it or taking notice. In Some cases i doubt this reasource is even collecting gst on goods if it is an international country transfering product from nz to another base in the world. I know personally of a investment group (non-nz) where a member has boasted of paying no tax on income here, own millions in farm land, pays average wages to locals and takes ALL the profits off shore. Foreigners dont even live here and our tax policy allows them to take our reasources tax free yet nzers pay 28 to 30%! Wake up and fix it policy makers. BRENDON HOSKEN W004177 28 Apr 2018, 8:43 AM Need to tax overseas businesses. And need better mechanisms to either catch the cash traders, or capture tax from them another way. With the dramatically increased number of immigrants in Auckland / NZ now, I have personally witnessed large cash transactions ($10,000-$50,000+) happening frequently. ALEX O'CONNOR W004184 28 Apr 2018, 9:14 AM Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission on the future of tax. I believe that GST tax should be removed from female sanitary products. We see too many girls in poverty who skip school or university because their families cannot afford sanitary items, and they're forced to use newspaper or other inadequate substitutes in attempts to control their period. This can lead to them missing many days of school each month, which puts them behind their school work and makes it harder for them to achieve success both at school and in their future. Considering no female chooses to have their period, it is unfair that they are made to pay GST tax on the products they need. SOPHIE W004196 28 Apr 2018, 11:04 AM I believe that tax should be removed from sanitary items (pads and tampons) as there is a real issue in New Zealand with period poverty. There are many woman in this country that can not afford this basic necessity and are using things such as socks, newspaper, or simply going without and this is not okay. Menstruation is a normal biological reality for almost all women ranging in age from early teens to menopause. These women should be able to access sanitary items as a basic need. Please consider this and thank you. FAY BRORENS W004209 28 Apr 2018, 12:44 PM we need to tax things that are detrimental to our environment and health. Think LONG term. KELLY SCREEN W004225 28 Apr 2018, 2:44 PM We are taxing some of the right things, but there are many areas that we could do better. I believe that it would be better to have a higher top bracket for personal income tax - say $150,000 or even $250,000 at 40% - and lower the percentage for the bottom bracket to say 9%. I think that we should introduce a capital gains tax on assets, businesses and property. For property, it should exclude the family home and maybe one investment rental (or Bach), and could possibly be built on a sliding scale so that the more property you own the higher the rate. I believe that the charity status of businesses which turn a profit should be reviewed. To be tax exempt they must put a sizable portion of all profits back into the community. We should be more vigilant in collecting tax from those companies who evade it, and perhaps with this extra revenue we could look at lowering the company tax rate to help increase investment into businesses who employ people and produce goods and services. H RIDDELL W004234 28 Apr 2018, 3:23 PM Encouraging retirement savings where people are able to is an important in managing the costs of an ageing population. It would be important to consider the costs and benefits of different tax options against the current system in terms of future proofing retirement savings to meet spikes in end of life costs. With the changing nature of work it would also be important to consider whether 'nudge' policies such as tax incentives to save in Kiwisaver or similar will remain sufficient in the long term with a move from traditional work structures to a self-employed model. Using taxes to modify behaviour should be used with attention to any wider economic impacts and also with a view to the interface between local and central government taxes. Levies on domestic water use in many local jurisdictions for example already provide incentive to reduce and minimise usage. TIM W004251 28 Apr 2018, 4:57 PM Tax corporates more, or work out how to tax them properly (ie google, facebook, apple) pay MINIMAL tax to NZ, but extract a lot more value from NZers. Ireland has just recently taken Apple to Court, and came back with Apple having to pay the Irish Governmnet !6.7 BILLION dollars in avoided taxes. Remove GST on healthy food options, doctors visits, electricity, etc. for lower income earners. There has been a massive failure in tax policy when it comes to property - Home ownership rates have decreased markedly in the past 30 years, partly because of rampant property speculation and no capital gains tax. AARON MILLER W004265 28 Apr 2018, 6:25 PM Tax wealth, as it proportionally affects everyone and fairly. Things like a fuel tax disproportionately affects the poorer people MICHAEL RUTLAND W004283 28 Apr 2018, 8:37 PM NZ needs savers, and so GST is an excellent way of taxing consumption, although higher rates may well be appropriate. Company tax is applied to profits, so it is primarily an earnings tax on savers. The situation is not ideal, but as the Company tax rate is close to the upper income tax rate, there is some justification. Income tax is unremarkable, although the high proportion paid by the top 20% of earners means there is little room for manoevre (other than reducing the rates). The simplicity of the NZ tax system and small number of exclusions/allowances is a breathe of fresh air. Please avoid the temptation to make it complicated. The total tax take compares well with other developed Countries. I do not believe that it is a proper role for government to take over the majority of the national economy. WADE DEVINE W004297 28 Apr 2018, 11:01 PM We should be taxing capital gains to level the playing field against other forms of saving and investments. Any new taxes must not be retrospective. Some charities are using their charitable status to run business to avoid tax. CORWIN W004308 29 Apr 2018, 9:10 AM Yes, good idea, fact sheet. I reckon taxing companies with no NZ base that sell things here is a good idea. We could lead the world and stop people turning a profit only because they’re in a tax haven and don’t pay for anyone’s core services. Same with capital gains tax. There should be one. I’d leave charities alone since they do a lot of work the government don’t have the money or people power to do. Or maybe a very small tax such as 4.5%. GST free fruit and vegetables would be very good. (But more complex for software developers like me to implement! That’s a small thing though) JEN OLSEN W004322 29 Apr 2018, 10:21 AM Tax revenue should be gained from those who are benefiting from the structure and functioning of society, in order to provide services to all citizens and assistance to those who need it. Therefore, all income, whether gained from employment, investment returns or property sales (excluding an only home) should be taxed in a graduated way. Companies operating in New Zealand and gaining profit from NZ citizens should be taxed on the profit made. If they are not based in NZ, taxation needs to take place at the point at which money leaves the country. Financial transactions should be taxed at a low level, eg, 1c per $100 at the point at which they take place. Food, as an essential item, should not be taxed with GST, with the possible exception of foods with negative health impacts, such as sugary drinks and high fat content fast food. Increasing taxation on petrol, alcohol, cigarettes and other socially undesirable items is a way to reduce their use and gain funding to mitigate harm. DIANE DYKGRAAF W004328 29 Apr 2018, 10:36 AM I think there are a few things that need to start paying tax. Offshore businesses should pay just like any other. Charities who own businesses should be taxed like any other business and i think that people who buy and sell properties should also have to pay tax on their gains. It's all about fairness. JULIAN JOY W004354 29 Apr 2018, 1:40 PM There are many ways of legally avoiding paying tax in NZ, as in many countries around the world. Some here are able to be seen as unfair when considering the size of our population and economy. For example massive foodstuff suppliers that are owned by a church and are very profitable businesses pay no tax as they are registered as charities. This is grossly unfair to a normal business in the same market and must significantly reduce the tax income of the government. It is also grossly unfair to the non-members of the subsidized church. Ordinary persons in the population are thereby subsidizing a church that they have no involvement with; meanwhile possibly donating to support their own church with wages after income tax and GST and so on has been paid. There needs to be a limit on the charity size or type that can be declared tax exempt. GABRIELLA BARBARA W004359 29 Apr 2018, 1:47 PM No to capital gains. This will push propert prices up or make people hold onto property longer. If this was to come in the government must include rebates for improvements If money is made in NZ then it should be taxable. Eg off shore companies CLAIRE ROSS W004365 29 Apr 2018, 2:03 PM Things That Should Not Be Taxed\* Or Should Have Tax Reduced/Modified - Fresh fruit and vegetables\* - Feminine hygiene products\* - A tax free threshold for income, even if only for those on the lower tax brackets - WINZ & StudyLink payments\* - The amount that citizens can purchase from overseas before duties and GST are charged, as NZ can have limited options (Australia’s is $1000, but even $500 NZD would be fairer) Things That Should Have Tax Increased/Modified - A higher tax bracket than $70, 000 plus. Someone earning $70, 000, a relatively median income compared to the rest of the developed world, should not be paying the same as someone earning $180, 000 or more - Businesses without an NZ base should still have to pay a rate of tax in NZ proportional to the amount they sell - Junk food in supermarkets. NZ has incredibly cheap junk food and incredibly expensive fresh produce, which encourages poor health choices and obesity in low socioeconomic families (mine included) ANONYMOUS W004371 29 Apr 2018, 2:34 PM In terms of charities, there are currently no rules to ensure businesses with exemptions under CW42 of the ITA 2007 are distributing money to charities. I would like to see tax play a part in this for example removing CW42 to encourage deductible donations, or, a refundable tax credit system (similar to what is used in Maori entities). I would also like to see the ability for charities to access imputation credits from investments. NIGEL JEMSON W004377 29 Apr 2018, 2:55 PM I think that we are mainly taxing the right things. In my comments on the future of the tax system, I have stated that I support a land tax. This a major area of wealth in New Zealand that is currently untaxed. This would enable the tax rate on other things (i.e. personal income) to be reduced. I would be wary of using the platform of the Tax Working Group to introduce a whole new series of taxes (e.g. carbon tax, sugar tax). These would introduce a lot of deadweight costs into our economy - the Government would need to set up more bureaucracy to administer these taxes and businesses would have to spend more of their time focusing on complying with such taxes. There's no convincing evidence that tax is the best solution to issues such as excess sugar consumption and pollution of the environment vs. other modes of action such as regulation. ANONYMOUS W004394 29 Apr 2018, 3:23 PM We should spend time investigating how to tax overseas companies/trade who do not have a NZ base. Especially with the increase of online shopping on overseas websites. DICK LANE W004408 29 Apr 2018, 3:49 PM The broad base is simple, but measures are needed to avoid harmful effects ( e.g. subsidies for healthy foods). Our GST level should be reduced. Broad taxes on wealth and capital gains are needed. Taxes on environmentally and socially harmful activities are needed. Ways need to be found to tax equally spending and profits that are leaving the country through the digital economy and other ways. Ways will need to be found to include bitcoin and similar transactions. ANN MARTIN W004410 29 Apr 2018, 3:51 PM Government needs to provide better incentives to encourage people to save for retirement. Taxing our every effort to save is a disincentive. It encourages dependency. It may mean reducing certain taxes on savings or using other means to support saving for / and funding retirement and other major living expenses eg buying house. Kiwisaver could provide greater support incentives to encourage and increase savings. New Zealanders are too heavily taxed. Government must make better use of taxes it collects and or find other ways to generate money it wants to use. International companies need to pay tax to the New Zealand Government. MICHAEL KEEHAN W004413 29 Apr 2018, 3:57 PM We need to ensure that we fairly tax the main advantages the wealthy have over the "not-so" wealthy. The advantages are "debt-leveraging" , "gaming the system" via estate planning and inter-generational transfers of wealth privilege. Currently a young person can find it very hard to accumulate enough to generate a house deposit. Once, a not quite as young, person has a mortgage they are away... This process is amplified by land-lords who can bid up prices by negative gearing. The capital gains are not the problem - it is the untaxed debt leveraging. Everyone should have enough assets to pay for a house and their superannuation. Once a person has "excess assets" they should be taxed based on a asset-value risk free rate of return (like foreign shares) . Having a threshold i.e. first $1,000,000.00 assets tax free and then deeming a rate of return in effect protects the "family home" but allows people freedom in lifestyle and use of capital. NICK ROCHE-KERR W004421 29 Apr 2018, 4:33 PM We generally tax income and expenditure (through GST and various duties), which are economically the most transparent and the simplest. Proposing more complex taxes (ranging from capital gains to specific purported 'good' or 'bad' things) tends to lead us into much more complicated and much more distortionary areas. While there may be very noble reasons, the purpose of tax should be collecting revenue (preferably as cheaply as possible - for both the Crown and the taxpayer) and not attempting to achieve social engineering (which, even if a desired aim, could probably be achieved more effectively and efficiently through other measures). MIKE DUCKETT W004437 29 Apr 2018, 6:15 PM Please ensure that charities , who have a beneficial tax status, are in fact taxed if the level of 'good' they do is measured to be below the general tax rate, 28 or 33% as appropriate. For example churches, food banks, schools should distribute charity before buying motorbikes, boats or paying high wages, or other non good expenses. If they do this tax them like a company. A variable level of tax could be added to top up their level of 'good' to the required rate is below 28/33% rather than a fixed amount, although it makes things more complicated. SHARON MARKS W004441 29 Apr 2018, 7:05 PM GST should be removed off some foods as in Australia it would not be difficult just consult with them!!. Countdown and New World have their dockets set up already. . Tax should not be paid on Superannuation as in Australia,as they have a tax free threshold of $18200.00. Our Superannuation is becoming difficult to live on. Taxing Big Business like Sanitarium who send their profits to the United States and hiding behind a Religion is not good enough. Churches such as Brian Tamaki's farce for a Religion should not be exempt from paying Tax either, he does not run a true Charity. Big Business not paying their fair share of tax, the Law should be changed, the wage earner has no way of cheating the Tax Man like Business with all its deductions for this and that. Also are the four Big Banks paying the correct tax on their massive profits? Capital Gains Tax should be introduced on Land Banking which is a reason our new housing is so expensive. MIKE WALLER W004453 29 Apr 2018, 8:07 PM I think that the tax base could be extended to cover a greater range of activities. My thoughts/suggestions are as follows: Long-term property / businesses - I believe that all economic activity/investments should be capital gains taxed to reflect that the investments are made for economic reasons. By targeting economic activity no one class of assets should be more or less disadvantaged. Other aspects to consider are a deminimus threshold and assessing on an annual basis rather than upon realisation (to push for cashflow (profit) maximisation). Charities - should be taxed on profits and economic activity as well to remove the significant competitive advantage that tax free status has. Maybe allow deduction when money is ACTUALLY spent on charitable cause. Overseas entities - should be taxed more but not really sure how as a unilateral approach may have unintended consequences. Other - comfortable with payroll, inheritance or retirement savings tax settings as current. DANIELA BAGOZZI W004458 29 Apr 2018, 8:29 PM We are not taxing the right things. We need to: 1) Set an income threshold below which we do not tax, and higher tax rates at the upper end 2) Ensure that company tax and tax paid by family trusts is set at the appropriate level (and that companies or trusts are not used as ways of avoiding higher rates of tax). 3) Ensure that those who derive their income from buying and selling assets that appreciate in value are taxed (when the capital gain is realised, and not allow these gains to go offshore untaxed) 4) Look at taxing the use of fossil fuels, other activities that generate pollution 5) We should look at a 'financial transaction tax' 6) We should bring back 'Stamp Duty' on property transactions (a very small percentage of the value of the transaction, with an exemption threshold set at an appropriate level so that that 'ordinary' homes and small business premises are exempt, while luxury homes pay the appropriate rate. 7) Tax empty homes in areas with a housing shortage DAVINA W004461 29 Apr 2018, 8:38 PM Food, particularly fruit, vegetables, meat amd milk should not be taxed. These are essentials that some people cant afford . Make it more affordable for them ANONYMOUS W004475 29 Apr 2018, 9:37 PM I don't think we should have petrol tax in Auckland as it doesn't include those road users using electric vehicles. JOCELYN PAPPRILL W004483 29 Apr 2018, 9:53 PM I'd like to see a Capital Gains Tax (excluding the family home) as this type of tax is normal practice in many similar countries. A capital gains tax on property sales means all income is treated the same for tax purposes. A lack of capital gains tax has pushed house prices up hence increasing inequality. A carbon tax is vital if we are to even begin to address our carbon reduction targets our country signed up to in Paris. A Financial Services Tax also should be introduced - not sure why we pay GST on food but on when we trade/exchange money. CAROLINE SYDDALL W004491 29 Apr 2018, 10:36 PM We need to tax more forms of capital with capital gains, financial trading and inheritance taxes. We need taxes on environmentally and socially negative products and services, e.g. pollution, unhealthy food etc. Fundamentally we need to tax the rich so that our society can become a more just one. Our current distaste for tax ignores the basic and important fact that taxes can potentially lead to a more equitable society and can be used to provide the basic goods and services that are human rights. RICHARD KELLER W004518 30 Apr 2018, 8:03 AM As wealth has been used to further the ideology of dominance (planetary ecosystem, class in human relationships, etc) and increased inequality, wealth must be a strong focus of tax. (Capital gain could be a part of that, focusing on difference from a norm which is based on balancing negative impacts and enhancing impacts on the planet.) Tax cannot be separated from other aspects of ecosystem relationships, human relationships, government, etc. Once those fundamental changes are accomplished then the tax environment will look different. Taxes on Co2, pollution, etc., will be possible. GARFIELD TORO W004529 30 Apr 2018, 9:31 AM Impose/extend sugar, food preservative, alcohol, cigarette and fuel taxes to offset health and environmental costs. BARRY PRIOR W004535 30 Apr 2018, 10:14 AM I hope the TWG carefully considers the need to bring the taxation of Maori businesses into line with others as the income being generated using treaty settlements is significant and any preferential tax treatment will adversely effect total revenue and load the burden on others which would be unfair and divisive. We must have a level playing field in tax matters. MEGAN BRADY-CLARK W004541 30 Apr 2018, 11:06 AM New Zealand has done well to have a relatively simple (by international standards) tax system, meaning that collection costs are kept down. However, the burden is not spread as it should be. It's great that NZ has fewer exemptions for companies than other countries, yet we still have a major problem with multinationals, in particular, not paying their share of tax. And, in this day and age, it's outrageous that religions are permitted a tax-free status, especially as so many are essentially run as businesses (see, for example, Destiny's Church, or the vast swathes of land the Anglican church owns). It's disgusting that companies like Sanitarium - a huge, profit-making company - should be allowed to hide behind religion. DAVID MARSHALL W004556 30 Apr 2018, 12:00 PM While I support GST overall, I am concerned that there is a substantial "black market" operating in NZ where for cash GST is excluded for many tradespeople. This needs to be better monitored and stopped. GST on taxes such as property rates is an anomaly that needs to be removed. A tax on a tax is completely unacceptable. With aging infrastructure Local Body rates are increasing faster than inflation and those on fixed incomes, and especially the elderly are being forced to move from their homes due to the rates burden. Removing GST and review the income level for the rates rebate system would bring considerable relief to a large cash-strapped sector of our society. Income tax needs to be adjusted to include a tax-free income & then lower rates until over the median NZ income . Property Investment & Company Sale Capital Gains on 50% of profit to be taxed as part of income where properties or businesses are sold within 10 years of acquisition (sliding scale of exemption). DAVID W004560 30 Apr 2018, 12:10 PM I would like to see more taxing of ownership, primarily a land tax but also a capital gains tax so long as it accounts properly for inflation (only taxing real gains). I like the universality of GST to reduce bureaucracy for business owners/IRD. I am strongly against the tax exempt status of certain charities which are primarily religious organisations, e.g. Sanitarium, as I do not like subsidising organised religion against my will. The current system of tax imputation for people receiving dividends from companies is fantastic and should be kept as it helps encourage business investment in a country which really needs stronger capital markets and more support for productive businesses. If more tax were raised from a land tax, I would like to see reduction in income tax (especially at the lower end, perhaps a tax free allowance) to compensate. SALLYANN HART W004571 30 Apr 2018, 12:43 PM In order to best support the poorest in the country, I think that the first $10,000 of earned income should be tax free. Also it would help families and pensioners if basic foodstuff was not taxed and basic children's clothes and shoes. GRAEME W004578 30 Apr 2018, 1:18 PM Overseas companies that are doing business in New Zealand need to pay tax regardless of where they are based or kiwi businesses are at a disadvantage. It doesn’t need to be much, but that money should go into helping enhance kiwi business and opportunities MONICA W004591 30 Apr 2018, 2:18 PM Don't tax income generated from earning already taxed. No inheritance tax as parents have paid tax on that. Don't lump mum and pop rental property owners( who save and go without to invest in property) with property investors and speculaters. Capital gains on property bought for long term investment should not be taxed. The brightline test of 5-7 years is fair. Charities with businesses making profit should be taxed. Foreign business should be taxed. Kids under 18 should not be taxed or all income under a certain amount should be tax free. Essentials - food etc should be gst free No secondary tax ROSS PRINGLE W004600 30 Apr 2018, 2:54 PM The commercial activities of registered charities should be subject to the same taxes as other businesses their products and services compete with. Sales of businesses should be taxed. Overseas businesses that earn revenue in NZ should pay tax on it. There should be some form of capital gains tax. ANONYMOUS W004606 30 Apr 2018, 3:07 PM We are taxing the right things and at about the right rates. Our big failing is not doing enough to collect revenue from multinationals that generate large revenues here but use transfer pricing and other methods to avoid contributing to the economy that supports them. We should also levy GST on personal imports, both to protect the local retail trade and to collect tax on an ever-increasing volume of trade via the internet. It would not be hard to design and implement a system to collect tax from Alibaba, Amazon and other online traders without adding disproportionately large transaction or inspection fees. CHRISTINA ROBERTSON W004633 30 Apr 2018, 4:22 PM We should absolutely tax capital gains - the current situation is unbalanced and unfairly privileges certain kinds of investments. I also believe there's a case for stamp duty on property transactions. I don't think charities' income should be taxed, though we should continue to look carefully at whether organisations' purposes are truly charitable. ANONYMOUS W004637 30 Apr 2018, 4:26 PM Please give due consideration to a net wealth tax to replace the current income tax. Facts for consideration: 1) FY17 Govt income tax was about $28b, 2) Total household net worth was about $1.65 trillion, 3) To replace the income tax revenue with a tax on net worth would be a tax rate of only 1.7%. 4) There is an increasingly large group of people who own many assets but pay little tax because the assets generate little net "income", whilst still hugely increasing net wealth (opinion: this seems to be grossly unfair) Pros: 1) It would make the vast majority of households (maybe >99%) better off, 2) This would make it more politically acceptable than a capital gains tax. 3) It would increase the disposable income of all income tax paying people without increasing business costs, 4) The people who are worth the most would pay the most, as opposed to the current income tax where only those earning "income" pay (and these people are not the most wealthy, even those on high salaries), ROB MCCAW W004647 30 Apr 2018, 4:33 PM Need wealth taxes, pollution taxes, resource use taxes/levies. I strongly support a UBI. PETER PARNHAM W004663 30 Apr 2018, 4:54 PM After saving hard out of after tax income I would deeply resent a wealth tax, a land tax, or a general capital gains tax on investments, as it is double taxation. KiwiSaver is a TTE scheme, and to be consistent, my personal savings should be treated the same. In my view a land tax is mooted mainly because it is simple to collect. If it excludes the family home, it will unfairly burden renters. If it includes the family home then it is a proxy wealth tax/poll tax. Cash flowing and complying with the clumsy FIF taxes show how silly CGT on investments can get in pursuit of some theory or other, and it also discourages diversity in savings. Sure, the housing crisis is a big problem. Ring fencing tax losses and the five year bright line test is a reasonable response, but blanket CGT will not solve the housing crisis. Inequality is a worry, if needs be adjust the progressive tax rates for that. Yes, tax overseas free loaders. MALCOLM HINE W004672 30 Apr 2018, 5:08 PM Tax on the Rates is a Tax on a Tax. Cannot be right. Taxing the interest earned on Savings is the reason for the poor number of savings accounts held by Kiwis. Banks offer very poor interest rates for savings and after the tax is removed it amounts to such a small gain that it is not worth bothering with. Grandchildren receive 60c interest on their savings AND IT IS TAXED. This is why we do not bother to put money , which has already been taxed,into savings accounts for them. PETULA JEFFERIES W004684 30 Apr 2018, 5:30 PM Tax processed foods, salt, sugar Tax packaging, plastics etc that is not reusable or organic Tax all incomes more fairly whether from airbnb, b&b, selling eggs, property etc as those with no incomes other than interest on savings are taxed Much higher tax rates on earnings 5x over the Living Wage Stop tax on earnings less than the Living Wage Stop secondary tax Stop GST on fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and meat Tax takeaways MARY NEATE W004705 30 Apr 2018, 6:46 PM Top rate income tax could be higher and the first $5000 of income could be tax free (like the UK system of tax allowances). This would help address inequality in society which is too great even if it is not increasing. Property should be taxed similarly to businesses or share ownership. This would encourage investment in more productive assets and may help boost NZ's poor productivity. Charities should be taxed in some form - would require a bit of care to do well. Churches should not automatically be treated as charities - they need to demonstrably do good work in society. Global & digital businesses - this has to be an international solution so maybe NZ should put more effort into building an international consensus on this - we're good at consensus building. Pension age should increase, at least for those in sedentary occupations. More tax, less pension. IAN LEATHERLAND W004719 30 Apr 2018, 7:54 PM Capital gains tax should be incurred on properties except for the a family home and one other property such as a batch or rental property. JUSTIN CONNOLLY W004728 30 Apr 2018, 8:21 PM We are absolutely not taxing the right things. The current tax system is taxing only the FLOW of money through part of the economy, not the STOCKS of wealth that exist within it. This is an important distinction because a lot of wealth can be tied up in non- productive assets that do not necessarily produce a flow of money or income in the interim. This puts an disproportionate and unnecessary burden on those flows of money that do exist. For example, I pay money on income, I pay money on interest earned in the bank or dividends paid from shares (all flows), yet I do not pay tax on the wealth that I have in my home. We have a tax incentive to invest in housing. Is it then any wonder that we have a housing affordability crisis? We need to take a broader- based perspective to tax and tax wealth in general, not just the flows of money. This is both right and left wing: it is equitable, while it also encourages the flow of investment to the those assets that provide the best return. KARL SWART W004731 30 Apr 2018, 8:25 PM I think it is unacceptable that our government has been so consistently unable to introduce capital gains tax. We've created a system that promotes investment in real estate over business which means that a select number of New Zealanders have gained significant wealth at the cost of many others for whom home ownership is out of reach. Had these funds instead been invested in business we may have seen significantly more economic growth, not just growth driven by immigration. I see only one real excuse for our lack of capital gains tax - consecutive governments who are unwilling to make changes because they do not wish to scare away wealthy voters. There would be no need to ban foreign buyers if we actually made sure that returns on property was taxed fairly as it is in most of the rest of the world. ALOY RAYEN W004745 30 Apr 2018, 8:45 PM While we tax most sources of income there are others that we do not tax or don’t tax adequately. In addition to tax there should also be incentives to save and create wealth. What we don’t tax adequately are those international companies that conduct business in NZ and get away with paying little or no tax . There should also be a large stamp duty on all foreigners buying property in NZ . Banning foreigners from buying property is not the answer except if it is a strategic asset . With regards to wealth created by New Zealanders it we should be encouraging rather than discouraging it . If this is to be taxed then it should be taxed at a very small percent say 1% and only to the extent of the gain that is realised . No unrealised gain should be taxed. I don’t believe that the incentives for investors on rental property should be removed all together. At least those owning one rental should be exempt . The reason for this is that people need added income in retirement to supplement super ANONYMOUS W004751 30 Apr 2018, 8:53 PM Should tax tourist for using services especially use of hospitals and health care services. ALISON BEST W004775 30 Apr 2018, 9:36 PM Tax capital gain only for properties sold within 5 years of purchase. Exclude the family home and owner used holiday homes from the bright line test. Gaining Charity status in NZ needs to be redefined as non profit organisations assisting people who need help as they are significantly disadvantaged (ill health , poverty , physical or intellectual disability) in comparison to the average population, carry out non profit research to reduce disadvantage and those assisting animals and the environment. That is you are not a charity if you are distributing to people who are no more than shareholders with the required religion or race for example. Charity based businesses that are commercial operations need to be taxed as a normal business and if their profits are donated to a charity then they receive the usual 33 % tax refund on that payment. Charities businesses dealing primarily with donated goods or labour can operate tax free. They are not in competition with business. PETER MARTIN W004785 30 Apr 2018, 10:06 PM Company tax needs a massive change. How about dumping all present company taxes / structures and just have a "spend tax" Any money spent by the company is taxed, wages, fuel, pens, new plant, shares, drawings, transfers out of NZ etc. Just have to pay 10%. The logic here is that if a company has money to spend then it has earned it a portion must be paid as tax. At end of month add up the outgoings and sent tax to govt. Real simple. Catches the Mega companies with "shell companies in multiple countries" set up to avoid taxes. It is legal at present, but morally wrong in my opinion. From newspaper reports some have had billon dollar turn overs and paid 1 million in tax. 0.1% tax rate. If govt captured these mega company tax dodges at say 10% rate then wage earners would get a break as the tax burden is moved off them and personal income tax rates could be lowered. M COLLINGWOOD W004792 30 Apr 2018, 10:28 PM Our tax structure needs to encourage us all to thrive. Therefore I believe: Long Term Property Investment - No tax. This is security. Selling a Business - No CGT. We want to encourage businesses in NZ. The resultant productivity and employment is important. We need to support the efforts of those who take the responsibility of funding and growing their own businesses. Wealth Tax - No Wealth taxes. This would be double-dipping and a total disincentive to strive. Instead, how about a 'user pays' approach - eg.a higher GST on luxury goods (high end cars etc) - we then have a choice and more tax revenue is collected. International - push hard with the BEPS - eg APPLE avoiding tax - Aust/NZ treaty. Charities - No tax. However we can gather a lot more revenue by removing charity status from the controversial entities eg.Maori business being classed as Charitable Trusts (eg. Tainui 2017 profit $137m/1.2 billion in assets/ need to start paying their fair share). Thank you. STEPHEN LEON W004800 30 Apr 2018, 10:55 PM As with other OECD countries, efforts to collect taxes from offshore companies operating here should be sharpened. Not a fan of a capital gains or death tax as practiced elsewhere. MATTHEW BLAIR W004806 30 Apr 2018, 11:35 PM Tax policy must aspire to remain simple and if anything encourage productive and postive use of resources. Such as the a land tax. Relatively easy to implement, fair and transparent, impossible to evade and discourages the resource being used ineffeciently.
