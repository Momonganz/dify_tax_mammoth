### 1.1 Purpose of This Report

1.1.1 The Committee's recommendations on the main features of the international tax reforms and the imputation scheme were outlined in Part 1 of its Report on International Tax Reform and its Report on Imputation. The Government's response to these recommendations was outlined in press statements issued jointly by you and the Minister of Revenue. These were published with the Committee's reports. With three reservations, the Government accepted the Committee's recommendations on the international reforms while those on imputation were accepted in full.

1.1.2 The purpose of this report is to outline the Committee's recommendations on the outstanding issues relating to both sets of reforms and to present the Committee's draft of the legislation. We comment only on those areas where we have found it necessary to modify our original recommendations and on issues which were left undecided in our earlier reports. In all other respects, the draft legislation implements the recommendations of the previous reports.

1.1.3 The aim of this report is therefore to provide interested parties, once you have made your decisions, with an explanation of the policy behind the draft legislation. The report is not intended as an exhaustive guide to the draft legislation. It does not restate all of the arguments or conclusions reached in the Committee's first two reports. This report should therefore be read in conjunction with the earlier reports. We do, however, elaborate our views on a number of the issues which have been raised in response to our previous reports.

### 1.2 Outline of the Report

1.2.1 The report is contained in two volumes. Our recommendations are presented in this volume. The Committee's draft of the legislation covering the international regimes, the imputation and the withholding payment system and related reforms is contained in a separate volume which forms an annex to this report.

1.2.2 The present chapter includes further comment on a number of issues which are central to the Committee's recommendations. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 outline the Committee's recommendations on the remaining details of the branch-equivalent ("BE") regime to apply to certain controlled foreign companies ("CFCs"). Chapter 5 discusses the outstanding issues relating to the foreign investment fund ("FIF") regime. Trusts are dealt with in chapter 6, while disclosure and default provisions are the subject of chapter 7. Transitional issues relating to the international reforms are considered in chapter 8.

1.2.3 Chapter 9 outlines the Committee's views on the remaining issues concerning the imputation and withholding payment regimes. Consequential and related changes to other aspects of the existing tax law are dealt with in chapter 10. Finally, chapter 11 draws together all of the recommendations of the previous chapters and makes a number of concluding remarks.

1.2.4 Annex 1 of the separate volume consists of the Committee's draft of the legislation on the international tax reforms. Annex 2 in the same volume presents the Committee's draft of the legislation on imputation, the withholding payment system and related matters.

### 1.3 "Grey List Exemption"

1.3.1 Residents are to be exempt from the BE regime in respect of interests in CFCs resident in certain "grey list" countries unless such a CFC utilises a listed significant tax preference available in a grey list country. These countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, Australia, France and Japan. The list is referred to as "grey" because it may be qualified by the listing of certain significant tax preferences.

1.3.2 Since by far the bulk of existing New Zealand investment overseas is in these countries, it is not surprising that further elaboration of the exact details of the operation of the grey list exemption have been sought by tax practitioners and businesses. In addition, a number of criticisms have been made: that the list should be expanded, perhaps to include all of the countries with which New Zealand has a tax treaty; that it should not be qualified by the listing of preferences; that no criteria have been given for deciding what preferences would be listed; that there should be no "look through" of a CFC resident in a grey list country to CFCs underneath it; and that the compliance costs of the regime would be unmanageable if it frequently applied to CFCs in grey list countries.

1.3.3 These concerns to some extent reflect the uncertainty that arises when tax reforms are developed during a consultative process. Though everyone would wish to see uncertainty minimised to the greatest extent possible, some considerable uncertainty is inevitable if the Government's reform proposals are to be the subject of private sector input and consultation. The trade off is that a better result will usually emerge. It is not possible to have consultation and certainty.

1.3.4 In Part 1 of our Report on International Tax Reform, we said the list should include countries "which have comprehensive international tax rules including CFC regimes" (page 19 of our report). The governing principle for listing a country is that, if the BE regime were applied in respect of CFCs resident in that country, it would be probable that the tax credit allowed for tax paid by a CFC resident there would be sufficient to offset the New Zealand tax liability on that income. In other words, the compliance costs of the regime would be excessive in relation to any revenue likely to be raised.

1.3.5 Whether or not the income tax paid by a CFC is likely to be comparable to the tax that would be levied on its income under the BE regime will depend on the definition of taxable income in its country of residence (such as whether there are significant tax preferences), income tax rates, the efficiency of the tax administration and the extent to which the domestic tax base is protected from avoidance. The existence of comprehensive international tax rules is relevant to the last factor, in particular. The tax legislation by itself may suggest that nominally high rates of tax will be payable, but if there are international planning opportunities effective rates may be very different.

1.3.6 We consider that the existence of a CFC regime is indicative of an income tax system and administration in respect of which it can reasonably be assumed that the effective tax rates on business income in those countries do not depart substantially from the statutory rates. In addition, the CFC regime of the grey list country tends to support the New Zealand BE regime where residents hold interests in CFCs resident outside a grey list country through intermediate companies resident in such a country.

1.3.7 We do not consider that the list should be extended to include all of New Zealand's tax treaty partners. The treaties are entered into to relieve double taxation, promote trade and advance our relationships with other countries. They say nothing about the robustness of the tax system of the treaty partner nor its comparability with New Zealand's. That is not relevant to the decision to establish a treaty. Indeed, we have suggested that a number of our treaty partners should be listed on the transitional list of low tax jurisdictions.

1.3.8 If the grey list is to serve its purpose, provision must be included for its qualification by the listing of preferences. Until recently, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom gave substantial tax preferences to a broad range of businesses. If the list were being considered, say, four years ago, it would have been necessary to either exclude these two countries or to designate the preferences that would trigger the application of the BE regime. Because so much of New Zealand's investment is in these countries, the compliance costs of the BE regime will depend importantly on whether a country is listed with preferences or the country is excluded from the list altogether. Listing with a qualification for certain preferences is the more flexible approach and the one which will have lower compliance costs.

1.3.9 The general arguments for not preserving the effect of tax preferences under the BE regime were set out in section 2.3 of our previous report. The main counter argument is that the claw-back of tax preferences will make foreign subsidiaries of New Zealand companies uncompetitive. In our view, this argument exaggerates the importance of tax considerations in investment decisions. Factors such as relative labour costs and inflation rates, access to capital and raw materials and proximity to markets will generally be far more important determinants of international competitiveness than relative tax burdens.

1.3.10 Nevertheless, one of the objectives of the BE regime is to minimise the extent to which tax influences the location of investment. Over time, the regime will tend to equalise the effective tax rates on the income of foreign and domestic companies owned by New Zealand residents. The potential effect of a tax preference on investment decisions should be the principal criterion for determining whether the preference should be listed. Developments in the tax systems of the grey list countries will need to be monitored by the Government. If a country introduces a tax preference that is significant enough to attract New Zealand investment, the preference should be listed. A number of generous preferences are to be or are currently being phased out in grey list countries but, because of their limited future, they are unlikely to influence investment decisions.

1.3.11 Even if no preferences are listed, the possibility of one being listed does introduce uncertainty. To minimise this, we recommend that the listing of a preference should have prospective application. Since an existing or a newly established CFC in a grey list country could take advantage of a preference, it is not sufficient to restrict the effect of the listing of a preference to CFCs established after its introduction. Thus, we propose that, if a preference is listed, the listing should not take effect until the beginning of the next income year.

1.3.12 We commented in our previous report on the need for the New Zealand regime to "look through" CFCs resident in grey list countries to CFCs owned by them. If this were not done, New Zealand would not have one CFC regime, but eight - those of the seven grey list countries as well. Residents could choose which of the eight was most favourable to them and establish an intermediate CFC in the relevant country which would own the underlying CFC. It would be pointless to have such a system. As noted above, the existence of a CFC regime in the grey list countries is indicative only. The complete exemption of a grey list CFC and all of its underlying interests should not turn on this factor.

1.3.13 Chapter 4 outlines the Committee's views on how the BE regime should apply in respect of a CFC resident in a grey list country which does utilise a listed preference. We propose that the computation of the BE income of the CFC for any accounting year should be simplified by taking it as the taxable income of the CFC for that year, measured according to the tax laws of its country of residence, adjusted for the effect of the preference. This approach should significantly reduce compliance costs. The major avenue for minimising the compliance costs of the regime in respect of grey list CFCs should be the listing of significant preferences only. It may well be that the best approach initially is to refrain from listing preferences until the regime has been introduced and some experience with its operation has been gained.

### 1.4 Compliance and Administration

1.4.1 The grey list exemption will remove most of New Zealand's offshore investment from the regime. This will substantially reduce the compliance and administrative costs of the BE regime to the extent that it will affect relatively few taxpayers. The Committee has, however, been concerned to reduce as far as possible the compliance costs of the regime where it will apply. In our previous report, we recommended that the BE regime should apply to a foreign company that is controlled at any time during its accounting year. In principle, this would require taxpayers to compute their interests daily though, in practice, this computation would obviously be necessary only when a taxpayer's interest changed. Nevertheless, the compliance and administrative costs of the scheme will be raised the more frequent the measurement of interests is required.

1.4.2 For this reason, we recommend in chapter 3 that interests in foreign companies for both control and income attribution purposes be measured on four days during the year -on the last day of each calendar quarter. A consequence of this decision is the need to have rules to deal with disposals and related acquisitions straddling a measurement day but, for taxpayers who do not engage in such activity, the reduction to four measurement days should considerably simplify compliance.

1.4.3 The definition of an interest for control and income attribution purposes is, of necessity, broad - we have defined five categories of interest in a company. For most normal share structures, the five categories will, however, reduce to only one or two. Where complicated share structures and rights exist, greater computational requirements will arise. Similarly, greater compliance costs will arise where there are relationships between companies which complicate the calculation of indirect interests. These can be reduced by simplifying corporate group structures.

1.4.4 We mentioned in the previous section the Committee's recommendation for a simplified basis of computing the BE income of a CFC resident in a grey list country. This should considerably reduce the compliance costs of the regime to the extent that it applies to such companies.

### 1.5 Trust Transition

1.5.1 A further issue which has attracted comment is the transition to apply to trusts with non-resident trustees settled on or before 17 December 1987. Once again, the concern is in part due to uncertainty since your earlier decision on the transition was only provisional. We discuss this matter further in chapter 8.

### 1.6 Credit Streaming

1.6.1 The Committee proposed a number of provisions to reduce the streaming of imputation and withholding credits. By streaming, we mean the allocation of credits disproportionately to taxpayers able to use them rather than to those, like non-residents, who will be unable to. Streaming would not be a concern if tax revenue were not an issue, but since it is, rules are needed to minimise its impact.

1.6.2 A related matter is whether New Zealand shareholders in non-resident companies with New Zealand subsidiaries should be able to receive credits for any New Zealand tax paid by the subsidiaries. One mechanism to achieve this would be to issue "stapled" shares in the subsidiaries to the resident shareholders.

1.6.3 The Committee considered this issue in its report on imputation. Imputation cannot be considered in isolation from the international reforms. If non-resident companies could direct credits to their resident shareholders through stapled stock and similar arrangements, a constraint on the adoption of a non-resident corporate structure in order to avoid the international reforms would be removed. Hence, we see the disallowance of stapled stock arrangements as a quid pro quo for non-resident status and relief from the international reforms. We consider that this argument also applies to companies which are already non-resident.

1.6.4 It has also been suggested that, if stapled stock type arrangements were to be disallowed in general, an exception should apply for Australian companies, in particular, and perhaps others. It is for the Government to consider whether a special arrangement is warranted with Australia. We would note, however, that a number of New Zealand's tax treaties have non-discrimination articles and most favoured nation provisions which might mean that a special arrangement could not be confined to only one of our treaty partners.

### 1.7 Draft Legislation

1.7.1 The Committee's draft of the legislation is contained in the annex to this report which is presented in a separate volume. The legislation has not been fully considered by officials nor parliamentary counsel, but we consider that it is sufficiently well-developed to provide a considerable degree of certainty to tax practitioners and businesses. Refinements to the legislation will, however, be needed. We understand that it will be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee so that interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on it.

### 10.1 Introduction

10.1.1 This chapter outlines the Committee's recommendations on sundry other issues raised by the imputation reforms, including the definition of a dividend, the amendments to the fringe benefit tax regime and excess retention tax.

### 10.2 Dividend Definition

10.2.1 In paragraph 4.7.1 of our earlier report, we advised that we were considering amendments to the section 4 definition of a dividend. One possibility was the extension of the ambit of the present section 4(2) dealing with proprietary company dividends, to all companies. The desirability of doing so, however, is due more to the weaknesses of the proprietary company definition rather than to any perceived avoidance policies of non-proprietary companies. In section 10.6, we suggest that the proprietary company definition requires review and, pending that review, we do not propose that the present section 4(2) ambit be broadened.

10.2.2 One deficiency of the existing dividend definition is that the provision of benefits to shareholders other than by way of distributions or dispositions are not clearly within the definition. As benefits can be conferred upon shareholders in this way, we propose to include as dividends the making available of any company property for the benefit of any shareholder if in the opinion of the Commissioner the making available of the property is virtually a distribution of an amount which, if distributed other than in the course of winding-up of the company, would be a dividend. We also propose to extend the dividend definition to include any excessive consideration provided by a company upon the acquisition of property from a shareholder. The taxable value of the dividend in the first case would be the amount by which the value of the benefit or property acquired by a shareholder exceeds any consideration provided by the shareholder. In the second case, the taxable value of the dividend would be the amount by which the consideration provided by the company exceeds the market value of the property acquired by the company.

10.2.3 Since these changes would extend the existing definition of a dividend, it is reasonable that taxpayers should have some notice of them before they come into effect. Accordingly, the Committee proposes that they take effect from 1 October 1988.

10.2.4 At present, section 4(2) deems to be a dividend any expenditure incurred by a proprietary company for the benefit of a shareholder, spouse of the shareholder, trust under which the shareholder or his or her spouse is a beneficiary or any other person associated with the shareholder. In order that we do not restrict the definition of a dividend with respect to a proprietary company, we propose that the extended definition of a dividend outlined in the previous paragraph apply where the person acquiring or disposing of the property in question is an associate of a shareholder of a proprietary company. By "associate", we mean any of the persons listed in the present section 4(2).

10.2.5 The CD proposed a definition of the term "paid up capital" meaning capital which could be returned free of tax upon winding-up or redemption. In our draft definition of dividend, we have adopted an alternative to this. A new section 4 defines widely the types of transactions which are initially considered to be dividends. A new section 4A contains exclusions from the section 4 net, so that no definition of "paid up capital" is required. Since our redrafted definition, apart from the changes proposed in paragraph 10.2.2 (which we suggest come into effect from 1 October 1988), merely attempts to state more clearly the present definition, we consider that it should come into effect from the commencement of the present income year.

#### Recommendation

10.2.6 The Committee therefore recommends that the definition of a dividend be extended with effect from 1 October 1988 to include, with respect to any person who is a shareholder of a company or, where the company is a proprietary company, an associate of a shareholder:

a   the value of any benefit or property provided by the company to the person to the extent that it exceeds any consideration provided by the person for the provision of the benefit or property; and

b   consideration provided by the company upon the acquisition of property from the person to the extent that it exceeds the market value of the property acquired by the company.

### 10.3 Section 190

10.3.1 Section 190 of the Act permits the Commissioner to disallow a deduction to a proprietary company for remuneration paid to a director, a shareholder or a relative of those persons if the remuneration is considered unreasonably high. The disallowed amount is deemed to be a dividend paid to the recipient. Such arrangements may appear more attractive in the light of the Committee's recommendation that, due to uncertainties in the application of the deemed dividend provisions, such dividends be excluded from the credit allocation rules. Hence, the Committee proposes that section 190 be retained in amended form.

10.3.2 The proviso to section 190 has the effect that the section does not apply where the recipient of the remuneration is an adult employed substantially full time in the business of the company and participating in its administration and management, and the remuneration is not influenced by the fact that the recipient is a relative of a shareholder or director. Because of the ease with which the proviso can be invoked and the possibility of streaming arrangements being entered into, the Committee proposes that, with effect from the commencement of the 1990 income year, the proviso exemption be limited to persons who are residents. This would have the dual effect of limiting the use of remuneration as a means of avoiding the allocation rules and reinforcing one of the few interjurisdictional allocation rules presently in the Act.

#### Recommendation

10.3.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the proviso to section 190 be amended, with effect from the commencement of the 1990 income year, to limit its application to resident recipients of remuneration.

### 10.4 Section 197

10.4.1 Section 197 relates to distributions of trading stock to shareholders as such, with distributions treated as a sale by the company and a purchase by the shareholder at market value. Section 197(3) makes it clear that the Commissioner's ability to deem the distribution to be a dividend under section 4 is not derogated by the deemed sale treatment under section 197(2).

10.4.2 The Consultative Document proposed the repeal of section 197 from the commencement of the 1989 income year. In our first report, we advised we were still considering this issue. The objective of the Act in regard to such distributions of trading stock is to place the company and the shareholder in the same position as each would be had the trading stock been sold to a third party and the profit distributed as a dividend.

10.4.3 Merely to treat the distribution as a dividend without deeming the distribution to be a sale does not achieve this result, as it leaves the company with a deduction by way of a lower closing stock figure. Hence it is necessary to deem the distribution to be a sale and for this reason we recommend the retention of section 197.

#### Recommendation

10.3.5 The Committee recommends that section 197 be retained.

### 10.4 Winding Up Distribution Tax

10.4.1 Winding up distribution tax ("WUDT") is designed to encourage the winding-up of companies which have ceased trading by levying tax at a concessional rate on taxable reserves distributed before 1 April 1989 in the course of and for the purpose of winding up. Winding up for this purpose includes a dissolution procedure provided for in section 335A of the Companies Act 1955. In our earlier report, we proposed that this should be a final tax. This means that non-resident withholding tax should not be levied on such distributions to non-residents, nor should any withholding payment be levied on such distributions received by companies upon the winding up of a non-resident company.

#### Recommendation

10.4.2 The Committee recommends that distributions which have been subject to the winding up distribution tax not be liable for either non-resident withholding tax or dividend withholding payment.

### 10.5 Fringe Benefits Received by "Major Shareholders"

10.5.1 The CD proposed that as from 1 April 1988 fringe benefits provided by a company to any shareholder/employee should be subject to fringe benefit tax. Fringe benefits received by "major shareholders" of private companies had previously been treated as dividends and were excluded from the fringe benefit tax regime.

10.5.2 The Committee accepts that retention of the major/minor shareholder employee distinction for FBT purposes is now redundant. We have become aware that, as we did not comment on this proposal in our first report, there is an expectation amongst many taxpayers and their advisers that we did not support the CD proposal. As this expectation can be attributed to an omission on our part to comment explicitly in our earlier report, we believe that a delay in the implementation date of the proposal is justified in respect of some but not all fringe benefits.

10.5.3 Most benefits, with the exception of loans at concessional rates, to major shareholders who are also employees are currently subject to a deemed dividend provision. In respect of such fringe benefits other than loans, we believe that taxpayers will not be prejudiced by a 1 April 1988 commencement date as proposed in the CD.

10.5.4 The existing provision applicable to loans at concessional rates to major shareholders who are also employees is not a very effective provision so that bringing such loans into the fringe benefit regime will be a substantial change of treatment. Ideally such change should have a prospective application date. Due to the confusion over whether the CD proposal was to be implemented, we propose that the application of FBT to concessional rate loans to major shareholders who are also employees be postponed to 1 October 1988. Such loans should remain subject to the deemed dividend provision before that date.

#### Recommendation

10.5.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that fringe benefits received by any shareholder who is an employee be subject to the FBT regime rather than the current deemed dividend provisions:

a   in respect of fringe benefits other than loans, with effect from 1 April 1988; and

b   in respect of loans, with effect from 1 October 1988.

### 10.6 Excess Retention Tax

10.6.1 The CD at paragraph 6.6 proposed the repeal of excess retention tax ("ERT") with effect from the commencement of the 1989 year. The CD noted that ERT has two objectives under the classical company tax system - first, to ensure that non-corporate taxpayers cannot defer personal tax liability on dividend income by holding shares through a company and, secondly, to reinforce the classical company tax system by requiring a minimum distribution of income each year. The CD suggested that, with the introduction of imputation,the reinforcement of the classical tax system was no longer relevant. In addition, it argued that there will be no incentive for a company to retain dividends which bear imputation credits and that, while privately controlled investment companies may still be used to defer shareholder tax liability on dividends without credits, that opportunity exists for all companies, not just privately controlled investment companies.

10.6.2 In our first imputation report, we noted at paragraph 2.4.8 that it might be necessary to retain ERT in order to ensure that credits are utilised by individual shareholders rather than held in a company which, together with the credits, is then sold. We believe that there would be a considerable incentive for credits to be trapped for this purpose. While our proposal, discussed in section 10.7, for a 75 percent commonality provision for carry-forward of credits goes some way to limit credit trap and sale opportunities, we believe it should be supplemented by retention of ERT. This will also limit the deferral opportunities such companies would provide in respect of uncredited dividends.

10.6.3 We noted in our first report that the ERT provisions have had little impact since the abolition of bonus issue tax and that they would need strengthening if ERT were to be retained. Accordingly, we recommend that non-taxable bonus issues made after 30 September 1988 be excluded from the calculation of dividends distributed by a privately controlled investment company for ERT purposes.

10.6.4 The Committee and the Inland Revenue Department have reservations about the effectiveness of the current definition of "privately controlled investment company" given the ease with which the definition of "proprietary company" may be avoided. This should be reviewed by the Department.

10.6.5 The Department has proposed that the current exemption from ERT for companies not having share capital should be repealed. We are not aware of the reason for the original exemption and, in the absence of any compelling reason for its retention, we recommend the repeal of the exemption with effect from the commencement of the 1990 income year.

#### Recommendation

10.6.2 The Committee recommends that:

a   excess retention tax be retained;

b   non-taxable bonus issues made after 30 September 1988 be excluded from the calculation of dividends distributed by a privately controlled investment company for the purposes of excess retention tax calculation; and

c   the exemption from ERT for companies without share capital be repealed with effect from the 1990 income year.

### 11.1 Introduction

11.1.1 This chapter briefly summarises the main elements of the BE, FIF and trust regimes and draws together all of the Committee's recommendations and some concluding remarks.

### 11.2 BE Regime

11.2.1 The BE regime recommended by the Committee is set out in chapters 2, 3 and 4 and follows closely that outlined in our first report. The regime will apply when five or fewer New Zealand residents hold interests, either directly or indirectly, or through nominees or associated persons, which add up to 50 percent or more of the rights or powers of ownership of a foreign company. The rules for determining whether a company is controlled are necessarily wide in scope. The rules for attributing the income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) to individual residents are more circumscribed. Income or loss will be calculated according to New Zealand tax rules, with some necessary modifications.

11.2.2 Residents with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC will be required to compute their share of its income or loss, which is then attributed to them with a credit for the corresponding share of the foreign tax paid by the CFC. Residents would be able to aggregate their attributed income or loss, and the foreign tax credits, in respect of CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction. We propose that excess tax credits should be able to be carried forward. The New Zealand shareholders of a CFC resident in a grey-list country (Australia, Canada, France, Japan, West Germany, United Kingdom, United States) will be exempt from the regime unless the CFC utilises a significant tax preference. Where such a preference is used, the Committee recommends a simplified basis of income calculation.

11.2.3 In our first report, we suggested that a foreign company should be a CFC if it was controlled by 5 or fewer residents on any day of its accounting year. After further consideration, in light of the high compliance costs of monitoring control interests which in some cases could change, if not daily, relatively frequently, the Committee now recommends that a resident's control and income interests be measured on the last day of the calendar quarters that fall in the accounting year of a CFC. A foreign company would be a CFC if 5 or fewer residents have an aggregate control interest of 50 percent or more on any of the quarterly measurement days. This change necessitates more elaborate anti-avoidance measures than would be necessary if control and income interests on every day in the year were taken into account. A remaining problem is the circumvention of the BE regime by the disposal of shares for a capital gain, but this can be addressed comprehensively only by the general inclusion of capital gains within the income tax base.

11.2.4 With respect to the grey list countries, the Committee recommends that only significant tax preferences should be listed and that it would be best not to list specific preferences until there has been some experience with the BE regime. The fundamental criterion for listing a preference should be that it is significant enough to attract New Zealand investment. Where a preference is listed, the listing should have prospective application.

11.2.5 We proposed a number of transitional provisions in our first report. The principal provision is the exclusion from the BE regime for a two year period (ie until 1 April 1990) of interests in CFCs, resident in countries other than listed low tax jurisdictions, that were acquired by taxpayers on or before 17 December 1987. We recommend one further transitional measure in this report whereby residents with interests in CFCs on 17 December 1987 could elect to apply the regime for the two year period from 1 April 1988 until 31 March 1990 so that losses generated in that period would be available at the commencement of the regime on 1 April 1990 for offset against attributed income derived in the same jurisdiction.

### 11.3 Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) Regime

11.3.1 The FIF regime is set out in chapter 5 and section 245O of the draft legislation. The regime buttresses both the BE regime where tax deferral benefits do not depend on control and the proposed regime for superannuation where residents invest in foreign superannuation funds. It does this by taxing New Zealand residents on the income they derive through foreign companies, foreign unit trusts, or foreign superannuation funds ("foreign entities") which provide New Zealand residents with significant tax advantages.

11.3.2 The Committee has defined a FIF as any foreign entity which derives its income or value primarily or substantially from holding or trading portfolio investments in shares, investments in debt instruments, real property, commodities, etc, where the effect of the fiscal residence, the tax treatment applying to the entity in its country of residence and the distribution policy of the entity is to reduce the tax payable on the income of the entity to a level significantly below what it would have been had the income been taxed in New Zealand as it was derived.

11.3.3 We define an interest in a FIF in a similar way to an income interest under the BE regime, but this is extended to include life insurance or superannuation policies issued by a foreign entity. FIF income or loss is determined by reference to the change in value of the interest in the entity. We propose that there should be no credit for any foreign tax paid by the FIF because attributed FIF income or loss is effectively net of foreign tax. Attributed FIF income and losses of a taxpayer should, however, be able to be aggregated without limitation and, in addition, attributed FIF losses should be able to be offset against other income up to the extent of the past attributed FIF income returned by the taxpayer.

### 11.4 Trusts

11.4.1 The trust regime recommended by the Committee is described in chapter 6 and is set out in Part F of the draft legislation. We propose a number of changes from the regime recommended in our first report but these are of form rather than of substance. The basic principles underlying the proposed regime can be summarised as follows:

a   the taxation in New Zealand of the foreign-source income derived by a trust should not turn on the residence of the trustee. The material factor is the residence of the beneficiaries but since they are often not specified, recourse must be had to the settlor. In addition, a settlor will frequently have some influence, if not control, over the trustee so that the disposition of the income of the trust remains to some extent in the hands of the settlor. For these reasons, we consider that if the settlor is resident foreign-source trustee income should be taxable here;

b   where there is a resident settlor of a trust in the year in which it derives foreign-source trustee income, the liability for New Zealand tax on that income should rest in the first instance with the trustee (whether that trustee is resident or not). If the trustee is not resident, the liability should fall to the resident settlor as agent of the trustee in the event that the trustee defaults;

c   distributions from a trustee to a resident beneficiary should generally be taxable unless the trustee (or settlor, in the event of default) has been liable to tax in New Zealand.

11.4.2 We use the term "qualifying trust" to denote a trust in respect of which trustee income has been subject to tax in New Zealand in all income years since its settlement. Distributions from these trusts should be non-assessable to beneficiaries. "Foreign trusts", on the other hand, are trusts which have had, at no time after 17 December 1987, a settlor who is a New Zealand resident. We recommend that distributions from the trustee income of these trusts derived in income years commencing after 1 April 1987 should be assessable to a beneficiary, at his or her marginal tax rate, but other distributions from such trusts be exempt.

11.4.3 "Non-qualifying distributions" are distributions from trusts which are not qualifying or foreign trusts. We propose that these distributions, other than of the corpus of the trust, should be assessable to a beneficiary at a tax rate of 45 percent with no credit for any foreign tax, except withholding tax, paid by a trustee. The higher rate is intended as a proxy for an interest charge on tax deemed to have been deferred in respect of such distributions.

11.4.4 The Committee proposes that transitional provisions apply in respect of trusts settled by residents before 17 December 1987. These are that:

a   the settlor would have no liability, as agent of the trustee, for tax on the trustee income of the trust;

b   where such a trust winds up before 31 March 1989, all distributions other than of corpus and capital profits (which would be exempt) would be subject to a final tax of 10 percent;

c   where the settlor, trustee or a beneficiary of such a trust pays a tax equal to 10 percent of the net trust assets as at 31 March 1988, it would be treated as a qualifying trust provided that the trustee income of the trust is subject to tax in New Zealand in subsequent income years.

### 11.5 Disclosure

11.5.1 Disclosure of relevant information, with penalties for non-disclosure, and default methods where the taxpayer is not able to comply are critical to the effective operation of the regime. We outline our views on disclosure in chapter 7.

### 11.6 Imputation and Withholding Payment Systems

11.6.1 Our recommendations relating to the imputation and withholding payment systems cover details of the regimes which were left unsettled in our earlier report or which have emerged in the drafting of the legislation. There are no changes of substance or policy involved.

### 11.7 Summary of Recommendations

#### Calculation of Control Interests

m   the control interest of a resident in a foreign company in any category of interest be defined as the aggregate of the person's direct and indirect control interests in that category and those of associated persons;

n   as a general principle, interests in a foreign company held by a CFC or associated persons of the CFC be attributed to the group of residents with the highest aggregate control interest in the CFC and, where there is more than one such group, to the smallest one and, where there is more than one person in any such group, the interests of the CFC be apportioned among them according to their income interests in the CFC;

o   any interests held by a nominee of a person be deemed to be held by that person;

p   a foreign company be defined as a CFC in respect of any accounting year of the company if, on any of the measurement days that fall within that accounting year, there are five or fewer residents whose aggregate control interest in the company in any category of interest is 50 percent or more;

i   the consideration payable to exercise the entitlement is less than the market value of the interest to be acquired; or

ii   the person holding the entitlement has given any form of financial assistance to the person holding the interest; or

iii   the holding of the entitlement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the BE regime;

u   the income interest of a resident in a foreign company held through a CFC be calculated by multiplying the resident's direct income interest in the CFC by the CFC's direct income interest in the other company, and so on where the interest is held through more than one CFC;

v   the income interest of a person in a CFC for any accounting period of the CFC be calculated as the average of the person's income interests for the quarters which fall in that accounting period;

#### Attribution of Income and Losses

w   residents be exempt from the BE regime in respect of a CFC and an accounting year of the CFC where their income interest in the CFC for that year and that of any associated persons is less than 10 percent;

y   an attributed loss of a resident not be recognised where the resident suffers little or no economic or financial loss;

z   where the aggregate income interests of 10 percent or more of residents in a CFC in any accounting year would otherwise exceed 100 percent, the income interest of each resident be apportioned downward so that the aggregate income interest equals 100 percent;

#### Adoption of CFC's Accounting Year

aa   residents be required to report attributed income in respect of a CFC in any accounting year in the income year in which the balance date of the CFC falls;

### 11.8 Conclusion

11.8.1 The Committee's recommendations outlined above are incorporated in the draft legislation contained in the accompanying annex. Further refinement of the draft will be needed as it is examined by parliamentary counsel and officials. Interested parties will then have an opportunity to comment at the select committee stage. The experience of other countries has been that CFC regimes need relatively frequent amendment to meet changing business practices and no doubt that will be the case with the New Zealand regime. The increasing internationalisation of businesses and financial markets also makes it inevitable that tax legislation will become more complex, though this will affect only a small number of taxpayers.

11.8.2 The real test of the draft legislation will, however, come as it is applied. It is impossible to anticipate all of the circumstances that may arise. We are, however, confident that the basic framework of the regimes, as embodied in the draft legislation, is sound.

### 2.1 Introduction

2.1.1 Chapters 2, 3 and 4 outline the Committee's recommendations on the outstanding issues relating to the branch-equivalent ("BE") regime. The main elements of this regime were outlined in Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Committee's Report on International Tax Reform. For ease of reference to the draft legislation, the issues are discussed in the order that they arise in the legislation. This chapter deals with the definitions which are central to the BE regime.

### 2.2 Relationship of BE Regime to Existing Act

2.2.1 The BE and the Foreign Investment Fund ("FIF") regimes will represent substantial additions to the existing Income Tax Act 1976 (the "Act") and, as a practical convenience, are best located together in Part IV of the Act. Their particular location is a minor matter - we have proposed that they form new sections 245A, 245B, etc. The regimes do, however, require a number of definitions. Definitions which are intended to apply generally throughout the Act are contained within section 2, while definitions which are specific to particular sections are usually included within those sections. The BE regime will apply when five or fewer New Zealand residents hold interests, either directly or through nominees or associated persons (which include certain relatives and trustees), which in aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent of the shares, voting rights, etc, of a foreign company. Thus, the definitions of residence, nominee, associated person, relative, trustee and company are critical to the effective operation of the scheme.

2.2.2 For this reason, we have reviewed existing definitions in the Act in order to consider their appropriateness for the purposes of the BE regime. We have proposed new definitions of a company, a trustee a resident which we recommend apply generally throughout the Act. Our proposed definitions of a nominee, associated person and relative are, however, intended to apply only to the international regime. The main reason for this limitation is that these definitions are pivotal to the operation of other sections of the Act as well as the sections that will form part of the international regime and should not be amended for the purposes of those other sections without careful consideration of the consequences. In the time available, we have not been able to undertake this task. There are, however, a number of deficiencies in the existing definitions and they should be reviewed at some stage. To this end, we have included in an appendix to the draft legislation new drafts of section 7, the present section defining associated persons, and section 8, the section dealing with control of a company, which could be considered in this review. Special definitions for particular sections may still be required.

### 2.3 Definition of "Company" and "Trustee"

2.3.1 As noted in the previous section, we recommend that the existing general definition of a "company" in section 2 of the Act be changed. It should be expanded to include any entity with a legal personality or existence separate from those of its members, which is created by way of incorporation or otherwise whether in New Zealand or elsewhere. This change is not fundamental but aims to more clearly include within the definition the variety of legal entities in overseas jurisdictions that are equivalent to companies. We understand that it is the intention of the Inland Revenue Department to publish for the guidance of taxpayers a list of the types of non-resident entities it considers to be the equivalent of companies under New Zealand law.

2.3.2 We also propose a minor amendment to the existing section 2 definition of a trustee to make it clear that a reference to a trustee of a trust means the trustee only in his or her capacity as trustee of that trust and includes all trustees of that trust.

#### Recommendation

2.3.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   the definition of a "company" in section 2 of the Act be amended to include any entity which has a legal personality or existence separate from that of its members, which is created by way of incorporation or otherwise whether or not in New Zealand; and

b   the definition of a trustee of a trust in section 2 of the Act be clarified to mean that trustee only in his or her capacity as a trustee of that trust and includes all trustees of that trust.

### 2.4 Residence: Individuals

2.4.1 The BE regime will apply to residents in respect of interests in foreign companies which are controlled by residents. Similarly, the settlor regime for trusts will apply to trusts which have a New Zealand resident settlor. Thus, the definitions of residence of an individual and of a company for tax purposes are key elements of the regimes. Residents should not be able to cease temporarily or regularly to be resident in order to avoid the control test and income attribution under the BE regime nor the settlor designation under the trust regime. In addition, residents should not be able to lose temporarily their residence status in order to receive a taxable distribution from a trust or company without suffering New Zealand income tax.

2.4.2 The present definitions are contained in section 241 of the Act. A natural person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if he or she:

a   has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand; or

b   is personally present in New Zealand for a continuous period of not less than 365 days except that, where the person has a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand, he or she may request to be treated as a non-resident.

2.4.3 Where a person is absent from New Zealand for a continuous period of not less than 365 days, the person is deemed not to be resident in New Zealand during that period except that, where a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand at all times during the period, he or she may request to be treated as a resident.

2.4.4 For the purposes of both 365 day tests, two or more periods are defined to be continuous if there are not more than 28 days between them and the intervening days do not exceed 56 days in that 365. In order to cease to be a New Zealand resident, a natural person must therefore be absent from New Zealand for at least 309 (i.e 365 less 56) days of a 365 day period and not be present here for any period exceeding 28 days. An absence of only 29 days is sufficient under the definition to break the residence link where the person in question does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand.

2.4.5 A person who is not a New Zealand resident can remain a non-resident by having a permanent place of abode outside of New Zealand and no permanent place of abode in New Zealand, irrespective of the time they are in New Zealand. Thus, a New Zealand resident can cease to be resident here by disposing of any permanent place of abode in New Zealand and acquiring a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand.

2.4.6 In our view, the permanent place of abode test needs to supplemented by a strengthened personal presence test. As noted above, the present test can be avoided by disposing of one's permanent place of abode in New Zealand and spending 29 continuous days out of New Zealand or by maintaining a permanent place of abode outside New Zealand. The continuous period concept in the existing personal presence tests adds little. We propose that they be simplified by determining residence according to whether a person is present or absent from New Zealand for a certain number of days. Thus, we propose that a natural person be deemed to be a New Zealand resident if:

a   his or her permanent place of abode is in New Zealand; or

b   he or she is personally present in New Zealand for not less than 183 days of any 12 month period.

2.4.7 In addition, we propose that a natural person who is a New Zealand resident may cease to be a resident only if:

a   he or she is absent from New Zealand for not less than 325 days in any 12 month period; and

b   he or she has, at no time during that period, a permanent place of abode in New Zealand.

2.4.8 The effect of these changes would be to make it easier for a person to become a New Zealand resident and harder to cease to be one. We propose that the amendment come into effect from the commencement of the 1989 income year.

#### Recommendations

2.4.9 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the residence tests applying to natural persons be amended with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 so that:

a   a person is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if he or she:

i   has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand; or

ii   is personally present in New Zealand for at least 183 days of any 12 month period; and

b   a person ceases to be resident in New Zealand only if he or she:

i   is absent from New Zealand for 325 days of any 12 month period; and

ii   has at no time during that period a permanent place of abode in New Zealand.

### 2.5 Residence: Companies

2.5.1 Temporary changes of residence by companies do not present the same problems under the international regime as do those by individuals. A company controlled by residents which became a non-resident to avoid the control and income attribution rules under the BE regime would itself fall within the regime. The present definition of the residence of a company is contained in section 241(2). A company is deemed to be resident in New Zealand if it:

a   is incorporated in New Zealand; or

b   has its "centre of administrative management" in New Zealand.

An exception applies to a "banking company" which is deemed to be resident only if its centre of administrative management is in New Zealand.

2.5.2 There are two problems with this definition. The first is the ambiguity of the term "centre of administrative management". The Inland Revenue Department interprets this to mean the place where the day to day administration of a company is carried out. By contrast, a number of tax practitioners consider that it means the place where the highest (i.e board of director) level of decision-making takes place. Many other countries use the term "place of central management and control" to designate the place where the board of directors meets.

2.5.3 The second problem with the definition is the administrative difficulty of applying a place of management test (whether central or day to day). To a large extent, the need for a CFC regime arises because of this difficulty. The place of management test has, however, much more economic substance than the place of incorporation test. In addition, most of New Zealand's double tax agreements employ a management and control test to settle the residence of a company resident within the jurisdiction of both treaty partners. Thus, a management and control test is an integral part of our tax law since the treaty tests override the Income Tax Act provisions where the two are in conflict. For these reasons, we favour retaining a place of management test of corporate residence.

2.5.4 To clarify the present definition, the level of management on which it is intended that residence depend should be spelt out more precisely. To avoid altering substantively the present test, we propose that the place of both the board and executive levels of management be included and that the term "head office" (where both levels of management would normally be located) be retained. Thus, a company would be resident in New Zealand if it:

a   is incorporated in New Zealand; or

b   has its centre of director control in New Zealand; or

c   has the centre of its executive management in New Zealand; or

d   has its head office in New Zealand.

For the purposes of the second test, the substantive issue is whether control by directors is exercised in New Zealand, irrespective of whether board meetings are also occasionally held outside New Zealand. We propose that the new residence definition apply with effect from the present (i.e. 1989) income year.

2.5.5 We have asked the Inland Revenue Department to investigate the origin of the special residence rule applying to banking companies. It dates from 1941 and was apparently intended to permit banks incorporated in New Zealand for the purposes of issuing banknotes here to do so without being subject to tax on their worldwide income, as would be the case if the place of incorporation test applied to them. Since this consideration is no longer relevant, we propose that the residence of a banking company be determined under the normal rules.

#### Recommendation

2.5.6 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the residence test for companies be amended with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 so that a company, including a banking company, is resident in New Zealand if it:

a   is incorporated in New Zealand; or

b   has its centre of director control in New Zealand; or

c   has the centre of its executive management in New Zealand; or

d   has its head office in New Zealand.

### 2.6 Definition of "Nominee"

2.6.1 Since the BE regime will apply whenever residents hold a certain threshold percentage of the "control interests" (meaning generally the various rights or powers of ownership which when aggregated sufficiently enable a person to control a company) in a foreign company, there is an obvious incentive for a person to disperse interests among nominees or associated persons. To counteract this, interests held by a nominee of a person must be deemed to be held by that person. The treatment of interests held by associated persons is referred to in the next section.

2.6.2 The scope of the definition of nominee will depend to some extent on its application. There are at present two definitions of nominee in the Act but they are both framed in relation to the sections to which they apply. For example, they differ according to the way in which relatives are brought within the definition. In principle, it is not necessary to deem relatives to be nominees of a person but, in practice, where it is likely certain relatives will be acting as nominees, it is reasonable to shift the burden of proof on to the taxpayer to establish that this is not so.

2.6.3 For the purposes of the BE regime, the definition of nominee needs to be framed in terms of the rights and powers which, if a person held them directly, would be taken into account in determining his or her control interest. With respect to relatives, given that the tax consequences for a person of having someone else deemed to be his or her nominee may be substantial, we propose that only children under 18 years of age be deemed to be nominees of a person unless the person can establish otherwise. In addition, we propose that a bare trustee (i.e. a trustee who holds property to the order of a beneficiary) be included in the definition. (A broader inclusion of relatives and trustees is proposed for the definition of associated persons.)

2.6.4 To support the definition, we propose that the definition of a nominee include a person who has entered into an arrangement or understanding with another person with respect to the holding or exercising of rights or powers in relation to foreign companies.

#### Recommendation

2.6.5 The Committee therefore recommends that, for the purposes of the BE regime, a nominee of a person be defined to include:

a   a child of the person under 18 years of age, unless the person can establish otherwise;

b   a bare trustee; and

c   a person who has entered into an arrangement or understanding with that person with respect to the holding or exercising of rights or powers.

### 2.7 Definition of "Associated Persons"

2.7.1 A nominee of a person is in effect that person's agent. The definition of associated persons aims to embrace persons who are not related as principal and agent but who, because of their personal or economic relationship, can reasonably be assumed to have similar economic interests. For example, two companies owned by the same shareholders may not be related as principal and nominee but will nevertheless have substantially similar if not identical economic interests. They should therefore be treated as associated persons.

2.7.2 In the context of the BE regime, we propose that interests in foreign companies held by associated persons be aggregated for the purposes of the control test, but not for the purposes of income attribution. The income attributed to any person would depend only on the interests that the person holds directly, through nominees, or through other controlled foreign companies. (Interests held by the nominees of a person should be aggregated with that person's own direct and indirect interests for the purposes of determining both the control and income interests of the person.)

2.7.3 The present Act contains a general definition of associated persons in section 8. In brief, this section defines associated persons as any two companies which consist of substantially the same shareholders or that are under the control of the same persons; a person and a company where that person owns 25 percent or more of the shares in the company; two persons who are relatives; and a person and a partnership where that person is associated with a partner. This definition is not appropriate for the purposes of the BE regime. First, the relationship between two companies or another person and a company needs to be extended and defined in terms of the rights and powers to be taken into account in determining control and income interests under the BE regime. Secondly, the 25 percent ownership threshold should be raised to 50 percent for consistency with the control threshold under the BE regime. Thirdly, the term relative means persons connected within the fourth degree of relationship (such as first cousins). This is too broad for the purposes of the BE regime. Fourthly, the present definition does not include trust relationships.

2.7.4 Accordingly, we propose that, in relation to the BE regime only, the term associated persons mean:

a   any 2 companies:

i   which consist substantially of the same shareholders, as presently defined in section 7; or

ii   which are under the control of the same person or persons, as presently defined in section 7; or

iii   where any group of persons holds income interests in each company totalling in aggregate 50 percent or more;

b   any person and a company if that person holds an income interest of 50 percent or more in that company;

c   two persons who are relatives if they are connected within the second degree of relationship;

d   a partnership and any person, where that person is a partner of the partnership;

e   a partnership and any person, where that person and any partner are associated persons;

f   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or any person associated with that person) has derived a benefit from that trust or, being a person associated with the settlor of the trust, could derive a benefit from it (except where the trust is for the benefit of employees only and the person, or an associated person, does not manage or control the affairs of the trust); and

g   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or a person associated with that person is a settlor of that trust (except where such an association exists as a result of an employer settling a trust, such as a superannuation fund, for the benefit of employees only and the employer or any associated person does not manage or control the affairs of the trust).

2.7.5 In addition, two persons who habitually act in concert with respect to the holding or exercising of interests in foreign companies should be deemed to be associated persons with respect to those interests.

#### Recommendations

2.7.6 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, in relation to the BE regime only, the term associated persons mean:

a   any 2 companies:

i   which consist substantially of the same shareholders, as presently defined in section 7; or

ii   which are under the control of the same person or persons, as defined in section 7; or

iii   where any group of persons holds income interests in each company totalling in aggregate 50 percent or more;

b   any person and a company if that person holds an income interest of 50 percent or more in that company;

c   two persons who are relatives if they are connected within the second degree of relationship;

d   a partnership and any person, where that person is a partner of the partnership;

e   a partnership and any person, where that person and any partner are associated persons;

f   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or any person associated with that person) has derived a benefit from that trust or, being a person associated with the settlor of the trust, could derive a benefit from it (except where the trust is for the benefit of employees only and the person, or an associated person, does not manage or control the affairs of the trust);

g   a trustee of a trust and any person where that person (or a person associated with that person) is a settlor of that trust (except where such an association exists as a result of an employer settling a trust, such as a superannuation fund, for the benefit of employees only and the employer or any associated person does not manage or control the affairs of the trust); and

i   two persons who habitually act in concert with respect to the holding or exercising of interests in foreign companies, with respect to those interests.

### 3.1 Introduction

3.1.1 The BE regime will apply when five or fewer residents control 50 percent or more of the rights or powers of ownership which when aggregated sufficiently enable those residents to control a company. A person's proportionate share of the total of such rights or powers will be referred to as his or her "control interest" for the purposes of the control test and his or her "income interest" for the purposes of income attribution. Depending on whether interests are held directly or indirectly through companies or associated persons, a person's control interest may be different from his or her income interest.

3.1.2 The objective of this chapter is to set out the Committee's recommendations on the determination of control and income interests. These matters are dealt with in sections 245B to 245G of the accompanying draft legislation.

### 3.2 Definition of Interests In a Company

3.2.1 The attributes of a company which are critical for the purposes of calculating control and income interests are the rights or powers which give the holders the ability to receive or control the disposition of the company's income or capital. In general, these rights or powers attach to shares and are held by the shareholders of the company. Different classes of shares may, however, have a wide variety of rights attached to them so that it is not sufficient to focus on the percentage of the shares held by a person. Thus, control and income interests in a foreign company need to be defined in terms of:

a   paid-up capital;

b   nominal capital;

c   rights to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company or variations in its capital (e.g. the issuing, redemption, acquisition or cancellation of any shares);

d   income of the company which the person would be beneficially entitled to receive or to have dealt with in his or her interest or behalf if it were distributed; and

e   net assets of the company (or the proceeds from the realisation thereof) which the person would be beneficially entitled to receive or to have dealt with in his or her interest or behalf if they were distributed.

3.2.2 The ownership of or an entitlement to acquire any one of these things in relation to a foreign company will be referred to as an "interest" in the company. Thus, the list above specifies five categories of interest. A foreign company should be deemed to be a controlled foreign company (CFC) when five or fewer residents, directly or indirectly, own or are entitled to acquire 50 percent or more of any category of interest. The meaning of "directly or indirectly" is outlined in the next section. For example, if five or fewer residents own 50 percent of the voting rights in relation to the distributions of a foreign company, it should be a CFC.

3.2.3 The income attributed to any resident having an interest in a CFC will, however, depend on that person's income interest in the CFC. The definition of an income interest is explained further in section 3.5.

3.2.4 In determining how voting rights are held, those of directors to decide distributions, such as interim dividends, should be excluded. These are exercised by directors acting in their capacity as directors under an authority delegated by shareholders in terms of the articles of the company.

3.2.5 The calculation of an interest under category d would require taxpayers to decide how the income of a company would be allocated if it were distributed as a dividend on a particular day. Certain shares, such as preference shares, may be entitled only to a fixed rate of dividend payable on specified days during the year. To accommodate these types of share, category d interests need to be measured on the basis that all of the foreign company's income for the accounting year is distributed as a dividend on the last day of the accounting year and all interests held on a measurement day are treated as if they were held on the last day of the accounting year.

3.2.6 In some circumstances, the percentage of the income or the net assets of a company that a person could acquire may differ from the percentage of its paid up capital, nominal capital or votes that he or she may hold. For example, minority shareholders of private companies may have no rights, or the powers given to a majority shareholder, directors or managers may be such that the shareholders who control the company could cause to be distributed to them or for their benefit a disproportionate share of the income or assets of a company. In cases such as this, the income interest of a person or group holding a control interest of more than 50 percent should be taken as 100 percent.

#### Recommendation

3.2.7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that residents' control and income interests in foreign companies be defined in terms of:

i   paid-up capital;

ii   nominal capital;

iii   rights to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company or variations in its capital (e.g. by the issuing, redemption, acquisition or cancellation of any shares);

iv   income of the company which the person would be beneficially entitled to receive or to have dealt with in his or her interest or behalf if it were distributed; and

v   net assets of the company (or the proceeds from the realisation thereof) which the person would be beneficially entitled to receive or to have dealt with in his or her interest or behalf if they were distributed.

### 3.3 Frequency of Measurement of Interests

3.3.1 The objective of the BE regime is to tax residents on the income of certain CFCs that remains undistributed from one year to the next. Thus, the regime needs to determine which residents hold interests in a CFC from one year to the next. This requires the determination of the interests held by residents at least once a year. There are, however, several problems with a single annual measurement of interests. First, there would obviously be an incentive for residents to avoid holding interests on that particular day. To counter this incentive, rules would be required to catch "bed and breakfast" transactions whereby interests were disposed of prior to the measurement day and reacquired after that day. Where a right of repurchase existed, the disposal would not be effective since the measurement of a control interest will require taxpayers to take into account interests that they are entitled to acquire. In addition, a provision would be needed to counteract temporary changes in the aggregate interests of a CFC in any category of interest (e.g. by the issue and cancellation of shares around the measurement day). Both of these types of rule would be needed if measurement of interests takes place on only a number of specified days during the year. A single measurement day would, however, put more pressure on the rules than more frequent measurement.

3.3.2 Secondly, a single measurement day would enable taxpayers in some cases to avoid the regime by holding companies for the interval between measurement days - that is, up to 364 days but not the measurement day. Income could thus be accumulated in a CFC which might then be sold to a non-resident prior to the measurement day for a gain that reflected the accumulated income. The longer the period between measurement days, the greater the scope for such activity. Thirdly, a single measurement day may be unfair on taxpayers who hold interests for short periods that included the measurement day, since their proportionate share of the income of the CFC for the whole of the year would be attributed to them. In principle, the anticipated tax liability could be taken into account in the purchase price of the interest.

3.3.3 At the other extreme, measurement of interests could be required on each day of the foreign company's accounting year. This was the approach we favoured in our earlier report and is the method adopted in the United States and Canadian CFC regimes for the purposes of determining control. The major disadvantage of this option is the compliance cost involved. In practice, residents would not need to compute interests daily, but they would need to do so for each day on which there was a change in their own interests, those of associated persons or in indirect interests held through CFCs and for each day on which there was a change in the aggregate of any category of interest in the relevant foreign company. The compliance costs could thus be onerous where taxpayers had complex holdings of interests and where the aggregate interests in the foreign company changed relatively frequently, such as may be the case for listed companies (which, for example, may regularly issue shares to finance acquisitions). While the compliance burden of this approach to measuring control interests may be acceptable under the United States and Canadian regimes, which are directed mainly at "passive" investment income, they could be excessive under the New Zealand regime which is targeted more widely.

3.3.4 The choice of the interval between the measurement of interests needs to weigh up the compliance costs of more frequent measurement on the one hand and, on the other hand, the possible reduction in the effectiveness and fairness of the regime if measurement is relatively infrequent. The Committee favours a compromise of requiring measurement four times a year at the end of each calendar quarter. A resident having a control or an income interest on a measurement day would then be deemed to have held the interest on every day of the previous quarter. If no interest were held on a measurement day, the resident would be deemed not to have held a control or income interest at any time during that previous quarter.

3.3.5 As noted above, a trade off for less than daily measurement is the necessity to have provisions to counteract bed and breakfast transactions and temporary changes in the aggregate interests in a foreign company. In essence, the bed and breakfast provision would deem a person who had disposed of an interest in a CFC before a measurement day which had the effect of reducing his or her attributed income not to have disposed of it to the extent that an interest in the CFC was acquired within a certain period, which we propose be 183 days, after the date of the disposal. A parallel rule would apply where a person temporarily increased an interest before a measurement day which had the effect of increasing an attributed loss.

3.3.6 A person's attributed income will depend, first, on whether a foreign company in which he or she holds an interest is a CFC and, secondly, on his or her income interests in the foreign company if it is a CFC. As discussed further below, whether a foreign company is a CFC will depend on the interests held by residents, their associated persons and CFCs in which they have a direct or indirect interest. Thus, a disposal and acquisition around a measurement day by any of these parties will affect the control interest of the person. This means that it is necessary to draw the bed and breakfast provision widely, so that it applies not just where one person reduces and subsequently increases an interest in a foreign company, but also where such a reduction occurs and any other party connected with the person whose interests affect that person's control interest subsequently acquires an interest. The provision should not, however, apply where a disposal or acquisition is made by one person and an opposite transaction is made by another person whose control interests do not affect the other's control interests.

3.3.7 The rule to reverse the effect of temporary changes in the aggregate interests in a CFC would deem the change not to have occurred to the extent to which it is reversed within a certain period, which we propose be 365 days. Where the provision applies, it would require residents to determine their interests on each measurement day in the period on the basis of the deemed aggregate interests.

3.3.8 The effect of these rules is to ignore for interest measurement purposes changes in interests in foreign companies which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the BE regime. A remaining problem is the acquisition and disposal of interests within a period between successive measurement days. This would have the effect of converting what would be income under the BE regime to a gain. The principal provision dealing with the taxation of such gains is section 65(2)(e). This taxes gains on the disposal of personal property (which includes shares):

> "if the business of the taxpayer comprises dealing in such property, or if the property was acquired for the purposes of selling or otherwise disposing of it, and all profits or gains derived from the carrying on or carrying out of any undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit".

3.3.9 In practice, this section has proved difficult to administer because, for example, of the need for the Department to establish the taxpayer's purpose of acquiring property at the time of its acquisition. In addition, the section cannot be successfully administered without sufficient disclosure by taxpayers. With adequate disclosure, however, we consider that this provision will be more effective in taxing gains on the disposal of interests in foreign companies in the circumstances outlined in the previous paragraph since, in many instances, the substantive purpose of the acquisition of such interests will be to dispose of them at a gain.

3.3.10 To reinforce the need for disclosure, we propose that residents who have a control interest in a foreign company at any time during its accounting year equal to or higher than 10 percent should be required to disclose the interests they hold in the company on its balance date and any disposals of interests in the company made during its accounting year. Similarly, where a resident has a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC at any time during its accounting year and that CFC has a control interest of 10 percent or more in another foreign company, the resident should be required to disclose the interests in that foreign company held by the CFC on its balance date and any disposals of such interests the CFC has made during its accounting year.

3.3.11 The circumvention of the BE regime by the disposal of shares for a capital gain can be addressed comprehensively only by the general inclusion of capital gains within the income tax system. The income tax system will always be vulnerable if taxable income can be converted, in one way or another, into an exempt capital gain. Accordingly, we commented on the need for the inclusion of capital gains within the income tax base in our two previous reports.

#### Recommendations

3.3.12 The Committee therefore recommends that:

a   for the purposes of determining control and income interests in a foreign company, residents be required to measure their interests in the company in each category of interest listed in paragraph 3.2.7 on the last day of each calendar quarter;

b   an interest held on a measurement day be deemed to have been held on every day of the previous quarter;

c   provisions be included to reverse the effect of short term transactions and changes in the aggregate interests in foreign companies which have the effect of reducing the income attributed to residents or increasing an attributed loss; and

d   residents who have a control interest in a foreign company at any time during its accounting year equal to or higher than 10 percent be required to disclose the interests they hold in the company on its balance date and any disposals of such interests made during its accounting year and where a resident has a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC at any time during its accounting year, the taxpayer be required to disclose the equivalent information in respect of the CFC.

### 3.4 Calculation of Control Interests

3.4.1 We referred in chapter 2 to the need to aggregate interests held by residents through nominees, associated persons and other controlled companies in order to counteract the incentive for the dispersion of interests aimed at avoiding the control test. Interests held by a person directly will be referred to as "direct control interests". Those held indirectly through CFCs will be referred to as "indirect control interests".

A person's total or aggregate control interest in each category of interest listed in paragraph 3.2.1 should be calculated by aggregating the person's direct and indirect control interests in that category and those of associated persons. Any person's interest in any category should include interests held by nominees.

3.4.2 The calculation of indirect interests requires the attribution to New Zealand residents of the direct control interests of CFCs and their associated persons (hereafter together referred to as "qualified control interests"). We propose that, where one CFC is controlled by a second CFC, the qualified control interests of the first CFC be attributed to the second CFC. The resulting qualified control interests deemed to be held by the second CFC should then be deemed to be held by the persons who control that CFC. This tier by tier or step by step attribution process means that the interests being attributed at each stage are direct control interests only.

3.4.3 As a general principle, we propose that such interests be attributed to the smallest group of residents who have a control interest of 50 percent or greater and, where there is more than one such group, to the group with the highest aggregate control interest. In particular, we propose that:

a   qualified control interests held by a CFC in another foreign company be attributed to the group of residents who control the CFC (i.e. who together have control interests totalling 50 percent or more);

b   if there is more than one such group, the qualified control interests held by the CFC be attributed to the smallest group;

c   if there is more than one such smallest group, the qualified control interests held by the CFC be attributed to the group with the highest aggregate control interest in the CFC;

d   if there is more than one group which satisfies rule c, the qualified control interests held by the CFC be divided equally among them; and

e   if there is more than one person in any group selected by rules a to d, the qualified control interests held by the CFC be apportioned among them according to their income interests in the CFC.

3.4.4 In summary, a resident's control interest in any category of interest would be the sum of the direct and indirect interests of the person and associated persons. A foreign company would be deemed to be a CFC if there is any category of interest in which the aggregate control interests of five or fewer residents equals or exceeds 50 percent.

3.4.5 The control interests of two persons who are associated would each be included in the control interest of the other so that, when interests are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC, multiple counting of control interests may arise. It is therefore necessary to have a general proviso to the effect that any person's (including a CFC's) direct control interests shall be counted only once for the purpose of determining whether a foreign company is a CFC.

3.4.6 Another source of potential double counting is the inclusion, for the purposes of determining control interests, of interests which a person holds and those which another person is entitled to acquire. Where one person holds an interest in a foreign company and another person is entitled to acquire that interest and both are in the same group of 5 or fewer persons for the purposes of determining whether the foreign company is a CFC, the interest would be double counted. We have therefore included in the draft legislation a provision which would avoid this type of double counting.

3.4.7 It is necessary to base the control test on the aggregate interests of a small number of persons, though the particular number is arbitrary, because the larger the group, the smaller each person's respective interest will be and the less likely it is that they will have sufficient incentive or opportunity to concert their actions in order to control a company. Where, however, the directors of a company control it, the size of the group is irrelevant. We therefore propose that a foreign company in which the New Zealand resident directors (or their nominees) have an aggregate control interest of 50 percent or more be included in the definition of a CFC, irrespective of the number of such directors.

3.4.8 It is important to note that the calculation of a person's control interest in a foreign company requires the person to include interests which he or she is contingently or absolutely entitled to acquire in the future. Thus, interests which a person could acquire under an option to buy shares or an option to acquire such an option must be taken into account. Similarly, interests which a person would acquire if another person exercised an option to sell such interests to them need to be taken into account where the terms of the agreement are such that the exercise of the option is a matter of course. Hence, so-called "shot-gun provisions" in a buy-sell agreement requiring a purchaser to buy shares in certain circumstances must be taken into account. In addition, a right or entitlement to acquire shares or voting rights given to a creditor in terms of a debt instrument needs to be taken into account.

3.4.9 Instances have arisen in other jurisdictions where a parent company has tried to avoid having direct control of a foreign subsidiary by issuing shares in the subsidiary to the parent's own shareholders. In order that the subsidiary's shares are not traded separately from those of the parent, they are "stapled" to the former. To accommodate this possibility, we propose that, where shares in a foreign company (the "stapled" company) can ordinarily be transferred only in conjunction with the shares of a New Zealand resident company or a controlled foreign company, shares in the stapled company should be deemed to be held by the New Zealand resident company or the controlled foreign company. This is simpler than the alternative provision, discussed in our previous report, of treating the stapled company as an associated person of the parent company.

#### Recommendations

3.4.10 Accordingly the Committee recommends that:

a   the control interest of a resident in a foreign company in any category of interest be defined as the aggregate of the person's direct and indirect control interests in that category and those of associated persons;

b   as a general principle, interests in a foreign company held by a CFC or associated persons of the CFC be attributed to the group of residents with the highest aggregate control interest in the CFC and, where there is more than one such group, to the smallest one and, where there is more than one person in any such group, the interests of the CFC be apportioned among them according to their income interests in the CFC;

c   any interests held by a nominee of a person be deemed to be held by that person;

d   a foreign company be defined as a CFC in respect of any accounting year of the company if, on any of the measurement days that fall within that accounting year, there are five or fewer residents whose aggregate control interest in the company in any category of interest is 50 percent or more;

e   where residents are directors of a foreign company and in aggregate have a control interest in the company in any category of interest of 50 percent or more, the company be deemed to be a CFC irrespective of the number of such directors; and

f   where shares in a foreign company (the "stapled" company) can be transferred only in conjunction with the shares of a New Zealand resident company or a controlled foreign company, shares in the stapled company be deemed to be held by the New Zealand resident company or the controlled foreign company.

### 3.5 Calculation of Income Interests

3.5.1 As noted above, the interests in a foreign company to be taken into account in determining the income to be attributed to a person under the BE regime can be referred to as his or her "income interest" in the foreign company. We propose three differences between the determination of control and income interests.

3.5.2 First, while it is necessary for the purposes of the control test to take into account interests held by associated persons, this should not be the case for income attribution purposes. The income interest of a resident should depend only on his or her direct and indirect interests, including those of nominees, and not those of associated persons. Where both parties are residents, income attributable to any interests they hold will be taxable in their hands. Thus, there is an important distinction between nominees and associated persons.

3.5.3 Secondly, we propose that the circumstances in which an entitlement to acquire an interest in a foreign company gives rise to an income interest be more circumscribed than we propose for control purposes. A person who is entitled to acquire an interest in a foreign company will have a control interest in that company, but it will not always be appropriate to attribute income to that person. For example, the interest to be acquired may be held by another resident and income would be attributed to that resident. In addition, entitlements may not be exercised. This will generally be the case if the consideration payable to exercise the entitlement exceeds the market value of the interest to be acquired. Conversely, where a resident is entitled to acquire an interest in a foreign company at less than its market value, it is reasonable to assume that the entitlement will be exercised. The resident should then have an income interest in that company. Similarly, an income interest should arise if a resident is entitled to acquire an interest held by another person who has received financial assistance from the resident to acquire that interest.

3.5.4 In view of these considerations, we propose that an entitlement to acquire an interest in a foreign company give rise to an income interest whenever the consideration payable to exercise the entitlement is less than the market value of the interest to be acquired or when a person who is entitled to acquire an interest has given any form of financial assistance, such as a loan, cancellation or reduction of a debt, guarantee or other form of indemnity, to the person who holds the interest for the purposes of acquiring or holding that interest.

3.5.5 In addition, it is necessary to support these provisions by a general anti-avoidance measure the effect of which would be to deem a person to hold an interest which he or she is entitled to acquire if the holding of that entitlement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of these provisions. Such a provision clearly needs to be supported by full disclosure. Entitlements to acquire interests in foreign companies are to be taken into account for control purposes and therefore must be disclosed. Where a person's income interest in a foreign company is significantly less than his or her control interest, the Commissioner should require a reconciliation of the two.

3.5.6 Thirdly, indirect income interests (i.e. those held through CFCs) need to be calculated differently from indirect control interests. As explained in the previous section, for control purposes it is necessary to deem all of the interests held by a CFC in a foreign company to be interests of the controlling shareholders of the CFC. The income of the underlying company would, however, normally be distributed to its shareholders in proportion to their interests in it. Thus, a 51 percent shareholder, even though controlling a company, would normally expect to receive only 51 percent of the income of the company, not 100 percent (although, as noted in section 3.2.6, in some circumstances, shareholders should have 100 percent of the income attributed to them). It is therefore necessary to compute a person's income interest in a CFC held through another CFC by multiplying the person's direct income interest (and that of any nominees) in the first CFC by that CFC's direct income interest in the second CFC, and so on.

3.5.7 The direct and indirect interests of a person in a CFC will be measured on each of the measurement days falling within the accounting year of the CFC. It will be necessary for the person to determine, for each of those measurement days, his or her direct and indirect income interests in each category of interest. The person's income interest for any quarter should then be taken as the highest of the five categories of income interest of the person on the last day of the quarter. In other words, the person would be deemed to have held that highest interest on each day of the preceding quarter.

3.5.8 The calculation of income interests will in most cases be a good deal simpler than the previous paragraph might suggest. In most companies, the rights of members by virtue of share ownership to vote, to share in dividends, to participate in winding up and so on do not vary from share to share, except where there are shares carrying a fixed dividend entitlement only. Thus, generally speaking, a shareholder will not need to examine his or her shares category by category to determine what percentage of rights he or she has in each case. In closely held companies, on the other hand, where a variety of share categories is more common, there is relatively little change in shareholding from year to year. Moreover, where a company is closely held, a New Zealand shareholder should not find the task of checking his or her income interest excessively onerous.

3.5.9 In order to determine a person's income interest with respect to a CFC and an accounting year, his or her income interests in each quarter, calculated as outlined in the previous paragraphs, should be averaged over the year. The resulting income interest represents an average interest of the person in the CFC for that year. This interest would be the basis of calculating the income to be attributed to the person in respect of that CFC and that accounting year. An equivalent rule is needed for short or long accounting periods arising from changes in balance dates or residence.

3.5.10 On page 85 of out first report, we indicated that we were considering an anti-avoidance rule aimed at situations where five or fewer taxpayers structured their affairs to achieve an income interest in a foreign company of more than 50 percent but a control interest of less than a 50 percent. On further examination, we consider that such an arrangement is possible only where the taxpayers hold interests in the company through a non-controlled company. This would mean that the group may not exercise control over the disposition of the underlying company's income and assets. We therefore consider that special provision for this situation is not needed. The definition of associated persons and of a nominee should be sufficient to deal with circumstances where there is any understanding or arrangement between the group and the non-controlled foreign company to act in concert.

#### Recommendations

3.5.11 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   the income interest of a resident in a CFC for any calendar quarter be the highest of the sum of the resident's direct and indirect income interests in the CFC on the last day of that quarter in the five categories of interest defined in paragraph 3.2.7;

b   an entitlement to acquire an interest in a foreign company give rise to an income interest where:

i   the consideration payable to exercise the entitlement is less than the market value of the interest to be acquired; or

ii   the person holding the entitlement has given any form of financial assistance to the person holding the interest for the purpose of acquiring or holding that interest; or

iii   the holding of the entitlement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the BE regime;

c   the income interest of a resident in a foreign company held through a CFC be calculated by multiplying the resident's direct income interest in the CFC by the CFC's direct income interest in the other company, and so on where the interest is held through more than one CFC; and

d   the income interest of a person in a CFC for any accounting period of the CFC be calculated as the average of the person's income interests for the quarters which fall in that accounting period.

### 4.1 Introduction

4.1.1 Residents with an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC will be required to compute the income or loss to be attributed to them in respect of that CFC. This will depend on their income interest in the CFC and the BE income or loss of the CFC. BE income and losses will generally be calculated according to New Zealand tax law though, as outlined in section 4.4 below, a number of departures from domestic law are required. Where the CFC is resident in a grey list country, its resident shareholders will be exempt from the regime unless the company utilises one or more of what the Committee considers, as discussed in chapter 1, should be a very limited list of significant tax preferences. Where such a CFC does utilise a listed preference, we propose that a much simplified basis of computing the BE income or loss of the company should apply.

4.1.2 Where residents have an amount of attributed income or loss in respect of any accounting year of a CFC, they will be able to claim a credit for their proportionate share of the foreign tax paid by the CFC in that year. We propose that provision be made for the carry forward of excess foreign tax credits. We also propose that BE losses be "ring-fenced" on a jurisdictional basis.

4.1.3 The broad outline of these provisions was decided in response to the Committee's first report. This chapter outlines our recommendations on the remaining details of the attribution and computation of BE income and losses, the operation of the grey list exemption, the calculation of foreign tax credits and a number of related issues. The corresponding parts of the draft legislation are sections 245E to 245N.

### 4.2 Attribution of Income and Losses

4.2.1 In Annex 2 of our earlier report, we indicated that we favoured an exemption for persons with income interests in a CFC of less than 10 percent. Though such residents would need to compute their control and income interests on each of the four measurement days during a year in order to determine that their income interests fell below the 10 percent threshold, they would not have to incur the possibly much more substantial costs of computing the BE income of the CFC and their proportionate share of the foreign tax paid by it. An alternative would be to have an exemption for residents with BE income below a certain threshold but this would be self-defeating from the point of view of minimising compliance costs since the residents would first have to compute BE income before determining whether they were exempt. Hence, the Committee continues to favour an exemption for residents who have an income interest of less than 10 percent. In order to prevent residents from fragmenting their income interests among associated persons, for the purposes of this exemption only, a person's income interests should include those of associated persons.

4.2.2 Where a resident, together with associated persons, has an income interest in a CFC which is above the 10 percent threshold, an amount of income or loss will be attributed to the person. The attributed income or loss in respect of any accounting year of the CFC should be calculated by multiplying the resident's income interest in the CFC for that year by the BE income or loss of the CFC for that year.

4.2.3 As explained in chapter 3, the definition of an interest in a foreign company needs to be wide in order to cover the variety of instruments or arrangements which a resident could use to control and accumulate income in such a company. The consequence of such a wide definition is, however, that an attributed loss may arise where a person has no economic or financial loss. For example, a person may have an option to acquire shares in a foreign company which, because it makes a loss, is not exercised. The economic or financial loss of the person is limited to the amount he or she paid for the option. No part of the loss of the company should be attributed to the person. Similarly, where a person owns shares in a company which makes a loss, but the person has an option to require another person to purchase the shares at a certain price, the economic or financial loss of the person is restricted by the option.

4.2.4 A general response to this issue would be to have a wash-up on disposal of an interest to the effect that the cumulative attributed income or loss of a person in relation to any income interest would be limited to the overall gain or loss he or she realises on the disposal of the interest. This type of provision could be considered as a complement to the general taxation of capital gains.

4.2.5 For the present, we propose that an attributed loss of a resident not be recognised where the person suffers little or no economic or financial loss. In applying this provision, it would be necessary to have regard to such things as the extent to which an attributed loss is due to a right to acquire an interest in a CFC with a BE loss and to the extent to which interests in a CFC with a BE loss could be disposed of under an option to require another person to purchase them.

4.2.6 A further consequence of the way in which we have defined an interest is that it is possible that the aggregate income interests of residents may exceed 100 percent. For example, one resident may own 100 percent of the voting rights of a foreign company while another holds 100 percent of the dividend rights, though such an outcome would be unusual. Where it does occur, more than 100 percent of the BE income or loss of a CFC could be attributed to residents. To avoid this possibility, we propose that, where the income interests of 10 percent or more of residents in a CFC in any accounting year when aggregated would otherwise exceed 100 percent, the income interest of each resident be apportioned downward so that the aggregate income interest does not exceed 100 percent.

#### Recommendations

4.2.7 The Committee therefore recommends that:

a   residents be exempt from the BE regime in respect of a CFC and an accounting year of the CFC where their income interest in the CFC for that year and that of any associated persons is less than 10 percent;

b   the attributed income or loss of a resident with respect to a CFC and any accounting year of the CFC be calculated by multiplying the resident's income interest in the CFC for that year by the BE income or loss of the CFC for that year

c   an attributed loss of a resident not be recognised where the resident suffers little or no economic or financial loss; and

d   where the aggregate income interests of 10 percent or more of residents in a CFC in any accounting year would otherwise exceed 100 percent, the income interest of each resident be apportioned downward so that the aggregate income interest equals 100 percent.

### 4.3 Adoption of CFC's Accounting Year

4.3.1 In Annex 2 of our previous report, we considered that residents should bring to account any attributed income or loss of a CFC in the income year corresponding to the accounting year of the CFC pursuant to section 15 of the Act. Thus, for example, if a CFC had a balance date between 1 April and 30 September, any attributed income of residents in respect of that CFC would be brought to account in the income year ending on the preceding 31 March. The advantage of this rule is that it is the same as that applying domestically. A problem with this approach, however, is that where a CFC's balance date falls after that of the resident taxpayer (it could be up to one year later), the taxpayer would have obvious difficulty calculating the BE income or loss of the CFC in the time required to file a tax return for the year and little if any information on which to base his or her provisional tax payments.

4.3.2 The alternative rule would be to require attributed income and losses to be allocated to the income year in which the balance date of the CFC falls. This would mean that the balance date of the CFC could never be later than that of its resident shareholders, thus reducing the compliance problem of computing BE income or losses. For this reason, we now favour this approach.

4.3.3 As a general rule, we propose that residents be required to compute their control and income interests in a CFC and its BE income or loss based on the accounting year of the CFC. Where the accounting year of the CFC changes, the Commissioner's approval of the use of the new accounting year for the purposes of the BE regime should be required. Since New Zealand has no jurisdiction over non-residents, it is not practicable to require the CFC itself to obtain the Commissioner's consent to the change.

4.3.4 In determining whether to give his consent to the use of a new balance date by residents, the Commissioner could consider such factors as a change of ownership of the CFC, the requirements of the tax law of the country of residence of the CFC and the balance dates of any other companies in the same group as the foreign company. Where the Commissioner declines to give his consent, residents would be required to continue to compute their control interests, income interests and the BE income or loss of the CFC on the basis of its old accounting year. To avoid unnecessary complexity, the Commissioner's decision should apply to all residents with an interest in the foreign company.

4.3.5 Where a CFC changes its balance date to a later date and the Commissioner consents to residents using the new accounting year, residents would compute the BE income of the company for the long accounting period but, to avoid incentives for balance date changes in order to defer attributed income, the corresponding attributed income should be brought to account in the income year in which the old balance date falls.

4.3.6 Since it would be possible to avoid seeking the Commissioner's consent to a balance date change by instead acquiring a new company with the desired balance date, consideration may need to be given to strengthening the Commissioner's powers such that he could require taxpayers to compute the BE income of a CFC on the basis of an accounting year different from that of the CFC.

#### Recommendations:

4.3.7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   residents be required to report attributed income in respect of a CFC in any accounting year in the income year in which the balance date of the CFC falls;

b   where a foreign company changes its balance date, residents be required to obtain the Commissioner's consent to compute their control interests, income interests and attributed income or loss in respect of that company on the basis of its new accounting year and the Commissioner's decision apply to all residents with interests in the company;

c   where a CFC changes its balance date to a later date and the Commissioner consents to the residents using the new accounting year, any attributed income of a resident for the resulting long accounting period be brought to account in the income year in which the old balance date falls.

### 4.4 BE Income Calculation

4.4.1 In Annex 2 of our first report, we outlined our views on the general approach that should be adopted for the calculation of BE income or losses. As a general rule, the BE income or loss of a CFC should be calculated as if it were a New Zealand resident. A number of departures from domestic law are, however, required:

a   rules are needed to determine the opening value of the depreciable assets and trading stock of a CFC in the year it first comes within the regime. As discussed previously, we propose that residents have the option of using the values used by the CFC for tax purposes in its own jurisdiction (provided that they are not higher than market value or the values that would apply had the CFC been at all times a New Zealand resident). Having elected either option, the taxpayer should be required to value all of the depreciable assets and trading stock of the CFC on that basis;

b   the acquisition price of financial arrangements in the initial year should be, at the option of the taxpayer, the market value of the arrangement or its adjusted base price (being its original acquisition price, plus the amount of interest which has accrued since acquisition or issue, less the the sum of all consideration paid, in the case of an issuer, or received in the case of a holder);

c   the BE income or loss of a CFC should be computed in the currency which the CFC uses for financial reporting purposes or, if there is no such reporting, the currency of the country in which the CFC is resident. We propose that the foreign currency annual income or loss then be converted into New Zealand dollars at an average of the mid-month New Zealand dollar/foreign currency spot exchange rates for the months falling within the reporting period;

d   a number of sections contain incentives relating to the encouragement of investment in New Zealand, most of which are now being phased out, which should not apply for the purposes of computing BE income or losses;

e   other sections have references to the carrying on of a business in New Zealand. In order that they can apply to the computation of BE income or losses, where applicable, the business carried on by a CFC needs to be deemed to be carried on in New Zealand;

f   dividends received by resident companies from non-resident companies after 1 April 1988 are to be subject to the withholding payment regime. It is therefore necessary to tax or subject to the withholding payment dividends received by a CFC. Dividends received by one CFC from another should, however, be exempt in order to avoid multiple taxation. We therefore propose that, in determining the BE income or loss of a CFC with respect to any resident taxpayer, dividends received by the CFC be taxable, other than dividends which are received from another CFC in respect of which the taxpayer has an income interest of 10 percent or more. One consequence of this provision is that the BE income or loss of a CFC may differ for different taxpayers according to whether the CFC has received dividends from another CFC in which some but not all of its resident controllers also have an income interest;

g   section 67, the section dealing with profits on land transactions, gives rise to an assessable profit where a taxpayer disposes of land and, at the time of acquiring the land, the taxpayer or an associated person was a dealer in land, a land developer or a builder. We consider that, for the purposes of the BE regime, the assessable income of a CFC should not be affected by the activities of associated persons who are not New Zealand residents. A similar provision exists in section 191(4A). If this section applied to a CFC, it could bring within the BE income of the CFC profits or gains derived by other companies in the same group. We consider that neither section should apply to the extent that the activities of associated persons of a CFC who are not New Zealand residents would give rise to income which would be assessable to the CFC;

h   a number of sections refer to other New Zealand statutes (e.g. the Bankruptcy Act 1908 and the Companies Act 1955). These sections should apply as if such references were references to equivalent legislation in the country of residence of the CFC;

i   section 117 of the Act deals with the recovery of excess depreciation on the disposal of an asset. The amount of depreciation recovered is equal to the lesser of the sum of the depreciation deductions allowed over the life of the asset and the difference between its written down value and its cost price. For the purposes of applying this rule, the written down value of an asset should be deemed to be its cost less the sum of the depreciation deductions allowed under the BE regime. The maximum amount of depreciation recovered would then be the aggregate of the depreciation deductions allowed in computing BE income;

j   section 129 is the section dealing with the recovery of interest on money borrowed to acquire or develop land which is sold within 10 years of its purchase. The section now applies only to land not used in the primary sector. In order that the section applies to interest on money borrowed by a CFC, it is necessary that the interest expense of a CFC which is deducted in computing the BE income of the CFC be treated as if it were a deduction allowed to the CFC;

k any value added tax in an overseas country should be accounted for in the same way as GST in New Zealand, as determined by section 140B;

l   where a taxpayer finances expenditure by way of a Government grant or subsidy, a deduction for the expenditure is not permitted. Where the expenditure relates to a depreciable asset, the depreciable value of the asset for tax purposes is reduced by the amount of the grant or subsidy. We propose that a comparable treatment apply to grants or subsidies received by a CFC from other governments. Where a subsidy or grant does not relate to deductible or depreciable expenditure, we propose that it should be treated as assessable income for the purposes of computing BE income;

m   the loss carry forward and grouping rules in sections 188 and 191 should not apply since, as explained in section 4.6, residents will be able, subject to certain restrictions, to carry forward and group attributed losses. There would be double counting if losses were also able to be carried forward and grouped in the computation of BE income;

n   in paragraph m above, we proposed that the BE income or loss of a CFC should be calculated without taking into account the BE income or loss of any other company. A CFC with a loss in its country of residence may, however, transfer the loss to a related company under grouping provisions similar to those in section 191. For example, the transfer may be effected by way of a subvention payment made to the CFC by another company. The effect would then be to increase the income tax paid by the CFC in future years. This would in turn increase the foreign tax credit that residents could claim under the BE regime. We therefore propose that any gain of a CFC which arises as a result of the transfer of a loss to another company should be included as assessable income under the BE regime;

o   section 208(1)(a) of the Act currently exempts from tax underwriting profits of an insurance company derived from insurance business carried on out of New Zealand. Section 208(1)(b) denies a deduction for reinsurance premiums paid out of New Zealand. In order that the CFC regime extends to so-called "captive" insurance companies (i.e. one that insures the risks of its parent in New Zealand and/or associated persons), the exemption in section 208(1)(a) should not apply, except where the income of a CFC consists of a reinsurance premium paid by a New Zealand insurance company which has been denied a deduction for the premium by virtue of section 208(1)(b);

p   sections 214A to 222 deal with the taxation of mineral and petroleum mining. Legislation implementing a new petroleum mining regime is currently before the House. A number of the provisions of the new regime are linked to the holding or relinquishment of prospecting or mining licences issued by the Ministry of Energy. It is not possible to specify parallel licences that might exist overseas. Hence, we have included a general provision in the draft legislation requiring that these sections apply with any necessary modifications for the purposes of computing BE income; and

q   the specified lease provisions should not apply to any leases entered into by the CFC before the first day of the accounting period in which it becomes a CFC, not being a day before 1 April 1988.

4.4.2 The above modifications also have implications for the computation of the income of foreign branches of New Zealand resident companies. We therefore recommend that consideration be given to requiring the income of foreign branches to be computed on the same basis as the BE income of CFCs.

### 4.5 Foreign Tax Credits

4.5.1 Residents with income interests in CFCs (together with those of associated persons) in excess of the 10 percent threshold will be assessed on their pro rata share of the BE income of the CFC and will receive a pro rata credit for the income tax paid by that company. It is therefore necessary to have provisions for determining how the tax credit is to be calculated.

4.5.2 New Zealand, like most countries, currently allows residents a credit for foreign taxes paid on foreign-source income up to the amount of New Zealand tax that is payable on that income. This is provided for under section 293 of the Act. The most important application of this section is to foreign-source income earned by resident companies through foreign branches. A branch is not a separate legal entity so its income is amalgamated with that of its parent company for New Zealand tax purposes. The company is then able to claim a credit for the foreign tax paid by the branch.

4.5.3 The general approach of the BE regime, as the name suggests, is to treat CFCs in the same way as branches. The foreign tax credit provisions applying to the BE regime should therefore be based as far as possible on the existing provisions. Section 293 is, however, rudimentary. While it may suffice when, as at present, it has limited application, it will not do so for the much more significant purposes of the BE regime. We therefore propose modifications to the section 293 provisions for the purpose of the BE regime. These modifications could apply equally to branches, suggesting that section 293 should itself be amended.

4.5.4 The first issue to consider is the definition of the foreign taxes which can be credited. Under the present section, creditable income tax is any tax which, in the opinion of the Commissioner is of "substantially the same nature" as New Zealand income tax. This definition has some ambiguity but most tax practitioners consider that it includes income taxes levied by central, state or local governments, provided that they are of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax. The Department takes the view that only federal level income taxes are creditable. To clarify the issue, a legislative amendment is necessary. We propose that, for the purpose of the BE regime, any income or withholding tax paid by a CFC be creditable. Since a CFC may pay New Zealand income tax if it has New Zealand-source income, such tax should also be creditable under the BE regime.

4.5.5 In some cases, a CFC may earn income which is not subject to tax in either the jurisdiction in which it is derived or the jurisdiction in which the CFC is resident. The income tax paid by the CFC on its taxable income would then be credited towards the resident's income tax payable on the total BE income of the company, including that which is exempt to the CFC. This would permit income tax paid in one jurisdiction to relieve New Zealand income tax on income which was exempt in another. We therefore propose that the proportion of the total income tax paid by a CFC that is creditable under the BE regime be the proportion of its total income that is taxable in its country of residence or the country of source of the income.

4.5.6 A resident's proportionate share of the total creditable income tax paid by a CFC in any accounting year should equal the proportion that the resident's attributed income or loss in that year in relation to that CFC makes up of the BE income or loss of the CFC in that year. This should be found by multiplying the person's income interest in the CFC by the total amount of the creditable income tax it has paid. Where residents with income interests in a CFC of 10 percent or more have an aggregate income interest in that CFC of more than 100 percent, the tax credit allowed to each person would be scaled down according to the rule outlined in section 4.2.

4.5.7 As noted above, section 293 currently limits the maximum credit allowed in respect of any foreign income to the New Zealand income tax payable on the income. We consider that it is necessary to have an equivalent provision in the BE regime since foreign tax could otherwise be used to offset New Zealand income tax payable on New Zealand-source income.

4.5.8 As a result of this limitation, the credit allowed to residents will sometimes exceed the New Zealand income tax payable on their attributed income. The question therefore arises of whether residents should be able to offset excess tax credits in respect of one CFC against their New Zealand tax payable on attributed income derived from another CFC. The CD proposed that credits should be limited on an entity by entity basis and a source by source basis. That is, residents would be required to separate out the taxable income (measured under New Zealand rules) of each CFC according to the jurisdiction in which the income was sourced, determine the foreign tax paid by the CFC in respect of each category and the New Zealand tax payable on each category. This approach would therefore be complicated. In addition, the dual limitation would not be effective where the New Zealand resident controllers of more than one CFC could shift income between CFCs. The scope for such shifting will be greatest when the CFCs are in the same jurisdiction.

4.5.9 An alternative approach advocated in submissions would be to have a global computation of attributed income and foreign tax credits. This would, however, allow the tax paid by a CFC in a high tax jurisdiction to offset New Zealand tax payable on attributed income derived through CFCs in low tax jurisdictions. Thus, the income of tax haven companies, which could include income diverted from New Zealand, could be sheltered by foreign tax paid by a CFC in a high tax jurisdiction. This would not be consistent with the anti-avoidance objective of the international reforms.

4.5.10 The Committee favours an intermediate approach of a country by country limitation. That is, residents would be able to aggregate the attributed income or loss they derive from CFCs which are resident in the same jurisdiction. Similarly, they would aggregate allowable foreign tax credits in respect of those CFCs. The resulting aggregate foreign tax credit would be able to be credited towards the New Zealand tax payable on the resident's aggregate attributed income derived in that jurisdiction, with the maximum credit equal to the New Zealand tax payable. This approach recognises that scope exists for shifting income between companies in the same jurisdiction but, as far as it is possible to do so, avoids allowing residents to use tax paid in high tax jurisdictions to shelter income in low tax jurisdictions. In addition, we note that a country by country limitation is consistent with the existing rules in section 293.

4.5.11 A further issue is the extent to which excess tax credits with respect to any jurisdiction should be able to be carried forward or backward. Excess foreign tax credits could arise because New Zealand and the foreign country calculate taxable income differently or because the New Zealand tax rates differ from those in the other country. We consider that an adjustment to take account of differing tax rates is not necessary for the purposes of the BE regime as long as the maximum allowable credit in any year is limited to the New Zealand tax payable on attributed income derived in that year.

4.5.12 The main argument for allowing excess credits to be carried into another income year is to smooth out the effect of income measurement differences. For example, under our accrual rules, interest income is accrued over the term of the instrument. If another country taxes interest only on receipt, there may be no foreign tax payable in a particular year because no interest is received, and hence no foreign tax credit, whereas a New Zealand resident would be taxed under the BE regime on accrued interest. When the interest is received, it would be taxable in the other jurisdiction but, provided that it had been accrued correctly, no income would be derived under the New Zealand rules. Thus, both New Zealand tax and foreign tax would be payable on the same income and no foreign tax credit would be allowed because the foreign and the New Zealand taxable income would fall into different years. To avoid such consequences, we propose that excess credits of a resident with respect to an interest in a CFC should be able to be carried forward for credit against the New Zealand tax payable on attributed income of the resident in future income years derived in respect of that CFC or other CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction. In principle, carry back might also be allowed but we do not favour it because of the administrative difficulties of reopening past assessments.

4.5.13 For consistency with our proposed treatment of losses, which is discussed in more detail in the next section, we propose that the carry forward of a credit by a company should be subject to a 40 percent continuity of shareholding test equivalent to that in section 188, the company loss carry forward provision. For the same reason, we recommend that credits be able to be transferred between the companies in a group of companies. Transfer of losses by way of subvention payments has no parallel in the case of foreign tax credits. Thus, we propose that the grouping of credits be permitted only in the case of specified groups (i.e those with 100 percent common shareholding), subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191.

4.5.14 Finally, we note that a double taxation problem may arise when a company falls within both the BE regime and the CFC regime of another country. For example, a New Zealand resident may own a United Kingdom ("UK") company which in turn owns a company in Cyprus. The UK company may incur a tax liability under the UK's CFC regime in respect of the Cyprus company. The New Zealand BE regime would attribute a New Zealand tax liability to the New Zealand resident in respect of the Cyprus company but credit would not be allowed for the UK tax paid by the UK company since it was not paid by the Cyprus company. To avoid double taxation in these circumstances, we propose that foreign income tax paid by a CFC in respect of income attributable to another CFC be deemed to be paid by the latter.

#### Recommendations

4.5.15 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   subject to recommendation b, income and withholding tax paid by a CFC be creditable under the BE regime;

b   the proportion of the total income tax paid by a CFC that is creditable under the BE regime be the proportion of its total income that is taxable in its country of residence or the country of source of the income;

c   residents be able to aggregate their proportionate shares of the creditable taxes paid by CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction;

d   the maximum credit allowable to a resident in any income year in respect of his or her aggregate attributed income derived from interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction be the New Zealand income tax payable on that income in that year;

e   residents be able to carry forward excess tax credits in respect of CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction for offset against New Zealand income tax payable in any future income year on attributed income in respect of CFCs resident in that jurisdiction;

f   the carry forward of an excess credit by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test equivalent to that in section 188;

g   a credit allowed to one company in a specified group of companies in respect of an income interest in a CFC be able to be transferred to another company in the specified group for offset against the New Zealand income tax payable by that company on attributed income derived from a CFC resident in the same jurisdiction as the first-mentioned CFC, subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191; and

h   foreign income tax paid by a CFC in respect of income attributable to another CFC be deemed to be paid by the latter CFC.

### 4.6 Attributed Foreign Losses

4.6.1 In the domestic context, the New Zealand tax system is based on a global computation of income. That is, residents amalgamate their profits and losses from all their activities and are taxed on the basis of the net result. There are two reasons to depart from this global treatment in the context of the BE regime. First, a BE profit is not equivalent to a domestic profit as far as the consequences for tax revenue are concerned because of the allowance of a foreign tax credit. New Zealand will collect revenue on the BE profits of CFCs only to the extent that the foreign tax credit allowed is less than the New Zealand tax payable on the profits. For this reason, a BE loss should also be treated differently from a domestic loss. The regime would be asymmetric if it permitted attributed losses to be aggregated with domestic income but then allowed a credit for foreign tax paid by a CFC once a resident had attributed income. Thus, one of the consequences of allowing a credit for income taxes paid by a CFC is the need to restrict the offset of attributed losses against domestic income.

4.6.2 Secondly, unrestricted offset of BE losses would give rise to problems where New Zealand residents were able to acquire losses in foreign companies. We referred earlier to the need for a special provision to counter this, but such provisions can never be fully effective.

4.6.3 For these reasons, we consider that attributed losses under the BE regime should not be able to be offset against other taxable income. At the same time, we recognise that loss ring-fencing is seldom very effective, particularly in the absence of interjurisdictional allocation rules. Taxpayers invariably find ways to mitigate its effect. Nevertheless, unrestricted offset of BE losses against domestic income could not be justified.

4.6.4 The Committee proposes that taxpayers be able to aggregate attributed income and losses from income interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction. As noted in the previous section, the rationale for not permitting grouping of attributed income and losses derived in different jurisdictions is that this would permit income accumulated in low tax jurisdictions to be sheltered by losses derived in high tax jurisdictions. This would not be consistent with the basic anti-avoidance objective of the regime.

4.6.5 Where a taxpayer's aggregate attributed income for a jurisdiction is a loss, we propose that it be able to be carried forward for offset against future attributed income derived from income interests in CFCs resident in that jurisdiction. Where the taxpayer is a company, the carry forward of an attributed loss should be subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 188. In addition, as for tax credits, we propose that companies in the same specified group that have income interests in two or more CFCs in the same jurisdiction should be able to aggregate their attributed income and losses in respect of those interests, subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191.

#### Recommendations

4.6.6 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   an attributed loss of a taxpayer derived from an income interest in a CFC be able to be offset only against attributed income derived from income interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction as the first-mentioned CFC in the same or a future income year;

b   the carry forward of an attributed loss by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test equivalent to that in section 188; and

c   companies in the same specified group be able to aggregate attributed income and losses in respect of income interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191.

### 4.7 Application of the Regime to CFCs Resident in a "Grey List" Country

4.7.1 The BE regime will not apply to a CFC resident in "grey list" countries (i.e the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, France, Canada and Australia) unless the CFC utilises a specified significant tax preference. Where such a CFC did utilise a listed preference, we recommended in our first report that its resident controllers should be required to adjust the taxable income of the CFC, measured according to the tax law of its country of residence, for the effect of the preference. If the foreign tax paid by the CFC as a percentage of the adjusted taxable income equalled or exceeded the New Zealand company rate, the CFC would remain exempt from the regime.

4.7.2 The application of the regime in these circumstances can now be spelt out in more detail. We consider that the best approach is to adopt a simplified computation of BE income whenever a CFC resident in a grey list country utilises a listed significant preference in a particular income year. In such cases, the BE income of the CFC would equal its taxable income in that year computed according to the tax law of its country of residence before taking into account any losses incurred by the CFC in other years or losses incurred by any other company, adjusted for the effect of the listed preference.

4.7.3 The adding back of any losses incurred by the CFC or any other company is necessary in part for consistency with the way in which the BE regime will apply outside of the grey list countries and in part to prevent possible double counting of losses, once in the computation of the BE income of a grey list CFC and again as an attributed loss in the hands of resident taxpayers.

4.7.4 In all other respects, the BE regime would apply to grey list CFCs in the same way as for other CFCs. Where a grey list CFC fell into the regime by virtue of utilising a significant preference, no New Zealand tax would be payable on its BE income to the extent that it paid income tax at least equal to the New Zealand tax that would be payable on its income. Thus, the allowance of a tax credit has the same effect as the rate test outlined in paragraph 4.7.1.

#### Recommendation

4.7.5 The Committee therefore recommends that where a CFC resident in a grey list country utilises a listed significant preference in any accounting year, the BE regime apply as for CFCs resident in other jurisdictions except that the BE income or loss of the CFC be computed as its taxable income or loss for that year, measured according to the tax law of its country of residence (before taking into account any losses of the CFC incurred in other years or losses incurred by any other company), adjusted for the effect of the listed preference.

### 4.8 Change of Residence of CFC or Taxpayers

4.8.1 Provisions are required to deal with changes of residence of foreign companies and New Zealand residents. For example, where a resident company ceases to be resident, it should be deemed to have an accounting period that commences on the day on which it ceases to be resident so that, if it falls into the BE regime as a result of its change of residence, an accounting period with respect to the computation of BE income is defined. These rules are therefore necessary for the mechanics of the BE regime.

4.8.2 The compliance costs of computing BE income for a short accounting period required as a result of a change of residence may be excessive. Thus, residents should have the option of pro rating the income derived by the CFC in its actual accounting year.

### 4.9 Determination of Residence

4.9.1 A number of provisions of the proposed regime depend on the residence of a company. For example, we have proposed that the carry forward of losses and excess tax credits be limited on a jurisdictional basis. In addition, the transitional provisions are related to the fiscal residence of a foreign company. This means that it is necessary to have provisions for determining unambiguously the residence of a foreign company.

4.9.2 The fiscal residence of a company will normally be the jurisdiction in which it is liable for tax. Where a company is resident in two or more jurisdictions, it should be regarded as being resident in the jurisdiction which the New Zealand residence rules would assign it to. If this still does not prescribe a single residence to the company, the country in which most of its assets are located should be its fiscal residence. Where none of these rules settles the residence of a company, there is no option but to let the Commissioner decide.

### 5.1 Introduction

5.1.1 The foreign investment fund regime is to apply to interests in offshore investment vehicles which fall outside the BE regime but nevertheless confer tax advantages on residents because of a favourable tax treatment in the country of residence of the fund. An investment fund in the form of a unit trust domiciled in a tax haven is a typical example of such an entity. By accumulating rather than distributing most of its income, the fund can convert income such as interest and dividends into a capital gain to the investor, which can be realised either by sale through a stock exchange or by repurchase by the fund or its managers.

5.1.2 We defined a foreign investment fund in our previous report as any entity:

a   which derives its income or value primarily or substantially from holding or trading portfolio investments in shares, investments in debt instruments, real property, commodities, etc; and where

b   the effect of the fiscal residence and the distribution policy of the entity is to reduce the tax payable on the income of the entity below what it would have been had the income been taxed in New Zealand as it was derived.

5.1.3 The taxable income derived by a New Zealand resident from an interest in a foreign investment fund in any income year is to be calculated as the increase in the market value of the interest over the income year, plus any distributions receivable by the resident.

5.1.4 This chapter outlines the Committee's recommendations on the remaining issues which need to be decided in order to implement the foreign investment fund ("FIF") regime. The relevant section in the draft legislation is section 245O.

### 5.2 Definitions

5.2.1 The definition of a FIF in the draft legislation follows closely the one outlined above with the following changes. Instead of referring to an "entity", the definition lists the types of entities which could be FIFs, namely, a foreign company, a foreign unit trust and a foreign superannuation fund ( which together can be referred to as "foreign entities"). Although a unit trust is deemed to be a company by section 211 of the Income Tax Act, we have expressly referred to unit trusts to emphasise their inclusion in the FIF definition. We propose that the new definition of "superannuation fund" to be added to section 2 as a result of the current review of the tax treatment of superannuation also apply for the purposes of the FIF definition.

5.2.2 The explicit inclusion of unit trusts and superannuation funds in the definition recognises that some countries give favourable tax treatment to such entities. A parallel change is therefore needed to the second leg of the definition, which requires a person to have regard to the jurisdiction in which the entity is resident, requiring a person to also have regard to be concessionary tax regimes applying within that jurisdiction.

5.2.3 An interest in a FIF is defined in the same way as a direct income interest in a foreign company for the purposes of the BE regime. As explained in chapter 3, income interests are defined in terms of the things that a shareholder of a company, or a person entitled to acquire shares, would hold. A person may, however, have rights to the income of a foreign entity by holding a life insurance or superannuation policy issued by that entity. Consequently, life insurance or superannuation policies must be added to the definition of an interest in a foreign entity for the purposes of the FIF regime. Such an interest will, however, be taxable under the regime only if the foreign entity that issued the policy falls within the definition of a FIF.

5.2.4 Constructive ownership rules are not needed in this regime since there is no control test, nor do we propose a minimum interest threshold before the regime applies. Given that the market value of an interest in a FIF will reflect the value of the FIF's direct and indirect interests, it is necessary to focus on direct interests only.

#### Recommendation

5.2.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the foreign investment fund regime apply to interests in foreign companies, foreign unit trusts and foreign superannuation funds that fall within the definition of a foreign investment fund and that the definition of an interest in a foreign investment fund include policies of life insurance or superannuation issued by a foreign investment fund.

### 5.3 Calculation of FIF Income or Loss

5.3.1 The income or loss in any income year that a person derives from an interest in a FIF is to be measured by the change in value of the interest over the year. Taking into account purchases and sales within a year, the taxable income or loss of a person holding an interest in a FIF in any income year can be defined as:

(a + b) − (c + d)

where a = the market value of the interest held at the end of the income year;

b = the market value of all distributions and any other consideration receivable by the person in that income year with respect to that FIF, including any consideration resulting from any disposal of an interest during the income year;

c = the market value of the interest held at the end of the previous income year; and

d = the market value of any consideration paid by the person for the acquisition of an interest during the year.

This definition is essentially the same as the one that you approved in response to our recommendation in Part 1 of our Report on International Tax Reform.

5.3.2 The term "b" in the above formula is defined to include within FIF income all distributions of a FIF. All such distributions, whether of income or capital, need to be included within the definition since any distribution will reduce the end of year market value of a FIF interest. Furthermore, distributions should be taxed in the year they become receivable, rather than the year that they are received, since the corresponding reduction in the market value of a FIF interest resulting from a distribution will be taken into account on an accrual basis. Finally, all distributions must be included, whether they are in cash or otherwise and whether or not they are received directly or are credited in account or are otherwise dealt with in the interest or on behalf of the person.

### 5.4 Treatment of Losses

5.4.1 FIFs have been defined so that it can be reasonably assumed that the change in the market value of an interest in a FIF over an income year will reflect the change in the market value of its net assets over the year. The growth in a FIF's net assets over a year will in turn depend on its income for that year, reduced by any tax paid and by any amount distributed to interest holders during the year. Thus, FIF income or losses will be measured net of any income tax paid by the fund. This means that it is not appropriate to allow interest holders a credit, or a deduction, for any income tax paid by a FIF.

5.4.2 By contrast, a tax credit is to be allowed under the BE regime. We recommended in respect of the BE regime that attributed income and losses of a person under the regime should not be amalgamated except where they are derived in respect of interests in CFCs resident in the same jurisdiction. Residents would otherwise be able to use credits for tax paid by a CFC in a high tax jurisdiction to offset a New Zealand tax liability in respect of an interest in a CFC resident in a low tax jurisdiction. This consideration is not relevant under the FIF regime since credits will not be given. We therefore propose that residents should be able to aggregate their FIF income and losses derived in any income year, irrespective of the residence of the FIF.

5.4.3 In order to ensure that residents are not double taxed on FIF income, once as it is reflected in an increase in the market value of an interest and again on distribution, it is necessary to allow FIF losses to be deductible. The regime should not, however, permit residents to claim a deduction for a FIF loss of income and/or capital accumulated or contributed prior to the introduction of the regime. It is therefore necessary to limit the FIF loss that can be deducted by a resident in any income year to the amount of the FIF income, if any, derived by the resident in that year or an earlier income year with respect to any FIF. Thus, where a FIF loss derived by a resident in any income year exceeds his or her FIF income for that year, the excess loss should be able to be deducted from other income of the resident derived in that year to the extent that the excess loss was less than the cumulative FIF income of the resident derived in earlier income years, less the amount of any such excess losses set off against other income in those earlier years. The effect of this rule is that a FIF loss could be deducted only to the extent to which a person has previously or will currently be taxed on FIF income.

5.4.4 To the extent that a FIF loss cannot be deducted in the year that it is derived, it should be carried forward for offset against FIF income derived in subsequent years. Where the taxpayer is a company, such a loss carry forward should be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test, as we have recommended in the case of BE losses. Similarly, FIF income and losses should be able to be amalgamated within a specified group of companies resident in New Zealand, subject to provisions comparable to those applying to the grouping of losses under section 191.

#### Recommendations

5.4.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   residents be able to aggregate their FIF income and losses derived in any income year from all FIFs in which they have an interest;

b   where a FIF loss derived by a resident in any income year exceeds his or her FIF income for that year, the excess loss be able to be deducted from other income of the resident derived in that year to the extent that the excess loss is less than an amount equal to the cumulative FIF income of the resident derived in earlier income years, less the sum of any excess losses set off against other income in those earlier years pursuant to this provision;

c   to the extent that a FIF loss cannot be set off against FIF or other income derived in the same income year, it be carried forward for offset against FIF income derived in future income years;

d   the carry forward of a FIF loss by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity test similar to that in section 188; and

e   a FIF loss incurred by one company in a specified group of companies be able to be offset against FIF income derived by another company in the specified group subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191.

### 5.5 Entry and Exit Provisions

5.5.1 Occasions will arise when an interest in a FIF will fall within or cease to be within the regime without an acquisition or disposal at market value occurring at the same time. This will happen when:

a   a person becomes or ceases to be a resident;

b   a person disposes of an interest by way of gift or for a consideration which is less than its market value;

c   a person dies; or

d   an interest in a FIF becomes an income interest in a CFC of not less than 10 percent, or vice versa.

In such cases, the interest should be deemed to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be, for its market value on the relevant day.

#### Recommendations

5.5.2 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a deemed acquisition or disposal at market value occur when:

a   a person becomes or ceases to be a resident;

b   a person disposes of an interest by way of gift or for a consideration which is less than its market value;

c   a person dies;

d   an interest in a FIF becomes an income interest in a CFC of not less than 10 percent; or

e   an income interest in a CFC of not less than 10 percent ceases to be such an interest but is an interest in a FIF.

### 5.6 Conflict Provisions

5.6.1 As decided previously, where an interest in a foreign company would give rise to attributed income under both the BE and FIF regimes, the BE regime will apply. This is provided for in section 245P of the draft legislation. The exemption from the BE regime for income interests of less than 10 percent does not, however, apply to the FIF regime. Thus, persons holding income interests in a CFC of less than 10 percent may fall within the FIF regime if the CFC is a FIF.

### 6.1 Introduction

6.1.1 In many circumstances, trusts can substitute for CFCs or FIFs. Hence, it is necessary to support the BE and FIF regimes with a regime applying to trusts. We referred to the trust regime in our first report as "the settlor regime" because it will bring within the tax net the foreign-source trustee income of trusts which have one or more New Zealand resident settlors. This trustee income is now not subject to tax in New Zealand where the trust has non-resident trustees.

6.1.2 A further deficiency with the current rules is the ambiguity about the tax treatment of distributions from non-resident trustees to New Zealand beneficiaries. This was discussed in the Consultative Document released in December and we have drafted legislation to deal explicitly with this type of income. The present rules also attempt to deal, though not very effectively, with the use of trusts for income splitting. With the recent considerable flattening of personal income tax rates, the need for such provisions has lessened. We have therefore taken the opportunity to recommend changes to the existing tax legislation applying to trusts. The result is a new regime for trusts which would apply to domestic trusts as well as to overseas trusts with New Zealand connections.

6.1.3 This chapter outlines the new regime. Transitional issues relating to the treatment of settlements in existence on or before 17 December 1987 are dealt with in chapter 8.

### 6.2 Existing Treatment of Trusts

6.2.1 The present tax treatment of trusts is dealt with primarily in sections 226 to 233 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 226 currently distinguishes between "specified" and "non-specified" trusts. Broadly speaking, non-specified trusts include trusts created by will or on an intestacy and inter-vivos trusts created before 19 July 1968. Specified trusts are inter-vivos trusts created on or after that date. The distinction was brought into existence by an amendment to the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 following the 1968 Budget. The difference between the two types of trust is purely a matter of tax treatment of the income derived by their trustees and beneficiaries. It is not founded in any jurisprudential distinction between trusts of different kinds.

6.2.2 The policy behind the distinction was an effort to frustrate income splitting by means of trusts which was thought to have become particularly prevalent in the 1960's. The benefits of income splitting achieved by taxpayers were enhanced by the steeply progressive income tax scales that prevailed at that time and that remained in force until relatively recently. The effect of this policy is that, broadly speaking, income of a specified trust is taxed at a higher rate than income of a non-specified trust.

6.2.3 The current law further distinguishes between trusts or, more precisely, between different streams of trust income, according to whether income is accumulated by trustees or distributed to beneficiaries and, if the latter, according to whether the distribution is pursuant to a discretion vested in the trustee or to a provision of the trust that fixes the rights of a beneficiary to income. Finally, a distinction is drawn in some circumstances according to whether the beneficiary is an infant or an adult.

6.2.4 Income accumulated by a trustee is taxed in the hands of the trustee at the rates that would apply if the trustee were an individual and had no other income. For specified trusts, there is a minimum rate of 35 percent, reflecting the 1968 policy of harsher treatment for these trusts.

6.2.5 When a trustee does not accumulate income but instead it is derived in trust for a beneficiary "entitled in possession" to the income, it is taxable to that beneficiary. This rule works well enough in the case of adults. If income vests in them by virtue of the provisions of a trust or by virtue of the exercise of a discretion by the trustee, they are entitled in possession to that income because they can call on the trustee to pay it over. This is not the case with infants (nor with persons who lack full legal capacity for other reasons, such as unsoundness of mind) since an infant is not entitled to the possession of income.

6.2.6 Thus, where, in the exercise of a discretion by a trustee, income is paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary by a "bona fide transaction" which places the income beyond the possession and control of the trustee, the beneficiary is deemed to be entitled in possession to the income so long as the payment or application is made within six months of the end of the income year in which the income is derived. The six month rule enables a trustee to calculate the trust's income for the relevant year before applying the money for the benefit of a beneficiary.

6.2.7 An additional condition applies in the case of a specified trust or an infant beneficiary. In that case, where the income comes within the possession or under the control of the trustee or is used for the purposes of a business carried on by the trustee, it is reassessed to the trustee instead of the beneficiary. This rule is part of the harsher regime for specified trusts mentioned in paragraph 6.2.4.

6.2.8 The precise effect of the "bona fide transaction" requirement is not certain. In many cases this requirement poses few problems because income is employed to meet current needs of the beneficiary. In other cases, trustees go to some lengths to ensure that there has been something that qualifies as a payment or an application. A common technique is for the trustee to establish a sub-settlement for the benefit of the beneficiary and for income to be channelled to that sub-settlement. The second requirement outlined in paragraph 6.2.6 in many cases is also able to be avoided, albeit at some cost in the establishment of sub-settlements and other planning devices.

6.2.9 In the case of fixed trusts other than specified trusts, income that vests in an infant beneficiary is also deemed to be income to which the beneficiary is entitled in possession.

6.2.10 In view of the ineffectiveness of the specified/non-specified trust distinction in countering income splitting and of the substantial flattening of the personal income tax scale, the Committee considers that the distinction should be removed. In addition, because the settlor regime supersedes the current trust provisions to some extent it is simpler to replace all of sections 226 to 233 by new provisions which cover both wholly domestic trusts and trusts with foreign elements.

#### Recommendation

6.2.11 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the present distinction between specified and non-specified trusts in sections 226 to 233 of the Act be removed from 1 April 1988.

### 6.3 Overview of Trust Regime

6.3.1 The major difference between the existing tax treatment of trusts and the proposed new regime is that the latter brings within the New Zealand tax net the trustee income of trusts with non-resident trustees which have a New Zealand resident settlor. Such income has previously not been subject to tax in New Zealand except where it has a New Zealand source. As explained in Part 1 of our report, the new regime recognises that the economic substance of a trust may differ from its legal appearance. A settlor may have substantial influence over the trustee, usually on an informal basis though there may be specific provision in the trust deed so that, in practice if not in law, a settlor may be able to wind up a trust and influence or control the disposition of its property.

6.3.2 If this assumption does not accord with the circumstances of a particular trust, then in future New Zealand residents can settle trusts on resident trustees and divest themselves of any liability for tax on trustee income. If they wish to use non-resident trustees, they must be prepared to have the trustee's liability for New Zealand tax on trustee income fall back on them should the trustee default. We recognise that this choice may not be available in respect of trusts that were settled before 17 December 1987 and so have recommended that the settlor in these circumstances not be liable for tax on trustee income. A number of transitional provisions relating to these trust are outlined in chapter 8.

6.3.3 Thus, under the new regime, the foreign-source trustee income of any trust will be taxable in New Zealand where, at any time in an income year, a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand. Trustee income is income derived by a trustee of a trust in any year that is not beneficiary income of any beneficiary of the trust. The tax treatment of trustee income is discussed in section 6.5. We refer to a trust in respect of which trustee income has been taxable in New Zealand in every income year since its settlement as a "qualifying trust". The liability for the tax on trustee income will fall on the trustee. Where there is no resident trustee, the New Zealand resident settlor will be liable as agent of the trustee. In effect, the settlor is treated as the "taxpayer of last resort" in respect of trustee income.

6.3.4 We propose that settlors of trusts that are charitable trusts or superannuation funds not be liable for tax on trustee income as agents of the trustees. In addition, we propose that, where a trust is settled by a new resident before he or she becomes resident in New Zealand, the settlor should not be liable for tax on trustee income provided that the settlor has not been resident in New Zealand at any time after 17 December 1987. These provisions are outlined in sections 6.6 to 6.8. We propose, however, that a new resident in the above circumstances should be able to elect to become liable for tax on trustee income. Similarly, a trustee of a trust which has a settlor who is no longer resident or who has died should be able to elect to continue to pay tax on foreign-source trustee income so that the trust retains it status as a qualifying trust.

6.3.5 The income derived by a trustee of a trust in any income year is either "trustee income" or "beneficiary income". Beneficiary income is, broadly, that part of the income derived by the trustee in any income year which vests in or is distributed to a beneficiary in the same year. Section 6.9 sets out the proposed treatment of such income. A beneficiary may also receive distributions from a trust other than beneficiary income. Such distributions could consist of income received by a beneficiary after the income year in which it is derived by the trustee or distributions from current or prior year gains that are not taxable income. Any payment, benefit, property or other consideration derived by a beneficiary from a trust, including beneficiary income, will be referred to as a "distribution". The draft legislation refers to the taxable portion of such a distribution as a "taxable distribution". The taxation of distributions is discussed in sections 6.10 to 6.12.

6.3.6 As noted above, trusts in respect of which trustee income has been subject to tax in New Zealand in all income years since their establishment will be called "qualifying trusts". We use the term "qualifying" since we propose that distributions from such trusts, other than beneficiary income, should qualify as non-assessable income in the hands of beneficiaries.

6.3.7 A second category of trust will be called a "foreign trust". We define a foreign trust as a trust that has not had a settlor who is or was a resident of New Zealand at any time after 17 December 1987. We propose that distributions of the trustee income of these trusts derived by the trustee in accounting years commencing on or after 1 April 1988 and any beneficiary income derived by a beneficiary of such a trust be taxable in New Zealand but other distributions be non-assessable. These proposals are discussed in section 6.11.

6.3.8 Distributions, other than beneficiary income, which are made by the trustee of a trust that is neither a qualifying trust nor a foreign trust will be referred to as "non-qualifying distributions". This term is not used in the draft legislation but, for convenience of exposition, we have employed it in this report. For example, distributions from trusts in respect of which trustee income has not been subject to tax in New Zealand in all income years since their settlement, other than foreign trusts, will be non-qualifying distributions. Since non-qualifying distributions may consist of income which has never been taxed in New Zealand and may not have been taxed in any other jurisdiction, they should not be non-assessable in the hands of beneficiaries. Our proposals in relation to these distributions are outlined in section 6.13.

6.3.9 The distinction between qualifying, foreign and other trusts is therefore an important determinant of the way in which we propose that distributions from trusts should be taxed.

### 6.4 Definition of a Settlor

6.4.1 A cornerstone of the regime is the definition of a settlor. This is dealt with in section 226 of the draft legislation. There are several legs to the definition:

a   a settlor is defined, broadly, as any person who, directly or indirectly (e.g. via nominees, solicitors, accountants, financial institutions, etc) and whether by one transaction or a series of transactions, makes or has made any disposition of property on a trust. A disposition of property is in turn defined widely;

b   where a trust is settled by a resident company and the company is wound up, any person who at the time of the settlement had a direct control interest, as that term is defined for the purposes of the BE regime, in the company would be deemed to be a settlor if the person's direct control interest together with that held by associated persons is 10 percent or more. A parallel rule applies where such a person is a company and is itself wound up, and so on;

c   where a trust is settled by a CFC, any resident who at the time of the settlement, or at the time a CFC becomes a settlor by virtue of rule b above, has a control interest in the CFC is deemed to be a settlor of the trust if the resident's control interest and that of associated persons is 10 percent or more;

d   where a trust is settled by a trustee of another trust, any person who is a settlor of the first trust is deemed to be a settlor of the second;

e   where the trustee of a trust is a company and a resident acquires an interest in that company with the effect or purpose of requiring the trustee to treat the resident, or any person he or she nominates, as a beneficiary, the resident is deemed to be a settlor;

f   a general anti-avoidance rule is included to define as settlors any persons who make an arrangement in relation to a trust which has the effect of defeating the intent and application of this definition.

6.4.2 The above definition of a settlor elaborates for the purposes of the draft legislation the very wide definition of a settlor and a settlement recommended in our previous report.

### 6.5 Trustee Income

6.5.1 As mentioned above, "trustee income" means income derived by a trustee of a trust in any income year that is not beneficiary income of any beneficiary of the trust. Where trustee income is derived in New Zealand, the trustee, whether resident or not, will be liable for tax in New Zealand on the income.

6.5.2 The settlor regime brings into the New Zealand tax net trustee income which is derived outside New Zealand in any income year if the trust has a settlor who is resident in New Zealand at any time during the year. Thus, where there is a resident settlor, both New Zealand- and foreign-source trustee income will be assessable in New Zealand.

6.5.3 As the Committee recognised in Part 1 of its report, where trustee income is to be subject to New Zealand taxation, the best course is to tax it in the hands of the trustee as if he or she were a resident. It is the trustee who derives the income and it is to the trustee that one should look in the first instance for the resultant tax. Consequently, in the case of a trust where there is a New Zealand resident settlor at any time during the income year, the primary liability for income tax should fall on the trustee.

6.5.4 As discussed in our previous report, where there may be difficulties in enforcing the trustee's liability for tax on non-New Zealand source income, it is necessary to make the resident settlor liable for tax on trustee income as agent for the trustee. Such difficulties may obviously arise where a trust has no resident trustees. If a trustee is resident, the Department can pursue the trustee through the legal process and has recourse to the trustee's assets. Where, however, the trustee is a shell company with no tangible assets in New Zealand, problems of enforcement may still occur. We therefore propose that the settlor of a trust not be liable for tax on trustee income if the trustee is resident in New Zealand and is a natural person, a trustee company within the meaning of the Trustee Act 1956.

6.5.5 In other cases, the settlor of a trust will be liable as agent of the trustee for tax on the trustee income of the trust. This liability will not, however, arise if the trust was settled on or before 17 December 1987 unless the settlor elects to be so liable. We propose a number of other exemptions in respect of superannuation funds, new residents and charitable trusts which are discussed in sections 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8.

6.5.6 In summary, foreign-source trustee income will be liable for tax in New Zealand in any income year in which the trust has a settlor who is resident in New Zealand. The primary liability for the tax will fall on the trustee. Where the trust was settled after 17 December 1987, a liability for tax on trustee income, in the event of the default of the trustee, will also fall on a resident settlor except in certain circumstances. We propose that these circumstances be that:

a   the trust has a resident trustee who is a natural person or a trustee company; or

b   the trust is a superannuation fund. (This exemption is referred to in section 6.6); or

c   the trust was settled by a person before becoming resident in New Zealand who had not been resident in New Zealand at any time after 17 December 1987. (This is the new resident exemption which is discussed in section 6.7); or

d   the trust is a charitable trust. (This is discussed in section 6.8).

6.5.7 Where there is more than one resident settlor, the simplest treatment is to make them jointly and severally liable for the tax as agents of the trustee. The use of the term "agent" brings into play all the provisions of the Income Tax Act in respect of agency liability. One of these is that an agent has a right of indemnity from his principal, in this case the trustee. Thus, for mechanical collection purposes, and to fit in with the existing pattern of the Act, it is appropriate to give the settlor the status of agent. This approach should not, however, obscure the policy considerations that make it appropriate for a New Zealand resident settlor to be treated, in effect, as a "taxpayer of last resort" in respect of the trustee income of a trust.

6.5.8 Circumstances will arise where, though there is no New Zealand tax liability in respect of foreign-source trustee income because there is no resident settlor, a settlor or trustee would prefer that a trust be a qualifying trust so that distributions of the trust (apart from beneficiary income) are non-assessable. For example, a settlor who is emigrating may wish to continue to have all of the trustee income of a trust taxed in New Zealand. For similar reasons, the trustee of a testamentary trust or an inter-vivos trust following the death of a resident settlor may wish to retain a qualifying trust status. Accordingly, we propose that a settlor or trustee of a trust be permitted to elect to make foreign-source trustee income of the trust liable for tax in New Zealand in any income year, even though there may be no settlor of the trust resident in New Zealand in that year, by submitting a return of such income by the due date.

6.5.9 At present the trustee income of specified trusts is taxed at a rate of 35 percent and the trustee income of non-specified trusts at the ordinary marginal tax rates applying to individuals. Since we have recommended in paragraph 6.2.11 that the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts should be abandoned, we consider that there should be a uniform rate of tax in respect of trustee income with effect from 1 April 1988.

#### Recommendations

6.5.10 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   a trustee be liable for tax on trustee income derived outside New Zealand in any income year in which the trust has a settlor who is resident in New Zealand at any time during the year;

b   subject to the recommendations in sections 6.6 6.7 and 6.8, where a trust was settled after 17 December 1987, any resident settlor of the trust be liable for tax on trustee income as agent of the trustee except where the trust has a resident trustee who is a natural person or a trustee company within the meaning of the Trustee Act 1956;

c   a settlor or trustee of a trust be permitted to elect to make foreign-source trustee income subject to tax in any income year by making a return of such income by the due date; and

d   a trust in respect of which trustee income has been subject to tax in New Zealand, in the hands of either the trustee or the settlor, in every income year since the settlement of the trust be defined as a "qualifying trust".

### 6.6 Settlor liability: Superannuation Funds

6.6.1 A contributor to a superannuation fund falls within the definition of a settlor where the fund is constituted as a trust. Where, however, the superannuation fund is resident in New Zealand, a separate tax regime is to apply to the taxation of the trustee income of the fund. This regime is the subject of a separate consultative process and supersedes entirely the trust regime which falls within our ambit. Consequently, our proposals for the taxation of trusts do not apply where the trust is a resident superannuation fund.

6.6.2 Where a superannuation fund is a non-resident, our understanding is that the regime under consideration in the separate consultative process would not apply. We would not, however, propose to tax a resident contributor to a non-resident superannuation fund on the worldwide trustee income of a non-resident superannuation fund. Thus, a contributor who is technically a settlor of a superannuation fund should never be liable for tax on the trustee income of the fund.

6.6.3 The only liability that would fall on a contributor would arise if the superannuation fund were a non-resident fund that fell within the definition of a foreign investment fund. As outlined in chapter 5, residents with interests in superannuation funds that are FIFs should be taxed on the income derived from such interests under the FIF regime.

6.6.4 We therefore propose that a person who makes a settlement on a trust that is a superannuation fund, as the term is to be defined for the purposes of the new tax regime for superannuation funds, should not be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust irrespective of the residence of the trustee. This exemption would apply, for example, to contributions made to a superannuation fund by an employee or an employer, including those made by a CFC.

#### Recommendation

6.6.5 The Committee therefore recommends that a person who makes a settlement on a trust that is a superannuation fund, as that term is to be defined for the purposes of the new tax regime for superannuation, not be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust.

### 6.7 Settlor Liability: New Residents

6.7.1 An immigrant who settles a trust before becoming resident in New Zealand is in a position similar to a settlor of a trust in existence on 17 December 1987, provided that the immigrant has not previously been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Thus, we consider that a similar relief from liability for tax on trustee income is warranted in such cases. In particular, we consider that, where a person who has never previously been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 becomes resident in New Zealand after that date and has settled a trust before becoming resident, that person should not be liable as agent of the trustee for tax on the trustee income of the trust.

#### Recommendation

6.7.2 The Committee therefore recommends that persons who become resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 who have settled a trust before becoming resident not be liable for tax on trustee income in respect of that trust, provided that they have not previously been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987.

### 6.8 Settlor Liability: Charitable Trusts

6.8.1 Trustees of charitable trusts are currently exempt from tax in New Zealand by virtue of sections 61(26) and 61(27) of the Act. The Government has announced its intention to review the tax exempt status of charitable trusts, but this is outside the brief of the Committee. Given that the trustee income of resident trustees of charitable trusts is exempt from tax in New Zealand, a person making a donation to a charitable trust (who would be a settlor under our definition) should not be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust. Even if the trustee income of charitable trusts were taxable in New Zealand, it would not be appropriate to make resident settlors liable for tax on the worldwide trustee income of non-resident charitable trusts. Thus, we propose that the new regime for the taxation of trustee income should not apply to a person who makes a settlement on a charitable trust. For this purpose, we propose that a charitable trust be defined taking into account the terms of section 61(27). If, however, the definition in this section is changed as a result of the current review, it may be necessary to amend our proposed definition.

#### Recommendations

6.8.2 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a person who makes a settlement on a charitable trust not be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust.

### 6.9 Beneficiary Income

6.9.1 As outlined in section 6.3, the receipts of a beneficiary of a trust arise from two sources:

a   income derived by the beneficiary in the same income year as it is derived by the trustee, or paid to or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary within six months of the end of the income year. This is referred to as "beneficiary income"; and

b   distributions of trustee income received by the beneficiary in an income year after the year in which it is derived by the trustee, or distributions from current or prior year gains of the trust that do not represent taxable income.

6.9.2 Beneficiary income, as noted in section 6.2, is currently defined as income derived by a trustee in any income year to which a beneficiary of the trust is entitled in possession in that year. In the light of the Committee's conclusion in section 6.2 that the specified/non-specified trust distinction should be dropped, we propose that beneficiary income be defined more widely as income derived by a trustee in any income year which:

a   vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary during the income year; or

b   is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within 6 months of the end of the income year

whether or not the beneficiary is an infant or is subject to any other legal incapacity.

6.9.3 This definition would remove the conditions that must be satisfied under current law in respect of specified trusts and infant beneficiaries and those of unsound mind. The effect would be to tax in beneficiaries' hands income that the current law attempts to tax to the trustee. We recommend, however, that trustees should continue to be liable for tax on beneficiary income as agents for the beneficiaries, as is now the case.

6.9.4 Where beneficiary income has been subject to tax in another jurisdiction in the hands of the trustee, the beneficiary (and the trustee as agent for the beneficiary) should receive a credit against the New Zealand income tax liability on the income for any foreign income or withholding tax paid by the trustee. In order that a disproportionate amount of the foreign tax paid by the trustee is not credited to a beneficiary, the credit allowed to the beneficiary should be equal to the proportion of the total foreign tax paid by the trustee that the beneficiary income bears to the total income derived by the trustee in that income year.

6.9.5 Where a trustee fails to meet an obligation for tax on beneficiary income and the beneficiary is a New Zealand resident, the liability will fall on the beneficiary. Where a beneficiary is a non-resident, the trustee will be liable, as agent of the beneficiary, for tax in New Zealand on beneficiary income only if that income has a New Zealand source. The rate of tax will depend on whether the income is ordinary income or non-resident withholding income. In either case, the settlor should have no liability for tax on beneficiary income.

6.9.6 The definition of a distribution needs to be wide enough to encompass indirect distributions to a resident beneficiary. For example, a taxable distribution paid through a tax-exempt or non-taxable third party who received the distribution from a trustee on the understanding that it was to be paid to or enjoyed by a beneficiary in a tax-free or lightly-taxed form should retain its character as a trust distribution. Other types of indirect distributions from a trustee include gifts, a loan, a release or abandonment of a debt and a disposition of property that purports to be a settlement on a non-qualifying or foreign trust for the benefit of the New Zealand resident or an associated person.

6.9.7 The enforcement of tax on such an extended definition of a trust distribution must rely to a large extent on disclosure. Failure by a beneficiary to disclose an indirect distribution would, however, constitute a failure to disclose assessable income and would be subject to the penalties applicable to tax evasion.

#### Recommendations

6.9.8 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   the beneficiary income of a beneficiary of a trust be defined as income derived by the trustee of the trust in any income year which:

i   vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary during the income year; or

ii   is paid or applied by the trustee to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during the income year or within 6 months of the end of the income year whether or not the beneficiary is an infant or is subject to any other legal incapacity;

b   the credit allowed to a beneficiary of a trust in respect of tax paid by the trustee of the trust in any income year be equal to the proportion of the total tax paid by the trustee in that income year that the beneficiary income of the beneficiary bears to the total income derived by the trustee in that income year;

c   the trustee of a trust continue to be liable for tax on beneficiary income as agent of the beneficiary; and

d   the definition of a distribution encompass indirect distributions received from a trustee.

### 6.10 Distributions From Qualifying Trusts

6.10.1 As explained previously, the expression "taxable distribution" in relation to a trust refers to a distribution received by a beneficiary, other than beneficiary income, that we propose should be taxable. The taxation of trusts has never involved double taxation such as occurred under the classical system of company taxation. Where income has been taxed to the trustee and then distributed to a beneficiary, it has not constituted assessable income in the hands of the beneficiary.

6.10.2 Accordingly, we propose that distributions, other than beneficiary income, from qualifying trusts, which are trusts in respect of which the trustee income has been subject to tax in New Zealand in all income years since settlement of the trust, be non-assessable in the hands of beneficiaries. Thus, there would be no taxable distributions from a qualifying trust, other than distributions which represent beneficiary income.

#### Recommendation

6.10.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that all distributions from the trustee of a qualifying trust (other than beneficiary income) be non-assessable in the hands of resident beneficiaries.

### 6.11 Distributions From Foreign Trusts

6.11.1 "Foreign trust" is the term we have employed in our draft legislation to describe trusts settled by persons who at no time after 17 December 1987 have been residents of New Zealand. These trusts came within the definition of a non-resident trust in Part 1 of our report but the latter term is now superseded. Foreign trusts have no connection with New Zealand apart from the residence here of a potential beneficiary. We therefore concluded in our previous report that distributions of accumulated income from such trusts should be taxable in New Zealand with a credit for any foreign taxes paid by trustees but that distributions of capital profits and corpus should be exempt in the hands of beneficiaries.

6.11.2 As noted in section 6.9, the income of a resident beneficiary from a trust arise from two sources - beneficiary income and distributions of trust accumulations received by a beneficiary in an income year after the year in which it is derived by the trustee, or distributions from current year gains of the trust that do not represent taxable income. Beneficiary income in respect of a foreign trust should be taxable according to the provisions outlined in section 6.9.

6.11.3 It is generally believed that the present law does not tax distributions (as distinct from beneficiary income) from foreign trusts. For this reason, we propose that distributions from foreign trusts of trustee income derived by a trustee in income years commencing on or before 1 April 1987 should remain exempt. Distributions of trustee income of a foreign trust derived in income years commencing after 1 April 1987 should, however, be taxable to resident beneficiaries.

6.11.4 As proposed in our previous report, we recommend that distributions from a foreign trust of capital profits, whenever derived, or corpus should remain exempt. As is the case in the domestic context with respect to companies, when capital distributions are subject to more favourable tax treatment than income distributions, there is pressure to convert the latter to the former. An anti-avoidance rule is therefore necessary to prevent trustees generating contrived capital profits that could be channelled to New Zealand resident beneficiaries. Hence, we propose that a provision similar to that in section 4 relating to distributions of capital profits by companies be included to the effect that capital gains realised in transactions directly or indirectly with associated persons would be treated as a taxable distribution.

6.11.5 As we have indicated previously but, for clarity, note again, the income derived by a trustee in any income year will consist of taxable income (referred to in the draft legislation as "income") and non-taxable income (which is referred to as "capital gain" or "capital profit"). The taxable income will be either trustee income or, where it vests in or is paid or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary, beneficiary income. Thus, a distribution made to a beneficiary in any income year of income derived by the trustee in that year will be either beneficiary income or a non-assessable profit or gain. Distributions to beneficiaries of income derived in an earlier year will consist of either trustee income or capital profit or gain derived by the trustee in that year. To distinguish among these various sources, an ordering rule is necessary.

6.11.6 We propose that a distribution made to a beneficiary in any income year be deemed to be made first from the taxable income derived by the trustee in that year. Thus, to the extent that the taxable income of the trustee absorbed the distribution it would constitute beneficiary income of the beneficiary. Where distributions made in any income year exceeded the taxable income derived by the trustee in that year, the excess distribution should be deemed to be made first from any capital gains or profits derived by the trustee in that year. To the extent that a distribution in any income year exceeded both the taxable income and capital gain or profit derived by the trustee in that year, the excess should be deemed to be made from the trustee income of the trust derived in the previous income year not previously deemed to have been distributed pursuant to these rules. Any balance of the distribution exceeding the trustee income of the trust should be deemed to be made from any capital gain or profit derived by the trustee in that previous year not previously deemed to have been allocated, and so on. The last amount deemed to be distributed would be the corpus of the trust.

6.11.7 The corpus of a trust should be defined as any property settled on the trust by natural persons valued at its market value at the time of settlement. Corpus should, however, exclude:

a   property settled directly or indirectly, whether by one transaction or a series of transactions, by a trustee of another trust;

b   property that would have constituted assessable income of the settlor but for the fact that it is diverted to the trust; and

c   property in respect of which a deduction can be claimed by the settlor in calculating his or her assessable income.

6.11.8 Where the ordering rule deems a distribution to be beneficiary income, it would be taxed to a resident beneficiary in the same way as beneficiary income derived from other trusts. The beneficiary would receive a credit for any foreign income or withholding tax or New Zealand income tax paid by the trustee on the income.

6.11.9 Distributions other than beneficiary income are derived either from untaxed income of the trustee derived in the same year as the year of the distribution or of such income or trustee income derived in earlier years. Whenever a beneficiary receives a distribution from trustee income of an earlier year, some deferral benefit is obtained. Because of this, we propose that where a distribution received by beneficiary is deemed to be made from trustee income derived by the trustee, no credit be given to a beneficiary for any tax paid by a trustee on the income. We do, however, propose that withholding taxes should be creditable. The amount of the withholding credit should be the proportion of withholding tax paid in respect of the distribution that the taxable distribution bears to the total distribution received by the beneficiary.

6.11.10 Whether a distribution is deemed to be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution, it should be taxed at the marginal tax rate of the beneficiary.

6.11.11 The ordering rule outlined above would require the trustee on behalf of the beneficiary to determine the deemed source of all of the distributions made to any beneficiaries, not just those resident in New Zealand. A beneficiary should be required to provide sufficient information with a return of income to establish that the appropriate portion of a distribution has been included as assessable income and to establish the basis upon which any credit for foreign tax has been allocated. Where this information cannot be provided or is insufficient, all of the distribution should be taxable in the hands of the beneficiary.

#### Recommendations

6.11.12 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, with effect from 1 April 1988:

a   distributions from a foreign trust be taxable to a resident beneficiary to the extent that they are made out of trustee income derived in any income year commencing after 1 April 1988 but all other distributions from a foreign trust, other than beneficiary income, be exempt;

b   distributions from a foreign trust be deemed to be made first from the most recent income year of the trustee and, with respect to any income year, first, from taxable income derived by the trustee in that income year and, secondly, from non-taxable gains derived in that year;

c   distributions of capital profits realised in transactions directly or indirectly with associated persons be treated as taxable distributions;

d   corpus be defined as any property settled on a trust by natural persons valued at its market value at the time of settlement other than:

i   property settled directly or indirectly, whether by one transaction or a series of transactions, by a trustee of another trust;

ii   property that would have constituted assessable income of the settlor but for the fact that it is diverted to the trust; and

iii   property in respect of which a deduction can be claimed by the settlor in calculating his or her assessable income;

e   where a distribution is deemed to be a taxable distribution other than beneficiary income, a credit for any foreign withholding tax be permitted such that the withholding credit does not exceed the proportion of the total withholding tax paid that the taxable distribution makes up of the total distribution; and

f   the rate of tax applying to distributions from foreign trusts be the marginal tax rate of the recipient.

### 6.12 Distribution From Trusts Settled by New Residents

6.12.1 In section 6.7, we referred to a person who becomes resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 who had not previously been resident here after that date as a "new resident". We recommended that such a person should not be liable for tax on the trustee income of any trust settled before he or she became resident. This does not affect the liability of the trustee - the trustee is liable for tax on all of the trustee income of the trust, wherever it is derived, from the time at which the settlor becomes resident.

6.12.2 A trust settled by a new resident before he or she becomes resident has the status of a foreign trust. We propose that distributions from such a trust which are attributable to income years prior to the person becoming resident should continue to be treated as distributions from a foreign trust. The provisions for attributing distributions to particular sources were outlined in the previous section.

6.12.3 Once the new resident settlor becomes resident, the trustee of the trust will be liable for tax in New Zealand on the foreign- and New Zealand-source trustee income of the trust derived in or after the income year in which the settlor becomes resident. The settlor could also elect to be liable for tax on such income, pursuant to recommendation c in paragraph 6.5.10. Provided that the liability for tax on trustee income is met by either the trustee or the settlor in every income year after the settlor becomes resident, distributions from the trust attributable to those income years should be treated as distributions from a qualifying trust.

#### Recommendation

6.12.4 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that where a trust is settled by a new resident before the person becomes resident in New Zealand and the trustee or the settlor of the trust meets the New Zealand tax liability for tax on the foreign- and New Zealand-source trustee income of the trust in every income year after the settlor becomes resident:

a   distributions from the trust which are attributed to income years ending before the settlor becomes resident be treated as distributions from a foreign trust; and

b   distributions from the trust attributed to income years ending after the settlor becomes resident be treated as distributions from a qualifying trust.

### 6.13 Non-Qualifying Distributions

6.13.1 By "non-qualifying distributions", we mean distributions, other than beneficiary income, that are not distributions from either qualifying trusts or foreign trusts. In general, these are distributions from trusts in respect of which trustee income has not been subject to New Zealand tax in all years subsequent to their establishment but that have had a settlor who is or was a New Zealand resident at any time subsequent to 17 December 1987. For example, the settlor of the trust may in some years be resident in New Zealand and in other years not. In addition, distributions from a trust settled by a resident on a non-resident trustee before 17 December 1987 would be non-qualifying distributions unless the trust is converted to a qualifying trust pursuant to the recommendations outlined in chapter 8. Similarly, those from a testamentary trust (or an inter-vivos trust following the death of a resident settlor) in relation to which the trustee does not elect to be subject to tax in New Zealand on the foreign-source trustee income of the trust would be non-qualifying distributions.

6.13.2 In your press statement with the Minister of Revenue that accompanied our first report, you indicated that all distributions after 1 April 1988, except distributions of corpus, from trusts that had been settled by New Zealand residents but that do not come within the settlor regime would be taxable. In the terminology we have now adopted, a trust which comes within the settlor regime would be a qualifying trust. Accordingly, we propose that all non-qualifying distributions (other than beneficiary income) received by New Zealand residents be taxable with the exception of distributions of the corpus of the trust.

6.13.3 You also proposed that such distributions should be taxable with an interest charge to offset the benefit to the recipient of the deferral of tax. As explained further in chapter 8, we consider that an interest charge would be unduly complex if it were to be other than arbitrary. As a simpler alternative, we propose that the deferral advantage enjoyed by a beneficiary in relation to a non-qualifying distribution be reduced by taxing such distributions at a higher rate. We recommend that the rate be 45 percent. For comparison with the effect of an interest charge, this rate would result in a tax impost on a distribution that would equate with the tax that would be payable if the distribution were assumed to be income derived by the trustee over a period of five years immediately preceding its receipt by the beneficiary and interest were charged on the outstanding tax at a compound rate of 16 percent.

6.13.4 In addition, we propose that a credit should be permitted for foreign withholding taxes paid on non-qualifying distributions but not for income taxes paid by the trustee. The amount of withholding tax allowed as a credit should be the proportion of the total withholding tax paid on the distribution that the taxable distribution (which would be the entire amount of the distribution other than that part deemed to be corpus according to the ordering rule outlined in section 6.11) bears to the total distribution received by the beneficiary.

6.13.5 In order that fictional distributions are not counted, such as settlements of sub-trusts, distributions of trust accumulations by a trustee to another trust or distributions over which the trustee retains control should be deemed not to have been made for the purposes of applying the ordering rule. Where a beneficiary cannot provide satisfactory records to support the allocation of a portion of a distribution to corpus in accordance with the procedures set out in the previous paragraph, all of the distribution should be treated as a taxable distribution.

6.13.6 Non-qualifying distributions would also arise where the trustee or a new resident settlor of a trust settled before the settlor became resident here does not meet the New Zealand tax liability on the trustee income of the trust in respect of income years after the settlor becomes resident. All of the distributions of the trust, other than beneficiary income, would be treated as non-qualifying distributions.

#### Recommendations

6.13.7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   distributions from a trust which are not distributions from a qualifying trust or a foreign trust ("non-qualifying distributions"), other than such distributions which are beneficiary income or distributions of corpus, be taxable at a rate of 45 percent;

b   non-qualifying distributions be deemed to be made first from sources other than corpus; and

c   a credit be permitted for foreign withholding tax paid on a non-qualifying distribution but not for any income tax paid by the trustee.

### 6.14 Financial Assistance to Trusts

6.14.1 In our previous report, we proposed that a resident settlor of a trust settled before 17 December 1987 who did not elect to be subject to tax on trustee income should be liable for tax on income that would be deemed to be derived in respect of any financial assistance the settlor had provided to the trustee of the trust. This was proposed as a quid pro quo for not being liable for tax on the trustee income. The same argument applies wherever a settlor of a trust is resident here but the trust is such that distributions from it would be non-qualifying distributions. This would be the case, for example, if a settlor or trustee of a trust settled after 17 December failed to meet the New Zealand tax liability on the trustee income of the trust. Similarly, it would be the case where a new resident settlor failed to meet the obligation to pay tax on the trustee income of a trust settled before the person became resident here.

6.14.2 Accordingly, we propose that, where a distribution from a trust would be a non-qualifying distribution and:

a   a resident settlor of the trust has a loan outstanding to the trustee and the rate of interest is less than the prescribed interest rate applying for fringe benefit tax purposes, the settlor should be assessed on interest on the loan outstanding computed at that rate. To avoid double-counting, any interest actually assessed to the settlor in respect of the loan should be deducted from the amount of deemed interest; or

b   a resident settlor has a form of financial assistance, other than a loan, outstanding to the trustee of the trust, such as a guarantee, the settlor should be assessed annually on an amount equal to the consideration that would have been payable in an arms length transaction, less any consideration returned as assessable income of the settlor.

#### Recommendation

6.14.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, where a distribution from a trust would be a non-qualifying distribution and:

a   a resident settlor of the trust has a loan outstanding to the trustee and the rate of interest is less than the prescribed interest rate applying for fringe benefit tax purposes, the settlor be assessed on interest on the loan outstanding computed at that rate, less any interest actually assessed to the settlor in respect of the loan; or

b   a resident settlor has a form of financial assistance, other than a loan, outstanding to the trustee of the trust, such as a guarantee, the settlor be assessed annually on an amount equal to the consideration that would have been payable in an arms length transaction, less any consideration returned as assessable income of the settlor.

### 6.15 Residence of a Beneficiary

6.15.1 One of the consequences of a sharp distinction between taxable and exempt distributions is that, where an otherwise taxable distribution is large enough, there would be an incentive for the intended recipient beneficiary to become a non-resident in order to receive the distribution. The Committee's proposed changes to the definition of residence of a natural person would make it considerably more difficult for a resident to cease to be resident. Nevertheless, we consider that a further provision is needed to the effect that, where a resident ceases to be a resident and within 5 years again becomes a resident, any taxable distributions received by the person during the period in which he or she was a non-resident from a trust, other than a qualifying trust, should be assessable in the income year in which the person commences to be resident again.

#### Recommendation

6.15.2 The Committee therefore recommends that where a resident ceases to be a resident and within 5 years again becomes a resident, any taxable distributions received by the person during the period in which he or she was not a resident, other than distributions from a qualifying trust, be assessable in the income year in which the person commences to be resident.

==========================================

[7.4 Disclosure: Trusts](#7-4)

* * *

### 7.1 Introduction

7.1.1 The BE, FIF and trust regimes will be amongst the provisions of the Income Tax Act which are the most difficult for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. This is in part because of their relative complexity and in part because much of the information the Department will need to administer them will be found offshore and often in countries with which New Zealand has no tax treaty and hence no exchange of information agreement. Thus, in the first instance, the administration of the reforms will depend critically on the information which taxpayers provide to the Department. It follows that the information disclosure requirements, far from being a minor aspect, are central to the effective administration of the regimes. Considerable care needs to be given in deciding what information taxpayers should be required to disclose.

7.1.2 This is important not only for administration but also for satisfactory compliance with the regimes. Voluntary compliance is encouraged if taxpayers are required to disclose relevant information and if there are substantial penalties for non-disclosure. Disclosure needs, however, to be selective. Too much information may hinder administration and compliance as effectively as too little.

7.1.3 We commented briefly on the importance of the disclosure of information and appropriate penalties for non-disclosure in our first report. This chapter outlines the Committee's views in more detail. We also comment on the way in which alternative assessment provisions might operate where there is non-disclosure or insufficient information to apply the BE, FIF or trust regimes. You announced in the Government Economic Statement that the penalty provisions of the Act are to be reviewed and in the light of this we make no further comment on penalties. Special penalties for these regimes are not needed - the general provisions of the Act, strengthened as necessary, should be sufficient.

7.1.4 Section 245R of the draft legislation provides the Commissioner with a general power to require the disclosure of sufficient information to establish the nature of any interest a taxpayer has in a foreign entity, whether or not the entity is a CFC or a FIF, and to compute the taxpayer's attributed foreign income or loss. The disclosure requirements in relation to trusts are provided for in section 231 of the draft legislation.

### 7.2 Disclosure: BE Regime

7.2.1 In general, residents should be required to disclose their direct control interests in foreign companies and the direct control interests held by associated persons. Where a resident does not personally hold a direct interest in a CFC, he or she should not be required to disclose the interests held by associates unless they are non-resident.

7.2.2 In order to avoid requiring taxpayers to disclose interests in companies which are unlikely to be either CFCs or FIFs, exemptions from this general rule will be needed. For example, an exemption from any disclosure requirement could be given for minor interests in listed companies resident in grey list countries. Limiting the scope of any general disclosure provision in this manner would avoid duplication since disclosure of interests in such companies is required for the return of dividends.

7.2.3 Where a resident has a direct control interest in a CFC, his or her income interest in the CFC needs to be computed and disclosed. In addition, the person needs to disclose indirect interests held through that CFC or an associate of the CFC. Where an underlying foreign company becomes a CFC by virtue of the indirect control provisions, residents need to disclose their income interests in the underlying CFC.

7.2.4 Direct control interests held by persons in the capacity of a nominee should also be disclosed, though disclosure of such interests should also have been made by the principal. The nominee definition includes a person who, pursuant to an arrangement or understanding or otherwise, holds powers or rights on behalf of another person. The starting point in applying a provision such as this is to ask taxpayers to disclose such arrangements or understandings.

7.2.5 In addition to the disclosure of control interests held on any measurement day, disclosure should also be required of dispositions and changes in the capital structure of a CFC to support the "bed and breakfast" rules described in section 3.3 of chapter 3. The information disclosed would also assist in the application of section 65(2)(e) of the Act. Thus, taxpayers would be required to disclose (except where an exemption from disclosure applied):

a   any interest in a foreign company disposed of before a quarterly measurement day and interests acquired in the same company within 183 days of the disposition;

b   any acquisition of an interest in a foreign company before a quarterly measurement day and any disposition of an interest in the same company within 183 days of the acquisition; and

c   any changes in the aggregate interests in a company before a measurement day to the extent to which they are reversed within 365 days.

7.2.6 As discussed in chapter 3, residents who have a control interest of 10 percent or more in a foreign company, whether a CFC or not, at any time during its accounting year should be required to disclose:

a   their interests held on the balance date of the company and their disposals of such interests during the accounting year; and

b   where a resident has a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC and that CFC has a control interest of 10 percent or more in another foreign company, the interests held by the CFC in that foreign company on its balance date and the disposals of such interests that the CFC makes during its accounting year.

Where appropriate, the disclosure requirements should apply to interests held, acquired or disposed of by persons associated with the taxpayer.

7.2.7 Where a person has an income interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC, the person should be required to provide a copy of the accounts of the CFC; details of the adjustments to accounting profit to arrive at the BE income of the CFC; the dividends received by the CFC; and the basis for calculating the person's attributed income or loss and tax credit claimed with respect to that CFC. A separate disclosure should be required in respect of each CFC in which a taxpayer has an interest in order to ensure compliance with the jurisdictional loss and tax credit limitation rules.

7.2.8 Where the aggregate income interests in a CFC of persons resident in New Zealand who hold income interests of 10 per cent or more in the CFC exceeds 100 percent, the names of persons who have those income interests should be disclosed to ensure that no more than 100 percent of an income interest in a CFC is taken into account in attributing BE income or BE losses.

7.2.9 A number of provisions of the draft legislation relate to arrangements or understandings between taxpayers. These cannot be effective unless the Department requires taxpayers, as a first step, to disclose the existence of such arrangements and understandings. Furthermore, as noted in chapter 3, taxpayers should be required to reconcile significant differences between their control and income interests in a CFC.

#### Recommendation

7.2.10 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Commissioner be given a general power to require the disclosure of sufficient information to establish the nature of any interest a taxpayer has in a foreign entity, whether or not the entity is a CFC, and to compute the taxpayer's attributed foreign income or loss.

### 7.3 Disclosure: FIF Regime

7.3.1 Interests disclosed under the provisions outlined above will include interests in FIFs that are companies. Where a company is resident or domiciled in a tax haven, it may be a FIF. Thus, taxpayers should be required to disclose interests held in tax haven entities and to compute their FIF income or loss. In order to determine whether a foreign company or a unit trust is a FIF, a taxpayer will need to consider the nature of the assets of the company, its residence for tax purposes, whether it receives a concessionary tax treatment in that country and its distribution policy. In some cases, it will be obvious that a foreign company will be a FIF and, in order to reduce compliance costs, the Commissioner could publish a list of such entities.

7.3.2 In addition, taxpayers should be required to disclose life insurance and superannuation policies issued by foreign companies or superannuation funds. Depending on their characteristics, some such policies will be interests in a FIF.

7.3.3 The basis upon which a taxpayer values an interest in a FIF should be disclosed and copies of any financial reports or equivalent information in respect of the FIF should accompany an income return. Section 245R of the draft legislation gives the Commissioner sufficient power to obtain the necessary information.

### 7.4 Disclosure: Trusts

7.4.1 The primary liability for tax on trustee income will fall on the trustee. Where a trustee is a resident, he or she should be required to disclose the name and address of the settlor of the trust and the names and addresses of beneficiaries who receive distributions or beneficiary income. Residents who have settled trusts on resident or non-resident trustees after 1 April 1988 should also be required to disclose the settlements and the name and address of the trustee(s). As outlined in chapter 6, the definition of a settlor and a settlement are both very broad.

7.4.2 Where a non-resident trustee fails to file a return or meet an obligation to pay New Zealand tax on trustee income, the resident settlor will be liable for the tax. In this event, the resident settlor should be required to provide the accounts of the trust and details of the calculation of its taxable income.

7.4.3 Settlors of trusts in existence on 1 April 1988 that were settled prior to 17 December 1987 should be required to disclose the settlement and the nature of any financial assistance outstanding to the trustees of the trust. In addition, they should disclose whether they have elected to have the trust treated as a "qualifying trust".

7.4.4 Beneficiaries should be required to disclose sufficient information to establish the appropriate basis for the taxation of any property or income of a trust that vests to them in any income year. Where such property or income represents beneficiary income or non-assessable or taxable distributions, the names and addresses of trustees of the trust should be provided. Sufficient information should also be required to support:

a   the claiming of a credit for any foreign income or foreign withholding tax paid in respect of beneficiary income;

b   that a distribution is a non-assessable distribution; and

c   if the tax rate on a distribution is the transitional 10 per cent rate, evidence of either the trust having been wound up on or before 31 March 1989.

7.4.5 Where a person receives income from a trust, the Commissioner's existing powers of disclosure are sufficient. An additional general power of disclosure is required to permit the Commissioner to require disclosure from settlors. A provision to this effect is contained in section 231 of the draft legislation.

#### Recommendation

7.4.6 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that provision be included in the legislation to permit the Commissioner to require disclosure of information from residents who are settlors of trusts in existence on or after 1 April 1988.

### 7.5 Default Methods

7.5.1 Cases may arise where taxpayers are unable to obtain the information necessary to apply the BE regime. Alternatively, taxpayers may fail to disclose information requested by the Commissioner. The information necessary to apply the FIF regime will generally be much less than that required under the BE regime though circumstances may occur where market values of interests in FIFs may not be available from published data or from the fund itself. It will then be necessary to estimate market values or, where this is not feasible due to insufficient information, both the taxpayer and the Commissioner will need to resort to alternatives.

7.5.2 Where the primary basis of computing income could be applied by the taxpayer, failure to apply it would constitute evasion. As discussed, the disclosure provisions and associated penalties will encourage compliance. Nevertheless, the alternative methods should not produce a more favourable outcome.

7.5.3 The draft legislation contains a non-exhaustive list of methods that the Commissioner could apply to determine the income or loss of a taxpayer in respect of an interest in a CFC or FIF. In particular, the Commissioner could make an assessment of income or loss by:

a   having regard to the accounts or other information of the CFC or FIF prepared for tax purposes (whether in New Zealand or any other country), or for creditors, shareholders or other persons having an economic relationship with the CFC or FIF;

b   having regard to the BE or FIF income or loss of the CFC or FIF for a prior period and, where it is an amount of income, applying a presumed compound rate of increase of not less than 10 percent;

c   having regard to the income of the CFC or FIF as reported in its financial accounts for a prior year and applying a presumed compound rate of increase of not less than 10 percent;

d   imputing an appropriate rate of return, such as a government stock yield plus a margin, to the value of the interest at the commencement of the relevant period; or

e   treating as attributed income or loss or FIF income or loss, as the case may be, any gain derived or loss incurred on disposal of the interests in question or any increase or reduction in the market value of the interest over the relevant period.

7.5.4 A default provision has also been included in the draft legislation to apply to the calculation of trustee income.

#### Recommendation

7.5.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that provision be included in the legislation for the calculation of the income or loss of a taxpayer where the taxpayer is unable to obtain sufficient information or where there is failure to disclose information.

Chapter 8 – Transition
======================

[8.1 Introduction](#8-1)
  
[8.2 BE Regime Transition](#8-2)
  
[8.3 Trust Transition](#8-3)

* * *

### 8.1 Introduction

8.1.1 The transitional provisions applying to the international reforms were largely decided in response to Part 1 of our report. We propose one additional provision with respect to the BE regime and comment further on the trust transition where you reserved your decision. These issues are dealt with in this chapter.

8.1.2 No transitional provisions are to apply to the FIF regime which came into effect on 1 April 1988. This means that residents with interests in a FIF on 1 April 1988 will need to establish the market value of their interests on that date.

### 8.2 BE Regime Transition

8.2.1 The transitional arrangements approved for the BE regime provide that:

a   taxpayers will be exempt from the regime for a two year period (i.e. until 1 April 1990) in respect of income interests acquired on or before 17 December 1987 in CFCs which are not resident in a transitional list of specified low tax jurisdictions; and

b   taxpayers will be exempt from the regime for a one year period (i.e. until 1 April 1989) with respect to income interests which were acquired after 17 December 1987 in CFCs which are resident in a grey list country.

It is possible for a company to have no fiscal residence. Consequently, in order to establish that a CFC is not resident in a country on the transitional list, it is necessary to require taxpayers to establish that the CFC is resident in a country not on the list.

8.2.2 One of the consequences of the BE regime is that, where any provision of the tax law of the country of residence of a CFC has the effect of reducing the income tax it pays in that country, the tax credit allowed to New Zealand residents will also be reduced, thereby increasing the amount of New Zealand tax payable. This is the intended result since a central objective of the regime is to levy New Zealand tax on income which has borne less tax than would be levied under New Zealand law. Tax losses of a CFC, incurred in a past income year or by another company in the same group, which are available under the tax law of its country of residence for offset against its current year income, are an example of such a provision.

8.2.3 Many submissions argued that the benefit of past tax losses in particular (i.e. those incurred by a foreign company before it becomes a CFC or before the BE regime applies to it) should not be "clawed back" under the BE regime. In the Committee's view, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of a CFC's past tax losses from the effect of other provisions of the tax law of its country of residence. If the BE regime were never to offset the effect of a tax benefit available to a CFC, it would be necessary to define BE income as the taxable income of the CFC measured according to the law of its country of residence. The BE regime would then have an impact only where another country had a company tax rate lower than New Zealand's. Thus, we consider that no special provision should be included to preserve the effect of past tax losses of a CFC. Once the BE regime applies in respect of a CFC, attributed losses will be able to be carried forward by resident taxpayers so that it is not necessary to adjust the BE income for tax losses carried forward by a CFC. The attribution of BE losses to New Zealand resident taxpayers is explained in chapter 4.

8.2.4 While residents can take these considerations into account in making future investment decisions, they cannot do so in respect of existing investments except by disposing of them. We therefore propose an additional transitional measure to the ones proposed in Part 1 of our report. We propose that taxpayers with income interests held on 17 December 1987 in CFCs resident in a country other than those on the transitional list should be able to elect to bring those interests within the BE regime for the accounting years of such CFCs falling (in whole or in part) during the period commencing on 1 April 1988 and ending on 31 March 1990. Taxpayers should not, however, be able to bring in only losses and not profits. The election should therefore be available only if a taxpayer chooses to bring in all of his or her interests held on 17 December 1987 that would give rise to attributed income or losses under the BE regime from 1 April 1990.

8.2.5 The election should be made by taxpayers in their 1991 income year return. The aggregate attributed loss of the taxpayer for the period from 1 April 1988 to 1 April 1990 would be brought to account in the 1991 income year. The measure should not, however, enable taxpayers to increase an attributed loss over what it would have been in the absence of this transitional provision. For the purposes of calculating the attributed loss of a taxpayer in each of the transitional years, the taxpayer's income interest on any measurement day should be taken as the lesser of his or her income interest on that day and the income interest held at 17 December 1987. Any attributed income in one of those years should, however, be calculated according to the rules set out in chapters 3 and 4.

#### Recommendations

8.2.6 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   taxpayers be entitled to elect, in respect of all of their income interests held on 17 December 1987 in all CFCs resident in countries other than those on the transitional list, to apply the BE regime for the accounting years of such CFCs falling in whole or in part during the period 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1990; and

b   for the purposes of calculating the attributed loss of a taxpayer in respect of each such CFC in the transitional period, the taxpayer's income interest on any measurement day be taken as the lesser of the taxpayer's income interest on that day and the income interest he or she held at 17 December 1987.

### 8.3 Trust Transition

8.3.1 As outlined in chapter 6, residents who settle a trust on or before 17 December 1987 are not to be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust as agent of the trustee. This does not affect the trustee's liability - the trustee, whether resident or not, will be liable for tax on trustee income in any income year in which there is a settlor resident in New Zealand. Where a settlement is made after 17 December 1987, the settlor will not be liable as agent of the trustee if the trustee is a resident natural person or trustee company.

8.3.2 While residents who settled trusts on or before 17 December 1987 are to be relieved of liability as a settlor, an alternative transitional arrangement is to apply to them. This was one of the areas in the Committee's first report where you reserved your decision. The Committee recommended that, in respect of settlements by residents on non-resident trustees in existence on 17 December 1987, distributions of income made on or before 31 March 1989 should be subject to a final tax at a rate of 10 percent and distributions of capital profits and corpus should be non-assessable provided that either the trust is wound up on or before that date or the settlor elects to be subject to the settlor regime from that date (i.e. the settlor elects to be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust). In the terminology of this report and the draft legislation, the settlor regime means the qualifying trust regime.

8.3.3 We recommended that, if neither of these options were taken up and:

a   the settlement was not a testamentary settlement:

i   all distributions, whether of income or capital (other than the corpus of the trust) should be assessable, with an interest charge calculated from 1 April 1988, with the beneficiary receiving a credit for foreign tax paid by the trustee; and

ii   where a settlor has a loan, guarantee or other form of financial assistance outstanding to the trustee, he or she should be assessed on imputed interest at a prescribed rate (less any interest actually received by the settlor or paid by the trustee, as the case may be) computed on the amount of the loan, guarantee or other assistance;

b   the settlement was by will or as a result of intestacy;

i   distributions of capital profits made after 31 March 1989 should continue to be non-assessable in the hands of beneficiaries; and

ii   distributions of income be assessable subject to an interest charge calculated from 1 April 1988.

8.3.4 In response to these recommendations, you announced in your press statement with the Minister of Revenue that:

> "At this stage, the Government considers that from 1 April 1989 resident trusts \[i.e. those with resident settlors\] should be taxed according to the settlor regime, except where the settlor can demonstrate that there is manifest good reason for such an exception and it can be shown that either the trust is subject to tax in a high tax jurisdiction or the imposition of the settlor regime would cause undue hardship to the settlor."

8.3.5 The main problem with this approach is the administrative burden such a discretion would place on the Inland Revenue Department. Most settlors would be expected to apply for the exemption and the Department would need to decide in each case whether there was "manifest good reason" and either undue hardship or that a trust was subject to tax in a high tax jurisdiction. It is difficult to decide what criteria could be used to establish "manifest good reason". A trustee of a trust would no doubt verify that a settlor who was not a beneficiary had no right to the income or assets of the trust, since this is the legal position. The undue hardship test does not add to the general discretion of the Commissioner to waive tax in the case of hardship. The substantive operative test would therefore be whether the trustee was subject to tax in a high tax jurisdiction.

8.3.6 Though this is a feasible test, it would bring within the regime settlors who have no way of altering their settlor status and who could therefore suffer a considerable additional tax liability which could not have been anticipated. Our proposed transition aimed to avoid this outcome.

8.3.7 To offset partially the deferral advantage of remaining outside the settlor regime, we proposed that distributions from a pre-17 December 1987 settlement should be subject to an interest charge in the hands of resident beneficiaries. Interest would be charged from the later of the 1988 income year or the year in which the income distributed was derived. The notional tax that would have been paid on the distributed income in the year that the income was derived would then be computed and carried forward at a prescribed interest rate to the year in which the distribution was made. An interest charge would therefore be complicated in practice, especially when the principal purpose of the provision is to encourage such trusts to either wind up or come within the qualifying trust regime. A simpler incentive should suffice.

8.3.8 A trust that was settled by a resident on or before 17 December 1987 would be a qualifying trust only if the trustee had paid New Zealand income tax on the foreign- and New Zealand-source trustee income of the trust in every income year since its settlement. This would generally not be the case if the trust earned foreign-source income and had no resident trustees. If there is a resident trustee, then tax would generally have been paid on all of the trustee income of the trust.

8.3.9 As outlined in chapter 6, where a trust settled by a resident on or before 17 December 1987 is not a qualifying trust, we propose that all distributions from the trust, other than distributions of corpus, should be assessable at a rate of 45 percent and no credit should be given for any tax paid by the trustee other than withholding tax. We also proposed in chapter 6 that a resident settlor of such a trust should be assessed on income deemed to be derived in respect of any financial assistance outstanding to the trustee. We consider that the treatment of distributions from pre-17 December 1987 settlements by residents as non-qualifying distributions and the taxation of income deemed to be earned on any financial assistance given to the trustee adequately offsets the advantage that the persons connected with the trust derive by virtue of its trustee income not being subject to tax in New Zealand.

8.3.10 Nevertheless, the thrust of our previous recommendations was that the transitional measures should encourage the wind up of trusts settled on or before 17 December 1987. To this end, you agreed that distributions (other than distributions of capital profits or corpus) from trusts that were settled on or before 17 December 1987 are to be subject to a final tax at a rate of 10 percent provided that all of the property of the trust is distributed before 1 April 1989. Such distributions are therefore not to be included in the assessable income of the recipient. The definition of corpus for this purpose was discussed in section 6.11.

8.3.11 In addition, a beneficiary, settlor or trustee of a trust that was settled on or before 17 December 1987 is to have the option of converting the trust into a qualifying trust. In our previous report, we recommended that the conversion should be effected by the settlor electing to be liable for tax on the trustee income of the trust. We have, however, recommended in this report that all distributions from a qualifying trust should be non-assessable. A trust could therefore be converted to a qualifying trust and then wound up free of tax. This would not be consistent with the treatment outlined in the previous paragraph for trusts that wind up before 1 April 1989.

8.3.12 Accordingly, for greater consistency but also to encourage the wind up of trusts rather than their conversion to qualifying trusts, we propose that, in order for a trust to become a qualifying trust, a 10 percent tax should apply to the value of the net assets of the trust as at 31 March 1988. New Zealand income tax would then be deemed to have been paid on the trustee income of the trust in the income years ending before 31 March 1988. Where the value of the net assets of a trust exceed its corpus and any capital profits, this provision would result in a heavier tax impost than would be the case if the trust were wound up before 31 March 1989. We consider that this is appropriate so that there is a bias towards wind up. Since the relevant legislation will not be passed until later this year, we recommend that the last date for payment of the 10 percent tax be 7 February 1989.

8.3.13 Our proposals duplicate to some extent decisions that were made in response to our earlier report but, for the sake of completeness, we gather them together in the following recommendation.

#### Recommendation

8.3.14 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   where a trust has been settled on or before 17 December 1987, distributions from the trust, other than distributions of capital profits or corpus, be subject to a final tax in the hands of the beneficiary at a rate of 10 percent and distributions of capital profits and corpus be non-assessable provided that all of the property of the trust is distributed before 1 April 1989; and

b   where a trust settled on or before 17 December 1987 is not a qualifying trust or a foreign trust and a beneficiary, settlor or trustee of the trust pays to the Commissioner no later than 7 February 1989 an amount equal to 10 percent of the net assets of the trust as at 31 March 1988, New Zealand income tax be deemed to have been paid on the trustee income of the trust in prior income years.

### 9.1 Introduction

9.1.1 The main features and many of the details of the imputation and withholding payment systems were outlined in the Committee's first report which you accepted in full. Thus, compared with the international tax regimes, few issues remain to be decided in respect of the imputation and withholding payment systems. Chapters 9 and 10 outline the Committee's recommendations on the remaining issues. This chapter deals with the imputation and withholding payment regimes. Consequential changes to other parts of the Act are discussed in chapter 10.

### 9.2 Draft Legislation

9.2.1 Like the international regime, the imputation and withholding payment regimes will result in major additions to the existing Income Tax Act. For ease of reference, each regime is best dealt with in a separate part of the Act. There is no particular significance to the location of these parts but we propose that the imputation legislation make up a new Part XIIA of the Act (immediately following Part XII, which deals with the provisional tax system), the withholding payment legislation a new Part XIIB and the branch equivalent tax account ("BETA") provisions a new part XIIC.

9.2.2 Within each part, the main sets of provisions are those concerning the operation of the imputation credit account ("ICA"), the withholding payment account ("WPA") and BETA respectively; the penalty tax provisions which apply when a company does not comply with the credit allocation rules; the provisions necessary to allow shareholders to utilise the credits; the anti-avoidance provisions; and, lastly, a number of transitional arrangements.

9.2.3 In addition, a number of consequential changes are necessary to other sections of the Act. For example, we propose a new definition of a dividend and amendments to excess retention tax and the deemed dividend provisions. These are outlined in chapter 10.

### 9.3 Allocation Rules

9.3.1 The provisions concerning the operation of the imputation system by companies are contained in sections 394B to 394H of the draft legislation. The central feature of the scheme is the ICA. Each company will be required to operate an ICA since the balance in this account will determine the amount of credits that the company can allocate to its shareholders in any income year.

9.3.2 The allocation of credits by a company will be subject to the allocation rules proposed in our previous report which are designed to ensure that credits are apportioned across dividends and bonus issues made to all shareholders, rather than directed selectively to certain groups of shareholders. The principal requirement is that a company must maintain the same credit ratio (i.e. ratio of credit to the value of a dividend or taxable bonus share) for all dividends paid in any income year unless it makes a statutory declaration that a ratio change is not part of an arrangement to confer a taxation advantage on a group of shareholders. In our first report, we proposed that such declarations should be made at least 21 days in advance of the first distribution at the changed ratio but we now recommend that they should be able to be made at any time before the dividend is declared.

9.3.3 Where a company does not comply in any income year with the requirement outlined in the previous paragraph, all the dividends (including taxable bonus shares) it pays in that year will be deemed to have been credited at the highest credit ratio applied by the company during the year. The corresponding aggregate credit deemed to have been allocated will be debited to the ICA of the company.

9.3.4 In addition, in order to ensure that the credit allocated to a dividend is not disproportionate to the amount of the dividend, the maximum ratio of imputation and withholding credit to dividend will be limited to the ratio of 28:72, based on the company tax rate of 28 percent. Where a company exceeds this ratio, it is necessary to impose some penalty. This was not dealt with in our earlier report. We therefore propose that, where the credit ratio of a dividend applied by a company exceeds the maximum ratio, the excess credit should not be allowed to shareholders, nor should it be included in the definition of a dividend. If the credit is an aggregate of an imputation credit and a withholding credit, the excess to be disallowed should be deemed to be, first, withholding credit and, secondly, imputation credit.

#### Recommendation

9.3.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   where the credit ratio of a dividend applied by a company exceeds the maximum ratio, the excess credit not be allowed to shareholders, nor included in the definition of a dividend; and

b   a ratio change declaration be able to be made at any time before the first distribution at the changed ratio is distributed.

### 9.4 Deemed Dividends: Allocation Rules

9.4.1 Under the present Act, a number of types of payment or benefit given to the shareholders of certain companies are deemed to be dividends. As discussed in chapter 10, we consider that these provisions should be retained. Deemed dividends would, however, cause complications in the application of the allocation rules. First, the application of the deemed dividend provisions is uncertain. Thus, a payment or benefit given to a shareholder of a company may not be deemed to be a dividend until some time after the end of the income year in which it is paid or conferred. Since the deemed dividend would not have been credited, it would trigger an additional allocation debit to the ICA of the company in a previous income year. Secondly, the quantification of the value of a deemed dividend is also uncertain under the present rules. Where the Commissioner's assessment differed from the taxpayer's, a breach of the credit allocation rules may result, once again triggering an allocation debit.

9.4.2 In view of these uncertainties, we consider that it is impractical to require companies to allocate credits to deemed dividends in the same way as for cash dividends. As discussed in chapter 10, benefits previously deemed as dividends provided to "major shareholders" who are employees are to be brought within the fringe benefit regime. Consideration could be given to bringing all non-cash benefits provided to shareholders within the fringe benefit regime. In the interim, we propose that deemed dividends be excluded from the allocation rules where they arise in respect of benefits given to shareholders by way of the sale of company property to a shareholder at an inadequate consideration (presently dealt with under section 4(l)(b)); the purchase of property from a shareholder by a company for excessive consideration (a new provision); loans to shareholders other than bona fide loans at commercial interest rates; non-deductible expenditure enjoyed by proprietary company shareholders and associates; and excessive remuneration to directors or shareholders of proprietary companies, or their relatives.

9.4.3 A separate category of deemed dividends is interest on debentures or convertible notes which fall within sections 192, 195 or 196 of the Act. These need to be treated in the same way as ordinary dividends for the purposes of the allocation rules.

#### Recommendation

9.4.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that deemed dividends be excluded from the allocation rules where they arise in respect of benefits given to shareholders by way of the sale of company property to a shareholder at an inadequate consideration; the purchase of property from a shareholder by a company for excessive consideration; loans to shareholders other than bone fide loans at commercial interest rates; non-deductible expenditure enjoyed by proprietary company shareholders and associates; and excessive remuneration to directors or shareholders of proprietary companies, or their relatives.

### 9.5 Producer Boards

9.5.1 Co-operative companies and the producer boards (which are to lose their tax exempt status from the beginning of the 1989 income year) are to be included within the imputation system. The boards are created by statute and do not have a shareholding structure on which dividends and credit allocations could be based. They do, however, act on behalf of producers who can be regarded as their owners in an economic if not a legal sense. It is therefore appropriate to impute any income tax paid by boards to their respective producers.

9.5.2 The boards' operations take one of two principal forms:

a   the Dairy Board and the Apple and Pear Marketing Board have an export monopoly and purchase produce from producers or producer co-operatives. Thus, these boards make produce payments directly or indirectly to suppliers;

b   the Wool and Meat Boards do not have an export monopoly, though they may purchase product for price-smoothing reasons. The activities of these boards are funded principally by way of levies on producers which are proportionate to the value of each producer's output.

9.5.3 In both cases, the return to a producer takes the form of higher product prices as a result of the boards' direct or indirect involvement in price-smoothing, marketing and other forms of representation. Product payments or levies therefore provide an appropriate basis on which the boards could allocate credits to producers. Individual producers will receive product payments and/or pay levies at various times of the year. It is therefore necessary to aggregate product payments or levies over the income year and to base the credits subsequently allocated to each producer on the aggregate annual product payments received or aggregate levies paid by the producer during the year. Where credits are allocated on the basis of product payments, the proportion of the aggregate credit allocated to each producer in any income year would equal the proportion that the producer's product payment made up of the of the total product payments made by the board in the previous year (as the actual allocation could not be made until after the end of the year of production). Alternatively, the allocation could be on the basis of the value of product supplied during the production year, rather than on the payments made. An equivalent proportional allocation rule would apply where credits were allocated on the basis of levies. In either case, no credits could be allocated until after the end of the first year of operation of the scheme.

9.5.4 In practice, the Dairy Board buys produce from dairy companies who in turn purchase milk from their farmer suppliers. Thus, payments for produce pass from the Board to the companies and from the companies to farmers. For the purposes of the credit allocation rule outlined in the previous paragraph, each company can be regarded as a producer with respect to the Board.

9.5.5 Companies incorporated under the Companies Act will be able to allocate credits to either dividends or taxable bonus issues. In our view, the producer boards should have the option of distributing cash dividends as a means of allocating credits to their producers. The boards presently do not have any statutory authority to pay dividends so that the characterisation of a payment to a producer as a dividend would occur only in respect of its income tax treatment. Where a board is authorised to make a payment to a producer, for example, in consideration for product purchased, it would elect to make all or part of the payment non-deductible for tax purposes. The amount of the payment to be treated as a dividend should be calculated on the basis that the dividend were fully credited. For tax purposes only, the non-deductible payment would then be treated as a fully credited dividend. The dividend would be assessable to a producer in the same way as any other dividend, but the producer would be able to use the attached credit to offset the tax payable. The additional tax payable by a board therefore results in an equal tax saving to its producers. The mechanism to give effect to this election will be included in an amendment to section 199 which is currently being drafted by the Inland Revenue Department. We have anticipated this amendment in our draft legislation.

9.5.6 In order that cash flow considerations do not constrain a company's ability to allocate credits to its shareholders, companies will be able to allocate credits to taxable bonus issues. These will be taxed in the same way as dividends in the hands of shareholders. The boards do not at present have share capital so that a bonus issue allocation mechanism cannot be used. It is, however, desirable that the boards have a mechanism for allocating credits without having to pay out cash dividends. Hence, we propose that they should be able to allocate credits to notional dividends. As proposed for cash dividends paid by a board, the amount of a notional dividend should be computed by assuming that it is fully credited. In other words, the allocation of a credit of 28 cents would require the declaration of a notional dividend of 72 cents. Producers would be taxed on the sum of the notional dividend and the credit in the same way as if the dividends were actual dividends. Where a producer member is a company, the notional dividend would not be assessable but the credit would be added to its ICA or WPA.

9.5.7 This credit allocation mechanism is equivalent to allocating credits to taxable bonus shares. In the latter case, the amount capitalised by way of the taxable bonus issue is added to the paid-up capital of the company. The distribution of capital will be subject to marshalling rules which are outlined in section 9.8. The boards do not, however, have a share capital so that a return of capital cannot be made in substitution for dividends. Thus, we propose that the boards be able to maintain a record of notional capital for tax purposes. The amount allocated to notional capital would equal the amount of notional dividends declared by the board, net of any credits. Actual cash payments sourced from notional capital would be exempt in the hands of the recipient producers.

9.5.8 The boards should also be able to operate a withholding payment account (WPA) in order that credits for withholding payments made can be passed through to producers and a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) in order to relieve any double taxation of the income of a CFC in which a board has an income interest of 10 percent or more.

#### Recommendations

9.5.9 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   the producer boards be able to operate an ICA and WPA for the purposes of allocating credits to their constituent producers and a BETA for the purposes of relieving double taxation of income derived under the BE regime;

b   a board be able to allocate credits to either payments made to producers, which would be non-deductible and treated as dividends for tax purposes, or to notional dividends and in either case the amount of the dividend be computed on the basis that it is fully credited;

c   an allocation of credits by a board to its producers by way of cash and/or notional dividends be made only once in each income year;

d   the credits allocated by a board to its producers be in proportion to the product payments made or payable by the board to its producers and/or in proportion to the levies paid or payable by producers to the board;

e   the boards be able to maintain records for tax purposes in which to credit the net amount of notional dividends allocated (i.e. the gross notional dividends allocated less the amount of the credits attached to them);

f   the notional capital of a board be able to be distributed tax free to producers.

### 9.6 Co-operative Companies

9.6.1 A number of co-operatives are in a similar position to the producer boards in that the return they provide to their members is in the form of reduced input prices or higher output prices rather than dividends. Co-operative companies do, however, have issued share capital and may pay dividends to members. The number of shares held may, however, be unimportant since the return members obtain usually depends primarily on their transactions with the co-operative rather than their shareholdings. We therefore propose that co-operative companies be treated in much the same way as we have recommended for the producer boards. Thus, they would have the option of electing to make a payment to members non-deductible to the co-operative for tax purposes in which case it would be treated as a dividend. Credits could then be allocated to the dividend. In the event that cash dividends were not available, the notional dividend allocation mechanism outlined for the producer boards could be used. In either case, the credits would be allocated to members on the basis of their transactions with the co-operative.

9.6.2 Since some co-operative companies do, however, have a share capital and pay dividends, they should be also be able to allocate credits to dividends or taxable bonus shares in the same way as other companies.

9.6.3 The present section 199 applies not only to co-operative companies but more generally to "mutual associations". An association is widely defined as "any body or association of persons, whether incorporated or not". The Committee is uncertain of the nature of any unincorporated mutual associations and of their tax treatment. We therefore refrain from making any recommendations on the way they should be treated under imputation. Our recommendations therefore apply only to co-operative companies.

#### Recommendation

9.6.4 The Committee therefore recommends that co-operative companies be treated in the same way as the producer boards for the purposes of imputation except that they also have the option available to other companies of allocating credits to dividends or taxable bonus shares.

### 9.7 Sharemilking Arrangements

9.7.1 One of the issues outstanding from our first report was whether a special arrangement was needed for sharemilkers who receive product payments through members of co-operatives though they themselves are not members. This would be the case under some sharemilking agreements. Where payments by a dairy company for milk supplied are made directly to a sharemilker and the land-owner, dividends and attached credits paid on the basis of product supplied should be paid directly to both persons on the same basis that payments for milk supplied would be made. In other words, the sharemilker should receive dividends from the co-operative even though he may not be a shareholder.

9.7.2 Where some other contractual arrangement exists, we would be reluctant to prescribe a general remedy. The parties involved can be expected to amend their contractual arrangements if they wish to. Where both the sharemilker and the land-owner are members of the co-operative, each would receive dividends and credits directly from the co-operative.

#### Recommendation

9.7.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, where payments by a dairy company for milk supplied are made directly to a sharemilker and the land-owner, dividends or bonus shares and attached credits paid on the basis of product supplied should be paid directly to both persons on the same basis that payments for milk supplied would be made.

### 9.8 Capital Distributions

9.8.1 The CD proposed that all distributions should be taxable, other than distributions of paid-up capital (including share premiums paid) made on the winding up of a company or on the redemption of shares. You agreed that this proposal should be amended by retaining the present exemption of distributions of capital profits on winding up.

9.8.2 The remaining issue is the treatment of a return of capital other than on winding up. In principle, a return of capital should not be taxed if it is merely a return of the capital paid in on the subscription of shares. If it were to be taxed, equity would be treated very differently from debt and instruments such as redeemable shares would not be viable. A return of capital should not, however, be a substitute for dividends and, pending solution of this problem, the Committee reserved its position on this issue in paragraph 2.6.4 of its earlier report.

9.8.3 It is conceivable that a company might issue shares, either of the same class or of separate classes, which are to be redeemed at regular intervals in the future. The redemptions would then be made instead of dividends. For example, if a company with a single class of shares redeems a certain percentage of every shareholder's holding each year, the resulting capital payments should be treated as dividends. Similarly, if a company issues a certain class of shares to its shareholders and then redeems them on a pro rata basis over a period of years, the return of capital should be treated as a dividend.

9.8.4 While providing for circumstances where a return of capital is made in substitution for a dividend, the legislation should give companies as much flexibility as possible to issue redeemable shares. We therefore propose that a return of capital made on the redemption of shares, other than on winding up, should be treated as capital, and hence non-assessable, provided that:

a   the shares were issued on terms such that they are to be redeemed at a specified date or dates or within a specified period; and

b   the capital returned is equal to the amount paid in, including any premium, on the subscription of the shares; and

c   the shares redeemed were not issued pursuant to an arrangement under which they were to be redeemed in a regular or systematic way such that it may reasonably be concluded that the return of capital is made in lieu of a dividend.

9.8.5 In addition to returning capital on the redemption of shares, capital may be returned pursuant to reductions in the par or nominal value of shares. Such partial redemptions will, however, invariably be made on a pro rata basis and hence on the same basis that dividends would be paid. For this reason, we propose that a distribution made on a partial reduction of the nominal or par value of shares not be treated as a return of capital but be treated as a dividend. We also propose that debentures which fall within sections 192 or 195 of the Act which are issued after 30 September 1988 be treated as shares for the purposes of these rules.

9.8.6 Our proposals are significantly different from those proposed in the CD so that it is reasonable that taxpayers have some notice of them. The implementation date of the proposals should also be integrated with the change to the tax treatment of bonus shares which is to come into effect on 1 October 1988. We therefore propose that they come into effect on 1 October 1988.

#### Recommendation

9.8.7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, with effect from 1 October 1988, a return of capital made by a company on the redemption of shares (including debentures issued on or after 1 October 1988 which come within sections 192 or 195 of the Act), other than on winding up, be exempt from tax in the hands of the recipient provided that:

a   the shares are issued on terms such that they are to be redeemed at a specified date or dates or within a specified period;

b   the capital returned is equal to the amount paid in, including any premium, on the subscription of the shares; and

c   the shares redeemed were not issued pursuant to an arrangement under which they were to be redeemed in a regular or systematic way such that it may reasonably be concluded that the return of capital is made in lieu of a dividend.

### 9.9 Carry Forward of Credits by a Company

9.9.1 In our first report, we referred to the need for anti-streaming provisions to ensure that the revenue cost of the imputation regime is not different from that envisaged by the Government. The allocation rules and anti-stapling provisions have this objective. In paragraph 2.4.8 of our earlier report, we referred to the possible need for a specific anti-avoidance rule buttressed by disclosure requirements to counteract temporary transfers of interests aimed at avoiding the allocation rules. The effect of the allocation rules would also be avoided by the accumulation of credits within companies which were then sold.

9.9.2 To limit the opportunity for such credit trapping and sale, we recommend in chapter 10 that excess retention tax be retained. This measure by itself is, however, not sufficient since, for example, the New Zealand holding company of a non-resident is not liable for ERT.

9.9.3 To supplement ERT with respect to companies owned by residents and as a measure effective in relation to non-residents, the Committee proposes that a 75 percent commonality of interests be required (using the same tests already used in section 188 of the Act with respect to the carry forward of losses, but extended to include fixed dividend shares) for a company to be able to carry forward the credit balance of its ICA, WPA or BETA. In the event that the 75 percent commonality is lost, a debit would arise in the relevant account equal to the credit balance of the account on the date that the required degree of commonality is lost. This measure will reduce trafficking in credits and is consistent with the integration principles underlying a full imputation system.

9.9.4 The compliance costs of a shareholding commonality rule are undoubtedly highest for listed companies because of normal trading of shares and the need to trace shareholdings through interposed companies. Moreover, listed companies and their subsidiaries are unlikely to be used as credit traps since their shareholders will generally be residents who are able to utilise the credits. Hence, we propose that there be an exception to the proposed commonality rule for companies listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and their wholly-owned subsidiaries.

#### Recommendation

9.9.5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a 75 percent commonality of shareholding (using the tests presently contained in section 188 of the Act but extended to include fixed dividend shares) be required for a company, other than a company listed on the New Zealand stock exchange or a wholly-owned subsidiary of such a company, to be able to carry forward the credit balance of its ICA, WPA or BETA.

### 9.10 Carry Forward of Unutilised Imputation Credits

9.10.1 Taxpayers in tax loss would be unable to utilise imputation credits (which are referred to in the draft legislation as "tax credits") so, in response to the Committee's recommendation, you agreed that they should be able to gross up the amount of any credit by dividing by a tax rate of 28 percent and adding the resulting amount to the amount of the tax loss to be carried forward. This was the mechanism that could at present be most easily accommodated within the Department's existing administrative and EDP systems. A better system would be to carry forward the amount of the unutilised credit but, according to the Department, it would be unable to implement this in the next year or so.

9.10.2 Since a system based on converting an unutilised credit to a loss carry forward is feasible, there seems no reason why it should not extend to all taxpayers. This would reduce the incentive for arbitrage amongst taxpayers aimed at utilising what would otherwise be wasted credits. Thus, we propose that all resident taxpayers, other than companies, be able to convert any imputation credits in excess of their tax liability in any income year, after taking into account all other tax reliefs, into a tax loss to be carried forward, where the amount of the loss is calculated as the amount of the unutilised credit divided by 0.28.

#### Recommendation

9.10.3 Accordingly, we recommend that that all resident taxpayers, other than companies, be able to convert any imputation credits in excess of their tax liability in any income year into a tax loss to be carried forward, with the amount of the loss calculated as the total amount of the unutilised credit divided by 0.28.

### 9.11 Refunds of Dividend Withholding Payment

9.11.1 The dividend withholding payment will be levied on dividends received on or after 1 April 1988 by resident companies from non-resident companies. The amount of the payment is intended to approximate the income tax that a non-corporate shareholder would pay on a dividend from a non-resident company if the dividend passed directly to the person. Where the eventual recipient shareholder would not incur such a liability, such as a non-resident or tax-exempt shareholder, or where the amount withheld exceeds a resident shareholder's tax liability, the excess is to be refunded.

9.11.2 The withholding payment is to be paid quarterly. The Government Economic Statement proposed that refunds to non-resident companies be made by the resident company paying the dividend. In our first report, we proposed that the payer company should offset the refund paid to a non-resident against its withholding payment liability for the quarter in which the refund was made. If the refund paid exceeded the liability, the excess would be refunded by the Department. Refunds to tax-exempt shareholders were to be made quarterly by the Department. In our report, we proposed that excess withholding credits should also be refunded to other resident taxpayers at the end of the year in the same way as refunds of other tax.

9.11.3 We have given further consideration to the refund mechanism. A problem with the proposed system is that the Department would be required to make reimbursing refunds to companies and refunds to tax-exempt shareholders before it had assessed withholding payment liabilities to verify, where necessary, that the withholding payment to be refunded had indeed been paid. One approach would be to have quarterly assessments but this would raise significantly the administrative and compliance costs involved. A more efficient system from an administrative point of view is to have annual assessments and annual refunds for all shareholders.

9.11.4 If an annual refund system were adopted, resident companies would face an unreasonable cash flow burden if they had to make not only the original withholding payment and pay that to the Department, but also refunds to non-resident shareholders that would be reimbursed only after the end of the year. We therefore consider that refunds to non-residents should be made by the Department on an end of year basis on application by a non-resident.

9.11.5 Withholding payment collected on behalf of non-resident shareholders can be viewed as an advance payment of some or all of their non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) liability on dividends paid. Thus, the withholding credit allocated to a dividend paid to a non-resident should be credited towards the NRWT payable on the dividend. Where the withholding credit was less than the NRWT payable, the payer company would be obliged to deduct the balance of the NRWT and pay it over to the Department as under the present system. Conversely, where the withholding credit exceeded the NRWT payable, the non-resident would claim a refund of the excess by making an application to the Department after the end of the income year in which the dividend was paid. Finally, if the withholding credit equalled the NRWT liability, no further payment or refund would be required.

9.11.6 The application for a refund by a non-resident or any other shareholder would need to be supported by the dividend statement supplied by the payer company. The draft legislation details the information that we propose be required to be included in the statement.

#### Recommendation

9.11.7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:

a   refunds of dividend withholding payment to all shareholders, irrespective of their residence or tax status, be made by the Department after the end of the income year in which the corresponding withholding credit was received;

b   where a withholding payment credit is allocated to a dividend paid to a non-resident, the non-resident withholding tax payable on the dividend be offset to the extent of the withholding payment credit.

### 9.12 Integration With BE Regime: Individuals

9.12.1 In our previous report, we recommended that individuals, like companies, should be able to operate a branch equivalent tax account ("BETA") for the purposes of avoiding double taxation of the income of a CFC, once as attributed income under the BE regime and again as a dividend when the income is distributed. The BETA would record the amount of tax paid by a person on attributed foreign income. The person could then offset tax payable on a dividend received from a CFC to the extent of the credit balance in the account. The computation of the tax payable on attributed income and the withholding payment liability on a dividend is straightforward for a company because of the flat rate of company and withholding tax. It is, however, more complicated for non-corporate taxpayers because of the progressive rate scale.

9.12.2 The objective of avoiding double taxation in the case of non-corporate taxpayers can be achieved more simply by recording in BETA the amount of attributed income the person has derived, rather than the tax paid on such income. A dividend received from a CFC would then be non-assessable to the extent of the credit balance in the account. We therefore recommend this approach instead of that proposed in our previous report.

#### Recommendation

9.12.3 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that, where a non-corporate taxpayer elects to establish a branch equivalent tax account, the amounts to be credited to the account be the attributed income derived by the person under the BE regime.

### 9.13 Group Investment Funds

9.13.1 Section 211A of the Act deals with group investment funds. The income of such funds is divided into two categories with "category A" income taxed as if it were derived by a company. The "category" B income of a fund is taxed as if it were derived by a trustee. A distribution of after-tax category A income is treated as dividend. As the trustees of such funds are taxed in the same way as companies in relation to category A income, it is appropriate that they be permitted to impute tax on distributions of category A income as if they were companies. The draft legislation gives effect to this.

Ngā tāke rawa mō ngā rōpū mahi aroha, kua kore i rēhita Charities deregistration tax on assets
==============================================================================================

Charities may need to pay deregistration tax when they’re removed from the Charities Register.

This applies to only deregistered charities, not to other sorts of not-for-profits that are registered with only the Companies Office.  

You have 1 year after deregistering
-----------------------------------

Your charity has 1 year from the date it’s deregistered to do 1 of the following:

*   re-register as a charity
*   dispose of or transfer its net assets to a registered charity or a New Zealand tax-exempt entity.

If you do not do this, for example if you keep some assets or transfer assets to an overseas charity, you’ll need to pay income tax on the assets 1 year from the date you deregistered. You’ll need to include them in your charity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day 1 year after the deregistration date.

For example, if your charity was deregistered on 1 November 2023 and you kept some assets, you’d need to include these assets in the charity’s 2025 income tax return. That’s because 1 November 2024 (1 year after the deregistration date) is in the 2025 tax year.

Working out the value of depreciable property or financial arrangement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After your charity is deregistered, you'll need to work out the value of any depreciable property and financial arrangements you hold. You'll use this value to work out tax for each following year.

Our Charitable and donee organisations – IR255 guide has examples of how to pay tax on and calculate net assets, depreciable property and financial arrangements.

When you do not have to pay deregistration tax
----------------------------------------------

There are 2 situations when your deregistered charity will not have to pay tax on assets it keeps. You do not have to pay the deregistration tax if your charity:

*   was deregistered by Charities Services before 1 April 2015 (or before 14 April 2014 if you chose voluntary deregistration)
*   has net assets worth $10,000 or less on the date it deregisters. This applies from 1 April 2019.

From 1 April 2019, only charities with net assets worth over $10,000 will have to pay deregistration tax on the total value of the net assets. The total value includes the initial $10,000.

When you work out the value of your charity's net assets, do not include:

*   assets received from the Crown to settle a Treaty of Waitangi claim or under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004
*   assets, other than money, gifted or left to the organisation when it was exempt from income tax
*   marae land and improvements under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993.

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue: Discovery in the Context of Judicial Review
====================================================================================================

2017 case note – Supreme Court refused leave to appeal – discovery of documents, double taxation agreement.

Case

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZSC 48

### **Summary**

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) issued a number of Notices under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) to the appellant. The appellant sought to judicially review this, and as part of that sought discovery of certain material (“the Documents”). The High Court refused this request, and that was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court refused leave on the basis that the issue here was straightforward, and was a matter of the application of settled principles to a particular fact situation. It was not necessary for the Supreme Court to engage with this issue.

### **Impact**

The appellant has now exhausted its appeal rights in regards to its request for discovery of the Documents. The High Court’s decision to refuse discovery is upheld and the Commissioner will not be required to provide the Documents. The decision has limited wider impact, as it is largely limited to its particular facts, although may provide some guidance on the Supreme Court’s approach to determining applications for leave to appeal in the discovery context.

### **Facts**

The Appellant appealed against a decision of the High Court declining an application for discovery of the Documents exchanged pursuant to the Double Taxation Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea (“the DTA”).

The decision of the High Court was reflected by judgments of Ellis J dated 1 September 2015 (_Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2015\] NZHC 2099, (2015) 27 NZTC 22-024) and 9 June 2016 (_Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 1234, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-053).

The Appellant’s substantive litigation originally involved two causes of action. The first was that the Appellant had a legitimate expectation under an operational statement known as OS 13/02 (_Operational Statement: Section 17 notices_ (Inland Revenue, OS 13/02, 14 August 2013)). The second was that the Commissioner failed to consider the terms of OS 13/02, the limited nature of the tax agent/client relationship and the terms of the DTA between New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. The first cause of action and the first two limbs of the second cause of action were struck out by judgment of Lang J dated 27 September 2016 (_Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2)_ \[2016\] NZHC 2289, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-072).

This left the allegation that in making the decision to issue the s 17 notices the Commissioner failed to consider the terms of the DTA as the last remaining cause of action.

In the High Court Ellis J concluded that the only aspect of the pleading to which the documents would relate (namely the allegation that the Commissioner failed to take into account the DTA) was unlikely to be justiciable and the Documents were confidential and not required to be disclosed (_Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZHC 1234, (2016) 27 NZTC 22-053 at \[22\]).

The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the documents were not required to be disclosed, noting that discovery in judicial review proceedings is not available as of right. The power of the Court to grant discovery in judicial review proceedings is discretionary and contrasts with the position in an ordinary proceeding.

The Court of Appeal considered the Commissioner had considered the relevant terms of the DTA and characterised the application for discovery as effectively a “fishing” expedition. As a result the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

The appellant then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.

### **Decision**

The Supreme Court declined the application for leave and awarded costs of $2,500 to the Commissioner.

In reaching its decision the Supreme Court noted that while the applicant raised issues of a type that would warrant the Court’s attention, the issue was straightforward on the particular circumstances of this case because:

1.  The Court had discretion as to whether or not to order discovery.
2.  The Court had to consider whether the materials sought were relevant given the only remaining live issue.
3.  The Court concluded on the pleadings that they were not.

The Supreme Court noted this was simply a matter of applying settled principles to a particular fact situation and not a matter which it was necessary for the Supreme Court to engage in.

Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014
===========================

The Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 abolishes cheque duty from 1 Jul 2014. Cheque duty is no longer payable on cheques printed or supplied by a bank to its customers.

_Sections 1 to 5 of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014, sections 2, 76 to 86 and 86F of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, sections 144 and 184A(5)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 has abolished cheque duty, with effect from 1 July 2014. Cheque duty is no longer payable on cheques printed or supplied by a bank to its customers. Cheque duty is also no longer payable on bills of exchange for which cheque duty has not been prepaid.

### Background

Cheque duty applied to bills of exchange (most commonly cheques) at a rate of 5 cents per bill of exchange. The Government recently announced, as part of Budget 2014, that cheque duty would be abolished, as:

*   the duty no longer raised substantial revenue and the revenue raised was in decline; and
*   cheque duty was easy to avoid, since closely substitutable transaction types (such as cash, EFTPOS, internet banking and credit card transactions) are not subject to duty. Cheque duty was therefore inefficient and had a small distortionary effect.

The application date of 1 July 2014 was chosen for the repeal because it tied into the return cycle for cheque duty purposes.

### Key features

*   Cheque duty is not payable on a bill of exchange drawn or made on or after 1 July 2014.
*   Cheque duty is not payable by banks on cheques supplied to their customers on or after 1 July 2014.
*   Cheque duty is not payable on cheques printed on or after 1 July 2014.
*   Banks and printers of cheques, which were licensed under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 for the quarter or month ended 30 June 2014, are required to file a final cheque duty return and make a final payment of cheque duty for that period by 21 July 2014.
*   Cheque duty may be refunded to those that paid cheque duty as a licensed printer of cheques or as a temporary licensee, who apply in writing to Inland Revenue by 21 July 2014 for a refund of cheque duty they have paid (within the last eight years) in relation to cheques that have not been printed, or unused cheques that were destroyed before 1 July 2014.
*   Banks that were licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 during the quarter ended 30 June 2014 can claim, as a deduction from their final payment of cheque duty, an effective refund of cheque duty they have paid (within the last eight years) in relation to cheques that have not been used and were destroyed by the bank during the quarter ended 30 June 2014. This includes any cheques they sent to their customers that were defaced or spoiled before the customer used them.

### Application dates

The repeal of cheque duty applies from 1 July 2014.

Despite the repeal taking effect on 1 July 2014, provisions necessary to:

*   ensure that banks and printers of cheques file a final cheque duty return, together with payment, for the period ended 30 June 2014; and
*   enable applications for refunds of cheque duty to be made,

remain in force until the 21 July 2014 due date for final cheque duty returns, payments and refund applications has passed. Section 5 of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 repeals these remaining compliance and refund provisions on 22 July 2014.

### Detailed analysis

#### Removal of liability to pay cheque duty

Three groups paid cheque duty to Inland Revenue:

*   licensed banks;
*   licensed printers of cheques; and
*   temporary licensees.

The effect of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 on each of these groups is explained below.

##### Licensed banks

Section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 cancelled the licences of banks licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 from 1 July 2014. As a result of section 3(1) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 repealing most of Part 6 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 from 1 July 2014, cheque duty is not payable on cheques a bank supplies to its customers or procures on its own behalf on or after 1 July 2014.

A bank that had its licence cancelled under section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 is required by section 3(4) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 to file a final cheque duty return (IR 193) and make a final payment of cheque duty for the quarter ended 30 June 2014 by 21 July 2014.

##### Licensed printers of cheques

Section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 cancelled the licences of printers licensed under section 82 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 from 1 July 2014. As a result of section 3(1) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 repealing most of Part 6 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 from 1 July 2014, cheque duty is not payable on cheques a printer prints for the use of its customers or on its own behalf on or after 1 July 2014.

A printer that had its licence cancelled under section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 is required by section 3(5) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 to file a final cheque duty return (IR 191) and make a final payment of cheque duty (if any is payable) for the month ended 30 June 2014 by 21 July 2014.

##### Temporary licensees

Section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 cancelled all temporary licences granted under section 83 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 authorising the printing and use of cheques prepaid with cheque duty on 1 July 2014. A printer that held an authority to print the prepaid cheques to which such a licence related also had its authority cancelled on 1 July 2014 under section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014.

##### Removal of liability when cheque duty has not been prepaid

Previously, if cheque duty had not been prepaid on a bill of exchange, the bill of exchange was required to be duly stamped (by affixing a postage stamp or stamps for the amount of cheque duty payable on the bill, cancelling each stamp, and stating on the bill the true date of cancellation) by:

*   the drawer or maker of the bill, if the bill of exchange was drawn or made in New Zealand; or
*   the first holder of the bill in New Zealand, for a bill of exchange drawn or made outside New Zealand.

As a result of section 3(1) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 repealing most of Part 6 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 on 1 July 2014, cheque duty is not payable on a bill of exchange drawn or made in New Zealand from 1 July 2014. Also, from 1 July 2014, for a bill of exchange drawn or made outside New Zealand, cheque duty is not payable by the first holder of the bill in New Zealand before the holder further acts on the bill.

##### Termination of agreements for exemption from cheque duty

Previously, Inland Revenue had the power, under section 80 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, to enter into a written agreement with specified bodies exempting them from paying cheque duty. Instead, a sum equivalent to the cheque duty that otherwise would have been payable was required to be paid to Inland Revenue on the dates specified in the agreement.

All agreements under section 80 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 were terminated on 1 July 2014 by section 3(3) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014. Any sum accrued (but not yet paid) under such an agreement as at the date of termination remains payable by the date specified in the agreement.

#### Refunds of cheque duty

Under section 85 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, cheque duty may be refunded to those that paid cheque duty as a licensed printer of cheques or temporary licensee, upon application in writing to Inland Revenue's Duties Unit by 21 July 2014 for a refund of cheque duty they have paid (within the last eight years) in relation to cheques that have not been printed, or unused cheques that were destroyed before 1 July 2014. The minimum refund is $1.

Licensed banks are not able to make an application to Inland Revenue for a refund of cheque duty. Instead, when banks that were licensed during the quarter ended 30 June 2014 file their final cheque duty return (due by 21 July 2014), they will be able to deduct (from the amount of cheque duty payable for the quarter) cheque duty they have paid (within the last eight years) in relation to cheques that have not been used and were destroyed by the bank during the quarter ended 30 June 2014. This includes any cheques they sent to their customers that were defaced or spoiled before the customer used them.

#### Offences specific to cheque duty

The following criminal offences (and associated penalties) specific to cheque duty contained in section 144 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 were repealed on 1 July 2014 by section 4(1) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014:

*   failure to comply with a provision of section 84 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971;
*   being licensed under section 83 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, or being a printer authorised under that section, and failing to comply with a provision of that section, or of a licence or authority granted under that section; and
*   without first being licensed or authorised under Part 6 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 to do so, printing on a bill of exchange or bill of exchange form an inscription indicating that the cheque duty for the bill or form has been paid.

The following existing offences remain in force after 1 July 2014:

*   being a bank licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, failing to comply with a provision of that section or of any licence granted under that section; and
*   being a printer licensed under section 82 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, failing to comply with a provision of that section or of a licence granted under that section.

However, from 1 July 2014, a bank or printer that had its licence cancelled under section 3(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 on 1 July 2014 is treated under section 4(2) of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 as being licensed (under the applicable section), for the purposes of these two offences. This ensures that these two existing offences continue to apply in respect of non-compliance with the requirement for these banks and printers to file a final cheque duty return and make a final payment of cheque duty by 21 July 2014.

As they will become redundant after the 21 July 2014 due date for final cheque duty returns to be filed and payments made, the two remaining offences will be repealed on 22 July 2014 by section 5 of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014.

### Cheque duty repeal – questions we've been asked

**Q:** Now that cheque duty has been repealed, are printers of cheques required to be licensed by Inland Revenue?

**A:** No. The purpose of the requirement for printers to be licensed by Inland Revenue in order for them to be allowed to print cheques prepaid with cheque duty was to protect the integrity of the collection of cheque duty. Now that cheque duty has been repealed, this need for Inland Revenue to administer a licensing regime for printers of cheques no longer exists. If the licensing regime provided any other benefits, these were purely incidental.

Child support primary obligation is children
============================================

2013 case note – identifying a liable parent's true financial ability and resources – primary obligation of child support to support children.

Case

D v B & Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Child Support Act 1991

### Summary

The mother successfully applied for a retrospective child support departure order in the Family Court. The High Court overturned the quantum of the departure order and the mother appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found that the liable parent's primary obligation was to support his children and, after ascertaining the father's true financial ability and resources overturned the High Court's finding on quantum. The Court of Appeal left open whether a departure order could be made retrospectively, although it did substitute a retrospective departure order here.

### Impact of Decision

The Court of Appeal did not express a view whether a departure order may be made retrospectively and left it open that the Court may be called upon to address the issue in a future case.

The Court set out helpful guidance on identifying a liable parent's true financial ability and resources and affirmed that the liable parent's primary obligation is to support their children.

### Facts

Ms D (the mother and custodial parent) and Mr B (the father and liable parent) were married, had three children and subsequently separated in 1996.

Following the separation, Mr B established a trust, transferred his business to the trust along with the majority of his other assets, including his house. Mr B paid himself a reduced salary whilst the profits of the business were paid to the trust as dividends. Mr B had access to the funds in the trust as the trust was indebted to him. Also, Mr B effectively used the business as his bank account, obtaining advances from the business and then repaying them, recorded in the "Director's loan account".

Ms D applied to the Family Court for a departure order and the Family Court held that the primary purpose of the company and trust structures was to avoid a higher child support liability. The Family Court ordered retrospectively an increase in the child support payable by Mr B to Ms D and awarded Ms D $297,300.94 ($146,676 plus $150,624.94 interest).

Mr B appealed to the High Court which found that there was jurisdiction to award retrospective child support but set aside the Family Court order and awarded Ms D $29,538 ($15,442 plus $14,096 interest).

The Commissioner had intervened in the High Court on the issue of retrospectivity.

Ms D appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner remained a party to the appeal but only took an interest in whether a departure order could be made retrospectively. The Commissioner did not make any submissions on the substantive issue of the amount of child support payable under the departure order.

### Decision

On the issue of retrospectivity, both Ms D and Mr B agreed in the Court of Appeal that a departure order under the Child Support Act 1991 ("the CSA") could be made retrospectively.

As it was no longer an issue in the appeal, the Court of Appeal declined to express any views on it:

*   \[25\] Fogarty J's finding that there is jurisdiction to award retrospective child support is not challenged on this appeal. It is therefore both unnecessary and inappropriate for this Court to express a view.  
    …  
    \[27\] We have set out this summary because, as Ms Deligiannis noted, there is an equally balanced difference of opinion in the High Court on the retrospectivity issue. This Court may therefore be called upon in some future case to resolve that difference and decide the issue.

The Court did, however, in allowing the appeal, order that a retrospective departure order be substituted at \[108\].

On the substantive issue whether to grant a departure order, the Court confirmed sections 105(4)(d) and (5)(a) of the CSA empower a court to ascertain the "true financial ability and resources of the parent of a child" and this includes the "ability to go behind or … to 'look through' company, trust and other structures" at \[55\].

A court's task is to "identify what financial resources, additional to the salary the father received from \[the business\], which he had available to pay child support". Repayment of the father's loan account (to the business) was an improvement in his asset position and was relevant to the Court's task. Further, something which is unable to be taken into account in a formula assessment, "such as the use of a car or interest free loans", can be taken into account on a departure order.

The Court of Appeal held the following were to be added to Mr B's income for the first period 1997 to 2003 (inclusive):

*   1.  The difference between the open and closing balance of the "Director's loan account" with the business, $71,855
    2.  The agreed vehicle expenses and interest charged, $57,398
    3.  Further advances to/drawings by Mr B, $89,750.

These were to be spread equally over the seven years, increasing Mr B's income available for the assessment of child support by $31,286 for each year.

For the second period, 2004 to 2010 (inclusive), the position is different because the drop in Mr B's income was due to his embarking on a large software development. The issue was whether and to what extent Mr B was entitled to decide to embark on this development to the detriment of his ability to make child support payments.

The Court of Appeal was attracted to the submission that Mr B took an "involuntary grant" from Ms D when Mr B embarked on the development because by paying less child support he could undertake it whilst not expecting to share any of the gains with Ms D. The Court's four main reasons for such analysis are:

*   1.  "It factors in what the father rather overlooked when he embarked on the software development project: that his primary obligation was to support his children" \[88\].
    2.  It is consistent with section 105 of the CSA and what is just and equitable between the parties and the children.
    3.  The evidence that the work Mr Bevis undertook for the software development would have commanded a salary of $100,000 per annum, whilst not the single basis for fixing the child support, was relevant to his "earning capacity" in terms of section 105(4)(d) of the CSA.
    4.  It appropriately reflects that it is a retrospective departure order being made. As an "involuntary investor" in the project, Ms D should enjoy the returns from the project in the form of, retrospectively, proper child support.

The Court of Appeal reinstated the Family Court order that Mr B pay the maximum child support for the years 2004 to 2010 (inclusive).

The Court of Appeal ordered interest and reserved leave to apply to the Family Court for supplementary orders dealing with enforcement should there be difficulty enforcing the retrospective departure order.

The Court of Appeal subsequently declined an application to redact the names of the parties from published reports of the judgment, finding that it is neither necessary nor appropriate and the children, now all adults, are not identified in the judgment.

[Applying the FIF rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012/applying-the-fif-rules "Applying the FIF rules")

Choice of FIF calculation method
================================

2012 explanation of the five FIF calculation methods and the general rules for choosing methods as outlined in section EX 46(3).

_Sections EX 46, EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62_

If none of the exemptions from the FIF rules apply (as discussed previously), the person has an attributing interest in a FIF.

#### Calculation methods

For each attributing interest in a FIF, the person must choose one of the five FIF calculation methods listed in section EX 44:

*   the fair dividend rate method;
*   the cost method;
*   the comparative value method;
*   the deemed rate of return method; or
*   the attributable FIF income method.

Sections EX 46, EX 47, EX 48 and EX 62 limit a person's choice of calculation method.

Section EX 46 outlines the general rules for choosing each of the FIF calculation methods. Section EX 62 limits a person's ability to change from a method that they are currently using for a particular FIF.

#### _Choosing the attributable FIF income method_

Section EX 46(3) limits the attributable FIF income method to interests in FIFs that are companies (as opposed to FIFs that are foreign superannuation schemes or foreign life insurance policies).

Portfolio investment entities that hold interests in foreign companies cannot use the attributable FIF income method.

Section EX 46(3) also prevents a person from using the attributable FIF income method if they cannot obtain sufficient information to perform the calculations in section EX 50. Note that there are two types of information that may be relevant for the purposes of this requirement:

*   If a person has sufficient accounting information to apply and satisfy the active business test in section EX 21E so that the FIF is non-attributing, they will comply with this requirement.
*   If a person is unable to satisfy the active business test in section EX 21E, they will only comply with this requirement if they can access the more detailed financial information that would be required to calculate attributable income under the tax concepts in sections EX 21D or EX 18.

Generally, a person must hold a 10% or greater income interest in a foreign company in order to apply the attributable FIF income method. Note that this interest can be held indirectly through a CFC or another FIF that uses the attributable FIF income method. This is because the person's income interest is calculated to include an indirect income interest (see sections EX 50(4) and EX 10). For example, in the following structure NZ Co would have an income interest of 10% in FIF 2.

**Example**

![A flowchart structure showing NZ Co with an income interest of 10 percent in FIF 2.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/0/d08ab2804c071a6c82c9abc74b7f9625/nl-page-21.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214402&hash=835F94B6BF813708C03FC98ABB247DBC)

A person with less than a 10% interest in a foreign company may nevertheless be able to use the attributable FIF income method if the foreign company is a CFC[1](#1)
 and a market value for shares in the CFC is not available except by independent valuation (for example, if the CFC is not listed on a stock exchange). In addition there are restrictions on the types of investors in the CFC.

Neither the person nor a person with an interest of 10% or more in the CFC can be:

*   a listed company;
*   a group investment fund;
*   a superannuation fund;
*   a unit trust;
*   a portfolio investment entity; or
*   a trustee of a trust with a beneficiary who is one of the above.

**Example**

John has 1% of the shares in a CFC. A listed company has 8% of the shares in the CFC. John is able to use the attributable FIF income method, but the listed company cannot. If the listed company had 10% or more of the shares in the CFC, John would not be able to use the attributable FIF income method.

#### _Choosing the fair dividend rate method_

If a person is unable to use the attributable FIF income method, or does not want to use this method, the main alternative is the fair dividend rate method.

The fair dividend rate method can be used for an attributing interest in a FIF that is an ordinary share and for which a market value is available. If a person cannot obtain a market value for an interest that is an ordinary share, they will generally use the cost method.

#### _Choosing the cost method_

The cost method calculates income in a similar way to the fair dividend rate method.

In order to use the cost method, the FIF interest must be an ordinary share and the person must not be able to obtain a market value for the interest except by independent valuation. If a person is able to obtain a market value without an independent valuation (for example, if the FIF is listed on a stock exchange), they will usually be required to apply the fair dividend method.

#### _Non-ordinary shares_

Persons with non-ordinary shares are generally required to use the comparative value method if they can obtain a market value, or the deemed rate of return method if they cannot obtain a market value. Non-ordinary shares are defined in section EX 46(10).

#### _Deemed rate of return method_

When a person has a non-ordinary share and cannot obtain a market value for that share, they are generally required to use the deemed rate of return method.

#### _Choosing the comparative value method_

Aside from non-ordinary shares, the only persons who can apply the comparative value method are natural persons and trustees of a trust for the benefit of a loved one or charity (see section EX 46(6)). If a natural person or a trustee of a trust for the benefit of a loved one or charity chooses to apply a comparative value method to any of their FIF interests, they cannot use the fair dividend rate method or the cost method for any of their other FIF interests. This implies that these persons must be able to use the comparative value (or the attributable FIF income method) for all of their attributing FIF interests.

When the comparative method is used for ordinary shares, the gains or losses on all of those shares are combined to produce an overall gain or loss for that year. If there is an overall loss across all of these holdings the person is considered to have zero income from these interests (see section EX 51(8)). In other words, the FIF losses cannot be used to offset other income.

However, if the comparative value method is used for non-ordinary shares, any losses on these shares can be used to offset other income. (Section EX 51(8) does not apply to non-ordinary shares.)

#### Summary diagram of main exemptions and limitations on choice of method

The following diagram summarises the main exemptions to the FIF rules and limitations that would apply to an investor's choice of calculation method under the new rules. Note the diagram does not include the rules in section EX 62 which limit an investor's ability to change from a method that they are currently using to a different method. The changes to section EX 62 are described below.

**Note**

This is a simplified illustration. In particular, it assumes the interest is a share in a foreign company and it excludes a number of the less commonly used FIF exemptions.

![Summary diagram of main exemptions and limitations on choice of method.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/6/66b7c4804c0723ed82dcabc74b7f9625/nl-page22-thumb.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214402&hash=47DFA1BC953D9642F5580CCBAF5149FE)

\* Subject to certain conditions a person with a less than 10% interest in a CFC may be able to use attributable FIF income method.

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/8/18b5d4804c07254582e3abc74b7f9625/nl-page-22-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214401&hash=E78E6B6F2F02FF4917A681B6C4F22555 "This link will open a new window.")

#### Limitations on changing method

In general, once investors start to use a calculation method for a FIF interest they are required to continue using the same calculation method. Section EX 62 supports this approach by providing a set of rules that limit an investor's ability to change from a FIF calculation method that they are currently using to a different FIF calculation method.

#### _Changing from the accounting profits method_

A person who used the accounting profits method in the year preceding the repeal of this method can change to any other method (see section EX 62(2)(a)).

#### _Changing to, or from, the attributable FIF income method_

A person who used the branch equivalent method in the year preceding the repeal of this method can change to the attributable FIF income method (see section EX 62(6)(a)).

A person can change from the attributable FIF income method if sections EX 46(a) and (b) prevent them from using the attributable FIF income method, or if it is impossible to obtain enough information to continue to use the method. Note that this second condition could be met in cases when a person previously satisfied the active business test but now no longer satisfies the test and cannot access sufficient information to calculate their attributable income under normal tax concepts.

If the previous paragraphs do not apply, there are additional requirements that must be met before a person can change to, or from the attributable FIF income method. These requirements differ depending on whether it is the first time that the person has for, that particular FIF, changed to the attributable FIF income method (from a different FIF calculation method), or from the attributable FIF income method (to a different FIF calculation method).

If it is their first change, they only need to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the change, and the reason for the change of method.

If the person has already used their one "free" change that they are allowed for a particular FIF, but wants to change to, or from, the attributable FIF income method a second time, they must notify the Commissioner as above, but as part of their notification they must also be able to show that:

*   there has been a change in circumstances that significantly changes the person's ability to obtain enough information to use the attributable FIF income method; and
*   altering their income tax liability is not the principal purpose or effect of the change.

#### _Changing to the fair dividend rate method_

Taxpayers are generally able to change to the fair dividend rate method from the accounting profits method, the branch equivalent method or the deemed rate of return method if they are using the fair dividend rate method for their first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This recognises the fact that the accounting profits method and the branch equivalent method have been repealed and the deemed rate of return method is now restricted to non-ordinary shares.

Taxpayers are able to change from the fair dividend rate method if it becomes impossible to obtain a start-of-year market valuation except by independent valuation (see section EX 62(2)(f)).

They are also able to change from the cost method to the fair dividend rate method if they are able to use the fair dividend rate method and can now get a market value for the FIF other than by independent valuation, for example, if the FIF becomes listed on a stock exchange. (See section EX 62(2)(g).)

Natural persons and trustees of a trust for the benefit of a loved one or charity are able to change between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods in consecutive years without restriction (see section EX 62(8)). However, if they use comparative value for one interest, they cannot use the fair dividend rate for another interest. This means that the comparative value method will generally apply to their entire share portfolio.

* * *

1 Even though the company is a CFC, a person with less than a 10% interest in the CFC (including interests of associated persons) will use the FIF rules as opposed to the CFC rules to attribute income from the CFC.

What a KiwiSaver fund is
------------------------

Your KiwiSaver provider may offer a range of investment funds to suit your needs. The funds will have different amounts of potential risk and return.

Once in KiwiSaver you can change your chosen fund at any time. 

Sorted's KiwiSaver fund finder and Smart Investor platform can help you compare KiwiSaver funds and pick one that is right for you.

[Sorted - KiwiSaver fund finder](http://fundfinder.sorted.org.nz/?_ga=2.206967251.1398715658.1599105410-1712292185.1599105410)

What a KiwiSaver scheme is
--------------------------

A KiwiSaver scheme is a collection of funds to choose from. There are a range of funds to suit your needs, for example, if you're just starting work or nearing retirement.

You can choose your fund from a KiwiSaver scheme provider and switch at any time. You do not have to stay with your employer’s chosen provider, or a default provider.

The Financial Markets Authority regulates KiwiSaver schemes in a similar way to other registered superannuation schemes.

If you have been auto enrolled by your employer, you will have been enrolled in a default scheme and we will send you the scheme's product disclosure statement (a document that tells you all about the scheme, including the investments and fees). If you enrolled directly, the provider will give you a statement. If your employer has their own scheme, you'll get a statement from them.

To make sure KiwiSaver schemes are competitive and members' best interests are looked after:

*   all default KiwiSaver schemes must have reasonable fees
*   default providers have a special contract with the Government requiring them to meet more reporting requirements
*   default providers' activities and their default investment funds are closely monitored.

KiwiSaver investments are not guaranteed by the Government. You make your own investment choices, which come with varying amounts of risk.

Deciding which KiwiSaver scheme is right for you
------------------------------------------------

KiwiSaver product disclosure statements tell you:

*   the specific rules, fees, terms and conditions of the scheme
*   how your money will be invested
*   who is responsible for managing your money
*   their approach to responsible investing (including their environmental and social considerations).

Once you've joined KiwiSaver, your main relationship will be with your KiwiSaver scheme provider.

Church leaders sentenced on fraud charges
=========================================

**08 March 2023**

Five leaders of the Samoan Assembly of God Church in Manukau have been sentenced to community detention and ordered to repay the money they received when they made false donation tax credit (DTC) claims to the tune of nearly $170,000.

The Church is registered as a charitable organisation which means one-third of donations made to it may be claimed back by producing a receipt and lodging the claim with Inland Revenue.

Church pastor **Naseri Masani** and his wife **Tasi Afuie,** Church Treasurer **Logotaeao Pace,** along with Sunday school leader **Faamanuia Mataafa,** and her husband Church Secretary **Aneterea Mino**, were all charged with using applications for donation tax credits with intent to obtain a pecuniary advantage.

As well as overclaiming DTC for themselves, the five asked other individuals, usually members of their congregation, for personal information, including their IRD numbers. Donation receipts using those details, with false donation amounts, were issued mostly by the Treasurer Logotaeao Pace, or otherwise by the Church Pastor Naseri Masani.

Receipts were then used by one of the five to lodge DTC claims with Inland Revenue, requesting refunds be deposited into one of their own bank accounts.

Sometimes a false DTC claim would be submitted to Inland Revenue in the name of a person who had no idea a DTC claim was made.

The integrity of the tax system is an important focus for Inland Revenue and we will use all available options where dishonesty like this has led to losses for New Zealanders.

**The Defendants** were sentenced on March 8 in the Manukau District Court.

**Logotaeao Pace** – the Church Treasurer – plead guilty to deception, issuing 12 false and inflated donation receipts to other church members, and dishonestly using applications for DTC, intending to obtain refunds.

Pace, either by herself or with the other church officers, was involved in 53 fraudulent applications for DTC refunds, totalling $122,367. She received $34,366 personally and $28,531 was paid to other church members. None of the money has been repaid.

A further $28,531 was also paid to other Church members who used the inflated donation receipts issued by Pace.

During an interview with Inland Revenue, she admitted making the false donation tax credit claims was her idea but said donors knew that the receipts she gave them were false.

Pace said she knew what she was doing was wrong but did it for “love of money”.

She was sentenced to the maximum possible 6 months community detention and 250 hours community work. She was also ordered to pay $700 reparation within 14 days and $20 a week for the next 5 years.

**Naseri Masani** - Pastor of the church - plead guilty to dishonestly using 19 applications for DTC, intending to obtain refunds.

Each year, from 2012 to 2016, he applied for refunds for his personal donations to the Church. Each application falsely inflated the amount donated so he’d get back more money.

Naseri Masani was also involved in false DTC claims for his wife, an adult son, and another church member.  In total he personally received $21,447 and none has been repaid.

He was sentenced to 6 months community detention and 200 hours community work. He was ordered to pay $600 reparation within 14 days and $20 a week for 5 years.

**Tasi Afuie** – the pastor’s wife and the Women’s Fellowship leader – plead guilty to dishonestly using 10 applications for DTC, intending to obtain refunds.

From 2012 to 2016 Tasi Afuie made donation tax credit claims. Each donation amount was for more than she gave. She was also involved in filing false DTC claims in the names of other people. She personally received $25,978 as a result of the false claims.

She also admitted Working for Families fraud by not telling IR she had married and was living with her husband, a situation which affected her WfF entitlements. She received an additional $22,417 which she was not entitled to. None of the $48,395 received by her has been repaid.

She was sentenced to 6 months community detention and 100 hours community work. She was ordered to pay $600 reparation within 14 days and $20 a week for 5 years.

**Faamanuia Mataafa (aka Faamanuia Mino) –** the Church Sunday School leader – plead guilty to dishonestly using 25 applications for DTC, intending to obtain refunds.

Each claim stated an inflated donation amount and attached falsely inflated Church donation receipts as supporting evidence.

Analysis of her bank accounts show that the refunds received were spent on personal items, travel, and debt repayment.

She was sentenced to 4 months community detention and ordered to pay $100 a week for 5 years.

**Aneterea Mino** – the Church Secretary and husband of Faamanuia – plead guilty to dishonestly using 27 applications for DTC, intending to obtain refunds.

From 2012 to 2016, he and his wife made similar personal DTC claims and he was involved with filing false DTC claims for other people. Sometimes personal tax details were obtained without the person knowing or being told why.

Mino and Mataafa received $58,842 into their joint accounts. $5,000 has been repaid.

Mino was sentenced to 4 months community detention and ordered to pay reparations of $150 per week for the next 3 years.

Church superannuation scheme not charitable
===========================================

2004 case note – Church superannuation scheme was not exempt from tax – charity, charitable.

Case

Jarod Peter Hester & Ors v CIR, CA 6/04

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The tax payers' appeal was unsuccessful. The superannuation scheme was not exempt from tax pursuant to section CB 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The correctness of the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case was doubted.

### Facts

#### Introduction

This case was an appeal of a decision of O'Regan J reported as _Hester & Ors v CIR_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,421. In that decision the High Court held that a superannuation scheme was not exempt from income tax pursuant to s CB 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (which exempts income derived by trustees for charitable purposes).

#### Background

The appellants are the trustees of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ("the Church") Deseret Benefit Plan ("the Plan"). The Plan is a defined benefit and contributory superannuation scheme providing retirement income to employees of the Church. The appellants claimed the Plan was a "trust for charitable purposes" and therefore exempt from income tax.

The Plan is for employees of the Church. The Church does not have paid ministers, but has a system of "callings" whereby Church members perform ecclesiastical functions. The Church itself has charitable status. The salaries received by the members of the Plan related to their temporal job, not their calling.

The Church's employees were employed at the Church's Administration Centre in Takapuna, the Church Temple in Hamilton and the Church College also in Hamilton. There was also provision for admission to the Plan of an "associated employer" though none in fact had been admitted.

The Administration Centre was, during the relevant time, the centre of the overall operation of the Church's operations in New Zealand. Members of the Plan at the Administration Centre included managers, human resources staff, IT staff, secretarial and clerical staff, and accounting staff. Church College is a private secondary school which is run and financed by the Church. It teaches the national curriculum as well as providing religious education to students. All staff members (apart from one) belonged to the Church. Members of the Plan at the College include teachers, secretarial and administrative staff, and catering and security staff. The Temple is the most sacred place the Church has in New Zealand. Members of the Plan at the Temple include managers, gardeners, security guards, clerical workers, and clothing and cafeteria workers.

#### The High Court decision

In the High Court the appellants argued that their situation was indistinguishable from the existing case law, particularly the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case (discussed further below). The Commissioner argued that their situation was distinguishable, and the High Court agreed and found for the Commissioner. The High Court also dismissed an argument that the Commissioner was acting in a discriminatory way in relation to the Plan.

### Decision

The main judgment was given by William Young J. His Honour set out the factual background to the dispute and summarised the legislation. Section CB 4(1)(c) of the Income Tax 1994 was discussed and it was concluded that the words "established exclusively for charitable purposes" did not apply to "trusts for charitable purposes".

The Judge then discussed in detail the two leading authorities: _Presbyterian Church of New Zealand Beneficiary Fund v CIR_ \[1994\] 3 NZLR 363 and _Baptist Union of Ireland (Northern) Corporation Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue_ (1945) 26 TC 335 ("_Presbyterian Church Fund_" and "_Baptist Union_").

The _Baptist Union_ case concerned the Baptist Union of Ireland Annuity Fund, the object of which was to provide annuities for its members and their widows and orphans. The _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case dealt with a superannuation fund that was primarily for the benefit of retired ministers of the Presbyterian Church and their dependants.

William Young J noted that the arguments originally presented before the Court of Appeal were relatively narrow. The appellants sought to apply the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case while the Commissioner supported O'Regan J's decision in the High Court and did not seek to challenge the correctness of the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case. However, during the course of argument the members of the Court of Appeal became concerned whether the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case was correctly decided and invited further submissions on that point. The Commissioner then asserted that that case had been incorrectly decided while the appellants supported it.

In considering the Commissioner's submissions that the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case was wrongly decided William Young J noted that there was some strength in the Commissioner's submission that the cases where gifts for the benefit of clergy were held to be charitable involved outside bounty (including in the _Baptist Union_ case). However, in the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case a very significant proportion of the funds of that superannuation scheme came from members.

William Young J concluded (at paragraphs \[85\] and \[86\]):

> It is hard to see the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ as having the "altruistic" features which in the end moved MacDermott J to hold that the _Baptist Union_ Fund was a trust for charitable purposes.
> 
> On that basis, it is well open to question whether the decision of Heron J in the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ was correctly decided.

The Judge then set out some history relating to the taxation of superannuation schemes and noted the long-standing view that superannuation schemes for the benefit of ministers of religion were charitable. Because of these factors the Court of Appeal declined to overrule the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case (at paragraph \[93\]):

> Given the history to which we have referred, the fact that the Commissioner did not appeal the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case and the extent to which it has been acted on in ways which would now be hard to unpick, we think it would be wrong to overrule the decision ...

William Young J then considered whether O'Regan J was right to distinguish the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case. The appellants argued that the benefits provided to the employees under the Plan were as closely associated as the advancement of religion as in the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case. The Commissioner argued that there were many grounds of factual difference. The Judge considered some sections in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act noting that the appellants' submissions on discrimination had some force. It was accepted that the tax system should not operate in a way that provides preference for "mainstream churches" (a term used in the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case) and it was noted that the Court of Appeal had "given anxious consideration to whether it is possible to maintain the distinction drawn by O'Regan J between the circumstances affecting the Plan and those which applied in the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case." (at paragraph \[102\])

The Court of Appeal concluded that the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case should not be extended to the situation of appellants. At paragraph \[106\] William Young J stated:

> If the Plan is accorded charitable status, the implications are likely to be serious. Amongst the employees covered by the Plan are teachers employed by Church College. If the provision of superannuation benefits for them by means of a contributory scheme is charitable because they are working for the Church, similar plans for school teachers employed by other church schools would also be charitable. Indeed, given that the advancement of education is a charitable purpose, presumably plans for the benefit of anyone working in the education field would likewise be entitled to charitable status. Arguably the same would apply to plans for doctors and nurses and ancillary staff (whose work is addressed to relief for the "impotent") and for social workers (who work with "the poor"). Similar status would be likely to be claimed for plans associated with the many other occupations associated with public service. In that context, allowing the appeal is likely to start a ball rolling which, unchecked, would have the potential to dent the income tax system severely.

The Court of Appeal therefore found for the Commissioner on the main issue.

In relation to a secondary issue the Commissioner's argument also was considered favourably by the Court of Appeal, though it did not make a definitive finding on it. The Plan's deed allowed employees of "associated employers" to join the Plan. The Commissioner submitted that a trust that permits the application of income for purposes that are not charitable cannot, itself, be charitable. It was irrelevant that there were no associated employers in the year in question. The Court of Appeal stated at paragraph \[115\]:

> It is not entirely unknown for trusts to be set up for what ostensibly are charitable purposes, but for other purposes (or beneficiaries) to be able to be introduced at the will of a person associated with the trust. It would be unsatisfactory if such a trust was able to operate with the benefit of charitable status associated with the charitable purposes ostensibly provided for but then for the purposes and beneficiaries to be changed to permit distribution to or for a non-charitable purpose or beneficiary.

Hammond J also gave a short concurring judgment. His Honour noted that the _Presbyterian Church Fund_ case as being "very much at the outermost limits of the existing doctrine" but noted that he "would not be minded to overrule that decision, even if it were procedurally appropriate to do so, by a side wind as it were." Hammond J concluded by stating (at paragraph \[14\]):

> It follows that, in my view, the scheme under consideration is well beyond the existing doctrine for an allowable religious charitable trust - it is too broadly conceived as to the persons who can come within it - and on that basis alone the present appeal should be dismissed.

1 Classified Public Commissioner’s Statement CS 16/02 Determining “Market Rental Value” of Employer-Provided Accommodation The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. The Statement is not a consultative document. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). This Commissioner’s Statement replaces any previous operational statements on this issue, with effect from 1 April 2015. Introduction 1. Changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 that came into force on 1 April 2015 (although some of the changes may have earlier effect) have altered the way in which employer-provided New Zealand accommodation is taxed, including the basis on which the value of such accommodation is determined. 2. This statement provides guidance to assist taxpayers in estimating the likely market rental value of employer-provided accommodation. It is not meant to provide comprehensive guidance on all aspects of the new provisions. If a taxpayer is unsure whether they are properly complying with their tax obligations, or whether the changes apply to the accommodation they are providing, they should consult a tax professional. 3. When an employer provides free, or subsidised, accommodation to employees, the market rental value of that accommodation is generally taxed as income of the employee. If the employer is providing accommodation that they have, in turn, rented from a non-associated third party on an arm’s-length basis, then the market rental value will be the rent so paid. However, when the accommodation is owned by the employer, or obtained from a third party under anything other than an arm’s length arrangement, it is necessary to establish its market rental value. 4. Section CE 1B(1) provides the general rule: The value of accommodation provided to a person is income of the person when it is provided in relation to their employment or service. The value is an amount equal to the market rental value of the accommodation. 5. Establishing the market rental value necessarily involves a process requiring the estimation of that amount. While the market rental value is inherently a matter of judgment, based on the expertise and experience of the person making the estimate of the value, a number of objective factors can be 2 Classified Public used. 6. Absolute accuracy is not expected, but it is expected that a reasonable and appropriate process is followed when estimating the market rental value. It is also expected that the process that is followed, and the factors that were taken into account, will be documented and available for review. Where the process that was followed is able to be demonstrated as reasonable in the circumstances, the actual valuation is unlikely to be questioned and shortfall penalties would not arise. 7. This statement sets out the Commissioner's view on which factors can be taken into account when estimating the market rental value of accommodation provided by an employer to an employee, and those factors that are not relevant. 8. This Commissioner’s Statement only applies to the provision of accommodation by an employer to an employee in New Zealand. This includes accommodation owned, or rented, by an employer that is provided to an employee. Separate guidance will be provided for accommodation provided to employees outside New Zealand, as different tax rules apply. Similarly, it is also intended to provide specific guidance for the provision of accommodation that is located within the grounds of a boarding school. 9. As discussed in more detail below, the Commissioner considers that the phrase “market rental value” refers to the amount that would be arrived at by two non-associated parties, on an arm’s length basis, for the rental (whether on a periodic or fixed term basis) of the accommodation. 10. When the accommodation is owned by the employer, or is rented by the employer on other than an arm’s length basis, a number of factors can be taken into account when determining the market rental value of the accommodation. 11. Employer-provided accommodation can arise in a wide range of circumstances and in a wide range of sectors or industries. It is not possible for this statement to provide specific guidance for accommodation arising from different employment situations. However, it should be noted that only limited exceptions apply and therefore the guidance provided in this statement will broadly apply across those different situations. 12. For example, the same rules apply to accommodation provided by a farmer to a farm worker in rural New Zealand as apply to the provision of a house by a company to an executive in Auckland. The estimated market rental value of the property is taxable income of the employee (the farm worker or the executive) and the employer (the farmer or the company) is required to account for PAYE on the market rental value of the accommodation. 13. New Zealand operates a self-assessment tax system. This means that both the employer and the employee are responsible for meeting their respective tax obligations. However, in the case of employer-provided accommodation, it is the employer’s primary responsibility to estimate the market rental value of the accommodation on a reasonable basis and to ensure that tax on the amount is properly accounted for. In the first instance, this means that PAYE must be paid on the market rental value of the accommodation. 3 Classified Public 14. However, the value of the accommodation will also directly affect the employee. For example, as the value of accommodation will be part of the employee’s income, it will be taken into account for child support or Working for Families Tax Credit purposes. It may therefore be good practice for the employer to discuss the basis on which the valuation has been reached with the employee, while recognising that such consultation cannot be for any purpose other than making a reasonable estimate of the market rental value. Deliberately undervaluing accommodation to benefit the employee will not be considered reasonable by the Commissioner. Market rental value 15. The term “market rental value” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. However, it is a commonly used and understood term that does not have any different, or specific, meaning in a tax context. The Commissioner considers that market rental value refers to the periodic rental that would be paid if similar accommodation in a comparable location, subject to similar restrictions or conditions relating to the tenancy, was rented on an arm’s length basis between non-associated parties. The Commissioner also considers that the amount actually paid to a third party as consideration under an arm’s length rental arrangement is the “market rental value” of the accommodation. 16. There are a number of factors that the Commissioner considers can be taken into account when estimating the market rental value, but there are also a number of other factors that are not relevant and therefore cannot be taken into account. In particular, those conditions that arise out of, or are peculiar to, the employment relationship itself, as opposed to arising under a lessor/lessee relationship, are irrelevant to estimating what the market rental value of the accommodation would be. Factors to take into account when determining market rental value 17. In determining the market rental value of accommodation, the aim is to estimate the amount that would be likely to be paid if the specific accommodation was available for rental on an arm’s length basis. This will normally be determined on the basis of a comparison with comparable properties (similar location, type of accommodation, condition and amenities). However, that may not always be possible. 18. Relevant matters to take into account in establishing an appropriate market rental value, consistent with the approach taken by registered valuers, include: • The location of the accommodation, taking into account aspects such as its desirability, access to amenities (such as transport, shopping etc.), relative building values and security. • The specific functional characteristics of the particular accommodation, such as the number of bedrooms, overall size, availability of parking, laundry facilities etc., and the quality of the build. • The overall, relative, condition of the accommodation, including whether it is rundown or, conversely, a luxury or high quality dwelling. 4 Classified Public • The ease of travel to and from places of work, schools, shopping etc., including the availability of public transport. • Restrictions on use of the accommodation, or access to it, where such restrictions substantially inhibit the rights of use that would normally be available to a lessee. The Commissioner considers it unlikely that minor, or reasonable, restrictions, such as in respect of pets or smoking, would have a more than de minimis effect on the market rental value of accommodation, if at all. 19. Therefore, it would be expected that accommodation in a sought after urban location will have a higher market rental value than similar accommodation in a less sought after location. However, the actual market rental value will reflect the relevant market – therefore, a higher value might be appropriate on the basis of limited availability of rental accommodation. 20. Accommodation provided within an employer’s place of business and with significant restrictions placed on the times at which persons (particularly visitors) could come and go, might be likely to attract a discount. Similarly, if the premises are not particularly desirable, for example, a house in factory premises, such a lack of relative desirability will be reflected in the likely demand for such a dwelling and therefore its likely market rental value. Factors that cannot be taken into account: 21. As noted above, the market rental value is the likely rental value of accommodation if it was available on an arm’s length basis. 22. In the case of an employer making accommodation available to an employee, there may be a number of reasons why the employer, or the employee, may consider that a reduced rental value is appropriate. For example, it may be a condition of employment that the employee occupy a specific dwelling, or a reduced rental may be considered appropriate having regard to the level of remuneration received by the employee. 23. However, the Commissioner’s view is that contractual or employment- related matters will not have an effect on the market rental value of the accommodation. Rather, they are personal to the employee and, therefore, such matters would not apply to any arm’s length transaction. As a result, such matters cannot be taken into account when estimating the market rental value of accommodation provided to employees. 24. In addition, it is not relevant, when estimating a market rental value, that there may not be an actual arm’s length market for specific accommodation, for example, where the accommodation that is made available to the employee is not, and never will be, available to members of the general public. This may arise for such reasons as a concern over security, or because the accommodation is intrinsic to the employment relationship. 25. In such cases, the market rental value should be established on the basis of a similar class of accommodation that is available to the general public in the same, or a similar, area. 5 Classified Public Market rental value of individual accommodation 26. The Act imposes a tax liability that arises from the specific provision of accommodation to each employee. Where a variety of accommodation is provided to a number of employees, an employer is not permitted to attribute an average market rental value to the accommodation, even though it may be more convenient or cost efficient to the employer. Rather, the estimated market rental value of the actual accommodation provided to each employee must be used, and as such gives rise to the relevant tax liability. Example 1: An employer owns three different dwellings that are provided to three different employees. A valuation has determined that the dwellings have a likely market rental value of $100, $150 and $200 per week, respectively. These actual market rental values must be used to determine the taxable amount attributable to each employee. It is not possible to attribute an average value of $150 to each employee. 27. However, if a group of employees are provided with shared accommodation in one property, then the market rental value of the entire property can be apportioned between the employees to determine the market rental value of the individual accommodation. Any reasonable basis of apportionment will be acceptable, as long as it is agreed to by the affected employees. If all the employees do not agree to a basis of apportionment, then it must be apportioned equally (as required by section CE 1B(4) of the Act). Example 2: A three-bedroom dwelling is shared by three employees. The market rental value of the accommodation is $450 per week. As there is no substantial difference between the rooms occupied by each employee, the amount attributed as income for each employee is $150 per week. Example 3: Three employees share a three-bedroom house. One of the employees also has sole use of the attached garage. The market rental value of the accommodation is $500 per week. As there is no substantial difference between the rooms occupied by each employee, all of the employees agree that the amount attributed as income to the two employees who do not have use of the garage is $150 per week, and the amount attributed to the employee who has the use of the garage is $200 per week. Market rental valuation methods 28. The Act does not specify how to determine the market rental value of accommodation an employer provides, or how often it is necessary to obtain an updated valuation. Rather, the Act simply imposes a tax liability in respect of the accommodation and as a consequence an obligation on the employer to establish the market rental value of such accommodation and account for tax (generally PAYE) accordingly. 29. Therefore, it is open to the employer to adopt any reasonable basis for determining the market rental value of the accommodation. For example, the possible basis for a market rental value might include (but isn’t necessarily limited to): • a valuation from a registered valuer; 6 Classified Public • an estimate of the market rental value from a real estate agent, property manager, or other suitably experienced person; • a review of comparable properties on internet sites that advertise rental properties, for example, Trade Me; • any other reasonable basis that takes into account the features of the accommodation being provided and compares it with similar accommodation. 30. Inland Revenue does not have a preference for any particular basis of determining the market rental value of accommodation. However, as with any other tax position taken by a taxpayer, it is expected that a taxpayer will take reasonable steps, and exercise reasonable care, in reaching a view on the appropriate market rental value. For example, if a valuation or estimate is sought from a registered valuer, real estate agent, or property manager, such a person would need to be suitably experienced and qualified. Similarly, if the market rental value is determined by using the values of other properties on Trade Me, it will be necessary to use a comparison with similar accommodation. 31. In all cases, it is necessary to document the basis on which the market rental value was reached. In the case of a valuation provided by a valuer, real estate agent or property manager, this could be a letter that sets out the valuation, how it was reached, and the factors and information taken into account. Example 4: Bruce has hired a new mechanic, Rob, for his garage. Rob has moved to Wellington from Hawera and hasn’t found anywhere to live, so Bruce has agreed to let Rob live in the house in Karori that he recently inherited, while Rob gets himself settled. As the house has never been rented (it was owned by Bruce’s mother for 62 years) Bruce has no idea how much the market rental value of the property is. However, Bruce knows that there is a strong rental market in Karori so he asked a local property manager, Felicity (who Bob is going to use to manage the property once Rob moves out), to estimate the likely rental that he will get once the house is put on the rental market. Felicity inspected the house and, on the basis of a comparison with similar houses (facilities, condition, location) that she manages, she has advised that a weekly rental of $500 is appropriate. Felicity backed this up with a letter confirming the amount and setting out the basis for the amount. 32. When an employer reaches their own estimate of the market rental value, for example, by using Trade Me, it is important to ensure that a fair and appropriate sample is used for comparison and as the basis for the valuation. Example 5: Margaret runs a French restaurant in Tawa. The restaurant is very busy, but Margaret has difficulty finding waiting staff with the right experience. Following a trip to Paris, Margaret was successful in employing a waiter, Jean-Claude, but found it necessary to include the provision of accommodation in his salary package. Margaret found it economical to purchase a three-bedroom ex-State house to provide to Jean-Claude. 7 Classified Public However, Margaret wants to keep her costs down so she looked on Trade Me to see what similar houses in the area are renting for. The house she bought is conveniently located near a commuter train station, so she limited her comparison to other three-bedroom houses with similar public transport connections. She found four houses that were comparable, and found that the rent being sought ranged from $350 to $400 per week, with the average being $380 per week. There were a number of cheaper houses available, but as they were not of the same quality, she excluded them. She also excluded the more expensive new build houses. However, as Margaret had her house redecorated and insulated before making it available to Jean-Claude, she decided that it would be more appropriate to estimate the market rental value at $400 per week. 33. When a taxpayer estimates the market rental value of accommodation on the basis of a comparison with other properties, for example, by using Trade Me information, it is important to ensure that the process that was followed, and the information relied on, is documented. This may include printing out the listings of the properties that were used as a comparison, recording the rental being sought for those properties, and recording why they were considered to be valid comparisons. 34. The Commissioner’s view is that it is necessary to establish an initial estimate of the market rental value of the accommodation (as at the time the arrangement commenced) and to then review that valuation from time to time, as appropriate, to ensure that the rental value, and therefore the taxable income, is as accurate as possible. How often this will be needed will depend on whether there has been a shift in the market rental value of accommodation for the particular area. However, it is suggested that the value of the accommodation should be reviewed at least every three years and adjusted accordingly. If the likely market rental value has declined, then the taxable income of the employee can also be reduced. A review of the market rental value will require a similar process as followed to reach the initial estimate of the market rental value. Employee contribution 35. When an employee contributes to the cost of employer-provided accommodation, the amount paid by the employee will reduce the income attributed to the employee. Example 6: The market rental value of employer-provided accommodation is $200 per week. The employee pays to the employer (whether by way of payment, or deduction from salary or wages) $150 per week. The amount of income derived by the employee will be $50. Employee obligations 36. The market rental value of accommodation provided by an employer to an employee is taxable income of the employee. As such, it will be taken into account for such things as child support, student loans and Working for Families Tax Credits. 37. The employee, therefore, has an interest in the accommodation being properly, and correctly, valued. For example, if the accommodation is not correctly valued, the employee may be subject to too much or too little 8 Classified Public income tax, or it may result in an incorrect calculation of a student loan repayment obligation or child support entitlements or liability. 38. It is therefore suggested that the employer discusses the method adopted to value the accommodation with their employee. Alternatively, an employee may wish to discuss with their employer the basis on which the estimate of the market rental value of their accommodation was reached. Further examples 39. The following examples are intended to illustrate particular circumstances. They are not intended to reflect all possible circumstances. Example 7: Farmer Brown supplies a cottage each to three live-in farm workers. While the farm workers could live in the nearest town, it is more convenient for Farmer Brown to have the workers living on-site, as they are readily available to respond to stock-related emergencies more quickly. As the farm workers are required to deal with such emergencies when they arise, and because the cottages are quite rundown, Farmer Brown doesn’t charge the farm workers for the accommodation. In addition, as the cottages are located in the heart of a working farm, there is little privacy, no peace and quiet, and no practical opportunity for the farm workers to have guests or visitors. Farmer Brown considers that, as he would never make the cottages available for rental, they would not have a market rental value. Furthermore, the nearest town does not have an established rental accommodation market, so even if it was convenient, the farm workers would not be able to live in town unless they bought or built a house. Answer: The market rental value of the cottage is taxable income of the employee. It is accepted that it will be difficult for Farmer Brown to establish the market rental value of the cottage, as there is no relevant nearby market to use as a comparison. A number of options are available to Farmer Brown. He could hire a valuation professional to assist him, or he could look on the internet to see if similar cottages are available for rental in other similar locations. Ultimately, Farmer Brown could reach a view, having regard to his experience, on what a reasonable estimate of the market rental value would be. Whichever option is adopted, it is important to ensure that the process followed, and the factors taken into account, are documented. The employment arrangement that gives rise to the supply of the accommodation does not affect the market rental value. The market rental value reflects the amount that would be charged in the absence of such an employment arrangement. The fact that the employees are expected to deal with emergencies does not give rise to any reduction in the value of the accommodation, but rather is a matter addressed by the employment arrangement (and in this case has given rise to Farmer Brown not charging rent). The rundown nature of the accommodation 9 Classified Public will likely be reflected in the market rental value, and environmental factors, such as excessive noise, would similarly be taken into account. It is similarly not relevant that Farmer Brown would not make the cottages available to non-employees. It is necessary to establish the likely market rental value if the properties were put on the open market. Farmer Brown can also not attribute an average value to each dwelling. It is necessary to attribute the correct income to each employee, on the basis of the accommodation actually supplied to them. Example 8: Mike has recently returned to New Zealand from a few years overseas and has decided to train as an electrician. He was lucky enough to be taken on as an apprentice. As he has been unable to find somewhere to live, his employer, John, has agreed to let him live rent free in John’s luxury penthouse in central Auckland for six months. Before Mike moved in, the penthouse had been rented to members of the public for $1,500 per week (and the market has not moved significantly in the meantime). Answer: The market rental value of the apartment is $1,500 per week, as this is the amount of the previous arm’s length rental. Mike’s taxable income is increased accordingly. Mike considers that this is excessive, as he would only ever pay up to $300 per week for rent. While that may be true, section CE 1B(1) of the Act includes in his taxable income the market rental value of the accommodation provided to him by his employer, not the amount that he is saving by being given free accommodation. Example 9: Vanessa is employed (she is not an IR56 taxpayer) as a nanny by Mr and Mrs Wells to look after their three children, Anita (2), Jenny (4) and Laura (5). Vanessa works long hours looking after the children, but is provided with a room within the Wells’ household. Vanessa is regarded as a full member of the household, has access to all parts of the house, joins the family for meals, and often watches television, once the children are in bed, with Mr and Mrs Wells. As part of her duties, Vanessa is expected to attend to the children if they wake up in the night. She is only “off duty” when the children are asleep or she is on her day off. Even on her day off, the children will usually want to play with her and she is usually woken up by the children each morning. The Wells family, and Vanessa, live in a six-bedroom house. To obtain an appropriate market rental valuation of the accommodation provided to Vanessa, Mr and Mrs Wells’ accountant has engaged a registered valuer to provide them with a valuation. Answer: The accommodation provided to Vanessa is one bedroom in a six- bedroom house. If Vanessa did in fact have unrestricted use of the house, such as in a flatting environment, an appropriate basis on which 10 Classified Public to calculate the market rental value of that one bedroom would be on the basis of one-sixth of the market rental value of the entire house. However, in many cases Vanessa’s actual entitlement to the use of the house would be likely to be far more restricted, recognising the reality that she is an employee. The extent of the restrictions might be explicit, such as being required to eat her meals or watch television in her own room, or a less explicit expectation that she recognise her employer’s privacy. In such cases, a lesser value, reflecting the actual extent of the private use that she has of the house, would be appropriate. No adjustment is made on the basis of the duties that Vanessa is expected to perform and the relative lack of privacy that she experiences. Such matters are appropriately addressed by the remuneration that Vanessa receives (which includes the market rental value of the accommodation). No specific adjustment needs to be made in respect of any lack of privacy, which is considered an inherent feature of shared accommodation. Example 10: Vanessa’s friend, Karen, is also a nanny. Karen is also provided with accommodation, but in a separate “granny flat”. In Karen’s case, the market rental value of the separate granny flat can be established and will be the amount that is treated as taxable income. Example 11: Martin is employed as the manager of a motel complex. Martin is provided with a separate, three bedroom house for his use. The house is located within the motel complex, but separate from the motel units. Answer: The starting point for establishing the market rental value of the house should be similar houses in the vicinity. It may also be relevant to take into account other houses with similar levels of noise, or foot and vehicle traffic. However, no adjustment should be made for matters related to Martin’s employment, such as the likelihood of being disturbed by guests wanting to check in late, or a guest needing something repaired in their motel unit. Example 12: Kat is a barista in a popular holiday town. While the café that Kat works in is busy all year round, in summer the town becomes very busy and accommodation is eagerly sought after by holiday-makers, to the extent that many residents rent out their houses. As a rule, rental accommodation can attract up to three-times as much in summer as it can the rest of the year. Kat is fortunate to be provided with a small house by her employer. Kat and her employer have entered into a long term rental arrangement and Kat pays the “winter rate” all year long. Answer: While it is accepted that for most of the year Kat pays a market rental amount, during summer she pays a lot less than her employer would be able to rent the house out for. However, the rent that Kat pays is 11 Classified Public appropriate when it is taken into account that she has entered into a long term rental agreement. Example 13: Kat’s friend, Simon, is employed at the café as a barman over the busy summer period. Simon is provided with a house similar to Kat’s, and he is charged the same rent as Kat. Answer: As Simon is only renting the accommodation over the summer period, the higher “summer rate” is the appropriate market rental value. Taxable income arises to the extent that the summer rate exceeds the rent being paid by Simon. Application 40. This statement provides general guidance to assist taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations. This approach can be used by taxpayers for, and will be applied by the Commissioner to, periods commencing on or after 1 April 2015, which was the commencement date of the new legislation. 41. Specific guidance should be sought from appropriately qualified tax professionals. 42. If you have any concerns about compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this Commissioner’s Statement, you should discuss the matter with a tax professional or Inland Revenue.

CIR wins New Zealand's largest tax avoidance case in High Court
===============================================================

2004 case note – tax avoidance and the Trinity scheme - commerciality of investment, depreciable intangible property, forestry.

Case

Accent Management Ltd, Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd, Bristol Forestry Ventures Ltd, Clive Bradbury, Greenmass Ltd, Gregory Peebles, Kenneth Laird Estate, Lexington Resources Ltd, and Redcliffe Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Trinity Scheme involves investment in a Douglas fir forest growing in Southland, entered into between March 1997 and July 2000. Under the scheme each investor (through a series of companies and a joint venture vehicle) acquired a licence to use land for forestry purposes. The duration of the licence is 50 years, which approximates one Douglas fir growing cycle.

The licence agreement gives no title to the land or the trees but gives a right to proceeds of sale of the trees after deduction of various charges, as well as various ancillary rights, eg rights to production thinnings and biomass/pollution credits.

The investors agreed by promissory note to pay a fixed price for the licence in 50 years' time. The calculations used to fix this price were highly contentious, but were purportedly projected off an initial stumpage figure for 1997, a figure for log price growth over 50 years, and an average annual rate of inflation over 50 years. The calculations produced exponential adjustments on a year-by-year basis, and the consequent licence fee is a huge sum, being $2,050,518 per hectare. The licensee is also liable to pay the planting and maintenance expenses. The up-front fees paid (largely by promissory note) to the landowner exceeded the cost of the land.

A further aspect of the scheme for the 1997 year for Tranche 1 investors was an insurance element. The investors took out a loss of surplus insurance policy under which the insurer assumed risk for a stipulated value of the forest in the year 2048. The value (approximately $2.05 million per hectare) is sufficient to enable the investor to break even, being the amount the investors have to pay for the licence in 2047. Premiums are payable by both the investors and the landowner, with the investors paying both a cash amount in 1997 ($1,307 per hectare) and a further amount by promissory note for payment in 2047 ($32,971 per hectare). The landowner's premium is to be paid in 2047 ($410,104 to $1,230,311 per hectare, depending on the value reached).

Thus payment for the investment overall was largely on a deferred basis. Over 99% of the total expenditure claimed over the life of the investment, and 87% of the expenditure claimed for the first (1997) year is deferred until the year 2047. The two promissory notes (one to the landowner and one to the insurer) for this expenditure are limited recourse to the proceeds of forest harvest.

The investors claimed deductions for the insurance premium and forestry agency fees in full in the first year, being the year in which they were incurred. They also contended that the licence fee is deductible as depreciable intangible property under Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The licence fee cost is the combination of the initial payment and the amount due in year 50, which is amortised over the 50 year duration of the licence.

The Commissioner issued assessments for the 1997 and 1998 years adding back the deductions claimed in relation to the insurance premium for the 1997 year and the amortised licence premium for the 1997 and 1998 years. The Commissioner also fixed penalties in relation to the 1998 year.

### Decision

The Judge held as follows on each of the issues:

**Commerciality** - The prospect of a positive return from the forest at maturity is unlikely but it cannot be ruled out.

**Depreciation** - The payment described as a licence premium is not of itself deductible pursuant to section EG(1) of the ITA.

**Insurance** - The insurance premiums meet the requirements of deductibility under sections BB7 and DL1(3) of the ITA and are not required to be spread under the accruals regime.

**Sham** - While CSI (the captive insurance company) was not in a sound financial position and Dr Muir (in particular) and Mr Bradbury had their own reasons for incorporating it and for fixing and controlling the insurance premiums to be paid to it, those factors do not of themselves support a finding of sham tax avoidance.

**Tax avoidance** \- The dominant purpose of the arrangement was tax avoidance.

**Penalties** - Penalties were properly imposed under section 141D of the TAA on the basis the plaintiffs took an abusive tax position.

Claim must provide clarity as required
======================================

2012 case note - Court decided that to consider the strike-out application, the case must be re-pleaded to provide clarity of issues and claim – High Court Rules.

Case

Chesterfields Preschools Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Court decided that to consider the strike-out application, the case must be re-pleaded to provide clarity of issues and claim.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that the Court will hear a case based on any reasonable grounds but will strike out a malicious prosecution tort if the issues involved were not ultimately found in the plaintiffs favour.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") applied to strike out Chesterfields Preschools Limited & Ors ("the plaintiffs") claim for damages for malicious prosecution of civil proceedings.

The plaintiffs are associated with David John Hampton and have been property-holding companies and operators of pre-schools involved in longstanding litigation with the Commissioner.

The malicious prosecution claimed by the plaintiffs related to liquidation proceedings and summary judgment proceedings against the plaintiffs.

#### _Strike-out application_

The Commissioner submitted that:

*   the liquidation proceedings were not resolved in favour of the plaintiffs;
*   the plaintiffs' claim that the liquidation proceedings were set aside is unsustainable;
*   each proceeding (save CIV-2000-409-803) was discontinued but in the context that the company had either accepted a liability and paid money or would do so;
*   it had withdrawn the CIV-2000-409-803 proceeding in light of doubt as to the nature and extent of the debt claimed, with the Commissioner paying a sum of money on account of costs;
*   a debt was due and owing and the winding-up of the relevant company was sought.

The plaintiffs opposed the Commissioner's application by alleging that:

*   Fogarty J's judgment in _Chesterfields Preschools_[1](#1)
     (judicial review) had, "by implication", set aside the liquidation proceedings; and
*   the summary judgment proceedings were permanently set aside by the judicial review proceeding and therefore resulted in favour of the plaintiffs.

At issue was whether the Court should strike out all or some of the causes of action advanced by the plaintiffs.

### Decision

After analysing the relevant principles[2](#2)
, submissions[3](#3)
 and case law[4](#4)
, his Honour Associate Judge Osborne found that the proceedings could not arguably amount to a determination in favour of the plaintiffs and that the only tenable claim was in one liquidation proceeding.

His Honour highlighted that there had been no judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and that each summary judgment proceeding remains adjourned[5](#5)
.

His Honour also found that debts were paid by the plaintiff to the Commissioner, (satisfactory arrangements were also made) and thus, the substantive outcome in each proceeding (save CIV-2000-409-803) was in favour of the Commissioner. Accordingly, seven of the eight proceedings were struck out.

Reference to the plaintiffs' statement of claim and its lack of clarity was also mentioned[6](#6)
:

*   There are paragraphs which by their nature do not lend themselves to a clear response by way of defence because separate and distinct facts are not stated separately and clearly as required by r 5.17(1).

Ultimately, the plaintiffs were ordered to:

*   file and serve (through a practising solicitor) an amended statement of claim in which the preserved cause of action is pleaded; or
*   if Mr Hampton is to continue to represent Chesterfields Preschools Limited, then he must file and serve a representation memorandum with a draft of the amended pleading.

Claim simply untenable
======================

2011 case note - Court had no jurisdiction to consider the family trust's claim, nor was it tenable - strike-out, abuse of court process, discretion.

Case

The Harsono Family Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994, Judicature Act 1908

### Summary

The Court had no jurisdiction to consider the Harsono Family Trust's ("HFT") claim, nor was it tenable. Furthermore, the claim brought by HFT against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue was found to be an abuse of process because HFT deliberately attempted to misconstrue the true nature of the payment.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms the well-settled principles relating to strike-out and abuse of process.

### Facts

Company F acquired a property at 45 Anzac Ave, Auckland, on 17 January 2001. On 15 July 2002 HFT purported to enter into a sale and purchase agreement to purchase the property for $1,100,000 plus goods and services tax (GST) ($137,500) while the property was already the subject of an existing sale and purchase agreement to another potential purchaser. On 2 August 2002, HFT paid $137,500 to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("Commissioner") as output tax on the sale.

The Commissioner paid a GST input credit of $137,500 to HFT on 28 January 2004. On 27 October 2005 the High Court found, inter alia, that the purported sale of the property to HFT was invalid. The Court also found that HFT had wrongly induced and procured the vendor to breach its previous sale contract with the potential purchaser and HFT was involved in an unlawful means conspiracy causing loss to that earlier potential purchaser. On 19 July 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed HFT's appeal against these findings.

Because the initial sale was invalid and was overturned, on 5 March 2007 the Commissioner issued a GST assessment which reversed the input tax credit issued in 2004. HFT then entered into the disputes and challenge proceedings as provided by Parts 4A and 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") to contest the reversal of the GST input tax credit.

On 14 May 2009, the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) confirmed the correctness of the assessment and found in favour of the Commissioner (case _Z16_). HFT then applied to have the TRA judgment recalled. On 5 August 2009 the TRA dismissed HFT's application for recall. The TRA held, inter alia, that HFT's recall application was "inconsistent with the objective of finality and certainty in litigation and is an abuse of process".

HFT then appealed the TRA's dismissal of the recall application in the High Court. On 15 September 2009, Venning J dismissed the appeal on the basis that there was no jurisdiction.

HFT persisted in its dissatisfaction with the Commissioner's assessment which reversed the $137,500 of input tax paid. On 16 March 2010, HFT issued civil proceedings against the Commissioner based on unjust enrichment, relief under section 94A of the Judicature Act 1908, money had and received, and restitution.

The Commissioner applied to strike out HFT's claim. The application was granted and HFT's claim was struck out on 21 March 2011 by virtue of the non-appearance of HFT or its legal representatives. HFT made an application to set aside that decision on the basis that the non-appearance was inadvertent. The Commissioner by consent agreed to set aside that decision. The strike-out application was then reheard by the District Court on 26 October 2011.

### Decision

**_Whether HFT's claim should be struck out_**  
Judge Wiltens first canvassed the requirements in the District Court Rules relating to strike-out, particularly Rule 2.50. A claim may be struck out if the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action; or is likely to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay; or is otherwise an abuse of process of the Court. Judge Wiltens also noted the well-settled criteria to be applied when deciding to strike out a cause of action, from _A-G v Prince and Gardner_ \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA).

The Commissioner submitted that by virtue of section 109 of the TAA, the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the assessments being challenged by HFT. The Commissioner also submitted that the claim was untenable and could not succeed as there were no valid grounds for HFT to dispute the assessment.

**_Whether the claim was tenable_**  
Judge Wiltens noted that section 165 of the TAA provides that any person who pays tax for, or on behalf of, any other person is entitled to recover that amount from that other person as a debt. HFT paid the output tax on 2 August 2002 on behalf of the then-registered proprietor. Therefore, HFT could claim this amount against the then-registered proprietor, not against the Commissioner.

Judge Wiltens concluded that HFT's claim was simply untenable.

**_Whether the claim was an abuse of process_**  
Judge Wiltens considered the law relating to abuse of process, particularly the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Felton v Johnson_ \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA). The Court considered carefully the submissions by HFT. HFT had tried to re-characterise its payment of GST output tax as "money" rather than "tax". Judge Wiltens found that this was "simplistic" and deliberately attempted to misconstrue the true nature of the payment.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

You must claim depreciation on assets kept in your business for longer than a year. These are capital expenses or [capital (fixed) assets](/api/glossary/item?id={810C33E8-6841-47BC-99CF-AFD6518D6F41})
.

Low value assets
----------------

You can claim an immediate tax deduction for low value assets, instead of claiming depreciation over the asset's life.

| Income year | Low value assets |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 16 March 2020 | Assets costing less than $500 |
| 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021 | Threshold increases temporarily to $5,000 |
| 17 March 2021 onwards | Threshold reset to $1,000 |

Pooling assets
--------------

You can group low value assets together and depreciate as a pool. Once you include assets in a pool, you cannot take them out. Pooled assets:

*   depreciate using the diminishing value method
*   must use the lowest depreciation rate from assets in the pool
*   cannot be buildings.

GST and depreciation
--------------------

If you're registered for GST, you claim depreciation on the price of the asset less the GST charged.

If you are not registered for GST, you claim depreciation on the total price of the asset, including GST.

Depreciation rates
------------------

Assets are depreciated at different rates. We set depreciation rates based on the cost and useful life of assets.

Depreciation methods
--------------------

There are 2 methods for depreciation. The total depreciation you can claim over an asset’s life is the same for both methods.

### The diminishing value method (DV)

This method depreciates at a high rate for the start of an asset's life and has a reducing rate each year.

[Work out diminishing value depreciation](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/claiming-depreciation/work-out-diminishing-value-depreciation)

### The straight line method (SL)

This method depreciates at the same rate each year.

[Work out straight line depreciation](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/claiming-depreciation/work-out-straight-line-depreciation)

You do not have to use the same method for all your assets. You can change methods at the end of each year. If you change methods, use the adjusted tax value to work out new depreciation.

Depreciation on buildings
-------------------------

Depreciation was allowed on most buildings until 2011. For the 2012 – 2020 income years, the depreciation rate for buildings with an estimated life of more than 50 years was set at 0%.

Changes reintroduced depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings for the 2021 – 2024 income years.

From the 2025 income year, the depreciation rate for non-residential buildings has returned to 0%.

Interpretation Statement (IS) 22/04 provides guidance to building owners on claiming depreciation on buildings. It considers the meaning of 'building' for depreciation purposes and the distinction between residential and non-residential buildings.

[Interpretation Statement (IS) 22/04 - Claiming depreciation on buildings (Tax Technical)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/2022/is-22-04)

Assets that do not depreciate
-----------------------------

Some assets do not depreciate including:

*   land
*   trading stock
*   franchise fees
*   intangible assets, like goodwill.

Claiming expenses on content creation income
============================================

You can deduct expenses from the income that you are taxed on. If you want to claim expenses, you’ll need to keep records of your expenses and income and understand what types of costs you can claim as an expense.

Common expenses
---------------

These are examples of expenses that are common across a range of businesses.

| Expense | More information |
| --- | --- |
| *   Home office expenses, such as rates, insurance, power and mortgage interest.<br>*   Phone and internet expenses. | [Using your home for your business](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/using-your-home-for-your-business) |
| *   Depreciation losses on equipment and other assets. | [Depreciation](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation) |
| *   Vehicle or travel expenses, if the content creation involves travel.  <br>    Home to work travel is not deductible, for example, if the creator has a studio or workspace that is not at home. | [Claiming vehicle expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/claiming-vehicle-expenses) |

[Types of business expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses)

Common expenses for content creators
------------------------------------

The following are examples of expenses that are more common for content creators.

### Fees and subscriptions

*   Professional fees, for example accounting or tax agent fees related to the content creation activity, and fees for creative services, for example fees for editing, design, or promotional work.
*   Subscriptions for online content or apps that content creators use for their activity.
*   Music licensing fees.

### Set-up costs

Some set-up costs such as computers, desks and chairs can be claimed as an expense. You may need to claim deprecation for these instead of claiming the full cost of the items.

### Content materials

*   The cost of buying games and expansion packs for professional gamers or content creators who feature the games in their content.
*   In-game micro-transactions for professional gamers or content creators, if these transactions are necessary to be competitive in deriving income from gaming or streaming.
*   The costs of materials, for example materials used in instructional videos.

Some expenses will not be deductible because they are private or domestic in nature, for example most clothing expenses. Private and domestic expenses are essentially living costs and costs associated with the home or family.

Deductibility 
--------------

Before you claim an expense as a deduction, consider how you incurred the expense.

*   Expenses must be incurred in earning income or carrying on a business for the purposes of earning income.
*   You can only claim an expense if you are the person who has incurred the expense.
*   Your income-earning activity must have started to be able to claim expenses - in other words your activity can generate your income. 
*   You can claim expenses even in years where your expenses are more than your income. However, there must still be an intention to make a profit.

### Expenses you cannot claim

*   Your personal or domestic expenses cannot be claimed as a deduction against your income. You may be able to claim part of an expense when it is used both in your income-earning activity and for personal use. For instance, if you have a home office you may be able to claim the part of your home expenses that relate to your content creation work.
*   You cannot deduct capital expenses such as cars. If they are used for your content creation income, you should depreciate the item. 
*   Deductions for expenses cannot be claimed if your business or income-earning activity has stopped, even if you continue to derive income from your old content.

Start of income-earning activity
--------------------------------

An income-earning activity usually starts when the activity can generate income for you. In some situations, there may be certain activities that need to happen before any income can be derived. For example, a person may need to establish a certain number of viewers or subscriptions before they can make money from their content. In this situation the income-earning activity has not yet begun.

Keeping records
---------------

You need to keep good records that support any expenses that you claim. We may request these as proof of the expense.

[Records of income and expenses](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping/records-of-income-and-expenses)

Example - Start of income earning activity

Li wants to be a professional online gamer and streamer like his friend Joshua. Li is an excellent gamer but does not derive amounts regularly from gaming and streaming activities. Before Li can start deriving regular amounts from competing or streaming, he'll need to do a few things, for example:

*   climbing the in-game ladder
*   competing in open tournaments
*   building their viewership.

However, Li is committed to giving it a go.

Li purchases the equipment he thinks he'll need to be competitive and wants to know whether he can deduct the costs from his income. In this case, Li cannot deduct the expenses from his income. Although it is not necessary for an activity to make a profit for expenses to be deducted from income, the income-earning activity must have started. Li might have an intention to make a profit one day like Joshua, but his income earning activity has not started.

Li is not yet making income because he is not deriving regular amounts from competing or streaming and is not in a position to do so. He has several steps to do before this will be possible.

Example - Private expenses

Ashley, a fashion commentator, is attending a fashion show. Ashley buys a new designer jacket to wear to the show, because being well dressed is essential to the success of their content.

The cost of the jacket is not deductible. Generally, the cost of clothing is private or domestic so is not deductible, even if a high standard of dress is required.

Ashley does not work from home, instead they rent space in an office to work from. Ashley therefore cannot claim their household bills as an expense. They can however claim expenses for the office they are renting.

If you're registered for [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
 you can claim the GST on expenses for goods and services. You can do this for goods and services used, or available for use, when you're renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})

| --- | --- |
| *   The whole property is rented out.<br>*   No private use. | *   You can claim GST for all your short-stay rental expenses. |
| *   The whole property is rented out (income-earning use) some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately for some of the time.<br>*   Vacant for 62 days or more. | *   You can claim GST on expenses based on the mixed-use asset rules before 1 April 2024.<br>*   For periods after 1 April 2024, you can use the mixed-use asset rules or another fair and reasonable method to apportion costs to reflect the extent of income-earning use of the property. |
| *   All the property is rented out (income-earning use) some of the time.<br>*   The property is used privately some of the time.<br>*   Not vacant for 62 days or more. | *   You can claim GST on expenses relating only to income-earning use.<br>*   Do not claim GST on private use expenses.<br>*   Split shared rental expenses based on a fair and reasonable method, for example the days the property was used and available for use. |
| *   Renting out a room.<br>*   Renting out part of a property. | *   You can claim GST on all expenses for income earning use.<br>*   Do not claim GST on private use expenses.<br>*   Split shared rental expenses based on a fair and reasonable method, for example the number of days the property was used and available for use. |

Claiming GST on the property purchase
-------------------------------------

You may also be able to get a GST input tax deduction for the purchase of your property (or claim some GST if you owned the property before you registered for GST and started renting out short-stay accommodation.).

Special rules apply for second-hand goods purchased from associated persons and those where the mixed-use asset rules apply. 

If you change the use of your property from taxable to exempt, or sell it, you must account for GST on disposal.

If you've bought goods from overseas, the supplier probably will not charge you GST unless they carry on a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
 in New Zealand.

When you import the goods, you'll likely be charged GST by Customs as they come into New Zealand. You can claim this amount back if you’re GST registered and are using the goods solely to make [taxable supplies](/api/glossary/item?id={07FA406A-D39C-4573-B445-274D0F443A3F})
.

Buying from non-registered suppliers
------------------------------------

If you buy goods or services from an unregistered person, they will not charge GST. This normally means you cannot claim GST on the purchase. For some special supplies, such as secondhand goods, you may still be able to claim a GST adjustment.

[Special supplies](/gst/charging-gst/special-supplies)

Adjusting your claim when supplies are put to both business and private use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can only claim GST on goods and services to the extent they’re used in your taxable activity to make taxable supplies. You cannot claim GST for supplies you use privately or to make exempt supplies.

There are 2 ways to adjust your claim, the apportionment method and the principal purpose method.

### Apportionment method

You’ll need to estimate and claim only the percentage of GST on the goods and services used for taxable activities.

Estimate a fair and reasonable percentage when you first get the goods or services.

You may need to keep an eye on the ongoing use of the goods and services. If the amount of use changes, you may need to make further adjustments if it’s different to your first estimate.

### Principal purpose method (for goods and services of $10,000 or less)

For goods and services $10,000 or less in value (excluding GST), generally apportioning the GST is not needed. The goods and services are either claimable or not claimable.

If the principal purpose of the good or service is for making taxable supplies, you can claim the full GST amount.

If making taxable supplies is not the principal purpose of the good or service, you cannot claim any GST.

You can carry on using the apportionment method if you choose not to use the principal purpose method.

Claims struck out for being filed out of time
=============================================

2014 case note - CIR has no authority to waive the timing requirements for a challenge being filed – response period.

Case

TRA 006/14 \[2014\] NZTRA 11; TRA 007/14 \[2014\] NZTRA 12

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputants' claims in relation to income tax assessments are struck out for being filed out of time. The disputants have 14 days to decide whether to pursue claims in respect of shortfall penalties.

### Impact of decision

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") has no authority to waive the timing requirements for a challenge being filed.

### Facts

The disputants are partners in a farming partnership. The disputants claim to have made an election in the 2009 year to cease valuing their herd using the herd scheme valuation method. However, the Commissioner has no record of an election being made in that year.

The Commissioner has assessed the disputants for additional income tax arising from the different valuation method used. The disputants challenged the Commissioner's assessments. This preliminary matter is about whether the disputants' Notices of Claim were filed in time.

On 21 March 2013, the Commissioner assessed the disputants for income tax for the year ended 31 March 2009 ("the income tax assessments").

On 23 March 2013, the Commissioner assessed the disputants for an unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty for the tax shortfall arising from the income tax assessments ("the shortfall penalty assessments").

On 23 May 2014, the disputants each filed a Notice of Claim in the Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA"). The Notices of Claim refer to disputable decisions made by the Commissioner on 23 March 2014, but appear to challenge only the income tax assessments made on 21 March 2014.

No application to commence a challenge out of time (under section 138D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) was made.

The Commissioner decided to bring the issue of timing to the TRA's attention on the basis that the Commissioner did not have the power to waive the statutory requirements in relation to when a challenge could be filed (see _Reckitt and Colman (New Zealand) Ltd v Taxation Board of Review_ \[1966\] NZLR 696 (SC); \[1966\] NZLR 1032 (CA)).

### Decision

The TRA held that although the income tax and shortfall penalty assessments arose from the same factual context, and the quantum of the shortfall penalty assessment related to the tax shortfall arising from the income tax assessment, the assessments were separate disputable decisions. Time limits applied from the date of issue of each Notice of Assessment (ie, 21 March 2014 for the income tax assessments and 23 March 2014 for the shortfall penalty assessments).

The TRA was satisfied that the challenges to the income tax assessments were filed out of time. In the absence of any applications to extend the time for filing a challenge, the challenges to the income tax assessments were struck out.

Although no particular mention was made of shortfall penalties in the Notices of Claim, there was sufficient mention of matters relating to the shortfall penalty assessments (ie, the 23 March 2014 date and letters dated 18 March 2014 that mention the shortfall penalties) for the Notices of Claim to apply to the shortfall penalty assessments. A challenge in respect of the shortfall penalty assessments was made in time.

The disputants have 14 days to advise the TRA whether they wish to proceed with the challenge to the shortfall penalty assessments only.

Clarification of "dividend" definition
======================================

2013 Act amends the definition of 'dividend' to make it clear certain transactions should not be treated as dividends for tax purposes. Applies from 1 Apr 2005.

_Sections CD29B and YA 1 (definition of "bonus issue") of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections CD 21BA and OB 1 (definition of "bonus issue") of the Income Tax Act 2004_

The definition of "dividend" has been amended to make it clear that certain transactions should not be treated as dividends for tax purposes. The changes do not involve a change in policy but clarify the policy intent for the specified transactions.

### Background

A dividend that is derived by a person is treated to be income. The current dividend definition is based on the policy that, in general, distributions from a company to a shareholder should be taxed if there is a transfer of value to the shareholder and the transfer is made in recognition of the shareholder's ownership interest in the company (instead of, for example, an employer/employee relationship between the company and shareholder).

Previously it was unclear whether certain transactions fell within the definition of "dividend". Amendments have therefore been made to clarify that certain transactions are not treated as dividends for tax purposes. The amendments do not involve a change in policy, nor do they imply that other arrangements fall within the dividend definition. The relevant transactions are described below: 

### _Rights issues_

Companies can offer their shareholders rights to buy new shares, generally at a discount to the market value.

Legislative changes have been made to make it clear that the discounted amount is not a taxable dividend for shareholders that exercise the right, and that the right itself (which has value and may in some cases be traded or renounced) is not a taxable dividend.

The policy rationale for ensuring that rights and discounted shares issued under a rights issue are not treated as dividends is that the company does not give up anything of value. A rights issue involves the company raising new equity when the shareholders invest new funds in the company.

### _Premiums paid under bookbuild arrangements_

Following a rights issue, a bookbuild can take place. A bookbuild involves the rights of non-participating shareholders (who chose not to participate or were not entitled to participate) being offered to other investors who pay a premium for them. The original shareholder is paid all or part of this premium for giving up their rights.

Legislative changes have been made to make it clear that premiums paid under bookbuilds are not dividends for tax purposes. From a policy perspective, a bookbuild should not be treated as a dividend because, like a rights issue, the company does not give up anything of value.

### _Share splits_

A share split involves a company diluting its shareholding whereby the shareholding proportions are retained but the shareholding is split into a greater number of shares.

The definition of "bonus issue" has been amended so that share splits that involve a subdivision of shares (that take place under the Companies Act 1993) can be excluded from the dividend definition. Previously, only bonus issues that involved the issue of new shares could be excluded from the definition of "dividend" for tax purposes. However, a subdivision of shares does not necessarily involve the issue of new shares.

From a policy perspective, a share split should not be treated as a taxable dividend because the company does not give up anything of value. Furthermore, in a subdivision of shares, the shareholder is generally not involved in a transaction with the company.

### Key features

Two key changes have been made.

New section CD 29B of the Income Tax Act 2007 and CD 21BA of the Income Tax Act 2004 ensure that:

*   under a rights issue, the discounted amount is not a taxable dividend for those shareholders that exercise the right;
*   under a rights issue, the right itself (which has value and may in some cases be traded or renounced) is not a taxable dividend;
*   premiums paid under bookbuilds are not dividends for tax purposes.

The legislative definition of "bonus issue" has also been amended to include not only the issue of new shares, but the subdivision of shares. The existing tax rules for taxable bonus issues and non-taxable bonus issues will then apply to subdivisions of shares.

### Application date

The changes apply from 1 April 2005. This is when the Income Tax Act 2004 (containing the dividend definition) came into effect. Similar changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007.

Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property
================================================================

2010 act confirms the fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings remains depreciable, and the meaning of 'plant' and 'building' under the tax depreciation rules.

_Sections DB 65, EE 47(2) and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings remains depreciable. The changes also clarify the meaning of "plant" and "building" for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules. A transitional rule has been included, allowing certain building owners to claim a deduction for an amount of building fit-out embedded in the tax book value of their building.

A key goal of the tax system, including the depreciation rules, is to tax different forms of investment as neutrally as possible to avoid distorting investment decisions. There are strong grounds, therefore, for depreciation rates to mirror economic depreciation (how assets fall in market value through time) as closely as possible. In this context, a distinction between the tax treatment of residential and non-residential building fit-out is justified on the grounds that building fit-out is likely to constitute a greater portion of the value of non-residential buildings than it is for residential buildings. Generally, non-residential fit-out is also less permanent than residential fit-out because of tenant-specific requirements and changes of use.

The new rules ensure that the fit-out of a non-residential premises remains depreciable property. The fit-out of residential premises remains generally non-depreciable. This is in line with the Commissioner's recently released interpretation statement, IS 10/01 "Residential rental properties - depreciation of items of depreciable property".

The depreciation treatment of fit-out in a building that has both residential and non-residential premises is determined by the dominant purpose of the building. If the dominant purpose of the building is non-residential, items that are shared for both purposes will be depreciable as commercial fit-out. If the dominant purpose of the building is one of providing private residential accommodation, the items of shared fit-out generally will be non-depreciable.

A consequential change has been made to clarify that the change-of-use rules are triggered when the dominant purpose of a building or premises changes between residential and non-residential purposes.

A transitional rule has also been introduced to enable certain building owners to claim a deduction for building fit-out that is embedded in the value of their building and when the building depreciation rate has been set at 0% as a consequence of Budget 2010.

### Background

Following changes to the tax treatment of buildings in Budget 2010, it was considered timely for a review of the depreciation rules around fit-outs of commercial and industrial buildings.

The review was intended to bring greater clarity on the distinction between a building and building fit-out in the depreciation rules, given:

*   The release of interpretation statement, IS 10/01, "Residential rental properties - depreciation of items of depreciable property", that discusses items that are part of a residential building. While the statement only applies to residential buildings, many of the principles are also likely to apply to commercial and industrial buildings.
*   It may be uncertain when taxpayers can choose to apply depreciation rates that differ from the rate that applies to a non-residential building, particularly when in the residential context the Commissioner's view is that many of these items will be part of the building.

### Application date

The changes apply from the 2011-12 and later income years.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Definition of "building"_

The definition of "building", in subpart YA 1, has been amended for the purpose of the tax depreciation rules. The change is intended to ensure that the value of items of commercial fit-out do not form part of the value of a building for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules. The amended definition of building means that a building does not include commercial fit-out for the purposes of subparts EE and EZ.

#### _Definition of "commercial fit-out"_

A definition of "commercial fit-out" has been introduced in subpart YA 1. The definition clarifies that plant attached to a commercial building is generally an item of commercial fit-out and therefore can be depreciated separately from the building. An exception is when the item of plant is used inside a dwelling within the commercial building. The intention is for plant to be depreciable unless the item is used in residential premises.

The second limb of the definition of commercial fit-out is intended to exclude items holding up the building or used to weather-proof the building ("building core") from being a commercial fit-out. This makes the building core of certain buildings non-depreciable. For a building with an estimated life of 50 years or more, the non-depreciable building core includes foundations, the building frame, floors, external walls, cladding, windows, external doors, internal stairways, the roof and load-bearing structures associated with the building such as pillars and load-bearing internal walls. Further, under the new definition of commercial fit-out, items attached to the building used within residential premises are not commercial fit-out. However, attached items used in relation to a residential dwelling are commercial fit-out if the building is a commercial building.

#### _Definition of "commercial building"_

A definition of "commercial building" has been inserted in section YA 1. The definition is important to the definition of "commercial fit-out". A commercial building is one where the main use is for non-residential premises and any residential premises within the building are of a secondary and minor use. In most instances it will be obvious whether the main use of a building is to provide residential premises. However, if it is not clear what the main use of a building is, taxpayers will need to take a position based on their particular circumstances. One method for determining the building's main use could be to compare the area of the building that is used or set aside exclusively for residential accommodation with the remaining area of the building. In making this assessment, the taxpayer would need to consider how to allocate the shared areas (for example, lobbies, hallways and entranceways that commercial and residential tenants can normally access). If commercial and residential tenants have equal access to shared areas, one approach would be to count the shared areas as appurtenant to the residential accommodation and again as part of the rest of the building. However, in working out the most appropriate apportionment approach the particular circumstances of each building will be important.

The definition of "commercial building" helps to define the boundary for the tax treatment of items of fit-out that are used for both commercial and residential purposes ("shared fit-out"). The dominant purpose of the building determines the tax treatment of items of shared fit-out, as illustrated by the following examples.

**Example 1**

If the dominant or main purpose of a building is commercial, items of shared fit-out will be depreciable as commercial fit-out. For example, most of the floor area of a building is occupied by commercial tenants but the top floor has a residential apartment. The shared items of fit-out, such as electrical cabling, fire protection equipment, sewerage and water reticulation, and the fit-out of lobbies that are not part of the residential premises are depreciable. However, the fit-out within the apartment is generally not depreciable property, as per the Commissioner's interpretation statement IS10/01.

**Example 2**

Most of the floor area of a building is used for residential purposes. The remainder is used for commercial purposes. Items of fit-out in the building that are used as a café and residential purposes will be mainly non-depreciable - as in the Commissioner's interpretation statement IS10/01. However, the fit-out of the café within the building will be depreciable as commercial fit-out because it is not used in relation to, and is not part of, a dwelling.

#### _Definition of "plant"_

Plant does not include an item that is structural in relation to a building. This definition has been introduced in section YA 1 to clarify that if an item, or part of an item, of plant is integrated into the structure of a building then the item or part of the item will be non-depreciable if the building has an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Without this definition, it would be possible to argue that parts of a building's structure are also within the meaning of "commercial fit-out", as they are items of plant, and therefore depreciable.

Items holding up the building or used to weather-proof the building are non-depreciable if the building has an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. In certain buildings some of these items may be specially constructed or strengthened to support, for instance, an item of plant. The definition of "plant" ensures for example, that a lift shaft is not treated as being part of the lift, as lifts are depreciable property and have an estimated useful life of 25 years. The definition of plant makes it clear that the estimated useful life of a lift shaft is not 25 years, but is the estimated useful life of the associated building or structure.

#### _Change of use_

In the unlikely event that a building changes its dominant use, section EE 47 has been amended to clarify that the normal depreciation change-of-use rules apply to the items of shared fit-out. Thus, if the dominant purpose of a building changes from commercial to residential, the items of shared fit-out will be deemed to have been disposed of at their market value. The reverse applies when the dominant purpose of a building changes from residential to commercial. That is, the items of shared fit-out will be deemed to have been acquired for their market value. In these instances the normal depreciation recovery or loss-on-disposal rules apply to the items of shared fit-out. In this instance the change of use is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year. Therefore, taxpayers need to have a view on the dominant use of their building throughout the income year.

#### _Definition of "dwelling"_

A definition of "dwelling" has been added to section YA 1 to help set the boundary between commercial and residential premises. The first limb of the definition is very broad and means any place used predominantly as a place of residence or abode. However, paragraph (b) of the definition excludes certain premises and types of activities that are more commercial in nature and the fit-out of these premises is more likely to depreciate when used in an income earning process. The new rules recognise that there are commercial buildings that provide residential-type accommodation by excluding a number of these types of buildings from the meaning of "dwelling". This ensures that fit-outs associated with these buildings will continue to be depreciable. The types of buildings that are specifically excluded from the meaning of "dwelling" are:

*   hospitals;
*   hotels, motels, inns, hostels, or boarding houses;
*   certain serviced apartments, where additional services are provided and where the resident does not have quiet enjoyment;
*   convalescent homes, nursing homes, or hospices;
*   rest homes or retirement villages, except places that are characterised as places of residence for independent living; and
*   camping grounds.

#### _Definition of "independent living"_

A definition of "independent living" has also been included in section YA 1. In relation to rest homes and retirement villages a distinction has been drawn between serviced apartments and premises that provide residents with independent living arrangements. Fit-out associated with rest homes, hospitals, community centres and serviced apartments will generally continue to be depreciable whereas fit-out associated with premises that provide for independent living will generally be non-depreciable. Serviced apartments are generally distinguishable from premises providing for independent living because the occupancy arrangements typically require the resident to purchase a bundle of care services (such as medical supplies, nursing care, meals, cleaning, provision of linen and laundry) in addition to a right of occupancy in order to be entitled to occupy the premises. In this situation, the fit-out of the serviced apartment will continue to be depreciable property. However, if the only compulsory services supplied to the resident are merely incidental to the occupancy (such as gardening, maintenance, management and security services) the fit-out of the serviced apartment will not be depreciable.

#### _Transitional rule_

A transitional rule, new section DB 65, allows a deduction for building fit-out that is embedded in the tax book value of certain buildings. The transitional rule applies to building owners that acquired a commercial building in the 2010-11 or earlier income years and who have not itemised the items of commercial building fit-out, acquired at the same time as the building, separately from the building in their tax asset register. Any subsequent commercial fit-out acquired and separately depreciated after the date that the building was acquired reduces the amount of the deduction allowed under section DB 65.

The amount of the deduction is the lesser of 2% of the starting pool value or the residual value of the pool - taking into account all previous deductions taken under this provision. The opening value of the pool is 15% of the building's adjusted tax book at the end of the 2010-11 income year less the adjusted tax book value, at the end of the 2010-11 income year, of any fit-out associated with the building that has been separately depreciated for income tax purposes.

**Example**

Company ABC acquired a warehouse on 1 April 1999 for $1 million. Items of commercial fit-out within the building were not separately identified and depreciated at the time the building was acquired. Twelve months later a refurbishment of the warehouse was completed. The refurbishment was itemised and depreciation was applied to the various items of commercial fit-out.

At the end of the 2010-11 income year the adjusted tax book value of the warehouse is $640,000 and the adjusted tax book value of the associated commercial fit-out is $64,000.

The starting pool value is:

*   (15% × 640,000) − 64,000 = $32,000

The annual deduction, assuming that the building is held for the 2011-12 income year is:

*   $32,000 × 2% × 12/12 = $640

To reduce complexity and compliance costs there are no loss or recovery rules applying to the value of the pool when the relevant building or fit-out is disposed of. In the above example, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction of up to $640 a year provided they own the commercial building. However, if the dominant purpose of a building changes from commercial to residential, no deduction is allowed under section DB 65, as subsection (1)(a) no longer applies to the building. However, the deductions would begin again if the building subsequently reverts to being a commercial building - provided the building ownership has been maintained.

Clarifying the acquisition date of land
=======================================

2014 legislation clarifies land provisions in the Income Tax Act and the time at which land is considered to have been acquired for tax purposes.

#### _Section CB 15B of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The land provisions contained in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to clarify the time at which land is considered to have been acquired for tax purposes.

### Background

New section CB 15B clarifies the acquisition date of land for the purposes of the land disposal provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, in particular section CB 6, which has caused considerable uncertainty for taxpayers, their agents and Inland Revenue.

Section CB 6 deals with land acquired for the purpose of, or with the intention of, disposal and the taxation of income derived from disposing of the land. If a taxpayer acquires the land with the intention or purpose of disposal and subsequently disposes of the land, any profit made is taxable.

Uncertainty arose around the timing of when the taxpayer's intention or purpose should be determined. The Courts held that "intention" or "purpose" should be tested when a taxpayer has acquired the land in question (known as the date of acquisition). However, because the definition of "land" in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes estates and interests in land, and the taxpayer acquires different interests and estates in "land" at different times under a typical sale and purchase agreement (which are then merged when the title is registered), neither the legislation nor common law provided sufficient clarity over which interest in "land" the date of acquisition should apply to.

To address this uncertainty, as part of Budget 2013, officials released the issues paper _Clarifying the acquisition date of land_. The issues paper discussed two possible interpretations of the provisions. It concluded that the "first interest" interpretation whereby the date of acquisition is the date when the first equitable or legal interest in land arises in a sale and purchase agreement (typically in the early phases of a sale and purchase agreement), would provide greater certainty and be more economically efficient. This interpretation also more closely reflected the policy underlying this provision when it was first introduced in the late 1800s (that is, to target property speculators), as it is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property. It would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought at the time of acquisition that it was likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable.

The new legislation is intended to provide taxpayers with greater certainty about the timing of land acquisition for tax purposes.

### Key features

New section CB 15B is a general rule for subpart CB (income derived from land) and provides that the date a person acquires land is the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest or option in that land.

There are two exceptions to this general rule.

The first exception, contained in subsection CB 15B(2), provides that if a person on behalf of a company (that is yet to be formed) enters into an agreement whereby the company will eventually have the land, the purpose and intention of the person is imputed on the company as if the company existed at the time of entering into the agreement.

The second exception contained in subsection CB 15B(3) provides that if a person has an estate or interest in land, and subsequently as a consequence of the person exercising an option obtains a new estate or interest in the same land, the person is treated as acquiring this new estate or interest from the time this person exercised the option.

New subsection CB 15B(4) provides that the timing provided for in new section CB 15B is overridden by any timing provided for in subpart FB or FC (which relates to transfers of property).

### Detailed analysis

#### _General rule of when land is acquired_

New section CB 15B(1) provides that a person acquires land at the beginning of a period in which the person has an estate or interest or option in that land. Practically, this means that the date the taxpayer's purpose or intention is tested for the land sale provisions, will be the date a binding agreement is entered into.

Indicative characteristics of the date a binding agreement is entered into (that is, the agreement has no conditions precedent, but the vendor and the purchaser intend to be bound by the terms of the contract even if there are conditions subsequent that have to be fulfilled) are:

*   the date a binding sale and purchase agreement has been signed and executed by both the vendor or purchaser (including nominees or agents); or
*   the "Date" indicated on a binding sale and purchase agreement, which is then subsequently signed by the parties to the agreement; or
*   the date a binding oral agreement for the disposal of land was agreed to by the parties, which has then been subsequently actioned by part performance of the agreement and if required later, evidenced by a memorandum.

As noted above, the policy underlying the general rule is the "first interest" principle, whereby the date of acquisition is the date when the first equitable or legal interest in land arises in a sale and purchase agreement, as typically it is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property.

#### _Exceptions to the general rule of when land is acquired  
Acquisition of land by company yet to be formed_

One exception to the general rule clarifies when a person, on behalf of a company that is yet to be formed enters into an agreement whereby the company will have the land, the purpose and intention of the person is imputed on the company as if the company existed at the time of entering into the agreement.

The purpose of this exception is to ensure that new section CB 15B is not circumvented on the basis that the company did not have the requisite purpose or intention as they did not exist at the time that the nominator, transferor or assignor entered into an agreement for the land. This is despite the nominator, transferor or the assignor having some form of decision-making authority to form the company or decision-making authority once the company is formed.

#### _Further land from the exercise of an option_

Another exception to the general rule provides that where a person has a previous (first) interest in land, and exercises an option that is related to that land, the person has entered into a new acquisition and sections CB 6 and CB 15B should be applied, as if the previous interest did not exist.

This situation is only likely to occur when there is an option to exercise a right to acquire another estate or interest in land.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| *   Brian has an unregistered leasehold in land with a "first right" option to acquire the fee simple estate if it is disposed of by the lessor, April.<br>*   April decides to sell the estate in fee simple and offers the land to Brian according to the terms of the lease agreement.<br>*   Brian agrees to exercise the option to acquire the estate in fee simple. |     |

In this example Brian has a number of interests and estates - the leasehold land, the option and once the option is exercised, a contingent equitable interest in the land that eventually merges into an estate in fee simple. Without this subsection, Brian's intention or purpose is only tested when he acquires the unregistered leasehold interest. However because an unregistered leasehold interest does not merge into the legal estate in fee simple, if Brian had the intention to acquire the estate in fee simple to dispose of it, and Brian disposes of the estate in fee simple, any gain Brian makes from this disposal falls outside the ambit of section CB 6. This is because when Brian acquired (the leasehold) he did not have the intention to dispose of the leasehold, despite making another active decision to exercise the option and acquire the estate that is eventually disposed of.

This outcome is not consistent with the underlying policy intent of section CB 6 or the first interest principle, as Brian has made another active decision to enter into an agreement to acquire the estate in fee simple. The new subsection therefore treats the subsequent acquisition as a separate acquisition of land, and Brian's intention or purpose should be tested at this time (when he exercises the option). As stated in the officials' issues paper:[1](#01)
  
 

*   ...the policy intent of section CB 6 is to capture property speculators, arguably the most appropriate time to assess a taxpayer's intention and purpose should be when a person decides to enter into a sale and purchase agreement. **It is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property.** It would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought it very likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable.  
    \[Emphasis added\]

The example described above is distinct from the situation when a person just has an option to acquire land but no other previous interest in land. As described in the officials' issues paper, the appropriate time to test their intention or purpose in relation to the option is when the option is granted.

### Application date

New section CB 15B applies to disposals of land from 22 November 2013, the date the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced. Therefore, section CB 15B can be applied retrospectively to land acquired before the 22 November 2013, as long as this land has not yet been disposed of.

For land that has been disposed of, the Commissioner's current interpretation of section CB 6 still applies (that is, the disposal interpretation - where the date of acquisition is determined by the "land" that is disposed of, usually at the later stages of a sale and purchase agreement).

Although the officials' issues paper acknowledged that the "first interest" interpretation is the preferred tax policy interpretation, the current interpretation is not a totally unreasonable interpretation that it is warranted for the Commissioner to "unwind" previous positions taken by both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue when the land has already been disposed.

Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008
==============================================================

2008 emissions trading amendment covers income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 (Climate Change Act) has the principal purpose of amending the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in New Zealand. However, the Climate Change Act also includes amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units. These amendments are the subject of this article.

This article also includes subsequent amendments to the Inland Revenue administered Acts.

_Sections CB 29, CW 3B, CX 44F, DB 46, DB 47, EB 2(3)(ah), ED 1(5B), EW 5(3B), GD 16 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004_

_Sections CB 36, CW 3B, CX 48B, DB 60, DB 61, EB 2(3)(i), ED 1(8B), EW 5(3B), GC 4B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

_Sections 2(1), 11(1)(n), 11A(1)(s), (t), (u) and (v) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

### Background

The Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable Preference) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 4 December 2007. It received its first reading on 11 December 2007 and its second reading on 28 August 2008. The provisions dealing with amendments to the GST Act were introduced by Supplementary Order Paper 231 at the Committee stage of proceedings. The resulting Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 and the Electricity (Renewable Preference) Amendment Act 2008 received Royal assent on 25 September 2008.

The Climate Change Act amends the Climate Change Response Act 2002, inserting provisions under which:

*   businesses in certain sectors will be required to surrender emissions units based on their actual emissions, or emissions treated as being made as a consequence of their activities
*   the government may allocate emissions units to businesses in certain sectors.

Amendments to income tax legislation are required to ensure that the income tax treatment of emissions units is clear, and that income and expenditure are recognised for income tax purposes in a way which is consistent with the objectives of the emissions trading scheme and the income tax system.

Amendments to GST legislation have been made to ensure that GST compliance impacts are minimised and to facilitate the trading of emissions units on international markets.

### Key features

Income tax legislation has been amended to provide for the tax consequences of transactions in emissions units related to forestry businesses. The main features of the changes are:

*   emissions units are ordinarily treated as being on revenue account
*   emissions units are treated as excepted financial arrangements, so are valued using a cost basis methodology
*   the cash basis of taxation, which generally applies to transactions entered into by forestry businesses, also applies to emissions unit transactions entered into by forestry businesses
*   while the ordinary rule of revenue account treatment applies to transactions relating to post-1989 forest land (including the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative), emissions units transactions relating to pre-1990 forest land are an exception from the general rule and are generally treated as being on capital account
*   capital account treatment applies where an allocation is made to an interim entity pending a Treaty of Waitangi settlement and then the units are eventually transferred to the ultimate owner following a Settlement in relation to pre 1990 forestry land
*   units allocated for an expected drop in fishing quotas capital value will be on capital account
*   the transfer of units will be at market value except for certain specific circumstances
*   any transfer in accordance with a forestry rights agreement (registered under the Forest Rights Registration Act 1983) at market value will not trigger a tax liability
*   transactions relating to emissions units are zero-rated for GST purposes.

The legislative changes apply only to emissions units which are New Zealand units, Kyoto units and units issued by overseas registries that can be transferred into an account in the New Zealand registry. They do not apply to voluntary or "unofficial" emissions units, which remain subject to ordinary income tax and GST rules.

### Application date

The income tax changes generally apply from 26 September 2008. The GST changes generally apply from 1 January 2009.

### Detailed analysis

#### Income tax valuation methodology

The legislation treats emissions units as excepted financial arrangements. Accordingly, either the first-in first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost valuation methods apply. There is no requirement to revalue emissions units if their market changes.

#### Income tax treatment of emissions unit transactions relating to post-1989 forestry

Emissions unit transactions relating to post-1989 forest land (including the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative) follow ordinary principles and are treated as being on revenue account. While the underlying concepts are that the acquisition of emissions units is deductible, and their disposal is assessable, the application of the cash basis of taxation, and detailed timing and matching rules mean that each transaction must be considered against the applicable legislation.

The treatment of each common transaction is as follows (statutory references are to the Income Tax Act 2007):

*   no taxable income arises on the allocation of units to the forestry business by the government (CX 48B.
*   a tax liability arises on the sale of government-allocated units. The taxable amount will be the entire proceeds of the sale, because these units have no direct costs (indirect costs have already been deducted) (CB 36)
*   where units are purchased to replace units previously sold ("replacement ETS units"), an income tax deduction is available (DB 60(3) and ED 1(8B))
*   where "additional" units are purchased, no income tax deduction will be available if those units are still held at the end of the tax year (ED 1)
*   no income tax deduction arises when a deforestation liability arises (principles of cash basis taxation method)
*   no income tax deduction arises when government-allocated units are surrendered (ED 1)
*   no income tax deduction arises when replacement ETS units are surrendered (the deduction was already given on their purchase) (CB 36(3) and ED 1(8B))  
    an income tax deduction is available when additional units purchased are surrendered (CB 36(3) and ED 1).

**Example - post-1989 forest land**

  

1 April 2009 - ABC Forestry Ltd is awarded 100 emissions units for carbon capture in its post-1989 forest. The market value of the units is $30 each.  
_No tax consequences arise._

30 June 2009 - ABC sells 10 units for $35 each.  
_ABC is taxable on $350 in the year of sale. No deduction is given against the sale proceeds as there is no cost base._

15 August 2009 - ABC purchases 20 units for $32 each.  
_An income tax deduction in the year of purchase is available for 10 of these units, which can be treated as "replacement ETS units". No income tax deduction is available for the 10 "additional" units, which sit in ABC's books at year end at their cost of $320 - the deduction for the additional units arises when the units are surrendered or disposed of._

30 November 2009 - ABC harvests the forest.  
_No tax consequences arise._

30 April 2010 - ABC transfers 100 units to the government to discharge its harvest liability to surrender units.  
_No tax consequences arise._

5 May 2010 - ABC sells the remaining 10 units for $38 each.  
_ABC has net income of ($38 minus $32) multiplied by 10 = $60, arising in the year of sale._

(Example assumes FIFO valuation method applied).

#### Income tax treatment of emissions unit transactions relating to pre-1990 forestry

Emissions unit transactions relating to pre-1990 forestry are generally treated as being on capital account, which means that no income tax liabilities arise from, and no income tax deductions are created by, these transactions. Specifically:

*   no taxable income arises on the receipt of "free" units from the government (CW 3B(2))
*   no taxable income arises if any of those "free" units are sold (CW 3B(3))
*   no income tax deduction arises if additional units are purchased to satisfy a deforestation liability, or where units are purchased in excess of any potential liability and remain held at the end of the year (ED 1)
*   no income tax deduction arises when a deforestation liability arises (principles of cash basis taxation method)
*   no income tax deduction arises when units are surrendered to the government to meet a deforestation liability (CB 36(5)).

The capital account treatment applies only to transactions in emissions units which are related to pre-1990 forestry land. If a business which owns pre-1990 forest land purchases emissions units and later sells them, any gain will be taxable and any loss will be deductible, as they would be for a business which did not own pre-1990 forest land (CB 36(2)).

There is an exception to capital account treatment. Certain businesses, such as property developers and land traders, will hold pre-1990 forest land on revenue account. Emissions unit transactions carried out by such businesses in relation to pre-1990 forest land will be on revenue account. Their treatment will generally be the same as transactions relating to post-1989 forest land, described above (CB 36(4)(b) and CW 3B(3)).

**Example - pre-1990 forest land**

  

1 April 2009 - The government allocates DE Forestry Ltd 100 emissions units in relation to pre-1990 forest land that it owns. The market value of the units is $30 each.  
_No tax consequences arise._

30 June 2009 - DEF sells 10 units for $35 each.  
_No tax consequences arise._

15 August 2009 - DEF purchases 1,410 units for $32 each.  
_No tax consequences arise._

30 November 2009 - DEF fells forest and converts land to dairy farm.  
_No tax consequences arise._

30 April 2010 - DEF transfers 1,000 emissions units to the government to discharge deforestation liability.  
_No tax consequences arise._

5 May 2010 - DEF sells remaining 500 emissions units for $35.  
_DEF is taxable on ($35-$32) x 500 = $1,500._

(Example assumes FIFO valuation method applied).

### GST treatment of emissions unit transactions

The supply of emissions units (other than "unofficial" emissions units) is zero-rated. Under zero-rating, emissions units are treated as being subject to GST for the purposes of measuring taxable supplies made by businesses. However, the amount of GST actually charged and so the GST to be accounted for by both transferor and transferee is nil.

Transactions that are supplies of emissions units and that are zero-rated include (section references are to the GST Act):

*   the allocation of emissions units by the government to a business (11A(1)(s))
*   the surrender of emissions units by a business to the government (11A(1)(t))
*   the sale of emissions units by a business, whether to a buyer in New Zealand or overseas (11A(1)(v))
*   the purchase of emissions units by a business from the government (11A(1)(v))
*   the purchase of emissions units by a business from another business, whether the selling business is in New Zealand or is overseas (11A(1)(v)).

When emissions units are awarded by the government to a business, without a cash payment being made by the business, any actual supply which the business makes in exchange for those units, or is deemed to make in accordance with the GST Act, will also be zero-rated (11A(1)(u)).

When the transaction is one where an express monetary price has been agreed for the units, then the value of that supply will be the price agreed for the units.

When the transaction is one where the government supplies emissions units, and an actual or deemed supply is made in exchange for that supply of emissions units, the value of both supplies is the market value of the emissions units.

**Example - GST**

  

1 April 2009 - ABC Forestry Ltd is awarded 100 emissions units for carbon capture in its post-1989 forest. The market value of the units is $30 each.  
_The government makes a taxable supply of emissions units valued at $3,000 to ABC. ABC makes a supply of services to the government valued at $3,000. Both supplies are zero-rated so no input tax or output tax arises for either party on either transaction._

30 June 2009 - ABC sells 10 units for $35 each.  
_ABC makes a taxable supply of $350. The supply is zero-rated so no output tax is payable by ABC and the purchaser cannot claim any input tax._

15 August 2009 - ABC purchases 20 units for $32 each.  
_ABC receives a taxable supply of $640, but the supply is zero-rated so no input tax can be claimed._

30 April 2010 - ABC transfers 100 units to the government to discharge the liability to surrender emissions units which arose on harvesting the forest in November 2009.  
_ABC makes a taxable supply of emissions units, but it is zero-rated and so no output tax is payable._

This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA 2 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15 June 2022 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Closure of the transformation programme Introduction 1. On 7 April 2022, the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee (GOV) authorised you to confirm the closure of the transformation programme by 30 June 2022 (GOV-22-MIN-0004 refers). This report provides you with an update on our progress with completing remaining work and seeks your approval to close the programme. 2. Since we last reported to you (IR2022/096 refers), transformation’s Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status has improved to Green overall, as shown in the table below. The status of all ten reporting keys has improved to Green as the programme completes its remaining deliverables. Note: The previous status shown is as at February 2022 when we last reported the RAG status of the programme to you. 3. The programme was delivered on time, under budget with savings of $464 million (including depreciation and capital charge) being generated over the 10 year period ending 30 June 2024, and has achieved its investment objectives. The programme has delivered a modern, digital revenue system 4. Transformation has involved changes to every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates, including policy settings, processes, our operating model and people capabilities, and technology. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. 5. From 2017 to 2021, in six releases across four stages, we successfully moved all the products we administer to new systems and processes, improving the services available to customers. 6. Customers now have online services for all products, making it easy for them to see and track their tax and social policy affairs. All their information is in one place in their myIR account, which is robust, reliable, and available when they need to use it. Most individuals and families now only need to check the information we hold about them. Routine transactions such as these have been automated and moved online, freeing us up to help support customers with more complex circumstances. 7. As each release went live, a comprehensive programme of policy changes was introduced to help simplify things for customers and improve the administration of products. The Bill containing the first changes related to transformation was enacted 3 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] on 2 June 2016 and the Bill containing the final transformation-related changes was enacted on 30 March 2021. Changes to policy settings provided the foundation for some fundamental and far-reaching changes, such as the introduction of automatic issuing of end-of -year income tax assessments for individuals. 8. The information we hold is more accurate and near real time. We are better able to analyse data from multiple sources and act on it due to the significant investment made in analytics. We can now respond far more quickly to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. Checks now happen at the time of a transaction, so errors, whether accidental or deliberate, are picked up at the earliest opportunity. This is reducing the need for later debt collection or audit work. For example, we stopped approximately 13 5,000 applications for the resurgence support payment and a further 168,000 were referred to one of our compliance experts to review. Without transformation, it would simply not have been possible for us to check this volume of applications and make payments to customers quickly. 9. We now partner with a much wider variety of organisations and make more of the information we hold readily available to them, with appropriate security permissions in place. For example, we work with the software industry to enable businesses to use their own systems to meet their tax obligations. Businesses can now choose to work out and pay tax as a by-product of normal business processes, rather than calculating and paying it separately. 10. For the first time, we have a single, end-to-end view of our customers. This makes it much it easier to support customers and for new products to be added at a considerably lower cost and effort than before. This is because common processes that all products use, such as registration, payments, and myIR access, are already in place. 11. The speed with which we were able to make new products available in response to COVID-19 and our ability to look at risk on a customer-by -customer basis shows what can now be done. The Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme, the Resurgence Support Payment and the COVID-19 Support Payment were available to customers within weeks, with funds in their account within days of a successful application. 12. We have completely simplified our technology with most of our services now supplied and supported by trusted partners and vendors. The buy rather than build approach is now well ingrained and our technology team focuses on managing our vendors and their service levels 13. Mobile workplace technology has meant we could keep providing services during several significant disruptions in recent years, including the Kaikoura earthquake, long-term building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. 14. Our new organisation design is centred around customers and their needs. Management layers have been streamlined to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. Devolved decision making is empowering our customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. 15. The investment made in transformation has created the capabilities that are enabling us to operate successfully in the digital age. The programme came in under budget 16. The forecast total capital and operating spend for transformation will be approximately $1,641 million over the 10 years from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024, with an approximately further $450 million for depreciation and capital charge over the same period. 4 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 17. This results in generated forecast programme savings of $250 million (13%) across capital and operating expenditure and $214 million (32%) for depreciation and capital charge as shown in the tables below. The combined forecast savings generated over the 10-year period ending 30 June 2024 are therefore approximately $464 million (18%). 18. Of the total generated savings, $441 million was handed back to the Crown and nearly $23 million repurposed by Cabinet for other priority spending in Inland Revenue. Table 1: Total forecast capital and operating expenditure 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024 ($ million) Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Self- funding increase 1 Total savings generated Forecast Savings repurposed by Cabinet Total savings returned to Crown Capital 484 613 (129) (21) (150) 23 (127) Operating 1,157 1,257 (100) - (100) - (100) Total 1,641 1,870 (229) (21) (250) 23 (227) Table 2: Total forecast depreciation and capital charge 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024 ($ million) Total spend Forecast Approved funding Budget Forecast underspend Forecast Depreciation 304 443 (130) Capital charge 146 221 (75) Total 450 664 (214) 19. The savings will increase once final costs are known. 20. As part of the Budget 2022 technical initiatives process, $35 million in operating expenditure was transferred to 2022/23 and 2023/24 for residual activities that were unable to be completed due to COVID-19 priorities. We are self-funding the capital costs for these activities of $21 million. Both the capital and operating amounts for the residual activities have been included in table 1 above, showing the total transformation capital and operating expenditure. 21. In addition to generating significant programme savings, we also fulfilled our business case commitment to self-fund a significant portion of the programme spend. We self- funded 47% of the capital and operating costs (target commitment 40%-50%). We also contributed 90% of the depreciation and capital charge funding (business case modelled a minimum contribution of 56%). The intended outcomes have been achieved 22. Achievement of the investment objectives for the programme is measured against a number of lead and lag indicators shown in the annex. Results for the 2021/22 year are not yet available. 23. For the 2020/21 year, we achieved seven out of the ten indicators for which there are quantitative measures. The measures not achieved were: • The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply. While this is increasing, this measure is tracking up more slowly than expected. Notwithstanding the significant changes introduced since 2017, 82% of customers say they find it easy to comply. 1 Inland Revenue increased its internal capital contribution by self-funding the capital for the residual activities ($21 million). This freed-up an equivalent amount of externally funded capital which has been returned to the Crown. Total capital and operating savings therefore increased from $229 million to $250 million. 5 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Reduction in compliance time for SMEs. The target for 2020/21 was not achieved, with a saving of 5 hours compared to a target of 15 hours. It appears that COVID- 19 and payday filing are having an impact. However, the cumulative value of the time saved is above target. We recognise that achieving the targeted time savings by 2023/24 will be challenging, and that an on-going focus on reducing effort for SMEs will be required. • Annual reduction in Inland Revenue’s administrative costs. This was not achieved for 2020/21 as decisions were made to delay some organisational changes in light of COVID-19. However, the cumulative reduction in costs is above target and we are confident we will achieve the targeted savings by 2023/24. The administrative savings we committed to deliver over the life of the programme have already been removed from our baseline, helping to achieve our business case commitment of Inland Revenue being no more expensive to run after transformation than it was before. 24. Although the transformation programme will close by 30 June 2022, we will continue to track and report against our benefit commitments through until 2023/24. Progress will be reported as part of our Annual Reports for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Final progress updates 25. The exit from our heritage data centres will be completed this month, on or before the 30 June 2022 deadline. The 1 April 2022 changes have been successfully implemented, showing that skills and capabilities have been transferred from the programme team. We have completed the final independent assurance reviews and all programme risks have been closed. Decommissioning 26. The archiving, shutdown, and removal of our heritage applications has been completed. The final services that were running in the heritage data centres have been shut down and all back-end infrastructure has been decommissioned. The disposal of FIRST is complete and Unisys is working through the secure disposal of all remaining equipment. Unisys will complete the exit of all the equipment that supported Inland Revenue from the two data centres on or before the planned completion date of 30 June 2022. Handover to business-as-usual 27. The knowledge, processes, and practices we used during transformation have been handed over to their enduring homes in our new organisation design. For example, the successful implementation of the more than 100 changes on 1 April was managed by our new Planning, Design and Delivery function in our Customer and Compliance Services group, not by the programme team. Independent quality assurance reviews 28. The final quality assurance reviews for the programme have now been completed. We have previously reported the findings of the Gateway review to you (IR2022/173 refers). As noted in that report, the Gateway review team rated transformation as green. 29. In March 2022, we commissioned KPMG to conduct a final Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) review. It is KPMG’s twelfth TQA for transformation (TQA 12). The TQA focused on our progress with decommissioning our heritage services, systems and applications. Fieldwork took place during April 2022. 6 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 30. KPMG concluded that the “decommissioning and archiving plan is likely to conclude on schedule,” and that “the commercial management of the suppliers involved in the decommissioning is well-communicated and controlled.” KPMG rated both areas Green. 31. As this was KPMG’s final review, they also took the opportunity to make some broader comments. Reviewers noted “the scale and significance of this achievement,” referring to both decommissioning and the work to simplify our technology environment, and “the high quality of the Programme’s planning and execution.” They also noted how important decommissioning is to achieving the outcomes committed to, noting that “technical debt is often overlooked” and “ can easily erode benefits unless actively managed.” They concluded that “This Programme has, in our view, done an exemplary job of enabling IR to exit the Unisys data-centre, while also aggressively reducing technical debt, in order to deliver a sustainable and cost-effective technology architecture to support IR in the future.” Risks 32. The transformation programme’s risk profile has improved to Green. 33. No issues (a risk that has been realised) are being managed. 34. As at June 2022, the programme had no open risks. Since we last reported to you (IR2022/092 refers), the remaining six programme risks have been closed. Communication 35. We will provide a copy of this report to the Treasury. 7 IR2022/302: Closure of the transformation programme \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendatio ns 36.

Taku haere ki Aotearoa I am coming to New Zealand
=================================================

If you're coming to New Zealand and want to know your tax requirements, see our section about international tax for individuals.

[International tax for individuals](/international-tax/individuals)

If you're looking for help in another language, see our multilingual guidance on coming to work or study in New Zealand. These pages are also a good introduction to New Zealand's tax system.

[I am coming to work or study in New Zealand](/situations/work-or-study-in-new-zealand)

When coming to New Zealand, there are other programmes that you may want to keep in mind. Even if you're not eligible or they do not fit your current situation, you may want to use them in the future.

KiwiSaver
---------

KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings scheme to help set you up for retirement. You can join KiwiSaver if you're both:

*   a New Zealand citizen or entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely
*   you live or normally live in New Zealand.

You cannot join KiwiSaver if you have a temporary, visitor, work or student visa.

If you work in New Zealand, make sure your employer knows that you cannot enrol in KiwiSaver. If you're accidentally enrolled, contact us to reverse your enrolment.

[How KiwiSaver works](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/how-kiwisaver-works)

Working for Families
--------------------

Working for Families tax credits are payments for families with dependent children aged 18 or under. To apply, you need to meet either of the following residency requirements.

*   You're a New Zealand resident and have been in New Zealand continuously for at least 12 months at any time. You must also be a tax resident to be entitled to the payments.
*   The child or children you're claiming for are both resident and present in New Zealand. 

You may not be eligible for this programme right away. If you'll be here in the long term, you may want to keep it in mind. In addition to the residency requirements, you'll need to meet the main criteria.

If you have a temporary tax exemption, it is important to know that applying and getting Working for Families will cancel it.

[Income Tax Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/income-tax-act-2007 "Income Tax Act 2007")

Commentary on parts of the act - A to B
=======================================

Commentary on parts A to B of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Part A

The broad purpose of the Income Tax Act 2007 is to define and impose tax on net income, to impose obligations concerning tax and to set out rules for the calculation and satisfaction of those obligations (section AA 1).

Section AA 2 reinforces the legislative principles of the Interpretation Act 1999 by highlighting how readers' aids to interpretation are to be used.

Section AA 3(1) has been omitted, as defining "this Act" to include the Tax Administration Act 1994 is no longer necessary. The drafting approach taken in the rewritten Act is to state clearly when the Tax Administration Act is being referred to.

Section AA 3(2) identifies the relationship of the Income Tax Act with the Interpretation Act, with particular reference to the defined term "person" in the Interpretation Act.

The Income Tax Act now provides that it applies to the Crown (section AA 4) to provide a better relationship with Part 4 of the Interpretation Act. Explicitly or not, the Income Tax Act has always applied to the Crown, as shown, for example, by the exemption given for government agencies in section CW 38 (Public authorities).

### Part B

The scheme and purpose of Part B remains the same as in the 2004 Act - to impose income tax and other tax obligations and to set out how those obligations must be satisfied. As the core provisions are intended as an enduring framework, it is not expected that these rules will be altered in the future, unless fundamental changes are made to the policy underlying the scheme, its purpose and structure.

Overall, little substantive change has been made to the core provisions. However, some structural changes have been made to improve the relationship of the core provisions to Part I (Treatment of tax losses), Part L (Tax credits and other credits), and Part R (General collection rules).

Changes to the following core provisions have been made in rewriting Parts F to N of the 2004 Act:

*   section BB 2(3) has been moved to section RA 4 (Provisional tax obligations);
*   section BC 4(4) has been moved to subpart IA (sections IA 2 and IA 3);
*   sections BC 8 and BC 10 have been moved to subpart LA (sections LA 4, LA 5 and LA 7);
*   section BC 6(2) to (4) has been omitted as the restructuring of the tax credit rules means these particular rules are no longer necessary;
*   a clear linkage has been made between section RB 3 and section BC 7 (relating to schedular income); and
*   section BC 9 has been renumbered as section BC 8 in the 2007 Act, and explicit linkages developed between that provision in subpart LA (sections LA 2 to LA 5, LA 9, and LA 10).

While Part B was rewritten in the 2004 Act, it is useful to restate the scheme and purpose of Part B at this time. This enables readers to see the relationship of the various Parts of the Act to the core provisions and Part B in particular.

#### Subpart BA

The overall purpose of the core provisions is to establish:

*   a statutory scheme for the calculation and satisfaction of taxation obligations; and
*   the structural relationships of the core provisions.

#### Subpart BB

Subpart BB sets out the obligations that the 2007 Act requires a person to satisfy. Any of these obligations may be modified by the general anti-avoidance rule (section BG 1) and New Zealand's obligations under its double tax agreements (section BH 1).

The main obligations listed in section BB 2 are:

*   the calculation and satisfaction of the income tax liability for each tax year (section BB 2(1) and subpart BC);
*   the calculation and payment of provisional tax for a tax year (section BB 2(3) and the provisional tax rules);
*   the calculation and satisfaction of withholding liabilities (section BB 2(4) and subpart BE); and
*   the calculation and satisfaction of a variety of other taxes and payments (section BB 2(5) and subpart BF).

There is no intended change in outcome associated with the minor drafting improvements to sections BB 2(5) and BF 1. A new term "ancillary tax" has been introduced as a consequence of rewriting the definition of "income tax", to draw attention to the types of tax obligations imposed under the core provisions through the previous definition of "income tax".

Sections BB 3, BG 1 and BH 1 continue to provide an override for:

*   the general anti-avoidance rule in sections BG 1 and GA 1; and
*   bilateral relief under a double tax agreement entered into by New Zealand.

#### Subpart BC

Subpart BC is linked to sections BB 1 and BB 2 through its subject matter. Subpart BC sets out the detailed process that must be followed to meet the obligation to calculate and pay income tax for a tax year.

The concept of "schedular income" in section BC 7 takes on greater importance as some provisions in Part H (Taxation of certain entities) provide for a scheme-based approach to the calculation of an entity's income tax liability, rather than using the core provisions' global gross approach. An example is the rules relating to portfolio tax rate entities.

Unless a person is a non-filing taxpayer, this process contains a series of steps involving the calculation of net income, taxable income and the income tax liability for a tax year. A non-filing taxpayer's income tax liability for a tax year is, in general, determined by amounts of tax withheld at source.

To apply subpart BC (the calculation of the income tax liability for a tax year), a person must know the core concepts of **annual gross income** and **annual total deduction**.

These core concepts are defined in sections BC 2 and BC 3 respectively. The concept of "corresponding income year" ensures that the core provisions align the calculation of the income tax liability for a tax year to the tax balance date of the taxpayer. The tax balance date may be either the standard date (31 March) or an early or late balance date.

"Annual gross income for a tax year" is a global concept. Section BC 2 defines it as the "aggregate of all assessable income from all sources that is derived in or allocated to the corresponding income year". The concepts of "assessable income" and "allocation" are explained further in subpart BD.

"Annual total deduction for a tax year" is also a global concept, and section BC 3 defines it as the "aggregate of all deductions that are incurred in or allocated to the corresponding income year". The concepts of "deduction and allocation" are explained further in subpart BD.

Section BC 4 now reflects the wide range of uses to which a net loss may be put.

Sections BC 6 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act provide a framework for determining the income tax liability of a person and how the Act uses tax credits to satisfy this liability. As this framework has been more closely integrated with the detailed tax credit rules in Parts L and M, these core provisions have been simplified and harmonised with Part L. As a result, sections BC 6 to BC 8 and subpart LA now cover the same subject matter as sections BC 6 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act.

The rewrite of Parts F to N of the 2004 Act highlights the importance of the concepts of "schedular income" and "schedular income tax liability" in section BC 7 as part of the framework of the core provisions. These two terms provide a framework for:

*   classes of income with unique tax rates or a final liability - for example, non-resident withholding income subject to final withholding; and
*   an entity-based calculation of the entity's income tax liability for a tax year - for example, portfolio tax rate entities in subpart HL (Portfolio investment entities).

The intention is that the more specific rules will state how the schedular rule relates to section BC 7. For example, section RB 3 (Schedular income tax liability for filing taxpayers for non-resident passive income) states that, for the purpose of section BC 7, the schedular income tax liability for a person with schedular non-resident passive income subject to final withholding is determined under section RB 3 and not under the rules in sections BC 1 to BC 6.

The flowcharts in the core provisions have also been updated to highlight the interaction of Part L with the core provisions in section BC 8.

#### Subpart BD

Subpart BD has an important role to supplement the operation of subpart BC, as it explains the core concepts of **assessable income**, **deduction**, and **allocation**. It also defines the extent of New Zealand's income tax base.

**Assessable income**

The concept of "assessable income" is a calculated amount, and is defined in section BD 1. Assessable income is a person's income that remains after excluding any part of that income that comprises exempt income, excluded income or non-residents' foreign-sourced income. An amount of assessable income may be spread or allocated across more than one tax year.

To use this concept, the reader also needs to know the meaning of "income", "exempt income", "excluded income" and "non-residents' foreign-sourced" income.

**Income**

The concept of "income" is described in section BD 1. This definition is supported by all of the provisions in Part C through the explicit linkage in section BD 1(1). That section identifies that Part C is a code in relation to its role of determining whether an amount arising from a transaction or event is income.

Gains and profits that are not treated as income under Part C are not subject to income tax. Examples of this category are capital profits and windfall gains.

The only exclusions from income are found in subsections BD 1(2) (exempt income), (3) (excluded income) and (4) (non-residents' foreign-sourced income). These subsections represent a series of exclusions from what is income under section BD 1(1).

After applying these restrictions, the amount (or apportioned amount) that arises from a transaction is termed "assessable income". Assessable income under section BD 1(5) represents the amount of income that is included in the determination of a person's income tax liability for a tax year, subject to any allocation of that income between different tax years. This amount may be allocated across more than one tax year.

**Exempt income**

The category of exempt income (section BD 1(2)) is reserved for amounts of income that Parliament determines should not be subject to income tax. An example of exempt income is found in section CW 41 (Charities: non-business income).

**Excluded income**

Falling within the concept of "excluded income" (section BD 1(3)) are amounts of income that are not included in income because they are generally subject to tax in another way.

For example, life insurance premiums derived by a life insurer (and reinsurers) are treated as excluded income (section CX 39). The exclusion arises because the life insurance rules in subpart EY separate the income (underwriting) and savings elements of those premiums and include the underwriting elements in income.

**Non-residents' foreign-sourced income**

This category of income establishes the role that the source of income and a person's residence play in determining whether an amount of income is subject to taxation in New Zealand (section BD 1(4)). It also enables New Zealand to identify what deductions a non=resident may or may not be entitled to.

**Source and residence**

The concepts of "source and residence" are fundamental to determining the scope of New Zealand's income tax base. This is achieved through the operation of section BD 1.

Section BD 1(1) defines the subject matter by reference to the amounts listed as income in Part C. As explained later in this article, the concept of income under Part C does not depend on the concepts of time, residence or source.

Section BD 1(5) provides that the concept of "assessable income" does not include income derived by a non-resident that is not treated as being derived from New Zealand at the time that person is non-resident. The overall effect of section BD 1(1) gives the following outcomes:

*   Income that a resident of New Zealand derives from anywhere in the world is treated as assessable income, provided that income is neither exempt nor excluded income (section BD 1(2) or (3)).
*   Income that a non-resident derives from New Zealand is treated as assessable income, provided that income is neither exempt nor excluded income (section BD 1(2) or (3)).
*   Income that a non-resident derives from sources outside New Zealand falls within non-residents' foreign-sourced income and is not assessable income (section BD 1(4)).

**Allocation of income (timing)**

Section BD 3 explains the basis on which the legislation allocates income to a particular income year. In this context, the term "income year" was chosen because allocation applies to both the standard (31 March) and non-standard tax balance dates.

The general rule is that the Act allocates income to an income year on the basis of when it was derived or credited in the account of a person, or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. Common law principles are also to be taken into account when considering the sometimes divergent tax accounting results that arise between business and cash-basis taxpayers (section BD 3(3)).

It is important to note that the allocation made is of the income, not just the assessable income. Therefore, the method of allocating an amount of income applies also to any part of that income that is exempt income, excluded income, non-residents' foreign-sourced income and assessable income. Allocation of the income on a consistent basis for all categories of income is necessary because of the nexus tests under the general permission which link deductibility with assessable income (section DA 1).

For example, an amount of income derived by a non-resident may be apportioned between non-residents' foreign-sourced income and assessable income. The allocation of both the non-residents' foreign-sourced income and assessable income across income years will be proportionate to how the income is apportioned.

Assuming that deductions in deriving income are allowed under the general permission, this allocation of income can be expected to influence the amount of deduction allowed in each tax year.

The general rule may be overridden by any rule that allocates the income on another basis.

**Deductions**

Sections BD 2 and BD 4 explain the core concept of deduction and the timing of a deduction.

The concept of "deduction" in section BD 2 is a key link or signpost between the core provisions in subpart BC and the operative rules found in subpart DA (previously located in section BD 2 of the 2004 Act). This relocation reflects the intention that all deductions should be located in one Part.

Section BD 2 identifies that Part D is a code for determining whether an amount arising from a transaction or event is a deduction. This means that a person may not have a deduction unless it is listed in Part D - see, for example, section HF 1(2) (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) of the 2004 Act.

**Allocation of deduction (timing)**

A deduction is always allocated to an income year (section BD 4). Again, the term "income year" is used to signal the application of the allocation provisions to persons with non-standard tax balance dates.

The general rule is that a deduction is allocated to an income year on the basis of when it was incurred. Again, common law principles must be taken into account when considering any possible divergent treatment that exists in tax accounting between business and cash-basis taxpayers.

This general rule of allocation may be overridden by any rule that allocates the deduction on another basis.

#### Other obligations

**Provisional tax**

Section BB 2(3) imposes the obligation to pay provisional tax. It also points to the details of the provisional tax rules in subpart RC which set out the process for calculating and paying provisional tax.

**Withholding obligations**

Sections BB 2(4) and BE 1 continue to provide the obligation to comply with various tax payment systems such as PAYE, RWT, NRWT, FBT, ESCT and FDP.

Section BE 1 also provides a link to the detailed provisions that a person needs to know in order to comply with these obligations.

**Ancillary tax obligations**

An ancillary tax is defined in section YA 1, as being any of ESCT, FBT, FDP, FDP penalty tax, further FDP, further income tax, imputation penalty tax, NRWT, PAYE, penalty tax for a Maori authority payable under section 140DB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provisional tax, qualifying company election tax, RWT and withdrawal tax.

Commentary on parts of the act - C to E
=======================================

Commentary on parts C to E of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Parts C, D, and E (rewritten in the 2004 Act)

The importance of Parts C, D and E as a group is that together they provide the details that enable taxpayers to calculate their income tax liability for a tax year, as required by the core provisions. (For a full commentary on these Parts, see the commentary to the Income Tax Act 2004 in the June 2004 issue of the _Tax Information Bulletin_).

As a number of insertions have been made into Parts C, D and E since enactment of the 2004 Act, the new Act has required the renumbering of these three Parts.

Income and deduction provisions located in Parts F to N of the 2004 Act have been rewritten as new income provisions in Part C and deduction provisions in Part D. This drafting approach reflects the underlying policy that Part C is an exhaustive list of what is "income" and Part D is a complete list of what is "allowed as a deduction".

Examples include:

*   the income and deduction rules for finance leases and consolidated groups of companies;
*   section HF 1, which provides that all income derived by a mutual association is income of the association, overriding the principle of mutuality; section HF 1(1) in the 2004 Act has been rewritten as section CB 33, and this provision is signposted in section HE 1;
*   sections CV 16, CV 17 and DW 3 in the 2007 Act (relating to non-resident shippers and film renters) are the new location for the operative aspects of sections FC 18 to FC 21 of the 2004 Act;
*   section CB 2 (which relates to amounts received on disposal of business assets that include trading stock);
*   sections CC 11 to CC 13 (which relate to finance leases and hire purchase agreements);
*   section CD 11 (which relates to various avoidance arrangements);
*   section DB 10 (which relates to profit-related or substituting debentures); and
*   sections DB 57 to DB 59, and DC 5 (which relate to various avoidance arrangements).

The insertion has been made either in an existing rule or as a new section that has an overriding effect on the related rule. No change in outcome is intended.

This has meant that sections CW 44, CX 45, CY 1 and DY 1 of the 2004 Act have been omitted as no longer necessary.

### Part C

The functions of Part C are:

*   to provide an exhaustive list of what is income for income tax purposes;
*   to identify the taxpayer to whom the income belongs;
*   to provide a catchall provision in section CA 1(2) to pick up any amounts outside these other categories that would be income under ordinary concepts; and
*   to define amounts that would be income but may, nevertheless, be exempted or excluded from being included in the calculation of the person's income tax liability.

If an amount arising from a transaction is not income under Part C, that amount does not fall within the scope. An example would be a capital gain arising from the sale of a private residence that does not fall within the land sales rules in subpart CB. This is illustrated in the diagram outlining the process of calculating and satisfying income tax liabilities set out in subpart BC.

A key principle is that, under Part C, income is a global or gross concept that does not depend on the concepts of time, source or residence. However, a specific provision in Part C may take into account the concepts of source or residence as a parameter in determining whether an amount is income. An example in the 2007 Act where residence is relevant to the determination of income is section CQ 2(1)(d) (Attributed CFC income).

An amount of exempt or excluded income may be subject to another form of tax obligation imposed under section BB 2. Generally, the provision signals the linkage to the obligation. For example, section CW 9(2) states that the FDP rules apply to this exempt dividend. This gives a clear signal that, despite the exempt nature of the dividend, a tax obligation remains in relation to the exempt dividend.

### Part D

The purpose of Part D is to provide a legislative code of when an amount is a deduction. Subpart DA sets out some general rules for deductibility of expenditure or loss.

The legislation has a general deductibility rule, the general permission, which is set out in section DA 1. The rules in section DA 2 Act are general limitations to the general permission.

Section DA 3 sets out the legislative relationship between the specific rules and the general rules. Section DA 4 is a special provision that clarifies at an early stage the relationship between a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss and the capital limitation.

As a consequence of rewriting Parts F to N of the 2004 Act, a number of new deduction provisions provide for rules that were previously set out in a Part other than Part D. For example, in the 2004 Act, sections HF 1(3) and (4) provided a deduction for mutual association rebates. This provision has been rewritten as section DV 19 and signposted in section HE 1, both in the 2007Act.

### Part E

In the absence of specific timing rules, the core provisions timing rules (sections BD 3 and BD 4) provide for timing to be determined on the basis of when income is "derived" or expenditure is "incurred". Sections BD 3 and BD 4 state that the meaning of "derived" and "incurred" will continue to be determined by case law.

Part E is the location for sets of rules that have a predominant focus on matching or allocation. These rules apply where the policy is to provide a timing result that differs from the result arising from the time at which income is "derived" or expenditure or loss is "incurred".

The most significant specific timing rules are:

*   revenue account property, section EA 2 (Other revenue account property);
*   accrual expenditure, section EA 3 (Prepayments);
*   depreciation (subpart EE);
*   the financial arrangement rules (subpart EW) and the old financial arrangement rules in sectionsEZ30 to EZ 49; and
*   valuation of trading stock, livestock and bloodstock (section EA 1 and subparts EB, EC and ED).

Not every element of a specific provision that has a timing aspect been shifted to Part E. A simple ancillary rule that clarifies when an amount is derived or incurred remains with the substantive provision creating the income or deduction. From a reader's perspective, to shift an ancillary rule would provide little benefit.

In addition to the rules on depreciable assets, trading stock and revenue account property, Part E also covers areas within which the timing, income and deduction rules cannot easily be separated, such as the accrual rules, the international rules and many of the life insurance rules.

Commentary on parts of the act - F to G
=======================================

Commentary on parts F to G of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Part F - Recharacterisation of certain transactions

Part F in the 2007 Act contains a range of provisions related to:

*   apportionment rules for cross-border transactions;l
*   modifications to the interest deductibility rules for certain types of debentures and, under thin capitalisation rules, some foreign-owned organisations and banks;
*   rules for consolidated companies when calculating their income tax liability for a tax year;
*   rules for determining how groups of companies use imputation credits; and
*   modifications to the tax treatment of certain transfers of property and financial arrangements under a relationship agreement or upon death.

If a "modification" rule in Part F applies, a taxation effect that is different from one that would be produced under Parts C to E generally follows.

Apportionment was one of the functions ascribed to Part F in the 2004 Act." But as Part F does not generally perform this function in the 2007 Act, a number of apportionment rules have been moved closer to their related provisions in Parts C, D and E." Examples of apportionment rules moved to a different location in the 2007 Act are:

*   section FB 2, which contains an apportionment rule for tax credits for foreign income tax and a source rule: the apportionment rule for tax credits has been moved to subpart YD (Residence and source in New Zealand); and
*   section FB 7, which is an apportionment rule relating to depreciation, has been moved to subpart EE, making this rule easier to access.

Despite apportionment provisions being located close to their relevant rule, Part F retains the apportionment rules relating to interest deductibility on thin capitalisation." The complexity and detail of these rules has led to retaining them in Part F, rather than moving them to Parts" C and D.

Subpart FA contains rules that alter the tax treatment of certain commercial arrangements by either:

*   recharacterising the nature of, or amounts derived under, the arrangement (see for example, section FA 2 which recharacterises the nature of the arrangement by treating a debenture as shares for income tax purposes); or
*   providing a different form of tax treatment for the parties to the arrangement (see for example, section FA 5 which alters the tax treatment of the party to the transaction).

Section FA 5 is intended to claw back deductions for lease payments that are effectively payments of the purchase price of the lease asset." This rule applies when an asset is leased under an operating lease, and the lessee acquires the asset at the end of the lease, and then sells the asset to a third party." As a result of this sale, the lessee has an amount of income equal to the amount of deductions allowed for the lease payments but only for any profit derived on that sale.

Subparts FB and FC contain the rules that provide for the income tax treatment on transfers of certain property - that is, transfers made under certain settlements of relationship property, and certain transfers of property after the death of the owner of the property.

The thin capitalisation rules that apportion certain interest expenditure between income derived from New Zealand and other income are contained in subpart FE and are directed at:

*   a New Zealand taxpayer who is subject to a certain level or type of foreign control; or
*   a foreign-owned bank that has a lower than prescribed level of equity.

A company's conduit tax relief may be restricted under subpart FF by an amount that correctly reflects the interest deductions of the company that relate to the assets that produce the conduit tax-relieved income.

Subpart FL deals with the income tax consequences when a New Zealand-resident company changes its residence to another country and loses its New Zealand residence.

Subpart FM draws together most of the rules for entry into a consolidated group and the tax treatment of certain transactions between member companies of a consolidated group." However, tax loss rules for consolidated groups are located in subpart ID because of their interrelationship to the more general loss rules in Part I.

Despite this general drafting approach, the application of some specific anti-avoidance rules to a consolidated group has been retained in subpart GB." The consolidated group rules relating to memorandum accounts have been retained in Part O (Memorandum accounts) as they are so closely related with the general rules in that Part.

Subpart FN applies when two or more companies that are part of a wholly owned group of companies form an imputation group to enable a company in the imputation group to pay an imputed dividend when another company in the imputation group has a credit for New Zealand tax paid." This subpart also includes the rules relating to trans-Tasman imputation groups.

Amalgamations involving only New Zealand-resident companies that are not dual resident and do not derive only exempt income are dealt with in subpart FO." These rules generally provide for no income tax consequences on the transfer of property and novation for liabilities that occur under the amalgamation.

#### Drafting improvements in Part F

A reference to debentures issued before 30 August 1940 contained in section FC 2 of the 2004 Act has been omitted from section FA 2 (Recharacterisation of certain debentures) as it is unlikely that debentures from this time would still exist.

Sections FA 6 and FA 12 (which relate to amounts derived under finance leases or hire purchase agreements) are clearly linked to the valuation provisions in the financial arrangement rules." This link makes explicit how a lessee determines their cost base for a lease asset for all purposes of the Act and simplifies the drafting of the lease and hire purchase rules.

An ambiguity in section FC 10(4) of the 2004 Act has been clarified in section FA 18(3) (Treatment of amounts paid in income years after agreement ends) by making it clear that the expenditure incurred by a lessee from hire purchase payments refers just to the interest component of those payments.

In section FB 13 (Trading stock), the period to which the provision relates has been changed from "tax year" (31 March) to "income year" (31 March or approved alternative balance date)." This change was necessary to ensure that the provision aligns correctly with the trading stock provisions in Part E, which are based on the income year rather than the tax year.

Section FB 16, which rewrites section FF 10 of the 2004 Act, removes repetition of language contained in section EC 31 of the 2004 Act.

In sections FB 19, FB 20 and FB 21 (which relate to leased assets, mining assets and depreciable property), the transfer values have been rationalised with the depreciation provisions by using the defined terms "adjusted tax value" and "base value".

In section FB 21(7), the relationship with the depreciation provisions has been clarified to show that subsection (7) applies only for the purpose of determining the correct depreciation rate.

Under the thin capitalisation or conduit rules, a person may have a reduction in the amount of interest that is taken into account in determining his or her net income for a tax year." This adjustment is structured as an amount of income in section CH 9, with the detailed calculation retained in section FE 6." No change in outcome is intended from the 2004 Act.

The consolidated company rules are set out in subpart FM and the amalgamation rules are located in subpart FO." Moving the rules together into one Part supports the overall objective of the Rewrite project of reducing compliance costs.

#### Intended changes in Part F

**Section FA 3 - Share dealing**

Section FA 3 rewrites section FC 3 of the 2004 Act." The section is an old provision, introduced in 1959 in response to sales of shares involving a dividend-stripping arrangement structured to create a loss on sale for tax purposes.

This rule deals with the situation where a person enters into an arrangement to buy shares on revenue account, strips out a dividend from those shares, and then sells them." In the absence of section FC 3, the person would be able to generate, for income tax purposes, a loss on the sale of those shares which would then be taken into account determining the person's net income for the tax year." This outcome offsets the artificially created loss against assessable income.

This rule was originally enacted in 1959 (as section 136A of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954) to deny the loss for tax purposes." The rule was also drafted to ensure that the dividend continues to be treated as it normally would, for tax purposes, under the dividend rules.

An ambiguity in the proviso to the 2004 Act was identified in the rewrite of this provision." This ambiguity potentially allowed the "stripped-out" dividend to be counted twice in applying the proviso, and would have resulted in the rule being largely ineffective.

The intended change clarifies that the "stripped-out" dividend is counted only once in applying the rule." This is achieved in section FA 3 by creating an amount of income no less than the stripped dividend but no greater than the artificial loss arising because of the dividend stripping arrangement." The effect of this rule is that the income created effectively "offsets" the loss on sale created through the dividend-stripping arrangement.

**Sections FA 5(6) and FA 9(3) - Finance leases and operating leases**

The lease rules in sections FC 5 and FC 8E of the 2004 Act provide that when a leased asset is disposed of to a person who is associated with the lessee of that asset, and that associated person then disposes of the asset, the lessee is taxed on any profit on disposal." The policy intent of this rule is to ensure that the disposal rules applying to the lessee cannot be circumvented through transactions with associated persons." However, these rules are not clear about when the test of association applies.

Sections FA 5(6) and FA 9(3) place this test of association at the time the leased asset is disposed of to the associated person.

**Transfers of property on death**

Sections FC 2 to FC 6 have been drafted to make it clear that the transfer on death to the executor/administrator and the subsequent transfer from the executor/administrator to the estate are treated as one transfer.

### Part G - Avoidance and non-market transactions

Part G contains two types of provisions - those dealing with avoidance, and those dealing with certain transactions treated as taking place at market value.

Two structural matters were identified in rewriting Part G:

*   It was not entirely clear in what circumstances a provision's anti-avoidance nature merited locating it in Part G." In many cases, technical base-maintenance remedial provisions could be viewed as dealing with matters of avoidance.
*   As other Parts of the Act also contain many provisions treating transactions as occurring at market value, the rationale for having valuation provisions in Part G was unclear." As a result, the provisions proposed to be retained in Part G are those that do not have a suitable alternative location or which have an anti-avoidance element.

The rewritten legislation locates in subparts GA and GB only those provisions that, in broad terms, apply to arrangements that are aimed at avoiding tax.

Subpart GC contains the rules that provide for the substitution of market value for the values adopted in a transaction where, in policy terms, the market value is regarded as being the more appropriate outcome.

#### Drafting improvements in Part G

Subpart GA contains the rules giving the Commissioner the general power to adjust a person's income tax liability when an arrangement is void under section BG 1.

Section GA 1 rewrites section GB 1(1) to (2C) of the 2004 Act." The drafting is simplified to refer to an adjustment in any way to taxable income." This approach is consistent with the law in section 99 of the 1976 Act and section BG 11 of the 1994 Act (before enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996)." The amendments to section BG 1 by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act were intended to complement the global/gross approach adopted in the core provisions, rather than change the outcomes under the law.

While there have been some drafting changes to this provision, there is no intention to change the outcome." For example, the section no longer contains the words "without limiting the generality of the preceding subsections" as these words seemed to have no practical effect on the Commissioner's powers under the section.

Section GA 2 rewrites section GB 17B of the 2004 Act." This provision permits an adjustment to a person's excluded income, which is affected by an arrangement altering the incidence of FBT.

In a number of sections in subpart GB, objective tests replace a discretion to be exercised by the Commissioner." Having the application of these provisions rely on an objective test provides an improvement in the relationship and consistency with self-assessment." For example, section GB 4 (Arrangements for grouping tax losses: companies) no longer requires the Commissioner to form an opinion on whether the section applies but provides a list of objective tests for the application of the section." Other examples are sections GB 6, GB 33, GB 36(1) and"GZ 1.

Section GB 26(3) (Arrangements involving repatriation of commercial bills) makes explicit the time of the "deemed" redemption as the time at which the actual redemption was originally provided for under the commercial bill facility." This timing was implied in the corresponding rule (section GC 14A(2) of the 2004 Act)." By making this explicit, the relationship of this rule to the financial rules is clarified: this timing rule overrides the financial arrangement rules because of the reference to "necessary implication" in section EW 2(1).

Section GB 27(3) (Attribution rule for income from personal services) clarifies that the exclusion is not intended to apply to an individual who is a trustee acting as such." The rewritten provision relies on the definition of "trustee" in section YA 1 for this effect." Section GB 27 now refers to the income year of the associated entity to give consistency to the value of "substantial business assets" in section GC 14C(6) of the 2004 Act, which was measured at the end of that entity's accounting year.

An uncertainty existed under section GC 15 of the 2004 Act in relation to benefits provided to an employee's associate over whether an associated person or the actual employee was treated as receiving the benefit." It is clarified in the 2007 Act that the fringe benefit is treated as received by the actual employee under section GB 32.

#### Intended changes in Part G

**Section GB 27(2)(c) - Attribution rule for personal services**

The 2004 Act rule in section GB 14B(2)(c) is ambiguous on whether the threshold of $60,000 should include income that is available for attribution." The rewritten provision confirms the policy intention that the threshold amount of $60,000 net income includes amounts that would be attributed under the attribution rule.

**Sections GB 35(2)(d) and GB 42(2)(d) - Multiple purposes in arrangements**

Sections GC 22(1)(a)(iv) and GC 27A(1)(d) of the 2004 Act refer to an arrangement that has "the purpose" of obtaining a tax advantage." The context of these rules is that this purpose should not be an incidental purpose, indicating that the section actually contemplates there may be more than one purpose for the arrangement." The use of "the purpose" is thus inconsistent with the context and application of the drafting and is linguistically incorrect.

It is clear from the drafting of these two sections that they are intended to apply when one purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage, irrespective of the number of purposes of the arrangement. As a result, in both rewritten provisions, the term "the purpose" has been clarified as "a purpose".

Commentary on parts of the act - H to L
=======================================

Commentary on parts H to L of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Part H - Taxation of certain entities

Part H of the Income Tax Act 2004 contains groups of rules that modify the calculation of taxable income for a tax year for certain persons and entities.

Qualifying companies and loss-attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) are dealt with in subpart HA.

Most of the trust rules are set out in subpart HC. These rules describe the taxation of distributions from trusts and the taxation of undistributed income derived by trustees. Trusts are classified as complying trusts, foreign trusts, and non-complying trusts.

The agency rules are set out in subpart HD. They describe the circumstances in which a person is treated as an agent for another person in relation to the other person's tax obligations for income tax and tax administration purposes.

Subpart HE sets out the rules that apply to transactions between a mutual association and its members. These rules describe the income tax treatment of income derived by a mutual association and also of distributions to members.

The rules for Maori authorities are contained in subpart HF. These rules set out the taxation treatment for income derived by a Maori authority and distributions made from these authorities. The relationship with other Maori authority rules is also identified, for example, in relation to tax credits, memorandum accounts, refunds, tax rates and administrative rules.

Subpart HL sets out the rules applying to portfolio tax rate entities. Subpart HR contains rules for a variety of entities, such as partnerships, joint ventures, group investment funds, the Government Superannuation Fund and airport operators.

#### Drafting improvements in Part H

**Qualifying companies**

The requirements that a company must meet to become and to continue as a qualifying company have been moved to subpart HA, primarily to sections HA 5 and HA6. Distributions from a qualifying company are treated either as fully imputed dividends or as exempt income. This effect is reflected in section CW 15.

The reference to "transitional capital amount" in section HG 13(1)(a)(i) of the 2004 Act has been removed. This reference is redundant as it related to unexpired 10-year bonus issues, which terminated in 1998.

Section HG 9(3) of the 2004 Act placed a restriction on the amount of deduction that a person is allowed for interest incurred. This restriction is now moved to section DB 9 as a limitation on the deduction.

Section HA 24(4), which rewrites sections HG 16(1) and HG 17(1)(a) of the 2004 Act, clarifies that the time at which the shareholder incurs an attributed loss from a loss-attributing qualifying company is subject to the balance date rule in section HA 26.

**Trusts**

The defined terms "qualifying trust" and "non-qualifying trust" have been replaced with the terms "complying trust" and "non-complying trust" to reflect the underlying policy. The word "qualifying" is not very meaningful and has been omitted.

Section HC 2 (Obligations of joint trustees for calculating income and providing returns) also draws into subpart HC the rule from section HD 1 of the 2004 Act relating to the taxation obligations of trustees. This rule also makes it clear that the core provisions are to be read as if co-trustees were a single person. Each of the trustees is jointly and severally liable to satisfy the obligations imposed under section BB 2.

The definition of "beneficiary income" in section HC6 omits paragraphs (a)(iii) and (iv) of the definition in section OB 1 of the 2004 Act as they are no longer necessary.

The defined terms "distribution", "settlor" and "settlement" rely on the defined term "transfer of value". The drafting approach provides a general rule with specific exclusions, rather than producing a list of inclusions that extend a general term.

The 2004 Act definition of "distribution" is very extensive, with paragraph (a) applying to every vesting in interest in a beneficiary of property of a trust, any payment of property to a beneficiary of a trust, or the application for the benefit of a beneficiary of any property of a trust. In addition, this general concept is extended in paragraph (b) of the old definition to include transfers of property and service transactions between a trustee and beneficiary when the transfer value adopted benefits the beneficiary.

A number of provisions in the trust rules treat an amount derived as one of the categories of income of a person. Anumber of new provisions have been included in Part C, along with appropriate cross-referencing in subpart HC, to provide structural consistency with the core provisions. For example:

*   Section HH 1(9) (which applies when a unit trust that is a superannuation scheme becomes a superannuation fund) is included in the dividend rules as section CD 12, with a cross-reference in section HC 1(5).
*   The income aspects of sections HH 1(7), HH 3(1), HH 3(3), HH 3(5A) and HH 8 of the 2004 Act have been relocated to subpart CV (Income specific to certain entities).
*   The "excluded income" provisions in sections HH 3(4), and HH 3A to HH 3F are now located in subpart CX (Excluded income). For example, a cross-reference from section HC 19 helps the reader identify its relationship with section CX 59 (Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts).
*   Exempt income provisions in the 2004 Act have been moved to subpart CW (Exempt income).  
    Section CW 53 (Distributions from complying trusts) rewrites the rule in section HH 3(5) of the 2004 Act as "exempt income". This provision is necessary because a distribution from a trust (not being beneficiary income) could otherwise be treated as income for tax purposes. An example of a distribution to which this rule would apply is the payment of a pension from a superannuation fund.  
      
    Drafting this rule as an exempt income provision reveals the structural relationship of the rule to the deduction rules. By treating these distributions as exempt income, the beneficiary may not have a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving a distribution from a superannuation fund. No change in outcome is intended.

Trustees and settlors are treated as tax agents for some purposes, and the obligations they are to comply with are more clearly signalled in the agency provisions in subpart HD.

Section HC 25 (Foreign-sourced amounts: non-resident trustees) is linked to section BD 1(4) and (5) in the core provisions, clarifying that section HC 25 overrides a core concept of the Act: taxation on the basis of both source and residence. This link is an illustration of the underlying theme of Part H, which is to modify the operation of Parts B to E in relation to a certain type of person or entity.

**Tax agent**

The main drafting improvement in subpart HD (Agents)isthe signposting of general tax agency obligations that a person declared to be an agent must satisfy. This signposting occurs in sections HD 3, HD 8 and HD 18. The rewritten provisions also draw together other agency provisions that are located in other parts of the 2004 Act.

**Mutual associations**

Sections HF 1(1) and HF 1(5) of the 2004 Act relating to income derived by, respectively, a mutual association and a member of a mutual association, have been relocated to sections CB 33 and CB 34 respectively. This is signalled at the beginning of subpart HE.

Section HF 1(2) of the 2004 Act has been relocated to subpart DV (Expenditure specific to certain entities), again to provide structural consistency in the Act for the treatment of deductions.

**Charitable trust**

The concept of "charitable trust" is defined for the purposes of the trust rules in section HH 1 of the 2004 Act. As this definition is virtually the same as the concept of "charitable trust" used in subpart CW, the

two terms have been rationalised. It is not necessary to retain a separate definition of "charitable trust" for the trust rules.

#### Intended change in Part H

**Section HC 34(2) - Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts**

Section HH 3(1) of the 2004 Act treats taxable distributions from a non-complying trust as a special

class of income that is not included in the beneficiary's annual return of income. These distributions are derived from trust funds when the trustees have not complied with their New Zealand tax obligations.

A taxable distribution of this nature is subject to a special tax rate, but the rules do not expressly contain a due date for payment of that tax. The current practice is to require payment of this tax by the terminal tax date of the person liable for the tax on the distribution. Section HC 34(2) makes this clear.

### Part I - Treatment of tax losses

Part I contains the loss rules. Since these rules were first introduced, many additions have been made to them, including ring-fenced losses for mining, and for CFC and FIF holdings. Over time, the Act has also extended the way in which a tax loss is used for purposes other than as an offset against the net income for a future tax year. The new subpart IA (General rules for tax losses) now provides clear links to the core provisions, as well as signposts to specific rules setting out the different ways in which a tax loss may be used.

The Part is structured to ensure that persons with tax losses carried forward must first use those losses by subtracting them from their net income for the tax year before they can make use of the variety of elective uses for tax losses. New terms central to these rules are "tax loss component", "tax loss", and "loss balance".

Subpart IA is a key part of the restructured Part I. Thissubpart also contains the general rules for carrying forward a tax loss, which are located in subparts IE and IFof the 2004 Act.

Subparts IC to IE deal with the main company-related loss rules. The loss grouping rules for companies are in subpart IC. Subpart ID sets out how the loss grouping rules are applied to a consolidated group of companies. The loss rules that apply to companies in certain amalgamations are set out in subpart IE.

The rules in subpart IP set out how losses may be used when the general loss rules and loss grouping rules are breached part-way through an income year. A breach of these rules occurs through a loss of continuity or commonality.

Subparts IQ to IT deal with how ring-fenced tax losses may be used. These losses include attributed CFC net losses, FIF net losses, mining and petroleum mining net losses, and life insurance policyholder net losses. Subpart IV contains the rules restricting the amount of a tax loss that a supplementary dividend holding company may use. Subpart IW sets out the circumstances in which a tax loss may be used to satisfy shortfall penalties.

#### Drafting improvements in Part I

Subpart IA now identifies those tax loss components that have specific restrictions on their use as "ring-fenced tax losses". The tax loss components treated as "ring-fenced tax losses" are as follows:

*   a net loss for a tax year of an LAQC (use determined under sections HA 24 to HA 27);
*   a life insurer's policyholder net loss under section EY 43(10) (use determined under section IT 1);
*   excess expenditure of investment funds (use determined under sections DV 5(4) and DV 7(2));
*   an attributed CFC net loss under section DN 4(3) (use determined under subpart IQ);
*   a FIF net loss under sections DN 8(3) and DN 9(3) (use determined under subpart IQ);
*   the net loss of a mining company, a resident mining operator and a non-resident mining operator when it relates to mining activities (use determined under subpart IS);
*   a net loss of a petroleum mining company if it relates to mining activities before the 1990-91 tax year (use determined under sections IS 5, IZ 2 and IZ 3);
*   an amount remitted as a condition of a new start grant under sections CX 48 or EW 46; and
*   a net loss of a portfolio tax rate entity (use determined under section HL 23).

Section IA 10 (Amended assessments) clarifies the effect on a person's tax loss, loss balance and tax loss components when the Commissioner makes an adjustment to the amount of a tax loss component for a tax year under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Intended change in Part I

**Section IA 4(1) - Tax losses**

The relationship between the tax loss carry-forward and the grouping rules was previously unclear. Under the 2004 Act, a potential ambiguity existed about whether losses carried forward by a person should be applied to the person's own net income before the grouping rules could be applied.

The policy intention is that, when a person is allowed to carry forward a "loss balance", they must first use the "loss balance" to offset against their own net income (subject to the restrictions on "ring-fenced tax losses").

New section IA 4 (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year) clarifies that a person who carries forward tax losses from one tax year to the next tax year must first use the carried-forward loss balance to reduce net income for that next tax year. It also clarifies that a person can apply the elective loss rules only to losses carried forward from the previous tax year if the balance of carried-forward tax losses exceeds the net income of the current tax year.

### Part L - Tax credits and other credit

The rewritten Part L contains the rules relating to tax credits that may be used to satisfy a person's income tax liability, and includes the core tax credit rules that were placed in sections BC 8, BC 9 and BC 10 of the 2004 Act. Part L also lists most of the rebates that were located in Part K of the 2004 Act, other than the family income assistance scheme (now the Working for Families or WFF tax credit) and the KiwiSaver tax credit.

Under the rewritten Part L, a person who has received a tax credit during a tax year includes the total amount of their credits in the assessment of their income tax liability and terminal tax for that year. However, the tax credits for housekeeping and for a payment of a charitable or public benefit gift may not be used to satisfy a person's income tax liability, as these continue to be paid separately under section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Subpart LA contains the general rules relating to the use of tax credits and includes aspects of the rules contained in sections BC 8 to BC 10 of the 2004 Act. In particular, subpart LA identifies when a tax credit arises, and sets out how the Act applies a tax credit to satisfy a person's obligations under section BB 2. It also sets out how WFF tax credits are used.

The provisions describing the amount and time at which a person has a tax credit for PAYE, provisional tax, RWT, NRWT, for families, and for caregivers are listed in subpart LB.

The tax credit rules relating to amounts that were rebates in subpart KC of the 2004 Act are now in subpart LC (Tax credits for natural persons). This subpart describes the amount and when a person can use the tax credit, as well as the adjustment rules for part-year residency and change in balance date.

Tax credits for donations or "charitable or public benefit gifts" are dealt with in subpart LD. The use of imputation credits as a tax credit is dealt with in subpart LE, and the use of FDP credits for tax credit purposes is set out in subpart LF.

Subpart LJ contains the rules that determine the tax credit a New Zealand resident can use for foreign taxes paid on income sourced outside New Zealand. These rules more clearly identify the segmental approach to the calculation of the maximum tax credit for income from a particular source or of a particular nature.

Subpart LK contains rules covering a variety of tax credits, including tax credits relating to attributed CFC income, consolidated companies and companies that have amalgamated.

The underlying foreign tax credit rules are set out in subpart LL. Subpart LO sets out when Maori authority tax credits arise and when they can be used. Subparts LP and LQ contain the tax credit rules for supplementary dividends and conduit relief. Policyholder tax credits for life insurers are dealt with in subpart LR.

Subpart LS contains the rules for the tax credits relating to certain zero-rated or exiting investors for their investment through a portfolio tax rate entity. It also contains the rules for the tax credit payable to a portfolio investor tax rate entity for the entity's positive rate investors.

#### Intended changes in Part L

**Sections LA 1 to LA 10 - Tax credits**

The rewritten Parts K and L consolidate the concepts of "rebate" and "tax credit". The rationalisation of these terms and restructuring of these rules gives rise to a minor adjustment in the use of rebates and tax credits.

The 2004 Act takes an inconsistent approach to the time at which tax credits arise and the tax year in which those tax credits are used to satisfy an obligation under the Act, particularly in a business context. The restructuring of the tax credit rules achieves a matching of the income year in which the tax credits arise to the corresponding tax year. This change overcomes timing problems inherent in some of the tax credit rules and better reflects the policy intention behind the rules.

This change relates to the time at which a tax credit may be used to satisfy an income tax liability. The rule applies only if a person has a tax credit. It does not apply if a tax credit is anticipated but not received.

For example, section LB 3 (which rewrites section LD3(2) of the 2004 Act) allows a person a tax credit "equal to the amount of tax withheld and paid in relation to the person's resident passive income for the tax year". Under section LD 3(2), the person was allowed a tax credit for all RWT paid in relation to the resident passive income derived during the tax year. This change ensures that only the part of the tax credit that relates to income included in the return of income for the tax year is included in a person's "total tax credit".

However, the clarification does not apply to tax credits that arise under subparts KC (Individual rebates) or KD (Tax credits for family support and family plus) of the 2004 Act, as these credits can only arise and be used in relation to a tax year.

**Section LC 9(2) - Apportionment for housekeeper and low-income tax credit**

An apportionment is necessary to determine the amount of entitlement to these credits when a person is absent from New Zealand during a tax year. The policy is to apportion the tax credit on the basis of absence or presence in New Zealand.

In the 2004 Act, two methods applied, with a weekly basis of apportionment applying to persons having regular pay periods and a daily basis to all other persons. The 2007 Act simplifies the apportionment calculation by providing one method - the daily basis - for all situations.

Commentary on parts of the act - M to Z
=======================================

Commentary on parts M to Z of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Part M - Tax credits paid in cash

Part M contains rules relating to tax credits that are paid rather than applied to satisfy a person's income tax liability. In particular, it includes the rules for the Working for Families tax credits, and the superannuation savings scheme (KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds).

The Working for Families (WFF) tax credit rules are placed outside Part L because they mostly relate to the delivery of tax credits to eligible people on an interim basis during a tax year. This Part provides for the calculation of the various credits, which are then dealt with under Part L. Similarly, the placement of tax credits under the superannuation savings scheme in Part M ensures that it is not confused with tax credits that relate to satisfying a person's income tax liability.

Subparts MA to MC contain the general provisions for the WFF tax credit rules. Subpart MB contains the rules for calculating the amount of income on which thefamily tax credit is based. Subpart MC lists the rules under which a person may be entitled to a WFF taxcredit.

Subparts MD to MF provide for the calculation and delivery of the various components of the WFF tax credits.

Subpart MK contains the rules providing the tax creditfor the KiwiSaver scheme and complying superannuation funds.

### Part O - Memorandum accounts

Part O contains the rules relating to memorandum accounts. The term "memorandum account" is a new, generic term covering imputation credit accounts, FDP accounts, CTR accounts, branch equivalent tax accounts, ASC accounts, Maori authority credit accounts and policyholder credit accounts.

The main purpose of Part O is to provide a way of tracking payments of tax, tax-relief amounts, and other types of payment made by or to certain entities in a way that enables the subsequent delivery of a tax credit under Part L or other tax benefits to people with interests in these entities. As a result, Part O indirectly relates to the core provisions via Part L and other provisions.

This Part draws common rules together and sets out separate tables for credits and debits that summarise the credit and debit rules for each type of memorandum account. These tables follow their related subpart. There are no intended changes in legislation listed in Schedule 51 for Part O.

Subpart OA contains the general rules that apply to all memorandum accounts. Examples of general rules include how to determine the balance of a memorandum account at any time, continuity rules that must be satisfied to preserve the carry-forward of credits in corporate entities from one tax year to the next, and how to calculate a maximum permitted ratio for attachment of certain credits to certain distributions.

Each subpart, from OB to OK, contains the specific rules for each type of memorandum account. These specific rules detail the credit or debit amount and the time at which they arise. Each subpart also quantifies the credit amount that may be attached to a distribution from the entity.

Each subpart also states the consequence of an account having a debit balance at 31 March and the additional amounts that may be payable as a result. Subpart OB deals with imputation credit accounts, subpart OC with FDP accounts, subpart OD with CTR accounts, subpart OE with BETA accounts, subpart OF with ASC accounts, subpart OJ with policyholder credit accounts, and subpart OK with Maori authority credit accounts.

Subpart OP contains the rules that set out how a consolidated group of companies applies the individual and general memorandum account rules. It also sets out specific memorandum account rules that apply only to a consolidated group of companies.

#### Drafting improvements in Part

The main improvements in the clarity of the legislation are expected to arise from:

*   restricting Part O to provisions relating to memorandum accounts, and as a result, moving tax payment and the tax refund rules to Part R;
*   having separate tables for credits and debits that summarise the rules for credits and debits for each type of memorandum account;
*   rationalising common rules into a new subpart OA; and
*   drawing together common rules that apply to all or most memorandum accounts, such as consolidated group rules and the resident's restricted amalgamation rules.

Tables have been used at the end of each subpart to provide quick access to the credits and debits that arise within each type of memorandum account. A separate table has been set out for all credits and debits, with a brief description of their nature, the date of the credit or debit and a link to the provision that defines that particular credit or debit.

A number of repetitive rules have been rationalised and placed in a new subpart OA. For example, in the 2004 Act, a separate rule creates the opening balance for each type of memorandum account in each subpart. A similar situation arises for the rules relating to resident's restricted amalgamations, as these rules apply to most memorandum accounts.

Two minor consequential drafting changes have been added as a result of a newly defined term "memorandum account" to allow the drafting of some general rules in the rewritten subpart OA:

*   In the definition of "tax position" in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), paragraph (j) includes the new term "memorandum account". Before this amendment, paragraph (j) of this definition referred to an undefined phrase "tax account". The phrase "tax account" does not appear elsewhere in the TAA and is used only once in the 2004 Act, in section MBB 2. It is clear from the language of the defined term "tax position" that the phrase "tax account" is intended to refer to the various memorandum accounts in Part M of the 2004 Act.
*   In section 22(2) of the TAA, paragraphs (k) and (kb) have been combined and now refer only to memorandum accounts, other than a CTR account or an ASC account.

### Part R - General collection rules

Part R consolidates the rules that set out how and when a person satisfies their obligations for amounts imposed under Part BB. The rules relating to tax payments and refunds from subparts MB to MD of the 2004 Act have been moved to Part R. Those rules related to terminal tax, provisional tax, PAYE intermediaries, tax pooling, early payment discounts and the use of tax refunds.

When a person satisfies an obligation under Part R, in most circumstances, a credit of tax will arise under Part L. When a company satisfies an income tax or FDP obligation, the company is generally required to account for those payments under the memorandum account rules in Part O.

Subpart RA draws together the general rules that relate to several different payment types. In particular, Part R provides a clear link from the obligations imposed

under section BB 2 to the detailed rules for each payment type in the relevant subparts. Subpart RA also contains a set of common rules - for example, the date by which payment is required - and the treatment of amounts withheld by the payer as being received by thepayee.

Subpart RB contains the rules that relate to the satisfaction of a person's terminal tax under section BC 8. This subpart also incorporates section NG 3 of the 2004 Act, which applies to a person with non-resident passive income when the NRWT withheld by the payer of the income is treated as the income tax liability in relation to that income.

The provisional tax rules are set out in subpart RC. These rules describe the circumstances in which a person has a provisional tax obligation, the methods for calculating the amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year, and the payment methods relating to a person's provisional tax liability for a tax year.

The PAYE and ESCT rules are now located in subpart RD because of the similarity in their operation. These rules define the PAYE rules and list the types of payments to which they apply. They also show how an employer calculates the amount of PAYE or ESCT to be withheld and when the amount withheld is to be paid to the Commissioner.

Subparts RE, RF and RG set out the rules describing when and how amounts are withheld from payments consisting of resident and non-resident passive income, as well as amounts in relation to foreign dividends received by a New Zealand company. These subparts also describe when and how these amounts are paid to the Commissioner or are treated as being paid.

Subpart RM consolidates the rules dealing with refunds of overpayments of taxes and other obligations under the Act. Subpart RP sets out the rules relating to PAYE intermediaries and tax pooling accounts.

The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 have been moved to and consolidated with associated provisions in subpart RD. Some administrative rules (which mainly relate to information and notification requirements) have been moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994.

#### Drafting improvements in Part R

A number of rules have been rationalised in subpart RA to avoid unnecessary duplication. Because of the intention to align payment dates, all payment dates are now located in subpart RA.

In the 2004 Act, payment and collection rules were spread through many of the subparts and related to:

*   the treatment of an amount withheld from a payment of income for income tax and other purposes;
*   the treatment of the various payment obligations as a debt due to the Commissioner; and
*   who must satisfy the various payment obligations.

A minor clarification has been made in the provisional tax rules in relation to the attribution rule for services in section NC 37(5) of the 2004 Act. It is now clear that the period of time by which a return of income is filed includes an extension of time agreed to by the Commissioner. This minor clarification provides a consistent rule for those who have similar requirements for provisional tax purposes.

### Part Y - Definitions and related matters

Definitions continue to be located at the end of the Act, just before the transitional provisions. Subpart YA lists the defined terms, whether the substance of a definition is set out in section YA 1 or is located close to its operating rules. An example of this latter approach is the definitions of the different types of trusts:

*   "Complying trust" is defined in section HC 10.
*   "Foreign trust" is defined in section HC 11.
*   "Non-complying trust" is defined in section HC 12.

Subpart YB defines "associated person". This definition has been restructured to better communicate the concepts underlying the various codes which define "association".

The meaning of "control" is set out in subpart YC, and includes the voting interest and market value interest rules. Subpart YD sets out the rules relating to residence and source. Subpart YE contains the rules describing how references to balance dates and years are intended to be read throughout the Act. General rules for currency conversion appear in subpart YF.

#### Intended changes in Part Y

**Section YA 1 - Definition of "land"**

This definition has been rationalised. In particular, the first three paragraphs apply generally for the Act.

**Section YA 1 - Definition of "mortgage"**

This definition was introduced into the Income Tax Act at a time when mortgages were part of the system of land tax. The definition has been updated and simplified and now applies generally for the Act.

**Section YA 1 - Definition of "natural resource"**

The concept of "natural resource" is found in two definitions in the Act and is also a term used in many of New Zealand's double taxation agreements. The 2004 Act does not define this term, and as part of the rewrite objective is to provide clear legislation, it is desirable to define it.

The new definition of "natural resource" is derived from a review of all natural resource-related definitions within other New Zealand legislation. The definition in section YA 1 includes land, water, air, soil or subsoil, minerals, geographic or geologic features, electromagnetic spectrum, forms of energy, living organisms, ecosystems and any rights or interests in any of these things.

**Section YA 1 - Definition of "pay"**

The definition draws together a number of related terms and applies them generally for the Act. The Interpretation Act 1999 makes it clear that all parts of speech and grammatical forms of a word (for example, "pay, paid, and payment") are to have the same meaning throughout the Income Tax Act, unless the context dictates a different meaning.

**Use of the defined term "tax year" in business-related rules**

In the rewrite of Parts F to O of the 2004 Act, officials identified a number of provisions through the Act that refer to the defined term "tax year" (31 March year), when the context of these rules indicates that the reference should be to the defined term "income year" (balance date-related). This is particularly evident in rules relating to commercial activities.

The affected provisions are listed in the appendix to Schedule 51. The term "tax year" has either been omitted from the rule, as the term is unnecessary in the context of the rule, or has been rewritten to better reflect the income year context of the rule.

### Part Z - Repeals, amendments and savings

Part Z contains the transitional rules, which have the same function as the equivalent rules set out in Part Y of the 2004 Act. The transitional rules apply from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year corresponding to the 2008-09 tax year.

Part Z also contains:

*   repeals of enactments (section ZA 1 and Schedule48);
*   consequential changes required for other Acts of Parliament, including the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section ZA 2 and Schedules 49 and 50);
*   transitional rules relating to the commencement (section ZA 3);
*   savings of binding rulings (section ZA 4); and
*   savings of accrual determinations (section ZA 5).

The transitional provisions provide that:

*   the plain language legislation is to have full effect from the date the legislation comes into effect; and
*   no change in the effect of the law from the 2004 Act is intended unless notified as a change in Schedule 51.

The 2004 Act can be used as an interpretive guide but only in cases when the meaning of a provision in the 2007 Act is unclear or gives rise to absurdity. This rule does not apply when changes in the law are intended and notified, or provisions in the Act are subsequently amended and introduce new policy. The provisions of the 2004 Act may also be used to identify that an unintended change in policy has occurred in the rewritten Act. The transitional provisions do not address this situation, however, so a non-legislative process is being developed for this purpose.

The most important transitional provisions are those in sections A 2(2), ZA 1(2) (When repeal effective), ZA 3(3), (4) and (5) (Intention of new law), and ZA 4 (Saving of binding rulings).

Subsections ZA 3(1) and (2) ensure that errors in other specific sources that reference corresponding provisions between the 2004 and 2007 Acts can be corrected, as contemplated by the Privy Council in the case of _Vela Fishing Ltd v CIR_ (2003) 21 NZTC 18,123.

**Section ZA 3 - Transitional provisions**

The transitional provisions in section ZA 3 are intended to:

*   provide a clear signal to users of the new law that no change from the 2004 Act is intended;
*   preserve existing case law and Inland Revenue practice and policy statements as much as is reasonably possible;
*   require the 2004 Act to be used as a guide to interpreting the meaning of the 2007 Act when the meaning of the new law is unclear or ambiguous;
*   ensure that each of the provisions listed in Schedule 51 is not subject to the transitional provisions; and
*   ensure that any provision that has been amended to introduce new policy after the new legislation comes into effect is not subject to the transitional provisions.

**Testing for unintended changes in policy**

It is reasonable to expect that the drafting of legislation in a comprehensive rewrite project will result in some inadvertent law changes. The courts may interpret new phrases and wording in a way that moves the interpretation of the rewritten Act away from the policy contained in the 2004 Act. For this reason, great care has been taken to ensure that the provisions in the 2007 Act are unambiguous and reflect the policy of the 2004 Act.

This has involved a process of testing and consultation on the drafting throughout the bill; from the development of the exposure draft, through to the introduction copy and reported-back versions of the bill.

Each of the drafts of legislation was reviewed on at least one occasion by a private-sector tax specialist. Significant levels of private-sector consultation also provide assurance that the rewritten legislation is intended to reflect accurately the current law unless notified.

**Unintended changes in legislative outcome**

It is still possible for a provision in the 2007 Act to contain an unintended change in legislative outcome. However, when the provision is clear and does not lead to an absurdity, the 2004 Act cannot be used as a guide to interpretation. In this situation, the 2004 Act can only be used to support a submission that there has been an unintended change in outcome.

The government has also given a commitment to promote retrospective amendments to the 2007 Act in circumstances when a provision in that Act contains an unintentional change in outcome of the law compared with the 2004 Act. This commitment is intended to avoid disadvantaging taxpayers who rely on the current law.

There will be occasions, however, when there will be differing views on whether a provision in the 2007 Act contains an unintended change in law. The Rewrite Advisory Panel has a role in this process. It consists of a representative from the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Treasury, Inland Revenue and the independent chair. Its functions are to:

*   consider any case brought to its attention on whether a provision in the 2007 Act has changed the effect of the law set out in the 2004 Act;
*   advise the government of its conclusion on each case; and
*   maintain a watching brief on the consistency of drafting of future income tax legislation.

This role of the Panel is intended to give taxpayers assurance that there will be a transparent process in place when the legislation comes into effect for determining whether it contains any changes in law, and to provide assurance that the drafting of income tax legislation will follow the styles and practices adopted in the 2007 Act.

**Retrospective legislation**

One concern that arises when considering enacting retrospective legislation is that any changes may have an adverse impact on a taxpayer's previously filed tax position. This impact will be considered when introducing the retrospective legislation. There remains the possibility that a future government will decide to retain the unintended change in policy. This arises because future governments and parliaments are not bound by an earlier government's policy or commitment to change the law.

Taxpayers who rely on the transitional provisions in coming to their tax position and who have been adversely affected by a government decision not to change the law are still required to meet their tax obligations.

They may be entitled to relief from penalties and use-of-money interest, however. The relief is to be available only if the person involved has taken reasonable care in taking an acceptable tax position, as provided for in section 141A of the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2004.

If, however, a person takes an unacceptable tax position resulting in a shortfall of tax in excess of the thresholds referred to in section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, they may be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest.

**Section ZA 4 - Binding rulings**

Section 91G of the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2004 states that a binding ruling does not apply from the date a taxation law is repealed or amended if the repeal or amendment changes the way the taxation law referred to in the ruling applies.

A significant consideration is the potential cost to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue if new rulings become necessary because existing binding rulings applied for a period after the rewritten legislation comes into effect.

The same approach adopted for the 2004 Act has been adopted for the 2007 Act binding ruling section ZA 4. This section ensures that a binding ruling continues to apply to the provisions that correspond to provisions of the 2004 Act that were the subject of the ruling (if the ruling continues to exist). For example, a binding ruling issued for three years, on the basis of the equivalent former legislation, with effect from the 2007-08 to 2009-10 tax years will result in the binding ruling remaining effective until the end of the 2009-10 tax year.

Binding rulings are not intended, however, to apply to any provision that does not have a corresponding provision in the old law. The two typical cases when this occurs are provisions:

*   listed in Schedule 51; and
*   those amending the 2007 Act to enact new policy.

The reference to the new law as being the law which "corresponds to the old law" means it is Parliament's intention that taxpayers and Inland Revenue should not have to go to the time and effort of obtaining or issuing replacement binding rulings. To support this, section ZA 4 specifies that the Commissioner is prohibited from making a new binding ruling if the existing binding ruling is to continue to have effect. In other words, the intention is that the requirement that the new law "corresponds to the old law" is not intended to be given a narrow, obstructive interpretation that would prevent binding rulings being saved.

In the vast majority of cases, it is anticipated that there will be no doubt over the existence of the "corresponding" new law. It should be very clear that there is a new law which corresponds to and expresses the same ideas as the old law, even though it uses plainer language and is located under a different section number.

**Section ZA 5 - Savings of accrual determinations**

The "preservation" approach adopted to save binding rulings has been applied to continue accrual determinations in a similar fashion.

Commentary on parts of the act - schedules
==========================================

Income Tax Act 2007 – commentary on the schedules.

### Schedules

The schedules have been renumbered and grouped by function. The appendix to Schedule 19 of the 2004 Act is of little practical use. Instead, it is now clear that the Commissioner's practice of issuing PAYE tables replaces this appendix, and is authorised under section RD 11(4). The comparative numbering for the schedules is set out in Table 3.

#### Table 3 - Comparative schedule numbering

| 2004 Act Schedule | 2007 Act Schedule |
| --- | --- |
| Schedule 1 | Schedule 1 |
| Schedule 2 part a | Schedule 5 |
| Schedule 2 part b | Schedule 1 |
| Schedule 3 | Schedule 24 |
| Schedule 4 | Schedule 25 |
| Schedule 5 | Schedule 26 |
| Schedule 6 | Schedule 27 |
| Schedule 6b | Schedule 19 |
| Schedule 7 | Schedule 20 |
| Schedule 8 | Schedule 17 |
| Schedule 9 | Schedule 18 |
| Schedule 10 | Schedule 10 |
| Schedule 11 | Schedule 12 |
| Schedule 11b | Schedule 11 |
| Schedule 12 | Schedule 31 |
| Schedule 13 | Schedule 3 |
| Schedule 14 | Schedule 1 |
| Schedule 15 | Schedule 37 |
| Schedule 16 | Schedule 13 |
| Schedule 17 | Schedule 14 |
| Schedule 18 | Schedule 36 |
| Schedule 19 | Schedule 2 |
| Schedule 19, appendix | omitted |
| Schedule 20 | Schedule 48 |
| Schedule 21 | Schedule 49 |
| Schedule 22 | Schedule 50 |
| Schedule 22a | Schedule 51 |
| Schedule 23 | Schedule 52 |

### Schedule 51

Schedule 51 contains the list of policy changes that have been approved by the government for inclusion in the 2007 Act. The policy changes are minor in nature. They were listed for consultation in exposure drafts of legislation and in submissions made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. An explanation for each of the intended changes appears earlier in this article.

### Importance of drafting approach for future legislation

The key aim of the rewrite has been to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. It is intended that this plain drafting approach be adopted for all future income tax legislation. It is therefore useful to review the key principles on which the 2007 Act is based.

Plain drafting has focused on refining structure, using plain language techniques, and clarifying the structural relationships between the core provisions and Parts of theAct.

Rewriting the income tax legislation has been integral to increasing voluntary compliance with the tax laws. The reason is that legislation that is clear, uses plain language and which is structurally consistent should make it easier for taxpayers to identify and comply with their income tax obligations.

The rewrite cannot, however, eliminate all the complexity and inconsistency of tax law because the subject matter is inherently complex. The challenge has been to ensure that the complexity results from the concepts rather than from the way the information is presented. The 2007 Act addresses this challenge through structure, drafting style and integrating the interpretive principles of the Interpretation Act 1999 with the drafting.

#### Structure

The overall scheme of the Act is determined by the structure and general application of the core provisions. This is complemented by links to the various parts which provide the detail for the workings of the core provisions.

The structure is based on the principle of working from the provisions that are the most generally applicable to those least generally applicable. This applies on an Act-wide basis as well as within each Part and subpart.

The subparts represent a grouping of provisions that address similar or related rules. For example, subpart CE addresses transactions relating to the income of employees and contractors. Each section in Parts C to E has been rewritten to address a single concept. In some cases this has led to sections in the 2004 Act being broken up into a number of parts.

In the 2007 Act, the main operative rule of a section is located at the start of the section. Other subsections within that section are then drafted to supplement the main operative rule. The 2007 Act also makes extensive use of signposts and cross-references to guide the reader to other relevant or related provisions. Each section is followed by cross-references to the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act and a list of the defined terms inthe section.

#### Drafting style

The drafting approach used throughout the rewrite of the Income Tax Act is based on the style set out in the government discussion document, _Rewriting the Income Tax Act - objectives, process, guidelines_ (December 2004) in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel Office Drafting Manual.

Examples of these guidelines include:

*   replacing archaic expressions with more modern ones, while taking care not to change the law inadvertently, by rewriting words or expressions that have a well-understood meaning;
*   using new defined terms when a term has a meaning that varies from its ordinary non-tax meaning, although some terms have been retained because there is a depth of case history behind them, and simpler words of equivalent meaning cannot be found;
*   harmonising definitions when possible, making it easier to find defined terms;
*   relocating the detail of definitions that are used for specific provisions from section OB 1 in the 2004 Act and placing them within the relevant provisions while retaining a reference to the definition has been retained in section YA 1; and
*   placing reliance on aspects of the Interpretation Act 1999.

#### Rules of interpretation under the Interpretation Act 1999

The main rule for the interpretation of statutes in New Zealand is contained in section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 which states, _"The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose"_.

To reflect the purpose of the legislation, the drafting approach adopted in the rewritten Act:

*   takes into account the scheme of the Act as a whole, that is to impose tax;
*   takes into account the subject matter of the Part or subpart in which the section is situated;
*   takes into account the context of the section itself as well as the words in the section;
*   attempts to make the underlying policy more easily identifiable from the most natural reading of the provision; and
*   relies more on the general rules of interpretation set out in the Act.

#### Readers' aid

Readers' aids are contemplated by subsections 5(2) and (3) of the Interpretation Act 1999, which state:

> _"(2) The matters that may be considered in ascertaining the meaning of an enactment include the indications provided in the enactment._
> 
> _"(3) Examples of those indications are preambles, the analysis, a table of contents, headings to Parts and sections, marginal notes, diagrams, graphics, examples and explanatory material, and the organisation and format of the enactment."_

In addition to diagrams, flowcharts, notes and lists of defined terms, the drafting of the Act uses Part, subpart, section headings and subsection headings. Tables are used extensively in Part O (Memorandum accounts) and also in Parts R and Y. Lists of defined terms follow each section.

#### Defined term

All defined terms in the Act are listed in section YA 1. The drafting approach adopted for definitions that are not widely used through the Act locates those terms close to their relevant operative provisions if that is likely to assist readers. Section YA 1 then lists that definition by pointing to the substantive definition. This location may be either within the section or within the relevant subpart.

The drafting style adopted for definitions led to some defined terms being introduced by the word "means" and of others by "includes". In the 2007 Act, the term "means" is used to introduce an exhaustive definition. The use of "includes" with a definition generally introduces an incomplete definition.

#### Parts of speech and other grammatical forms of word

Section 32 of the Interpretation Act 1999 states _"Parts of speech and grammatical forms of a word that is defined in an enactment have corresponding meanings in the same enactment"_.

Definitions in the 2007 Act rely on section 32 of the Interpretation Act for different parts of speech or other grammatical forms of a word that have a corresponding meaning. For example, it is not necessary to add to a definition of "sell" a statement that "sale" has a corresponding meaning.

The defined term "pay" is an example of this drafting approach as the defined term "payment" in the 2004 Act is no longer necessary.

#### Parts of speech, number and gender

Sections 31, 33, 35 and 36 of the Interpretation Act 1999 establish rules in relation to parts of speech, number and gender. The effects of these rules are that:

*   in all Acts of Parliament, the singular includes the plural, and vice versa; and
*   unless an income tax provision adopts a unique approach to the determination of time and distance, any references to time and distance used in the rewritten Act are to use the rules set out in the Interpretation Act 1999.

#### Ambulatory nature of law

Section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1999 specifies that _"An enactment applies to circumstances as they arise"_.

The provision recognises the fact that an Act of Parliament may last for many years and operate within a changed society where the courts must consider circumstances that are often very different from those in which it was originally enacted.

For example, the purpose of the foreign investment fund rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents who have overseas investments are taxed on their share of the overseas entity's income on a current basis. As the nature of investments evolves, the courts will be called on to consider to what extent a new form of investment may fall within one of the classes of foreign investment fund referred to in section EX 29.

The drafters of the Income Tax Act 2007 have tried to achieve an enduring piece of legislation through the use of plain language and clear structure.

Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective from 1 April 2024. Background The interest limitation rules were introduced in 2021 and deny a deduction for interest incurred for residential investment property. For property acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest deductions have been denied in full since 1 October 2021. For property acquired before 27 March 2021, and borrowings drawn down before 27 March 2021, the ability to claim interest deductions has been phased out as follows: Period that interest is incurred Percentage of interest deductions allowed 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 75% 1 April 2022 to 31 Mach 2023 75% 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 25% 1 April 2025 onwards 0% Date: March 2024 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It is now proposed that interest deductibility be phased back in on the following basis: Period that interest is incurred Percentage of interest deductions allowed 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 80% 1 April 2025 onwards 100% The above phasing will apply to all taxpayers, whether they acquired their property, or drew down their lending, before or after 27 March 2021. The current rules determining which types of land and taxpayers are subject to the interest limitation rules and providing for specific anti-avoidance would continue to be necessary while deductibility is being reintroduced and would, therefore, be retained. It is proposed that the interest limitation rules will be substantially repealed from 1 April 2025, when all taxpayers are allowed full deductions. However, the current rules that allow taxpayers whose disposals of residential land are subject to tax to claim a deduction for interest that was denied under the interest limitation rules at the time the property is disposed of, would be retained. Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are: ▪ The ability to claim interest deductions will be phased back in with 80% of deductions allowed from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 and 100% allowed from 1 April 2025 onwards. ▪ Phasing back in of interest deductibility will be allowed for all taxpayers, whether they acquired their property, or drew down lending, before or after 27 March 2021. ▪ The current rules determining who, and what types of land, the interest limitation rules apply to will continue to apply. Any taxpayers, or types of land, that are currently exempt from the interest limitation rules will continue to be exempt. ▪ The interest limitation rules will be repealed from 1 April 2025 once all taxpayers are entitled to full deductibility. ▪ The rules that allow taxpayers whose disposals of residential land are subject to tax to claim a deduction for interest that was denied under the interest limitation rules at the time the property is disposed of, will be retained.

This proposal will also apply to interest incurred to acquire an ownership interest in, or become a beneficiary of, an interposed residential property holder (ie, a company that holds residential land). The interest limitation phasing rules will continue to apply based on interest incurred for the period 1 April to 31 March each year. For most taxpayers this will be the same as their income year. However, for taxpayers with non-standard balance dates, this will require them to calculate the amount of interest denied based on different percentages for different parts of their income year. Example 1: Non-standard balance dates Enia has a 30 June balance date. She owns several rental properties acquired before 27 March 2021. For the 2023–24 income year, which ends on 30 June 2024, Enia would be allowed a deduction for 50% of her interest expenses for the period 1 July 2023 to 31 March 2024 and 80% of her interest expenses for the period 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024. Scope of the rules It is proposed that there would be no changes to the types of properties, and taxpayers, that will be covered by the interest limitation rules. Until the ability to claim interest deductions is fully phased back in, the rules would continue to apply on the same basis as before. This means that land that is used, for example, as a business premises, build-to-rent land, land used for social, emergency, council or transitional housing, and land held by property developers would continue to be exempt from the rules. In addition, the interposed entity and other specific anti-avoidance rules would continue to apply while the interest limitation rules are being phased out. The rules will be substantially repealed from 1 April 2025 once the ability to claim interest deductions is fully phased back in.

It is proposed that this rule would be retained so that it can continue to apply for future sales of properties that were subject to the interest limitation rules. The rule will be relocated to section DZ 24. Example 2: Deductions on sale Jack and Aria buy a rental property in November 2022 for $700,000. They borrow $400,000 at 4% interest to complete the purchase. In July 2024, they sell the rental property for $710,000. The sale is subject to the bright-line test. Jack and Aria paid a total of $26,600 interest, that would have been deductible if the interest limitation rules had not applied because the property was used to derive taxable income. Therefore, the interest is potentially deductible in the year of sale. The property was bought for $700,000 and sold for $710,000 20 months later. In the year of sale, the $710,000 sale price is income under the bright-line test, and the cost of the property may be deducted under section DB 23. Section DH 11(1) provides that the original cost of $700,000 is deemed to be increased by the disallowed interest of $26,600. However, section EL 20 provides that, in the year of sale, the amount of the deduction is limited to income from the sale ($710,000) plus net gains from other taxable land sales. If this is the only property Jack and Aria sold that year, the deduction would therefore be limited to $710,000 (resulting in no net income to be taxed or loss deducted). This would mean only $10,000 of the disallowed interest would be deductible. The excess amount of $16,600 would be carried forward and applied against any taxable land sale gains Jack and Aria have in later years.

This will return the bright-line test to its original purpose of ensuring land speculators pay their fair share of tax on gains from property sales. As a result of this change, other consequential amendments to the bright-line test and associated rules are proposed to simplify their application. This includes removing the complex apportionment rules for the main home exclusion and expanding the rollover relief rules. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect for disposals of residential land where the bright-line end date (generally the date a binding contract to sell is formed) occurs on or after 1 July 2024 (more information on the bright-line end date can be found below). Background The bright-line tests tax income from the sale of residential land where it is sold within a specified period. There are currently three different bright-line tests that could apply to the sale of residential land: ▪ the 10-year bright-line test applies to land acquired on or after 27 March 2021, which is not new build land, that is disposed of within 10 years ▪ the 5-year new build bright-line test applies to new build land (defined as land that has a self-contained residence or abode that received a code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2020) acquired on or after 27 March 2021, that is disposed of within five years, and ▪ the 5-year bright-line test applies to land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021 that is disposed of within five years. “Residential land” is defined as land that has a dwelling on it, land for which the owner has an arrangement to erect a dwelling, or bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it. It does not include land used predominately as business premises or farmland.

This objective is to improve compliance with the other land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 by supplementing the intention test in section CB 6, which makes gains from the sale of land purchased with a purpose or intention of disposal taxable. This ensures that land speculators pay their fair share of tax on gains from property sales. Given this objective, it is proposed that other policy settings are also returned to those that existed when the original 2-year bright-line test was introduced. In particular, it is proposed that the complex apportionment rules for the main home exclusion be removed. This will mean that the main home exclusion will apply if the land has been used predominantly (ie, more than 50% of the land area), for most of the time the person owned the land (ie, more than 50% of the period), for a dwelling that was the person’s main home. The main home exclusion will also be modified so that the period when a dwelling is being constructed on the land is ignored in determining whether the land has been used predominantly as a main home for most of the period. Consistent with the objective of simplifying the rules, and with returning to the original intention for the bright-line test, it is also proposed to extend the rollover relief rules. The rollover relief rules essentially allow a transfer between specified people to be ignored for the purposes of the bright-line test. The current rules only apply to a very limited set of transfers. It is proposed that these rules be extended to apply to all transfers between associated persons, provided they have been associated for at least two years prior to the transfer. Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are: ▪ The current 10-year and 5-year new build bright-line tests in section CB 6A would be repealed and replaced with a new 2-year bright-line test. ▪ The time and land area apportionment rules in section CB 6A would be repealed and replaced with simpler rules. These apportionment rules are currently used for determining the application of the bright-line test where the land is used partially as a main home. ▪ The main home exclusion in section CB 16A would be returned to its original form. The exclusion would apply if the land has been used predominantly (ie, more than 50% of the land area), for most of the time the person owned the land (ie, more than 50% of the period), for a dwelling that was the person’s main home.

Detailed analysis Returning to two years It is proposed that the current 10-year bright-line test and 5-year new build bright-line test in section CB 6A, and the 5-year bright-line test in section CZ 39 be repealed and replaced by a new 2-year bright-line test. This new test will apply if the person’s bright-line end date for the land is within two years of the person’s bright-line start date. For standard sales of land, the bright-line start date will continue to be the date the transfer of the land is registered to the person under the Land Transfer Act 2017. As is the case under current law, the bright-line start date is modified in the following situations: Type of acquisition Bright-line start date Land outside New Zealand Date on which the instrument is registered under foreign laws No instrument registered Date the person acquired an estate or interest in the land “Off the plans” acquisition Date the sale and purchase agreement was entered into Subdivided land Bright-line start date for the undivided land Freehold estate converted from a lease with perpetual right of renewal Date of the grant of the leasehold estate Date: March 2024 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Type of acquisition Bright-line start date Joint tenancy converted to a tenancy in common or tenancy in common converted to a joint tenancy To the extent the person’s share in the land is unchanged, the bright-line start date for the land before the conversion Change of trustee Bright-line start date for the original trustee The bright-line end date is the date that a vendor enters into a binding agreement for sale and purchase to dispose of the land, even if some conditions still need to be met (such as obtaining finance, a building report or a Land Information Memorandum). Where land is disposed of with no agreement to dispose of the property, the bright-line end date is the earliest of: ▪ the date on which a person makes a gift of the land ▪ the date on which the land is compulsorily acquired under any Act by the Crown, a local authority or a public authority ▪ if there is a mortgage secured on the land, the date on which the land is disposed of by or for the mortgagee ▪ the date on which the estate or interest is disposed of (usually the settlement date). Application date This new test will apply to disposals of residential land where the bright-line end date occurs on or after 1 July 2024. The new 2-year bright-line test will apply if the bright-line end date is within two years of the bright-line start date. Example 3: Application date Jonathan entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire residential land in late 2021 with the transfer being registered on the title on 5 January 2022. He used the land as a rental property. He enters into a sale and purchase agreement to sell the land on 20 June 2024. The current 10-year bright-line test will apply to tax the disposal of the land. The land was acquired after 21 March 2021, and the bright-line end date for the land (being the date the sale and purchase agreement was entered into), was prior to 1 July 2024. Martin also acquired residential land with a bright-line start date on 5 January 2022, which he used as a rental property. He disposes of the land on 27 July 2024. Because the bright-line end date for the land is after 1 July 2024, the new 2-year bright-line test Date: March 2024 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] will apply. But because the bright-line end date is more than two years after the bright- line start date, the disposal will not be taxable under the new 2-year bright-line test. Main home exclusion Under the 10-year bright-line test (and the 5-year new build bright-line test), the application of the main home exclusion depends on apportionment. There are currently two bases of apportionment: ▪ Time apportionment: the main home exclusion only applies for periods when a property is physically used as the owner’s main home (subject to a “12-month buffer”, where the use can be changed without consequence). ▪ Land area apportionment: apportionment is also required where the land area is used for dual purposes and is not predominantly used as a person’s main home. It is proposed that these apportionment rules be removed from the bright-line test. Instead, it is proposed that the main home exclusion in section CB 16A would apply if the land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owned the land, for a dwelling that was the person’s main home. The proposed requirement that the land is used predominantly for the person’s main home means that most of the area of the land (ie, more than 50%) must have been actually used for the home. The test is based on a person’s actual use of the property and not the person’s intended use of the property. The land also must be used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50% of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land. The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on vacation or prior to settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private residential use. This main home exclusion would either apply or it would not apply; it would not apply on a proportionate basis. As a result, when the property is used less than 50% for the main home of the person, either by land area or time, then the main home exception will not apply. Example 4: Main home exclusion Kate acquires residential land, with a bright-line start date of 28 March 2023. She occupies the property as her main home for 14 months.

The bright-line end date for the land is 20 September 2024. The main home exclusion will apply to Kate so that any gain from the sale of her property will not be subject to tax under the new 2-year bright-line test. This is because Kate occupied the property as her main home for more than 50% of the period that she owned it. The main home exclusion continues to be subject to limitations so that it cannot be applied by a person more than twice in two years, or where a person (or group of persons) has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. Construction periods Consistent with amendments proposed for the 5-year bright-line test in the Bill as introduced, it is proposed that the main home exclusion would ignore the period during which the person’s main home is constructed when determining whether the residential land was used as the person’s main home for most of the bright-line period. The ordinary meaning of “construction” would apply, which would encompass work to build or erect the main home, including the design phase. In many cases, construction would be considered complete once the code compliance certificate has been issued under the Building Act 2004. However, the exact length of the construction period would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Example 5: Land not predominantly used for main home Aroha owns a residential property with three townhouses located on it. The bright-line start date for the property is 30 January 2024. Aroha uses one flat as her main home. Aroha’s flat occupies approximately 40% of the land area. Aroha rents out the other two flats. Aroha disposes of the property in 2025 with a bright-line end date of 30 November 2025. Because Aroha did not use the property predominantly as her main home (ie, 60% of the land area was occupied by rented townhouses), the main home exclusion will not apply.

The section remains vacant for three months while Raj decides what to do with the property. Raj then enters into agreements to have a home constructed on the property. It takes 13 months for the home to be planned, consented, constructed and a code compliance certificate to be issued. Raj then lives in the property for six months before a change of job requires him to move to another city and he sells the property. The bright-line end date for the property is 1 January 2025. The 13 months during which the home was being constructed on the property is ignored when considering whether the property was used as Raj’s main home for most of the bright-line period. Looking at the remaining period, Raj occupied the property for six months, and the property was vacant for three months. Therefore, the main home exclusion will apply because Raj used the property as his main home for most of the remaining period. Rollover relief Rollover relief under the bright-line test ensures that certain transfers of residential land are not taxed at the time of the transfer. Instead, the recipient takes on the original owner’s acquisition cost and bright-line start date. When the recipient disposes of the residential land, this cost and bright-line start date determines whether the disposal is taxed under the bright-line test and the amount of the gain that is taxable. The bright-line test, as introduced in 2015, included limited relief for certain transfers: relationship property, inherited property and company amalgamations. In 2022, in the context of the 10-year bright-line test, additional rollover relief rules were introduced for a limited number of legal transfers of residential land when there is no underlying change in economic ownership. It is now proposed to extend rollover relief further. From 1 July 2024, rollover relief would be provided for: ▪ all transfers between persons that are associated under any of sections YB 2 to YB 13, provided they have been associated for at least two years prior to the transfer, or ▪ a transfer to a trustee of a trust in which all beneficiaries are persons that have been associated with the transferor for at least two years (other than infants that are less than two years old and persons that are associated due to a recent marriage or adoption), or charities. This recognises that transfers between associated persons do not represent the types of speculative transactions that the new 2-year bright-line test will be intended to capture.

Where rollover relief applies, the transferor will be treated as transferring the land for an amount that equals the cost of the land to the transferor. This will mean that no tax consequences would arise for the transferor if the transfer was made within the relevant bright-line period. The transferee would take on the transferor’s bright-line start date and cost base. In addition, any period of time where the land was used as a main home by the transferor will also be attributed to the transferee and can be taken into account when the transferee sells the land. Example 7: Rollover relief Jocelyn owns residential land with a bright-line start date of 4 June 2024. The land has a cost of $750,000. In December 2024, Jocelyn gets advice from her lawyer that it would be beneficial to transfer the land to her family trust. She has been a settlor, trustee and beneficiary of the family trust since it was established in 2020.

Jocelyn has been associated with the trust for more than two years. Therefore, a transfer of the residential land to the family trust will qualify for rollover relief. Jocelyn will be treated as having transferred the land to the family trust for its cost ($750,000), such that no tax consequences will arise for her under the bright-line test. The trust will be treated as having acquired the land on 4 June 2024 for $750,000. To ensure that the new rollover provisions cannot be used to avoid the application of the bright-line test in situations where it was intended the test should apply, there is also a limitation on the number of times rollover relief can be applied to a property. Rollover relief can only be claimed for a property under the associated person provision once in any two- year period. Example 8: Limitation on rollover relief Following the transfer from Jocelyn in Example 7 above, in June 2025 the trustees of the trust resolve to transfer the residential land to Jocelyn’s sister, who plans to renovate and sell it. Jocelyn’s sister has also been a beneficiary of the trust since it was established. As a beneficiary of the family trust, Jocelyn’s sister is associated with the family trust. Jocelyn’s sister has been associated with the trust for more than two years. However, because the land has been transferred in a transaction that was subject to rollover relief within the last two years, the associated person rollover relief provision cannot be used again. Therefore, this transaction would be subject to the bright-line test. The current rollover relief rules for family trusts and changes in capacity in section CB 6AB will be repealed. The current rollover relief rules for Māori authority trusts and Treaty of Waitangi settlements (currently located in sections CB 6AC and CB 6AE) will be retained. However, they will be rewritten and relocated to new subpart FD with the new associated person rollover relief rule. The other current rollover relief rules will also be retained.

These proposals give effect to that announcement. Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2024–25 and later income years. Background In 2010, with effect from the 2011–12 income year, the ability to claim depreciation deductions for long-lived buildings was removed. Building depreciation was reintroduced in 2020 for non-residential buildings with effect from the 2020–21 income year. It is proposed that the ability to claim depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings should be removed again with effect from the 2024–25 and later income years. The proposal is to return to the pre-2020 settings when building depreciation was last set at 0%. The 0% rate means that buildings will remain depreciable property and historical depreciation deductions remain recoverable when the building is disposed of. The 0% rate will apply to buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. The estimated useful life of a building is determined on a whole-of-life rather than remaining-life basis. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will not be able to set special depreciation rates for these buildings. A new transitional provision for commercial fit-out will be made available for buildings acquired in or before the 2010–11 income year. These building owners were previously provided with the ability to separate an amount representing the cost of commercial fit-out from the building’s adjusted tax value, under former section DB 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so the fit-out could continue to be depreciated. A new provision (section DB 65B) is proposed to allow these owners to continue to do this. The main change from the previous provision is that depreciation deductions for fit-out will be calculated using a straight-line rate of 1.5% (rather than the 2% rate used in the original provision).

Key features The key features of the proposed amendment are: ▪ The depreciation rate for all buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more would be set at 0%. The 0% rating means that buildings would remain depreciable property and historical depreciation deductions would remain recoverable when calculating depreciation recovery income. ▪ The 0% rate would apply to buildings regardless of when the building was acquired. The estimated useful life is determined on a whole-of-life rather than remaining-life basis. ▪ The ability of the Commissioner to set special depreciation rates in section EE 35(2) would be amended to make special depreciation rates unavailable for long-lived buildings. ▪ Owners of a building acquired in or before the 2010–11 income year would be able to deem a proportion of the building’s adjusted tax value as the cost of commercial fit- out and continue to depreciate the fit-out separately under new section DB 65B. ▪ Deductions taken under former section DB 65 and new section DB 65B would be included when calculating depreciation recovery income for buildings sold from the 2024–25 income year. ▪ The rules for grandparented structures would be reintroduced with retrospective effect from 1 April 2020. ▪ Provisions relating to special excluded depreciable property, for buildings acquired in the 1992–93 income year, would be reintroduced. Detailed analysis Annual rate for buildings with long estimated useful lives It is proposed that sections EE 31, EE 61, EZ 13 and EZ 14 be amended to provide that buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more would have an annual depreciation rate of 0% for tax purposes. This 0% rate is a statutory rate and would override the rates set by determination. An item’s estimated useful life is the estimated useful life for that type of item, as set out in a determination issued by the Commissioner. When determining an item’s estimated useful Date: March 2024 24 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] life, a “whole of life” approach is taken. For example, if a person purchases a secondhand item with an estimated useful life of 50 years, its estimated useful life will still be 50 years, regardless of how old the item actually is. Buildings will still be depreciable property, but with a 0% annual depreciation rate. This means that the other depreciation provisions, such as those providing for depreciation recovery still apply. No special rates for buildings Special depreciation rates are granted in situations where a specific item’s economic depreciation rate is either faster or slower than the rate set by the Commissioner. It is proposed that section EE 35(2) be amended so that special depreciation rates would not be able to be set for buildings. The Commissioner would continue to be able to set provisional depreciation rates for buildings with an estimated useful life of less than 50 years. Definition of a building The Bill as introduced includes a definition of “building”. This definition confirms that a building includes part of a building where the building is separated into unit titles. It is proposed that the definition of “building” in the Bill be amended to exclude commercial fit-out. This will ensure that the value of items of commercial fit-out do not form part of the value of a building for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules and allows commercial fit- out to continue to be depreciated. It is also proposed that the definitions of “residential building” and “non–residential building” contained in section YA 1 be repealed because they are no longer necessary. The Commissioner’s view on the “meaning of “building” is set out in Interpretation Statement IS 22/04 Claiming depreciation on buildings. Commercial fit-out While it is proposed that the depreciation rate for long-life buildings would be 0%, the depreciation rate for items used in, but not part of, these buildings would not be changed, and they would continue to be depreciated separately from the building itself. This includes commercial fit-out. As stated above, non-structural commercial fit-out would be expressly excluded from the definition of a building. When the depreciation rate for commercial buildings was set to 0% in 2010, former section DB 65 was introduced to allow building owners who had not previously recorded commercial fit-out separately, to treat as fit-out up to 15% of the building’s tax book value at the end of Date: March 2024 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the 2010–11 income year. Taxpayers who opted to use this rule could then depreciate their fit-out at the previous straight-line building depreciation rate of 2%. The Amendment Paper proposes to reintroduce this rule for buildings acquired in or before the 2010–11 income year. The rule will not be available for buildings acquired after the 2010– 11 income year where it has been more common to depreciate fit-out as a separate item. Taxpayers that acquired a building in the 2020–21 to 2023–24 income years and chose to depreciate fit-out as part of the building, can make an application under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requesting that the Commissioner amend their assessments, so that fit-out acquired with the building can be depreciated separately. Taxpayers will need to have market valuations to determine the value to be attributed to the items of fit-out. The proposed annual deduction would be 1.5% of the “starting pool”. This is equivalent to the straight-line rate for buildings in the 2023–24 income year, and the straight-line rate that currently is being applied to this fit-out. It is proposed that the “starting pool” value would be the same amount as used for former section DB 65, being 15% of the building’s adjusted tax book value for the 2010–11 income year, less the adjusted tax value as at the end of the 2010–11 income year of all items of commercial fit-out that were acquired after the building was acquired and depreciated separately. For this purpose, “building” is defined in section YA 1 as including commercial fit-out acquired as part of the building that has not been depreciated separately. Proposed section DB 65B(5) provides a formula for determining the remaining value (similar to the adjusted tax value of a depreciable asset) of the fit-out. This is necessary because proposed new section DB 65B sits outside the ordinary depreciation rules. Where the remaining value allocated to the fit-out is less than 1.5% of the starting pool, section DB 65B(4) clarifies that the deduction for that year would be limited to the remaining value. The remaining value of the fit-out would be calculated by deducting the following amounts from the starting pool: ▪ the total amount of all deductions allowed under former section DB 65 ▪ the total amount of all deductions allowed under new section DB 65B, and ▪ an amount representing the imputed deductions that would have been allowed under section DB 65B if it had existed for the 2020–21 to 2023–24 income years. This is calculated using the formula: (1.5% x starting pool) x 4. This amount is a proxy for the depreciation deductions relating to the fit-out that have been taken as part of depreciating the whole building during this period. Example 9: Commercial building owned since 2009 – section DB 65 deductions Company ABC acquired a warehouse on 1 April 1999 for $1,000,000. Items of commercial fit-out within the building were not separately identified and depreciated Date: March 2024 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] at the time the building was acquired. Twelve months later a refurbishment of the warehouse was completed. The refurbishment was itemised, and depreciation was applied to the various items of commercial fit-out. At the end of the 2010–11 income year the adjusted tax book value of the warehouse is $640,000 and the adjusted tax book value of the associated commercial fit-out is $64,000. The starting pool value is: ▪ (15% × 640,000) − 64,000 = $32,000 Therefore, the annual deduction for the 2024–25 income year is: ▪ $32,000 × 1.5% × 12/12 = $480 The remaining value of the fit-out at the end of the 2024–25 income year is calculated by deducting the following amounts from the starting pool value: ▪ the deductions made under former section DB 65 ▪ the imputed deductions for the years 2020–21 to 2023–24 ▪ deductions made under new section DB 65B. Company ABC claimed the annual deduction for each of the years 2011–12 to 2019–20 under former section DB 65 amounting to: ▪ $640 × 9 = $5,760 If section DB 65B had existed from 2020 and Company ABC continued to claim deductions for fit-out at the building rate, its total deductions for the 2020–21 to 2023–24 income years (imputed deductions) would amount to: ▪ $32,000 × 0.015 x 4 = $1,920 Therefore, the remaining value of the fit-out at the end of the 2024–25 income year is: ▪ $32,000 − $5,760 − $1,920 − $480 = $23,840 When the annual deduction is more than the remaining value allocated to the fit-out for a given income year, Company ABC can take a final deduction amounting to the remaining value of the fit-out. Fit-out deductions included when calculating depreciation recovery income Depreciation recovery income arises if the amount received for the sale of the building (or treated as received when the use changes) is greater than the adjusted tax value of the Date: March 2024 27 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] building. However, the amount of depreciation recovery income cannot be more than the total amount of depreciation loss that was available to the person for the building. It is already the case that deductions under former section DB 65 are taken into account in determining the adjusted tax value of a building under section EE 60(1). It is proposed that this section will be amended to also take into account deductions taken under new section DB 65B. In addition, it is proposed that deductions taken under former section DB 65 and new section DB 65B would be included as part of the building’s depreciation loss. This change would apply to all buildings sold in or after the 2024–25 income year. Example 10: Depreciation recovery income Company ABC sells the building for $1,010,000 million on 1 April 2025. The adjusted tax value of the building when it is sold is: 2010–11 adjusted tax value − building depreciation claimed for the 2020–21 to 2023–24 income year − s DB 65 deductions − s DB 65B deductions = $640,000 − $5,760 − $60,000 − $480 = $573,760 The amount of depreciation recovery income is the lesser of: ▪ $436,240 being the difference between the sale price and the adjusted tax value when the building is sold, and ▪ $426,240 being the depreciation deductions on the building ($420,000) plus the deductions taken under section DB 65 ($5,760) and section DB 65B ($480). ▪ The amount of depreciation recovery income is therefore $426,240. Grandparented structures Grandparented structures are specific types of buildings that, prior to an Interpretation Statement issued by Inland Revenue in 2010 (IS 10/02: Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions), were considered to be structures not buildings. In 2010, special rules were enacted to allow grandparented structures acquired on or before 30 July 2009 to continue to be depreciated as structures rather than buildings. These rules were inadvertently repealed as part of the reintroduction of building depreciation in 2020. It is proposed that these rules be reinstated with retrospective effect from 1 April 2020. These include: ▪ reintroducing the definition of “grandparented structure” in section YA 1 ▪ excluding “grandparented structures” from the definition of “building”, and Date: March 2024 28 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ▪ amending section EE 37(3) so that improvements to grandparented structures made after 30 July 2009 are treated as separate depreciable property. Special excluded depreciable property “Excluded depreciable property” is defined in section EE 64. This is property for which an economic rate cannot be set. For these items the person must use the historic rates of depreciation. The annual rate for excluded depreciable property is the rate published by the Commissioner for the 1992–93 income year. The Commissioner has no power to change the rate. To ensure that buildings that are excluded depreciable property are depreciated at the 0% rate and not the applicable 1992–93 rate, it is proposed that the definition of “excluded depreciable property” in section EE 64 be amended to exclude “special excluded depreciable property”, and the definition of “special excluded depreciable property” be reinstated in section EE 67. “Special excluded depreciable property” would be defined as all buildings that are not items listed in schedule 39. Schedule 39, which lists buildings that would not be expected to be long-life buildings and should not be subject to the 0% rate, would also be reintroduced.

The proposed amendment would also ensure section GC 1 does not apply to trading stock disposed of outside the course of business to a donee organisation (whether or not that donee organisation is associated with the person making the disposal). This amendment ensures section GC 1 does not disincentivise charitable giving by businesses. Several consequential amendments are also proposed. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect for all trading stock disposed of below market value on or after 1 April 2024. Background Under the ITA, a business is allowed a deduction for the costs of acquiring, growing or manufacturing trading stock in the year of disposal. Where a business disposes of its trading stock for less than market value, section GC 1 deems the business to have derived income equal to the market value of the trading stock on the date of disposal. The recipient of the trading stock is deemed to have acquired the trading stock at its market value on the date of disposal. If the market value of the trading stock is greater than the allowable deduction for that stock, a business may have to pay tax on an amount of net income it does not economically derive. This deemed income rule is appropriate in a number of cases (outlined below under key features). However, we consider that section GC 1 overreaches in relation to disposals that Date: March 2024 31 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] are made in the course of carrying on a business between non-associated parties. Where prices are agreed at an arm’s length a valuation rule is not required. Section GC 1 also overreaches for disposals that are not made in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income and that are donations to donee organisations. The deemed income rule can act as a disincentive to donate, can distort donation behaviour and is widely perceived to be unfair. In 2021, the Government addressed these two issues by enacting temporary emergency provisions (sections GZ 4 and GZ 5 of the ITA) to support businesses as part of the COVID-19 response. This relief: ▪ excluded from section GC 1 donations of trading stock to donee organisations and public authorities ▪ excluded from section GC 1 disposals of trading stock to non-associated parties, and ▪ removed other donations from the application of section GC 1 and subjected them to a new valuation rule equivalent to cost or opening book value. This relief addressed the two issues outlined above for times of emergency. However, it is due to expire on 31 March 2024. Although this relief may be switched on by Order in Council in response to future emergency events, we consider a permanent rule is required to address these long-standing overreach issues. The issues exist whether there is an emergency event or not, although the donation overreach can be more pronounced in times of emergency. Key features We propose removing the temporary relief in sections GZ 4 and GZ 5 and replacing it with a permanent change to section GC 1. The proposed amendments to section GC 1 would limit its application to the following instances: ▪ Where trading stock is disposed of to an associated person. ▪ Where a person disposes of trading stock to themselves for their own use or consumption. ▪ Where trading stock is not disposed of in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income or excluded income, or a combination of both. The proposed amendment would also ensure section GC 1 does not apply to trading stock disposed of outside the course of carrying on a business to a donee organisation (whether or not that donee organisation is associated with the person making the disposal).

Three amendments to the purchase price allocation rules in the ITA are also proposed to clarify their application and address issues arising from their interaction with section GC 1: ▪ Specifying that section GC 20 (effect of purchase price allocation agreement) overrides section GC 1, unless the relevant section GC 20 disposal is between associated parties for below market value consideration. In this case, section GC 1 would deem the parties to dispose of and receive the trading stock part of the transaction at market value. ▪ Section GC 21 (purchase price allocation required: no agreement) overrides section GC 1 under the current law, however, an amendment would clarify that section GC 1 still applies where the disposal is between associated parties for below market value. ▪ Repealing section EB 24 (apportionment on disposal of business assets that include trading stock), on the basis that since the enactment of sections GC 20 and GC 21 it has been redundant. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments to section GC 1 limit its application to cases where we consider there is a valid integrity concern or where an adjustment is necessary to reflect general income tax principles. Associated person disposals Where trading stock is disposed of to an associated party at below market value, section GC 1 will continue to apply, requiring the transferor to return as income the market value of the trading stock on the date of disposal, and the transferee to enter the equivalent value in their books on acquisition of the trading stock. Without a valuation rule, for example, associated parties could manipulate prices to achieve timing advantages or benefit from a lower tax rate. In this context the application of section GC 1 is a necessary integrity measure. Trading stock taken for private use Where trading stock is taken for private use, section GC 1 will also continue to apply under the proposed amendment. The person taking the trading stock for their private use is required to return income equivalent to the market value of the trading stock on the date they take it for their private use (this is considered a “disposal” for the purposes of section GC 1).

For example, a donation may be made for promotional or marketing purposes, where there is a nexus between the cost of the trading stock and the income earning activities of the business. Under the proposal, a section GC 1 adjustment will not be required for these disposals because the trading stock is disposed of in the course of carrying on a business. There are situations where a donation of trading stock will not have any connection with the derivation of business income. For example, when a farmer donates their livestock to a foodbank, on the face of it there is no connection between this donation and the derivation of farm income, although the exact connection between a donation and the derivation of business income will be fact specific. The proposed amendment to section GC 1 clarifies that when trading stock is disposed of outside the course of carrying on a business, a market value adjustment is necessary. However, a proposed exception to this rule is where trading stock is disposed of to a donee organisation, whether or not the donee organisation is associated with the transferor. Donee organisations are, in most cases, a defined subset of registered charities that significantly benefit New Zealanders. We consider this exception would remove the disincentive to donate for many businesses, while addressing integrity concerns by limiting the exception to donee organisations. The proposed exception means that businesses can donate their trading stock to approved donee organisations without making an adjustment under section GC 1 and therefore claim a net deduction for the cost of their donated trading stock. Consequential amendment to section FC 1 Current section FC 1 of the ITA outlines a number of types of disposal of property, including a “gift of property” (which includes trading stock), that are subject to a deemed market value adjustment in section FC 2(1) that is identical in effect to the valuation rule in section GC 1. Section FC 2 has the effect of deeming a business that gifts their trading stock (ie, disposes of it for less than market value) as having derived income at market value. To uphold the policy intent of the proposed amendments to section GC 1, an amendment to section FC 1 is therefore necessary. The proposed consequential amendment would remove gifts of trading stock from the scope of section FC 2 entirely. This would clarify that gifts of trading stock are entirely governed by the rules in section GC 1. Amendments to the purchase price allocation rules The purchase price allocation rules interact with section GC 1 to the extent that they determine the price of trading stock disposed of to another party alongside other property.

We propose that section EB 24 be repealed. This section applies when trading stock is disposed of with other assets of a business. It has been superseded by the purchase price allocation rules, which provide a more specific method of apportioning the price between assets depending on whether there is an agreement between the parties. Current section GC 20 specifies a method for allocating the price between two or more types of property that are disposed of together when there is an allocation agreement between parties. We propose that an override be included in section GC 20 so that where the parties to a disposal are associated, any trading stock is always deemed disposed of for market value. There is no effect on the amount allocated to other items of property. This would ensure that associated parties make a market value adjustment for trading stock even if they add another type of property to their transaction that causes them to fall under the purchase price allocation rules. Current section GC 21 specifies a method for allocating the price between two or more types of property that are disposed of together where there is no allocation agreement between the parties. Section GC 21 overrides provisions of the Act requiring transfers to occur at market value, meaning that section GC 1 does not deem the trading stock portion of the section GC 21 disposal to occur at market value. To give effect to the policy intent of the section GC 1 changes, this override does not apply where the disposal is between associated parties. Where trading stock is disposed of alongside other business assets for less than market value, section GC 1 now deems the trading stock portion of the disposal to be at market value.

It applies to GST-registered persons that are located outside New Zealand to the extent they make supplies of remote gambling services to New Zealand residents. The offshore gambling duty will be 12% of the offshore gambling profits arising on or after 1 July 2024. The offshore gambling profits exclude amounts from betting on sports and racing because there is an existing requirement to pay “point of consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs on these amounts. Effective date The proposed amendments will be effective for offshore gambling profits arising on or after 1 July 2024. Background The National Party Tax Plan, endorsed by the Coalition Agreements, commits to a regulatory regime for online casino gambling, to ensure online casino operators pay their fair share of tax. Currently, the only tax that applies to offshore online casinos is goods and services tax (GST). This means online casinos face significantly lower taxes than New Zealand land-based casinos, Class 4 operators (pokies in pubs and clubs), and online casinos in the United Kingdom and some European countries. Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) there are existing requirements for non-resident suppliers of remote services of gambling supplied to New Zealand residents to register and return GST on these supplies. The proposed offshore gambling duty will apply to these suppliers of remote gambling services if they are located outside New Zealand. Most of the offshore gambling duty rules have been designed to align with the existing rules for GST on remote services, to allow existing systems and calculations for GST to be adapted to apply the offshore gambling duty. The main difference from the GST rules is that the proposed offshore gambling duty is calculated by excluding amounts for which the offshore operator is required to pay “point of Date: March 2024 37 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. Point of consumption charges are 10% charges on betting on sports and racing by New Zealand residents conducted through offshore operators. From 1 July 2024, it is proposed that a 12% offshore gambling duty will apply to online gambling provided by offshore operators to New Zealand residents, other than bets placed on sports or racing events (because 10% point of consumption charges already apply to these bets). Gambling provided by offshore gambling operators will remain subject to GST. The proposed offshore gambling duty will result in offshore gambling operators paying an overall tax rate of about 25% on gross betting revenue. 1 An overall tax rate of 25% would put New Zealand near the midpoint of jurisdictions that impose gaming duties on online casino operators. Key features The key features of the proposed offshore gambling duty are: ▪ It applies to GST-registered persons that are located outside New Zealand to the extent they make supplies of remote gambling services to New Zealand residents. ▪ The rate of offshore gambling duty is 12% of the offshore gambling profits. ▪ Offshore gambling profits are calculated as the amounts received from residents, minus the prizes paid to residents, minus any offshore betting amounts. ▪ Offshore gambling profits are calculated by subtracting any amounts of “offshore betting amounts” on which the offshore operator is required to pay “point of consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. Point of consumption charges are 10% charges on betting on sports and racing by New Zealand residents conducted through offshore operators. ▪ If the offshore operator has a negative amount of offshore gambling profits for a return period (because it has a greater amount of prize money paid or payable to New Zealand residents, than the amount of money it has received from residents) it will carry forward this negative amount to offset future offshore gambling profits in its next return periods. 1 Gross betting revenue is measured by bets received minus prizes paid out. Because GST on gambling is applied to a GST-inclusive amount of consideration, GST is 3/23rds (approximately 13%) of the gross betting revenue. The proposed offshore gambling duty will be 12% of the gross betting revenue.

Detailed analysis Offshore gambling operators and related definitions The proposed offshore gambling duty applies to offshore gambling operators who are defined as registered persons located outside New Zealand who conduct any offshore gambling. Proposed new section 12S(1) of the Gaming Duties Act defines offshore gambling operators along with the other key terms that are used to apply the offshore gambling duty. Registered persons are persons who are either registered or liable to be registered under the GST Act. An offshore operator is required to register for GST if they make $60,000 or more of taxable supplies in a 12-month period, where taxable supplies include supplies of gambling to New Zealand residents (measured by the amount of money received from residents, minus prize money paid out to residents). Offshore gambling means any gambling or prize competition that a person who is resident in New Zealand pays an amount of money to participate in through the supply of remote services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. The proposed offshore gambling duty will not apply to existing online products offered by the Lotteries Commission (operating as Lotto NZ) and TAB NZ. This is because these operators use entities that are located within New Zealand to conduct their online gambling operations. Under the Gambling Act 2003, it is generally illegal for operators who are located within New Zealand to conduct remote interactive (ie, online) gambling, with exceptions for the Lotteries Commission and TAB NZ. However, it will apply to offshore websites owned by New Zealand casinos because this gambling is conducted by entities that are located outside New Zealand. Remote services are defined using the same definition as how remote services are defined in the GST Act. Remote services are a service, that at the time it is performed, there is no necessary connection between the place where the service is physically performed and the location of the recipient of the service. That is, the service provider and the recipient could be in different locations. This definition includes online gambling services.

Proposed new section 12S(2) of the Gaming Duties Act provides that existing section 8B of the GST Act will be used to determine if a person is resident in New Zealand for the purposes of applying the offshore gambling duty. Section 8B of the GST Act requires the registered person to use at least two pieces of evidence, which do not conflict, that indicate the recipient of the service is a New Zealand resident. They can use the following as evidence: ▪ the recipient's billing address ▪ the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the recipient, or another geolocation method ▪ the recipient’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank ▪ the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the recipient ▪ the location of the customer's fixed land line through which the service is supplied to them ▪ any other commercially relevant information. Under section 8B, the Commissioner also has flexibility to prescribe or agree with the registered person an alternative method to determine a recipient’s residence. Calculating offshore gambling profits The rate of the proposed offshore gambling duty is 12% of the offshore gambling profits. Offshore gambling profits are calculated under proposed new section 12T of the Gaming Duties Act by using the following formula: amounts received from residents − prizes paid to residents − offshore betting amounts When measuring the “amounts received from residents” and “prizes paid to residents”, it is intended that the offshore gambling operator will be able to use the same values that they calculate for the GST remote services rules. This is because equivalent terms are used in the formula used to determine the amount of consideration in section 10(14B) of the GST Act. However, a difference from the GST calculation is that the offshore gambling profits are calculated by subtracting “offshore betting amounts”. Offshore betting amounts are the total amount in money on which consumption charges are payable under section 113 of the Racing Industry Act 2020. The offshore betting amounts arise from bets placed by New Date: March 2024 40 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Zealand residents on sports and racing events where there is a requirement to pay “point of consumption charges” to the Department of Internal Affairs. The offshore gambling profits are determined for supplies of offshore gambling for which the “time of supply” under section 9 of the GST Act has occurred for the return period. The GST remote services rules also use the same “time of supply” rules. Under these rules, the supply occurs for each amount received (the bet) on the date on which the first drawing or determination of the corresponding gambling result (or prize competition) commences. The foreign currency rules in section 77 of the GST Act will apply for determining the New Zealand dollar amounts of offshore gambling profits. This is intended to allow the offshore gambling operators to use the same foreign currency conversions as they already use for GST purposes. Section 77 of the GST Act generally requires amounts of money be expressed in New Zealand dollars at the time of supply. Alternatively, the non-resident supplier (the offshore gambling operator) can make an election to express the amounts in a foreign currency. If they elect to use a foreign currency, they must use one of the methods in section 77(3) to convert the foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollar amounts and must maintain the same conversion method for at least 24 months unless the Commissioner agrees otherwise. Example 11: Online casino games only An offshore gambling operator conducts online casino games that are supplied to New Zealand residents. In the three-month period between 1 July 2024 and 30 September 2024, it receives $151.5 million of bets from New Zealand residents and these residents have been paid or credited prizes valued at $140 million. Their offshore gambling profits for the return period are $11.5 million ($151.5 million minus $140 million). The 12% offshore gambling duty applies to the offshore gambling profits. The operator files a return and pays $1.38 million of offshore gambling duty to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2024. For the same three-month period, the operator files a GST return and pays GST of $1.5 million (3/23rds of the $11.5 million of consideration for the remote services of gambling by New Zealand residents) to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2028.

In the three-month period between 1 July 2024 and 30 September 2024, it receives $246 million from bets/ticket sales to New Zealand residents and these residents have been paid or credited prizes valued at $200 million. These amounts include $100 million of sports bets and $70 million of prizes paid on the sports bets. The operator is required to pay point of consumption charges to the Department of Internal Affairs on the $30 million of offshore betting amounts ($100 million minus $70 million) from these sports bets. Their offshore gambling profits for the return period are: $246 million − $200 million − $30 million = $16 million The 12% offshore gambling duty applies to the offshore gambling profits. The operator files a return and pays $1.92 million of offshore gambling duty to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2024. For the same three-month period, the operator files a GST return and pays GST of $6 million (3/23rds of the $46 million of consideration for the remote services of gambling by New Zealand residents) to Inland Revenue on or before 28 October 2028. For the same three-month period, the operator will pay point of consumption charges of $3 million (10% of the $30 million of offshore betting amounts from the sports bets) to the Department of Internal Affairs. If the only gambling products that an offshore gambling operator supplies to New Zealand residents (for a return period) are sports and/or racing bets on which they are required to pay point of consumption charges, their offshore gambling profits will be nil. They will still be required to register for the offshore gambling duty and file a return including a nil value of offshore gambling profits for the relevant return period. If the offshore gambling operator has a negative amount of offshore gambling profits for a return period (because it has a greater amount of prize money paid or payable to New Zealand residents than the amount of money it has received from residents), it will carry forward this negative amount to offset future offshore gambling profits in its next return periods.

The return periods are the period of three consecutive calendar months ending on the last day of either March, June, September or December. In other words, they are for quarterly periods with the first period commencing on 1 July 2024 and ending on 30 September 2024. Proposed new section 12V of the Gaming Duties Act requires that returns for offshore gambling duty must be filed on or before: ▪ 28 October for the return period and ending on 30 September ▪ 28 January for the return period ending 31 December ▪ 7 May for the return period ending 31 March, and ▪ 28 July for the return period ending 30 June. Proposed new section 12W of the Gaming Duties Act requires that the offshore gambling duty must be paid to Inland Revenue no later than the relevant due date that the offshore gambling return must be filed for the corresponding return period. Assessments, challenges, disputes process, penalties and interest The proposed rules for the Commissioner making an assessment of offshore gambling duty and for recovering any amount of unpaid gaming duty as a debt to the Crown, are identical to the existing rules that apply for casino duty. This is provided for by proposed new section 12X of the Gaming Duties Act. Similar rules also apply for gaming machine duty, aside from existing section 12K(2) of the Gaming Duties Act, which sets out a joint and several liability rule that only applies to gaming machine duty. Section 12K(2) does not apply to casino duty, nor will it apply to the proposed offshore gambling duty. The disputes process and challenges rules that are prescribed by Parts 4A and 8 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) will apply to the offshore gambling duty. The tax penalties of the TAA also apply to gaming duties, including the proposed new offshore gambling duty. Existing section 15 of the Gaming Duties Act references the fact that Part 9 (Penalties) of the TAA applies to gaming duty. Use of money interest applies to unpaid amounts of gaming duty under Part 7 (Interest) of the TAA. This is because the definition of “tax” in the TAA includes gaming duty.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2024, and would apply to contracts for taxable accommodation entered into before that date where the supplies are made on or after that date. Background Starting 1 April 2024, operators of electronic marketplaces (and, in some cases, listing intermediaries (see below)) will be required to account for GST on supplies of “listed services”. These supplies include non-exempt accommodation such as short-stay and visitor accommodation (referred to in this item as “taxable accommodation”). Operators will be liable to account for and pay GST on these supplies to Inland Revenue if an invoice is issued or a payment is received in respect of these services on or after 1 April 2024, as per the standard time of supply rule for GST. A transitional issue may arise for operators of electronic marketplaces and listing intermediaries because of this timing rule. The problem would arise when an operator of an electronic marketplace takes an accommodation booking before 1 April 2024 for a host or “underlying supplier” who is not registered for GST. In this case, it is likely the price of the accommodation was set on the assumption of GST not applying. This means if neither a payment is received nor an invoice is issued for the supply until after the new GST rules for listed services are in force, the supply will be deemed to have occurred when the new rules are in effect. In the absence of a transitional rule, the operator of the electronic marketplace (or, in some cases, a listing intermediary) would therefore have a GST liability for the supply, even though the price of the accommodation was not set with GST in mind. “Listing intermediary” would be defined by proposed section 60CB(8) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) as a registered person who lists services referred to in Date: March 2024 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] section 8C(2)(a) of the GST Act on an electronic marketplace on behalf of an underlying supplier who makes those supplies through the electronic marketplace. The proposed definition would require that the person enters into an agreement with the marketplace operator to list or advertise the services provided by the underlying supplier. 2 Key features It is proposed that operators of electronic marketplaces (and, if applicable, listing intermediaries) would be able to apply a transitional rule to relieve them of their GST liability for supplies of taxable accommodation in situations where the contract for the services was entered into before 1 April 2024. The transitional rule would be optional for marketplace operators and listing intermediaries to apply. The proposed transitional rule could be used for a supply of taxable accommodation in circumstances where: ▪ the supply is made through an electronic marketplace ▪ the supply is made under a contract entered into before 1 April 2024 (being the application date of the new listed services rules), and ▪ section 60C(2)(ab) of the GST Act would apply to the supply in the absence of the transitional rule (see further below). Such supplies are referred to in this item as “transitional bookings”. The proposed transitional rule would provide that the operator of the electronic marketplace (or listing intermediary, as the case may be) may choose to treat section 60C(2)(ab) as not applying to the supply. If the person treats section 60C(2)(ab) as not applying, this would relieve them of the GST liability on the supply, including “switching off” all requirements relating to the flat-rate credit. Any GST liability for the supply would remain with the underlying supplier of the services, who would only be liable to account for and pay GST to Inland Revenue if they are a registered person. Notification requirements An additional condition would apply when the underlying supplier of the services has told the marketplace operator (or listing intermediary, if a listing intermediary would be responsible for output tax on the supply) that they are a registered person. In this instance, the marketplace operator or listing intermediary would only be entitled to apply the 2 This amendment and the other proposed amendments relating to listing intermediaries are not included in the Amendment Paper but were added to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill when it was reported back to the House by the Finance and Expenditure Committee.

The marketplace operator or listing intermediary should also take reasonable steps to ensure the underlying supplier has sufficient information within a reasonable timeframe to correctly account for GST on the transitional bookings to Inland Revenue. There may be situations where a transitional booking is for accommodation that was listed on the electronic marketplace by a listing intermediary, where: ▪ the operator of the electronic marketplace (if not applying the transitional rule) would be liable for output tax on the supply, not the listing intermediary, and ▪ the listing intermediary would be responsible for all requirements in respect of the supply that relate to the flat-rate credit, if applicable. If the marketplace operator in this situation wants to use the transitional rule, it would need to inform the listing intermediary within a reasonable timeframe that it is doing so and provide the listing intermediary with sufficient information for the relevant supplies to be identified. This requirement to notify the listing intermediary would apply regardless of whether the underlying supplier is registered for GST. If the underlying supplier of the services is a registered person, the listing intermediary would need to pass this information on to the underlying supplier within a reasonable timeframe so the underlying supplier can correctly account for output tax on the relevant supplies to Inland Revenue. If the underlying supplier is not a registered person, the listing intermediary would still need the same information from the marketplace operator so the listing intermediary would not incorrectly deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit in relation to the supply and pay the flat- rate credit to the underlying supplier. Detailed analysis The transitional rule in proposed new section 85E of the GST Act would apply when: ▪ the supply is of listed services referred to in section 8C(2)(a) ▪ the supply is made through an electronic marketplace ▪ the supply is made under a contract entered into before 1 April 2024 ▪ the time of supply for that supply takes place on or after 1 April 2024 ▪ an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary would be treated by section 60C(2)(ab) as making the supply in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity in the absence of the transitional rule ▪ the person who would be treated as making the supply chooses that the transitional rule applies, and Date: March 2024 47 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ▪ if the underlying supplier of the services is a registered person (or, as discussed below, in some cases if a listing intermediary is interposed between the underlying supplier and the operator of the electronic marketplace), the person applying the transitional rule takes reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify the underlying supplier or listing intermediary of their decision to apply the transitional rule, and to provide the underlying supplier with sufficient information for them to correctly account for GST on the supply. If the above conditions are met, proposed section 85E(2) would allow the marketplace operator or listing intermediary to treat the services as not having been supplied by them. The transitional rule would be applied by not including the relevant supplies in the ‘sales’ box of the person’s GST return, and by not deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit in respect of these supplies. The person would not need to notify Inland Revenue of their choice to apply the transitional rule, but they would need to keep evidence of their choice for a minimum period of seven years in accordance with the record keeping rules in the GST Act. Supplies covered by the transitional rule The above requirement that the supply is of listed services referred to in section 8C(2)(a) of the GST Act means the services are accommodation other than accommodation that is exempt from GST under section 14(1)(c) of that Act. As outlined above, the transitional rule would only apply if section 60C(2)(ab) would apply in its absence. Section 60C(2)(ab) is a new provision in the GST Act that, as of 1 April 2024, will provide that listed services are treated as supplied by the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the supply of services is made if those services are performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. Provided certain conditions are met, proposed section 60CB(7) would provide that a “listing intermediary” is treated as the marketplace operator for the purposes of section 60C(2)(ab), meaning that in some instances a listing intermediary (rather than the operator of the electronic marketplace) may be treated as making the supply of listed services. This means the transitional rule could only ever apply if the services would otherwise be treated as supplied in New Zealand by either an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary. For instance, it would not be necessary to have the transitional rule apply to supplies by GST-registered underlying suppliers who have opted out of the application of the electronic marketplace rule in section 60C(2)(ab) using one of the available opt-out provisions.

In other words, the transitional rule could only ever be applied by an operator of an electronic marketplace or a listing intermediary, and only if that person would otherwise be treated as making the supply. How the transitional rule would apply When such a person chooses to apply the transitional rule, the choice they are making is that section 60C(2)(ab) does not apply to the supply. This means the rules for electronic marketplaces in section 60C (and, if applicable, the rules for listing intermediaries in proposed section 60CB) would not apply to treat the services as having been supplied by the person. Instead, the supplier of the services for GST purposes would be the underlying supplier (that is, the host or property owner who contractually provides the accommodation to the guest). This means that: ▪ A person applying the transitional rule would not account for and pay output tax on the relevant supply to Inland Revenue. All requirements related to the flat-rate credit (which will only ever apply if section 60C(2)(ab) applies) would also not apply. This means the person applying the transitional rule would not deduct input tax for the flat- rate credit in relation to the supply and the flat-rate credit scheme would not apply. ▪ Any output tax liability on the supply of taxable accommodation would remain with the underlying supplier as per the pre-1 April 2024 rules. The underlying supplier would only be liable to account for and pay output tax on the supply to Inland Revenue if they are a registered person making the supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. A decision by a marketplace operator or listing intermediary to apply the transitional rule would not change the time at which the supply is deemed to occur. A GST-registered underlying supplier who is required to account for GST on the supply because of the transitional rule should therefore account for the output tax in their GST return for the taxable period in which time of supply occurred (being the earlier of when a payment was received or an invoice was issued for the supply). Notification requirements In situations where the transitional rule is applied for a supply and the underlying supplier of the accommodation is required to account for and pay GST on the supply to Inland Revenue, the underlying supplier would need to know they are liable for GST on the supply.

This notification must make it clear that the marketplace operator or listing intermediary will not be liable for GST on the supply, and that this liability will remain with the underlying supplier. Where this requirement applies, the notification must be made within a reasonable timeframe. The marketplace operator or listing intermediary should also take reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to ensure the underlying supplier has sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supply to Inland Revenue. Meaning of “reasonable steps” There are two scenarios in which notifying the underlying supplier should be relatively straightforward: ▪ The first scenario concerns where an operator of an electronic marketplace would, in the absence of the transitional rule, be responsible for output tax on the supply, and there is no listing intermediary involved in the supply. ▪ The second scenario is where a listing intermediary would, in the absence of the transitional rule, be responsible for output tax on the supply. In other words, the listing intermediary and the operator of the electronic marketplace through which the supply is made have an agreement that the listing intermediary is responsible for output tax on supplies of listed services. In the above scenarios, the person applying the transitional rule would be required to take reasonable steps to notify the underlying supplier only if the underlying supplier has told them they are GST-registered. As a result, some marketplace operators and listing intermediaries might only want to use the transitional rule for supplies where they are entitled to assume the underlying supplier is not a registered person. This approach would be acceptable, as the transitional rule is intended to be flexible enough to allow marketplace operators and listing intermediaries to apply it for all their transitional bookings or only a subset of them. The person applying the transitional rule would also need to ensure the information they provide to the underlying supplier is sufficient for the underlying supplier to correctly account for output tax on the relevant supplies. The proposed amendment does not mandate that any specific type of information be provided, just that the information provided is sufficient for the underlying supplier to correctly account for output tax. This is broad enough to include any information the marketplace operator or listing intermediary could share or provide that would enable the underlying supplier to identify the relevant supplies, so that the underlying supplier knows those supplies are the ones they need to account for in their GST return.

Information that is sufficient for the underlying supplier to correctly account for output tax on the supply would also include the price paid by the recipient for the supply. This is the price inclusive of any commissions, mark-ups or fees due to the marketplace operator for their services. There is a third possible scenario in which the underlying supplier might need to be notified that the person is applying the transitional rule. This scenario would arise where a transitional booking is made for accommodation that was listed on an electronic marketplace by a listing intermediary and, in the absence of the transitional rule: ▪ the operator of the electronic marketplace would be liable for output tax on the supply, not the listing intermediary, and ▪ the listing intermediary would be responsible for all requirements in respect of the supply that relate to the flat-rate credit, if applicable. This scenario (where the marketplace operator is responsible for output tax and the listing intermediary is responsible for all the requirements related to the flat-rate credit) is the default scenario under the proposed rules applying to listing intermediaries. Several conditions (that are not the subject of this item) would need to be met for a listing intermediary to assume the output tax liability on supplies of listed services. In this default scenario, the marketplace operator (if applying the transitional rule) would be required to take reasonable steps to notify the listing intermediary within a reasonable timeframe that they are applying the transitional rule and to provide the listing intermediary with information that is sufficient for GST-registered underlying suppliers to correctly account for output tax on the supplies. The listing intermediary in this situation should pass the relevant information on to GST-registered underlying suppliers within a reasonable timeframe. The marketplace operator would be required to take reasonable steps to provide the information to the listing intermediary regardless of whether the underlying supplier of the accommodation is a registered person. This is for two reasons: 1. In this situation, the marketplace operator is unlikely to know anything about the underlying supplier, including whether they are a registered person. 2. Even if the underlying supplier is not a registered person, the listing intermediary would still need the same information from the marketplace operator that, if the underlying supplier was GST-registered, would enable the underlying supplier to identify the supplies for which it should account for GST to Inland Revenue. In this case, the information would enable the listing intermediary to correctly identify for Date: March 2024 51 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] which supplies it should not deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit. Therefore, the “reasonable steps” requirement to notify the listing intermediary serves a dual purpose. Meaning of “reasonable timeframe” A marketplace operator or listing intermediary choosing to apply the transitional rule would need to take reasonable steps to provide the necessary information to GST-registered underlying suppliers and/or to listing intermediaries within a reasonable timeframe. This means the marketplace operator or listing intermediary should make their best endeavours to ensure the information is provided as soon as practicable to allow a GST-registered underlying supplier to account for output tax on the relevant supplies in the correct GST return, before that return is due to Inland Revenue. At the very latest, Inland Revenue would expect the necessary information to be provided in advance of the due date for the April 2024 GST returns (being 28 May 2024). Example 13: Marketplace operator applies the transitional rule, underlying supplier not registered person In January 2024, Ben books accommodation at a Whangarei bach for several days in December 2024/January 2025 through Marketplace Co, an operator of an electronic marketplace. Will, the underlying supplier of the accommodation, is not registered for GST because his supplies are below the registration threshold. The payment terms allow Ben the option of paying for the accommodation in instalments. Ben pays the first instalment in April 2024. No invoice has been issued, so this first payment means time of supply occurs in April 2024 when the new GST rules applying to listed services are in force. Marketplace Co chooses to apply the transitional rule to this supply of accommodation, meaning that Marketplace Co would not account for GST on the supply. Marketplace Co applies the transitional rule by preparing and filing its GST return consistently with this position (that is, by not including the supply in the ‘sales’ box of its GST return, and by not deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit). Because there is no listing intermediary involved in the supply and Will has not notified Marketplace Co that he is a registered person, Marketplace Co is not required to take reasonable steps to notify Will of the decision to apply the transitional rule.

The payment terms allow Martin to pay in full when he checks in at the bed and breakfast, which he will end up doing. As of April 2024, no invoice has been issued for the supply. Marketplace Co intends to apply the transitional rule to all bookings made on its website before 1 April 2024 where time of supply will occur on or after 1 April 2024. This includes the booking made by Martin in November 2023. In early April 2024, Marketplace Co provides communications to Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast explaining that Marketplace Co will not be accounting for and paying GST on bookings taken before 1 April 2024 to Inland Revenue, and that GST on these bookings remains the legal responsibility of Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast. The date on which Martin’s booking was made is visible to Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast via the Marketplace Co platform, so Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast knows that it is required to include the supply in its GST return for the taxable period in which time of supply occurs (being when Martin pays upon checking in at the bed and breakfast if no invoice is issued before then). Marketplace Co has taken reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify Graeme’s Bed and Breakfast of the decision to apply the transitional rule and to ensure they have sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supply. Marketplace Co is therefore entitled to apply the transitional rule for the supply.

In early April 2024, Marketplace Co provides communications to the listing intermediary explaining that Marketplace Co will not be accounting for and paying GST on bookings taken before 1 April 2024 to Inland Revenue, and that GST on these bookings remains the legal responsibility of the property owners or accommodation hosts. In these communications, Marketplace Co advises the listing intermediary that this information will need to be passed on to GST-registered property owners so they can comply with their GST obligations. Marketplace Co also advises the listing intermediary that other relevant information that the GST-registered property owners will need to identify the bookings made before 1 April 2024 should be passed on to them, such as the dates the bookings were made (which is information that is accessible to the listing intermediary through the Marketplace Co platform). Marketplace Co has taken reasonable steps within a reasonable timeframe to notify the listing intermediary of the decision to apply the transitional rule and to ensure the GST-registered owners of properties listed on the platform by the listing intermediary have sufficient information to correctly account for GST on the supplies. Because Jacob is not a registered person, the listing intermediary does not need to pass the information provided by Marketplace Co on to him. However, because Marketplace Co notified the listing intermediary that any GST liability for the transitional bookings will remain with the property owners (instead of those supplies being subject to the new GST rules for listed services) and has provided sufficient information to the listing intermediary to enable these bookings to be identified, the listing intermediary knows it should not deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit on the supplies.

Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018. Background Non-residents are only taxed on their New Zealand-sourced income. The DTA source rule in section YD 4(17D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 deems an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under a DTA. There are several exceptions to the DTA source rule that ensure income is not taxed where the income’s connection with New Zealand is tenuous and New Zealand did not anticipate collecting tax on that income. The Bill proposes two further exceptions to the DTA source rule to address two identified instances of overreach. One of these exceptions is for fees for technical services provided by a non-resident to a New Zealand customer. However, the proposed drafting in the Bill requires further clarification to ensure that the exclusion captures the breadth of transactions in the nature of “technical services fees” that could be deemed to have a source in New Zealand under a DTA. This was recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to a submission on the Bill, however, the amendment made in response to this recommendation did not fully capture the intended change. Key features The proposed amendment would broaden the reference to “technical services fees” to “fees for technical, management or similar services”. This would ensure that this broader category of fees is excluded from the DTA source rule and the resulting tax overreach.

Commercial
==========

The Commercial team came together at an early stage of the programme, prior to the business case in 2015. This included the recruitment of a commercial specialist. All commercial activity for Inland Revenue’s transformation was managed by the programme.

Wherever possible, we’ve gone with Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. We have implemented around 10 COTS solutions as part of transformation to run various aspects of our business. COTS solutions include our data and analytics platform, content management systems, and the day-to-day systems that support the running of Inland Revenue such as human resources and finance. We relied strongly on out-of-the-box processes to avoid unnecessary configuration or customisation.

Very early on we developed a sourcing strategy for Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions and refined this as our knowledge of COTS grew.

Vendor management
-----------------

The Programme undertook effective contract management through its monthly account review meetings and partner score-carding to ensure:

*   the relationships with programme suppliers were handled professionally
*   consultant performance was meeting programme expectations
*   all services were provided within an effectual contractual framework and in line with Government policy.

Master services agreements were established for all major suppliers with specific statements of work entered for the delivery of transformation programme services.  All projects and initiatives within the Programme had documented contracts covering all external spend whether for goods or services.

### Regular forums

Regular partner management forums were established with all contracted suppliers as part of the governance structure of the programme.  These forums are managed by the Head of Commercial and Procurement with attendance from Programme Leadership Team member(s).

The Deputy Commissioner for Transformation was accountable for the management of third-party suppliers through the Head of Commercial and Procurement.

### Management of suppliers and partners

The Head of Commercial and Procurement was responsible for the management of suppliers and partners on the BT Programme which included the following:

*   negotiation of the commercial framework of terms and conditions that suppliers are contractually obligated to deliver within
*   management of contractual deliverables
*   management of change requests
*   performance management of suppliers against the programme scorecard
*   milestone deliverables
*   managing suppliers to value-add
*   management of supplier innovation
*   sourcing of suppliers to meet IR’s requirements
*   contract management and commercial governance of the suppliers.

The involvement of third-party suppliers was subjected to All of Government (AoG) Rules of sourcing and IR procurement policy and undertaken through the direction of the Head of Commercial and Procurement. Prior approval of the Senior Responsible Officer or Commissioner of Inland Revenue in accordance with the agreed levels of financial delegation was sought for all procurement activities and involvement of a third-party supplier.

### Account review meetings

The purpose of the account review meetings was to provide a monthly forum for the management of the programme commercial arrangements and relationships with key service providers.

Meetings were held monthly and include engagement effectiveness, cost management, schedule attainment and delivery performance, scope and change management, team performance, risk and issues management, delivery assurance and administration and compliance. The meetings also reviewed the status of commercial activities (acceptances, change requests and invoicing), budget forecasts and actuals and resource planning and changes.

The account review meetings were chaired by the Head of Commercial and Procurement. The scorecard was shared with the Portfolio Governance Committee as applicable.

Noting that this approach will continue at IR post the BT Programme closure as it has been very effective.

Commissioner allowed to continue investigation
==============================================

2009 case note – application for stay of High Court judgment pending resolution of appeal denied – CIR able to progress investigation and pass information to ATO.

Case

Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd & Ors v The District Court at North Shore & The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The applicants’ application for a stay of the High Court judgment pending resolution of their appeal was denied.

### Impact of decision

The Commissioner is able to progress his investigation and is also able to pass on information to the Australian Tax Office notwithstanding the appeal of the substantive judgment to the Court of Appeal.

### Facts

On 8 November 2006 the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) and the Australian Tax Office (ATO) conducted simultaneous access operations on both sides of the Tasman. The operations followed a request by the ATO to the Commissioner in 2004 under Article 26 of the Australia-New Zealand Double Tax Agreement (DTA). The ATO provided background information which indicated that a number of entities based in or operating in New Zealand were promoting, marketing and implementing a wide range of tax avoidance schemes.

Using his powers under section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner entered seven premises, both private and commercial, and removed hardcopy documents and hard drives for copying. Seven applicants commenced judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner, and another applicant later joined the proceedings.

On 22 December 2008, the High Court delivered a judgment upholding the Commissioner’s actions and dismissing the judicial review. The High Court ordered the return of three hard drives where the Commissioner had not followed his own processes; otherwise the Commissioner was successful on all bases. The applicants have appealed the High Court decision and sought a stay, from the High Court, of the High Court judgment pending resolution of the appeal. The Commissioner opposed the application for a stay.

### Decision

Venning J held that the applicants had failed to make out the case for a stay and dismissed the application.

The applicants’ main concern was that if a stay was not granted, then a successful appeal would be worthless, because even though the Commissioner could turn an institutional blind eye to the information, individual officers would not be able to remove the information from their minds, and would make decisions affecting the applicants, and other entities associated with them, on the basis of that information.

The applicants were also particularly concerned at the prospect of information being passed to the ATO on the basis that once the information was out of the country, the IRD and the New Zealand courts would have no control over the information and could not insist on the use of it being unwound. The applicants also cited the difficult relationship that they, particularly Mr Petroulias, have had with the ATO in recent years as a factor that increased their concern.

The Court found that failure to grant a stay would not render a successful appeal nugatory, because the Commissioner would destroy or return the hard drives to the appellants and neither the Commissioner nor the ATO would be able to use the information contained on those hard drives. All information would have to be deleted from IRD records and any assessments based on that information would have to be unwound.

The Court also relied on the role and responsibility of the Commissioner, and the fact that he is a public officer subject to the Official Information Act 1982 and Parliamentary enquiries. The Commissioner and his officers are also subject to secrecy provisions in the legislation.

### Conclusion

The High Court held that the Commissioner was entitled to review the electronic information.

The Court also held that the Commissioner was entitled to pass any such information to the ATO once the ATO has provided an affidavit to the Court confirming that the ATO will put in place a process to ensure that any information it receives will be identified so that it can unwind any steps or actions taken on the basis of such information, and also confirming that such an unwind would be at the ATO’s cost.

Commissioner awarded discovery orders
=====================================

2014 case note – application by CIR for discovery of documents - discovery orders, particular discovery, evidence exclusion rule.

Case

TRA 022/12 \[2014\] NZTRA 06

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules, Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998

### Summary

This case concerned an application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") for discovery of documents supporting the disputant's statement in her Statement of Position ("SOP") explaining how she funded her losses.

### Impact of decision

The evidence exclusion rule will not preclude a discovery order over documents supporting a statement in a SOP even when that statement is not identified as a separate legal issue or proposition of law. The statement forms part of the disputant's case and therefore the Commissioner is entitled to reply to it.

### Facts

This was an interlocutory application by the Commissioner for discovery orders.

The substantive dispute involves a claim for deductions. The disputant failed to file income tax returns for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 income tax years (inclusive). In June 2009, the Commissioner issued default assessments based on annualised sales from GST returns filed for the periods in dispute.

The disputant subsequently filed income tax returns for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 income tax years and issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment. The disputant claimed expenses exceeding income derived in two of the three years in dispute. The expenses claimed represented 139%, 99% and 113% of income for those years respectively.

The disputant's SOP stated that she was handling work for which she would not be paid until the end of the matter. Therefore, her taxable income was not greater than her expenses resulting in taxable losses. She claimed she funded the losses by loans from a family trust.

The Commissioner sought discovery of the following documents:

1.  a copy of the disputant's diary for the 2006 to 2008 income years;
2.  all documents/material that evidence or explain what funds the disputant or her family used to fund her losses and to support her and her family's lifestyles during the 2006 to 2008 income years; and
3.  all documents relevant to the deductions claimed by the disputant in each income year.

Subsequent to the hearing, the parties reached agreement for informal discovery of the documents referred to in 1 and 2 above.

The remaining issue for determination related to discovery of documents identified in 2 above.

### Decision

An order was made for discovery of the documents identified in 2 above.

#### _Relevance of documents_

The Commissioner argued that whether the disputant has satisfied her onus of proof will in part turn on her credibility, assessed in the context of the background facts. A key background fact is whether it is credible that the disputant had virtually no net income in the years in dispute given that she claims to be successful in her chosen career.

The Commissioner further argued that the documents sought are relevant, as such evidence has a tendency to disprove that all the deductions claimed are genuine business expenses (section 7(3) of the Evidence Act 2006); that the Commissioner is entitled to respond to the disputant's statement that her net income is temporarily low and that she has lived off loans from her family trust; and that the disputant cannot justify her returns and then not discover the documents relevant to that justification.

The disputant argued that neither party in her SOP identifies the disputant's source of funds as a legal issue in dispute and, therefore, the discovery sought is not relevant.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") agreed with the Commissioner and found that the discovery sought is relevant to the legal issue for the following reasons:

1.  for the purpose of assessing the credibility of the taxpayer;
2.  the documents sought have a tendency to disprove that all the deductions claimed are genuine business expenses; and
3.  it is necessary for the Commissioner to be able to respond to the disputant's statement that her net income is temporarily low and that she has lived of loans from her family trust.

#### _Applicability of evidence exclusion rule_

While the disputant accepts that the operation of section 138G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") (the "evidence exclusion rule") does not preclude an order for discovery of relevant material, she argued that the Commissioner has failed to establish that discovery of the documents is either relevant or necessary to resolve the present challenge.

The disputant argued that the scope of the evidence exclusion rule refers back to the requirements to be included in the parties' respective SOPs. Sections 89M(4) and 89M(6) of the TAA provide that SOPs must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the other party, give an outline of the facts and the evidence on which the party intends to rely; an outline of the issues that the party considers will arise; and specify the propositions of law on which the party intends to rely.

The disputant argued that neither party identified any legal issues or propositions of law relating to the question of how the disputant funded her expenditure or supported her family.

The disputant argued that no reasonable person reading the parties' SOPs would think either party had made an issue of her source of funds.

The Commissioner argued that it is necessary under sections 89M(4)(b) and 89M(6)(b) that SOPs only contain an outline of evidence. The discovery sought is within the outline of evidence in the disputant's SOP and therefore cannot be excluded under the evidence exclusion rule.

The Commissioner argued that when the disputant explained her ability to fund her losses from her family trust, she put in issue how she funded her losses and it now forms part of the outline of the case.

The TRA found that it is not necessary for the matter to be identified as a separate legal issue or proposition of law. The disputant clearly raised the issue of the source of her funds in the context of her claim for deductibility of expenditure when she sought to explain how she funded her losses. That explanation now forms part of the disputant's case and the Commissioner is entitled to rely on it.

Commissioner directed to consider remission of penalties and interest
=====================================================================

2006 case note - taxpayer obtained directions against the CIR regarding aspects of their tax affairs - arrangement, penalties and interest, remission.

Case

Chesterfields Pre-Schools Limited and Other v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Act 1908

### Summary

The taxpayer obtained directions against the Commissioner regarding aspects of their tax affairs

### Facts

This was a judicial review started by five entities associated with David Hampton.

The facts of the case are complex. As the judgment recognises "For the most part the current indebtedness of the taxpayers in these proceeding reflects an automatic consequence of returns not being made on time and tax paid on due date" \[par 31\]

In 1993 the Chesterfields Partnership overclaimed a GST input and was obliged to repay $33,333.34 to the Commissioner. This was not done, although the taxpayer expected to offset another input tax credit to make the payment. This other input tax credit did not become available due to an audit into the claimed input.

Several years of investigation into other input tax credits in other entities (usually arising from transactions within the Hampton entities) meant that planned offsets never occurred. Mr Hampton's entities have relied upon tax refunds to pay indebtedness and have not actually paid tax \[par 148\]. Other revenue periods for other entities fell into arrears as the inter-entity transactions "moved" debt between entities.

Various arrangements were entered into but many issues were left unresolved between the parties. The situation was aggravated by inaction by the department in failing to complete various audits and investigations while, at the same time, awaiting the outcome of those audits and investigations to determine the availability of possible tax credits which may or may not be available to pay tax due.

In addition, one entity, Anolbe Enterprises Limited was struck off the Companies Register in 1996 and not restored until 2000. The company's GST registration was ceased in 1996 and in 2000 an informal application for re-registration (together with a request for $92,222.22 of input tax refunds) was made, but it was not until 2004 that a formal re-registration was sought. The Commissioner declined to backdate the re-registration.

Finally, the Hampton entities sought remission under section182A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") which was declined in June 2004. Those entities sought judicial review of this decision.

### Decision

The Judge noted the departmental scepticism in dealing with Mr Hampton and also noted that Mr Hampton is "an extremely difficult ‘taxpayer' to deal with". \[par 132 and 144\].

He concluded, after reviewing circumstances of the section 182A remission decision, that the decision contained no reviewable error of law. He came to no concluded view regarding the various arrangements entered into.

Regarding the accumulation of penalties and interest his honour considered that:

> "In my view, the correct perspective for (sic) the Commissioner should take in this case is that parliament has provided for late payment penalties as incentives on taxpayers to pay core tax liability…. The Commissioner needs to appreciate that rightly or wrongly for long periods of time, particularly between 1993 to 1998, the various officers were treating the debts as uncollectable because of the pending audit assessments of GST inputs. The Audit department did not make its decisions promptly and in some, if not most cases, did not make decisions at all in respect of the disputed GST refunds. Mr Hampton was given comfort in that respect, and became naively confident his claims would prevail, and the mounting penalties would be remitted." \[par 149\]

The Court concluded that "the various neglects or failures \[of the Commissioner\] cumulatively justify intervention by this Court by way of judicial review directing the Commissioner to complete processing input claims, and to consider associated reduction of penalties and interest payments." \[par156\]

The Court considered the delay in processing Anolbe's reregistration was aggravated by the Commissioner's failure to advise Anolbe of the need to make a formal application for GST registration. It is in terms of this that the relief is granted to the plaintiffs. \[par 159\]

The Commissioner is directed to reconsider Anolbe's re-registration and the Anolbe returns, together with any other unresolved claims by the other entities. Any resultant refunds are to be applied to the best advantage of the plaintiffs. He is to make a decision under section 182 TAA (as applicable before 23 September 1997) regarding remission of penalties—this will probably need to go to the Minister of Inland Revenue. He is to consider further remission under section 182A for penalties accruing over the periods of the hearing.

Commissioner entitled to discovery
==================================

2009 case note – Summary of the relationship between discovery and the Tax Administration Act – confirmation that CIR entitled to discovery in tax litigation.

Case

RadioWorks Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; TVWorks Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner sought general discovery against the plaintiffs and non-party discovery against two non-parties. The plaintiffs opposed general discovery on the grounds that general discovery is not appropriate in tax litigation, other than for exceptional cases.

### Impact of decision

This judgment provides a clear and concise summary of the relationship between discovery and the provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). It confirms that the Commissioner is entitled to discovery in tax litigation, notwithstanding his powers under the TAA and the evidence exclusion rule.

### Facts

The plaintiffs, who are related companies and part of the CanWest group, issued optional convertible notes ("OCNs") as part of intra-group funding arrangements. The OCNs were issued to off-shore related companies. The Commissioner investigated the issue of the OCNs on the basis that he considered that it was part of a tax avoidance arrangement. During the course of his investigation, the Commissioner issued notices under section 17 of the TAA to the plaintiffs requesting documents and information.

When the Commissioner received the plaintiffs' Statements of Position ("SOP"), the SOPs raised a new issue, being whether the off-shore company to whom the OCNs were issued was in fact part of the CanWest group. The plaintiffs have since advised that they will not pursue the argument that the off-shore company was not a related company.

The plaintiffs applied for an order that general discovery was not appropriate. The Commissioner applied for non-party discovery against two non-parties, NZ Guardian Trust Company Limited and the parent company of the plaintiff, Media Works NZ limited.

### Decision

#### General discovery

##### Onus

High Court Rule 8.17 provides that the Court must make an order for discovery in standard track proceedings if it is appropriate. There is no specific provision for seeking or opposing general discovery. In principle, the person seeking discovery has the onus of establishing that discovery is appropriate, but the threshold is low and there is an assumption that discovery will be appropriate in standard track proceedings. If the party opposing general discovery raises issues that suggest that discovery is not appropriate, the party seeking discovery must show that discovery is appropriate, notwithstanding the issues raised.

##### Limitation of discovery in tax cases

The plaintiffs argued that discovery was not appropriate in tax litigation, other than for exceptional cases. They gave two reasons: first, the Commissioner has powers under section 17 of the TAA to obtain all relevant documents from taxpayers; and secondly, section 138G of the TAA excludes discovery.

The Court held that the scheme of the TAA (sections 17 and 138G) does not preclude general discovery; and there is jurisdiction to order general discovery in tax cases. The jurisdiction is supplementary to the information exchange provisions of the disputes resolution process. The Commissioner can be expected to have used his section 17 powers during the investigation, but there is no certainty that he will obtain all the relevant information this way. Section 138G of the TAA does not preclude discovery because documents obtained from discovery may fall within the category of documents identified in the SOPs or it may fall within the exclusion to 138G or it may be a basis for cross-examination.

The Court held that the Commissioner had established that discovery was appropriate in this case.

#### Non-party discovery

The Court also held that the Commissioner had established that non-party discovery was relevant and necessary in this case as it may be relevant to the issue of whether the OCNs would have value to a third party. The Court held that section 17 was not a bar to non-party discovery. The Court also stated that there was a distinction between discovery and admissibility and that the Courts do not have to determine admissibility at the time of making an order for non-party discovery.

Commissioner entitled to use section 19 during the dispute resolution process
=============================================================================

2008 case note - Section 19 enquiry convened for the proper purpose of assessing the taxpayers' tax liability - dispute resolution process, substantive unfairness.

Case

Gerald Malcolm Foxley and Anor v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The section 19 enquiry was convened for the proper purpose of assessing the taxpayers' tax liability. The Commissioner may use his section 19 power after the commencement of the dispute resolution process.

### Facts

This case involved a judicial review of the exercise of the Commissioner's statutory power under section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

The taxpayers and the Commissioner are engaged in the dispute resolution process under Part IVA of the TAA 1994 concerning the taxpayers' liability for tax for the year ended 31 March 2002. Two sets of Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") and Notices of Response ("NORs") have been exchanged.

The Commissioner, at this stage, required the taxpayers to attend a section 19 interview. They alleged the Commissioner employed section 19 for the improper purpose of forcing them to settle. Further, they allege that section 19 is not available when the dispute resolution process is under way and that the Commissioner's use thereof was both procedurally and substantively unfair.

The Commissioner disagreed and alleged that section 19 was properly deployed to ascertain the taxpayer's correct tax liability.

On 25 May 2001, the taxpayers entered into a Deed of Transfer and Assignment of Interest of Forestry Rights with Fox and Fox Limited, a company of which they are the directors and shareholders. In terms of the deed the taxpayers assigned to Fox and Fox Limited, all rights and entitlements in and to the services and forestry rights in consideration for $488,000, of which $314,000 was to be paid for services and the balance for forestry rights.

Neither of the taxpayers returned any portion of the $488,000 in their returns for the period ending March 2002.

The Commissioner issued a NOPA on the basis that the payment was for forestry rights or services. The taxpayers' NOR denied the same but did not specify what was transferred.

The Commissioner issued a second NOPA alleging in the alternative that if forestry rights were not transferred and services not provided, the payment was a deemed dividend. The taxpayers' NOR alleged the payment was neither for cutting rights nor a dividend but was in fact for their interest in obtaining forestry rights that were under negotiation. They alleged that the cutting rights were obtained by Fox and Fox Ltd from the property owners concerned.

The Commissioner's solicitor decided that an inquiry based on section 19 should be made to fully understand the background facts to properly interpret the deed and issue a Statement of Position. The solicitor was also of the view that it might be possible to settle the dispute.

The taxpayers attacked the Commissioner's case alleging that the solicitors' memorandum and affidavits filed for the Commissioner reflected an improper purpose.

### Decision

The Court found that the section 19 inquiry by the Commissioner was for the purpose of ascertaining the taxpayers' true tax position and not for the purpose of pressuring them to settle as alleged by the plaintiffs.

The Court held that there is nothing in section 19 itself or in Part IV that clearly precludes use of section 19 while a disputes process is under way. The availability of section 19 has not been the subject of any previous decision but it is well established that the Commissioner may use his powers under section 17 until the proceedings are on foot and potentially beyond, provided it is for the proper purpose. There is no reason why the section 19 power should be different.

The allegation of substantive unfairness on the part of the Commissioner failed as the Court found there was no abuse of power, as did the allegation of procedural unfairness based on the assertion that by its very nature the section 19 procedure will be unfair.

In the result, the judicial review was dismissed.

Commissioner granted unless order for security for costs
========================================================

2017 case note - CIR granted 'unless order' by the High Court for security for costs.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney as Trustee of the Forest Trust v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 2195

Legislative References

High Court Rules 2016, r 7.48(2)

### Summary

This proceeding concerns the non-payment of a security for costs order. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) sought orders that unless the plaintiff pays the $40,000 security for costs within 14 days, his claim will be struck out. The Court granted the Commissioner’s application but gave the plaintiff 30 days to pay the security for costs.

### Impact

The Court will grant an unless order where there has been a reasonable time within which to comply with an order to provide security for costs. The failure to comply with the security for costs order has caused delays and is at odds with the clear public interest in ensuring the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of a proceeding.

### Facts

In July 2012, Mr Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust (“the Trust”) sought damages of over $5m from the Commissioner after she disallowed a goods and services tax (“GST”) refund of approximately $67,000. Mr Mawhinney also filed an application for summary judgment seeking approximately $600,000 for GST refunds withheld by the Commissioner.

The Commissioner applied for security for costs of $40,000 and sought that the proceedings be stayed until the sum was paid or security was given. On 4 July 2014, Associate Judge Christiansen granted that order and held that the amount sought was reasonable and could not be said to stop Mr Mawhinney from pursuing the claim. On 3 December 2014 Brewer J upheld the decision on review.

The proceeding has been stayed since the order made by the Associate Judge in 2014. The current application for an unless order was filed and served on 16 May 2017.

### Mr Mawhinney’s Affidavits

The Commissioner objected to three of Mr Mawhinney’s affidavits being read. Those affidavits were originally served as unsworn affidavits, outside the Court ordered deadline, and shortly before the initial hearing of the application. The initial hearing, however, was adjourned due to a power cut.

The Court considered that the Commissioner has now had the opportunity to read and consider the affidavits which were subsequently served in sworn form. Her Honour noted that the application was for an order which, if granted, would likely result in the proceeding being struck out. She concluded that there is no prejudice to the Commissioner and the interests of justice weigh in favour of permitting the affidavits to be read.

### Decision

The Court set out the principles in _SM v LFDB_ (\[2014\] NZCA 326, \[2014\] 3 NZLR 494 at \[31\]) which apply to unless orders:

*   An unless order is an order of last resort and will be granted where there is a history of failure to comply with earlier orders.
  
*   An unless order should clearly set out when and what is the sanction for non-compliance.
  
*   The sanction will apply without further order if the party in default does not comply with the order by the time specified. The party in default may seek relief by application to the Court.
  
*   The party should not assume that belated compliance of the order will suffice. Justice may require that the party in default be relieved if the Court is satisfied that the breach resulted from something for which the party should not be held responsible.
  
*   Where the unless order has deliberately been breached, it will be difficult in the interests of justice to grant that person relief from the order.
  
*   When deciding whether to excuse a breach of an unless order a Judge must ask what does justice demand in the circumstances of this case? Matters to consider when deciding this include public interest in the administration of justice without unnecessary delays and costs, the interests of the injured party to minimise delay and wasted costs, and injustice to the defaulting party but this carries less weight than other considerations.

A plaintiff must be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with an order for security for costs before a proceeding is struck out.

_Analysis_

The proceeding has been stayed for over three years and the Court stated this is a reasonable time within which to comply with an order to provide security for costs.

The Court considered that the delay in the proceeding is prejudicing the Commissioner as the events took place in 2009 and it is difficult for staff to recall key events in the proceeding. The Commissioner also needs to maintain staff or employ additional staff should the proceeding move forward.

The Court stated that Mr Mawhinney’s failure to comply with the security for costs order has caused delays and is at odds with the clear public interest in ensuring the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of a proceeding.

The Court was not convinced that Mr Mawhinney will have funds available to him through the sale of logs in April 2018 in order to vary the order in the future. There was no evidence produced to substantiate his claim. There is current litigation about whether the logs may be harvested without a resource consent and the Court was unconvinced that the harvesting of smaller areas as of right would return the amounts submitted by Mr Mawhinney.

The Court stated that it seems unlikely that there are other avenues of funds available to Mr Mawhinney. The Court was not persuaded that litigation between another trust associated with Mr Mawhinney and the Commissioner will result in any source of funds being available in the short term, and noted that there is no undertaking or legally enforceable agreement by which this other trust agreed to advance sums to Mr Mawhinney.

The Court also took into account that Mr Mawhinney’s claim had been assessed as weak by the judges involved in earlier decisions relating to security for costs.

The order to provide security for costs strikes a balance between the rights of plaintiffs to bring and progress their proceeding, and the rights of defendants to be protected from unmeritorious claims brought by impecunious plaintiffs. On balance, the Court held the interests of justice require Mr Mawhinney to be afforded one final opportunity to pay the security for costs order or have his claims struck out.

_Result_

The unless order is granted; unless the plaintiff pays the security for costs in the sum of $40,000 into Court within 30 days from the date of this judgment, the plaintiff’s proceedings will be struck out.

If we disagree with a return you’ve filed, we may start the disputes process.

In this video, we explain Commissioner-initiated disputes, and the steps required to resolve the dispute as quickly and easily as possible.

Don't worry. It's not complicated. Most people can do the paperwork themselves.

Though we do recommend you contact a professional tax advisor if you need help, or your dispute is complex.

When might we start a dispute?

Most commonly, following an audit of your financial affairs, if we're unable to reach an agreement on the outcome.

We'll send you a Notice of proposed adjustment explaining how we propose to amend your tax return.

If you agree with our Notice of proposed adjustment, we'll issue a new assessment.

If you disagree, you need to send us a Notice of Response within two months.

If we agree with your Notice of response, the disputes process ends here.

If we disagree, we move to Step 3.

In Step 3, we get together to discuss the dispute in person, or over the phone.

We will offer to provide an independent facilitator. This person will be a senior Inland Revenue staff member with no previous involvement in the dispute.

If we reach an agreement at the conference, the disputes process ends here.

If we don't agree, you have a choice. You can move to Step 4, or ask us for agreement to go straight to Step 7, the final step in the disputes process.

At Step 4, we'll send you a Statement of position.

Please send us your own Statement of position within two months.

If no agreement is reached, we move to Step 6. Our independent experts in our Disputes Review Unit will take a fresh look at the case and make a decision about your dispute. This costs you nothing.

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in your favour, the disputes process ends here.

If the Disputes Review Unit decides in our favour, you may decide to take your case to the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court.

One final point. Please keep to the time limits. This is important. Under the law, if you miss a deadline, you may have to accept our decision.

All time limits are clearly shown on the forms you need to fill out.

Commissioner Not Entitled to Costs for In-House Counsel Appearing in High Court
===============================================================================

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) failed in her application for 2B costs on a liquidation proceeding

Case

CIR v New Orleans Hotel (2011) Limited \[2018\] NZHC 971

Legislative References

High Court Rules 2016 Rules 14.1, 14.2 and 14.6

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) failed in her application for 2B costs on a liquidation proceeding on the basis that the Commissioner had not incurred costs in the sense contemplated by part 14 of the High Court Rules 2016.

### Impact

The impact of this decision is that in-house counsel employed by the Commissioner are not entitled to apply for costs under the High Court Rules. It appears that claims for disbursements will be unaffected.

### Facts

This was a cost decision in relation to a long running liquidation matter that had been filed on 1 September 2016. Following a defended hearing in relation to an application to restrain advertising (_CIR v New Orleans Hotel (2011) Limited_ \[2017\] NZHC 2500) and an appeal of the decision (_CIR v New Orleans Hotel (2011) Limited_ \[2017\] NZHC 2769) in favour of the Commissioner on that application, the liquidation proceedings were eventually withdrawn on 25 January 2018, upon confirmation that the defendant company had paid its tax debt in full.

At the time the liquidation proceedings were withdrawn, Osborne AJ reserved the question of costs until the decision of the Full Bench of the Court of Appeal in _McGuire v Secretary for Justice_ \[2018\] NZCA 37.

Osborne AJ wanted to know whether or not the Court of Appeal would comment on or modify the position in the earlier decision of _Joint Action Funding Limited v Eichelbaum_ \[2017\] NZCA 249. In _Joint Action Funding Limited_, the Court of Appeal had overturned the longstanding exception for self-represented lawyers to the general principle that a self-represented litigant was not entitled to an award of cost.

In _Joint Action Funding Limited_, the Court of Appeal had held that the phrase "costs incurred" in rule 14.2(f) envisaged invoices rendered for legal services provided by a legal practitioner to a client. It followed from this that under the current cost rules, claims for costs are confined to legal costs billed by a lawyer retained by a party litigant for legal services provided by the lawyer to that litigant (at \[43\]).

In _McGuire_ the Full Bench did not consider that there was any need to revisit the conclusions reached in _Joint Action Funding_.

### Decision

The Commissioner argued that, based on the Court of Appeal authority in _Henderson Borough Council v Auckland Regional Authority_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 16 at \[23\], she was entitled to claim for costs when she was represented by in-house counsel.

The defendant argued that _Joint Action Funding Limited_ had materially altered the way in which a Court is to determine awards of cost.

Matthews AJ noted that "costs actually incurred" is confined to legal costs billed by a lawyer retained by a litigant for legal services provided by the lawyer to that litigant, and as there was no bill rendered by the lawyer who had represented the Commissioner to the Commissioner, there were no costs actually incurred in terms of _Joint Action Funding_.

Matthews AJ noted that _Henderson Borough Council_ had been regularly applied by the Courts, but considered that the interpretation of the rules in _Joint Action Funding_ applies outside the context of a litigant representing him or herself in person. Matthews AJ stated:

\[18\] Thus this Court is now called upon to decide whether to apply _Henderson_, or the interpretation of the Rules in Part 14 in accordance with _Joint Action Funding_. I have concluded that this Court should follow _Joint Action Funding_ and _McGuire_. In both cases the Court of Appeal expressly interpreted the current Rules. In neither case did the Court limit its interpretation to application only in relation to self-representing lawyers. Nor does there appear to be any principled basis upon which the rules could bear one interpretation in one context and another in a different context. The interpretation set out by the Court excludes an award of costs to in-house counsel unless the circumstances of that counsel’s retainer fit within the terms of these cases.

The Judge declined to follow the decision in _Henderson_. The Judge noted that he was departing from previous decisions in the High Court in relation to costs awarded to in-house counsel, but distinguished those cases on the basis that they were decided prior to _Joint Action Funding_.

Matthews AJ noted that Rule 4.1 preserved the rule that all matters are at the discretion of the Court if they relate to costs of a proceeding. He considered, however, that since _Joint Action Funding_ and _McGuire_, it would not be a principled exercise of the discretion under Rule 4.1 to award costs in a circumstance where legal costs have not been billed by a lawyer retained by a party litigant for legal services provided by the lawyer to that litigant.

Commissioner not required to disclose documents exchanged under double tax agreement
====================================================================================

2016 case note – High Court finds CIR not required to disclose documents exchanged under double tax agreement.

Case

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1234

Legislative References

Sections 17 and 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 69 and 70 of the Evidence Act 2006, s 10(2)(i) of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary 

The High Court found that the disclosure of documents exchanged between tax authorities pursuant to a Double Tax Agreement is governed by s 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The High Court confirmed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was not required to disclose such documents to the applicant in relation to judicial review proceedings.

### Impact 

The High Court has found that the provisions of s 81 of the TAA govern the determination of whether copies of documents exchanged between Republic of Korea's National Tax Service ("NTS") and the Commissioner, including the original request received by the Commissioner from the NTS ("the Documents") are to be disclosed to the applicant. While the Commissioner had relied on the relevant sections of the Evidence Act 2006 in support of her opposition to the disclosure of the Documents, this decision reinforces the confidential nature of documents exchanged between tax authorities.

### Facts

Chatfield & Co Ltd ("Chatfield") applied to judicially review a decision of the Commissioner to issue it with Notices to Furnish Information under s 17 of the TAA ("the Notices").

Chatfield acts as the tax agent for various companies ("the Companies") which are currently under investigation by the tax authorities of the Republic of Korea ("Korea"). The NTS asked the Commissioner to obtain and provide information relating to the Companies, pursuant to the Double Taxation Relief (Republic of Korea) Order 1983 ("the DTA"). 

In the context of this application for review, Chatfield has sought copies of the Documents. The Commissioner had refused to provide copies of the Documents on the grounds that they are irrelevant, and that they relate to "matters of state" and as such are protected by privilege/confidentiality.

### Decision

The High Court's decision is set out in a judgment (\[2016\] NZHC 1234) dated 9 June 2016 which is to be read in conjunction with an earlier reserved judgment (\[2015\] NZHC 2099) dated 1 September 2015.

_Reserved Judgment dated 1 September 2015_

In its reserved judgment dated 1 September 2015, the High Court stated that it was prepared to proceed on the basis that, as the Documents caused the Notices to be issued, they will by definition be relevant to a claim seeking judicial review of the decision to issue the Notices. 

The High Court identified two cases in which the New Zealand Courts have been required to grapple with applications for discovery in a Double Tax Agreement context; being _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v E R Squibb & Sons (New Zealand) Ltd_ ((1992) 6 PRNZ 601 (CA)) ("_Squibb_") and _Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd v North Shore District Court_ (\[2008\] 1 NZLR 675 (HC)) ("_Avowal_").

The High Court considered that the terms of the DTA coupled with s 81 of the TAA and the rules of court govern the position regarding disclosure. If consent to disclose the Documents was specifically refused by the NTS, then ss 69 and 70 of the Evidence Act 2006 may come into play. 

Furthermore, the High Court considered that the conclusions set out in its reserved judgment were not directly at odds with _Squibb_ and _Avowal_, and that any such conflict is explicable on the basis of the different wording of the DTA; the clarification in more recent OECD commentaries; and the more nuanced approach that is now taken to secrecy under s 81 of the TAA.

The High Court considered that the following factors are relevant in interpreting Double Tax Agreements:

1.  Each Double Tax Agreement is the product of a separate bilateral negotiation process and there are likely to be differences between the various agreements;
2.  The most recent version of the relevant Commentaries to the Model Convention (OECD (2014), _Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version_ 2014, OECD Publishing) is intended to reflect a common view as to what the meaning of a particular section is, and has always been; and,
3.  The legal landscape in relation to taxpayer secrecy, and its recent evolutions.

The High Court also considered that _Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2008\] NZSC 24, \[2008\] NZLR 709) ("_Westpac_") carried greater authority than _Squibb_ in this context. 

The High Court concluded that the matter could not be resolved at this point. It directed that the Commissioner make inquiries of the NTS as to its views on disclosure of specific documents and file a memorandum advising of the outcome of any inquiries made. 

_Judgment dated 9 June 2016_

Subsequent to the release of the Reserved Judgment, the Commissioner filed a memorandum with the High Court detailing why, as a matter of Korean law, the NTS sought to maintain the confidentiality of the Documents. 

In its judgment the High Court found that the requested disclosure was not a ss 69 or 70 (of the Evidence Act 2006) matter but that, following _Westpac_, s 81 of the TAA and the rules governing discovery apply. 

The High Court found that the Commissioner faces competing s 81 interests in carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts, being:

1.  Complying with her discovery obligations in the course of defending court proceedings against her; and
2.  Maintaining a properly founded duty of confidence (whether owed to a taxpayer or to a foreign state).

The weighing of these two interests was considered to be different to the exercise required under ss 69 or 70 of the Evidence Act 2006. 

Against disclosure, the High Court found that discovery principles require that documents sought must at least be relevant to some justiciable issue. Here the applicant wished to test whether the request from the NTS was:

1.  necessary for carrying out the provisions of the Convention or of the domestic laws of Korea (as required by art 25(1)); and
2.  for information which is obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of Korea (as required by art 25(2)).

As set out in its reserved decision of 1 September 2015, the High Court found that the prospect of the Court on review being willing to engage with those kinds of issues is far from high.

The High Court then considered the recent decision of the Singaporean Court of Appeal in _Abu v Comptroller of Income Tax_ (\[2015\] SGCA 4, \[2015\] 2 SLR 420 (CA)) ("_Abu_"). It found that there were similarities between the contentions raised in _Abu_ and those Chatfield advanced in the judicial review proceedings. In this regard the High Court agreed with the concerns articulated by the Singaporean Court of Appeal, that:

1.  Domestic law requires that a request from a foreign tax authority must be clear, specific, relevant, legitimate and consistent with the Exchange of Information Standards. 
2.  Where considering challenges to the veracity of a request from a foreign tax authority, the protection of a taxpayer's rights needs to be balanced against the need to ensure the efficacy of the exchange of information machinery. 
3.  International comity would be compromised if the court were required to make pronouncements that could question the underlying _bona fides_ of requests made by foreign tax authorities.
4.  The Court, in applying the relevant provisions of the tax acts, must not step into the shoes of the executive, which is the branch of government charged with the responsibility for entering into and enforcing international agreements.

As a result, the High Court considered the balance fell firmly on the side of confidentiality, directing that the Documents are not required to be disclosed.

Commissioner obtains Mareva injunction
======================================

2005 case note - CIR obtained a Mareva Injunction against the plaintiffs and third parties in a judicial review, as well as a Court-directed solicitor's undertaking.

Case

Chesterfield Preschools Ltd & Ors v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner obtained a Mareva Injunction against the plaintiffs in a judicial review, and against third parties. He also obtained a Court-directed solicitor's undertaking. The Court also critiqued the recent Vinelight decision in regards to the Commissioner's statutory powers and the Court process.

### Facts

The Commissioner is endeavouring to recover a sum of $3 million from a number of different legal entities and persons including the plaintiffs in this proceeding. All of these persons are united by being members of the Hampton family, or being trusts or corporate entities formed by the Hampton family. The most important person within these proceedings is Mr David John Hampton.

The sum of $3 million has accumulated over a number of years, which has built up through various defaults, whether as to paying GST or other payments and accumulating penalties.

This application was to seek Mareva Injunctions against the plaintiffs, their directors and officers, employees, agents, family members or otherwise to restrain them from disposing or encumbering or otherwise dealing with in any way their money or other assets, whether in their own names or not and whether solely or jointly up to a value of $3 million. This includes orders against the following non-parties:

*   the parents of DJ Hampton in respect to a property which was originally owned by their son and then transferred to his parents recently, and
*   DJ Hampton's sister, Mrs Susan Stikkelman, who owns the business known as Chesterfield Preschools Ltd which, again, was owned by Mr Hampton but was transferred to Mrs Stikkelman.

Ancillary orders were sought for all parties and non-parties to disclose, by affidavit, the whereabouts of their assets.

There is a substantial history of the family members moving assets into different vehicles within the family, which raises the risk of the assets being disposed or dissipated. The sale of property by DJ Hampton to his parents and his sister (a transfer that is questionable, and the Court accepted could turn out to be a sham) are of particular interest.

The plaintiffs said that real property was held by DJ Hampton as trustee in the Anolbe Family Trust, then transferred to his parents partly due to his father's ill health and a wish for his parents to be settled in the property, which they had lived in prior to an attempt to sell the property on the open market, by auction, which did not proceed.

The Crown was seeking charging orders under r 567 HCR, over a number of real estate properties under the control of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs argued that this was an abuse of the Court process as there is another statutory remedy available to the defendant under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Decision

Based on the lack of documentary evidence the Judge felt that there was a real issue around whether the represented advances that may have been made by Mr Hampton's parents to him for his family and may not, on strict analysis, be advances made for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the Anolbe Family Trust. It raised a question as to whether the real property was transferred to his parents to give them peace of mind, given the stressful situation they are in due to the grave illness of his father. On this, the Judge said he was not satisfied that this was an ordinary inter-family transaction.

The Commissioner was successful in his application for a Mareva Injunction against Mr Hampton, his parents and sister based on the pattern of behaviour shown by Mr Hampton and his family and entities. The Judge felt that there was no real risk of the plaintiffs acting dishonestly in a personal sense but would be capable of entering into ingenious transactions, no doubt believing that they were within the law and therefore it being legitimate, but also have the consequence of making it difficult for the Commissioner to enforce tax liabilities and collect tax.

A Mareva Injunction was not ordered against Ms Sisson (Mr Hampton's former wife and a member of his trading partnerships) as she is a barrister and solicitor in practice and therefore an officer of the Court. In that case, Justice Fogarty sought a personal undertaking by her as to the aspect of the conduct of her practice which involved these parties.

It was argued that application for the Mareva Injunction appeared to rely on the defendant's notices or investigations under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and this was an abuse of the use of section 17 and of the Court process. Section 17 is a mechanism of obtaining and producing for inspection:

> ..... any books or documents which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers necessary or relevant **for any purpose** relating to the administration and enforcement of **any** of the Inland Revenue Acts

(Emphasis added)

The plaintiffs submitted that use of the section 17 information in civil proceedings was an abuse of process regardless of whether it was for the Judicial Review or the Mareva order. In a recent decision, (_Vinelight Nominees Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (High Court) Auckland CIV-2005-404-2774, 14 July 2005) Justice Simon France held:

> \[52\] Section 17 is broad in its wording but its use after proceedings have been commenced must be consistent with s27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

Justice Fogarty considered _Vinelight_ but came to a different conclusion to hold that, in this case, the Commissioner was correct in using section 17, or inferentially have section 17 as a backstop, in order to obtain the information it had gathered to support the application for a Mareva Injunction. A detailed discussion of the principles applied by Justice Fogarty is found at paragraph 26 to 46 of the judgment.

The Commissioner was unsuccessful in obtaining a charging order due to the evidence presented to the Court, had not, by fact, satisfied the test to issue a charging order. The language of r 567 is emphatic in saying that such an order shall be granted only on "proof that the opposite party with intent to defeat is making away with property." The Judge was not satisfied that this was the only remedy available to the Commissioner to secure payments. The Commissioner was reserved leave to reapply if he could assemble a stronger case on the facts.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue not able to add new ground to appeal
===================================================================

2005 case note – Court found the CIR unable to raise an issue on appeal that had not been argued in the Taxation Review Authority.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Zentrum Holdings Ltd and Ngahemi Properties Ltd, as the Zentrum Holdings Group

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Justice Keane found in favour of the taxpayer, holding that the Commissioner was unable to raise an issue on appeal that had not been argued in the TRA.

### Facts

This is a decision on a threshold issue raised in the appeal.

The matter concerns the affairs of a company, Zentrum Holdings Ltd ("Zentrum"), and Mr John Brown, who is involved as director and principal shareholder. Another of Mr Brown's companies, Marketing Management Holdings Ltd ("MMHL"), is also involved in the arrangements in question. At the relevant time, MMHL had approximately $1 million in losses, and owed further money to Mr Brown.

Mr Brown made significant monetary contributions to Zentrum, which were held on capital account in a shareholder's current account. In 1997, it was agreed between Mr Brown and Zentrum's other director/shareholder that part of Mr Brown's current account ($1.2m) would be replaced with an interest-bearing loan to Zentrum from Mr Brown.

Mr Brown assigned his loan to Zentrum to MMHL. Zentrum agreed to pay interest to MMHL at the rate of 25%. MMHL paid $1.2m to Mr Brown as consideration, which Mr Brown immediately re-advanced to MMHL. This was done on terms whereby, although interest was to be paid to Mr Brown, it was not required unless it was requested. There was no record that interest was ever requested.

MMHL set off the interest received from Zentrum against its accumulated losses, and made repayments of capital to Mr Brown. The Commissioner assessed this transaction as tax avoidance.

The matter was heard in the TRA. Zentrum was successful in vindicating the returns of income it had made, and the Commissioner's assessments were set aside.

The Commissioner appealed, and included in his grounds for appeal the contention that the transactions in which the disputed assessments were founded amounted to a sham. This issue had not been argued in the TRA, and arose out of evidence given by the taxpayer during the course of the TRA hearing, and documents discovered afterwards.

The taxpayer challenged the Commissioner's ability to include this issue, arguing that the Commissioner is confined to the grounds on which he made the assessments.

### Decision

The Commissioner submitted that whether or not he should be entitled to advance the sham argument should be determined according to the usual principles governing any new point taken on a civil appeal, and without reference _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v V H Farnsworth_ \[1984\] 1NZLR 428 (CA). The Commissioner relied on _Perkowski v Wellington City Corporation_ - while a new ground will not usually be permitted if further findings of fact are required, it can be entertained if open on the record of the Court below.

The Commissioner argued that Zentrum was aware of the Commissioner's concerns about the authenticity of the transactions, as they were set out in the Commissioner's first NOPA, as well as responded to in Zentrum's NOR. The Commissioner contended also that Zentrum's second NOR (in response to a further NOPA) went wider and "identified questions, which could only go to whether the transactions were genuine or fictional." These issues were the subject of evidence and submission in the TRA, and central to the Authority's decision.

Finally, the Commissioner contended that Zentrum did not disclose, either prior to the assessment or during the TRA hearing, "documents recording yet a further instance of circularity, demonstrating the transactions to have been no more than a device to deceive the revenue."

The starting point for Justice Keane's decision was _Farnsworth_, and to what extent the principles it stands for continue to apply.

His Honour then noted that:

> "If this issue fell to be decided on ordinary principles, I would find the Commissioner's arguments highly persuasive. But the _Farnsworth_ principles on which Zentrum relies, those decided in that case, and those deriving from it, are central to this case; and, if they apply, are fatal to the Commissioner."
> 
> After briefly summarising the _Farnsworth_ principles, Justice Keane went on to consider the principles of accuracy and fairness, concluding that "\[t\]he ultimate expression of these principles ... is to be found in Duvall." In that case, Richardson P said that the Commissioner was "necessarily confined to the stance he had taken and which had been held by the TRA". Furthermore, the Court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain any other basis for the assessment.

His Honour continued:

> "To be complete and intelligible, then, any assessment must be expressed definitively at some point not just as a sum payable but as an expression of statutory liability; and, I consider, **where as here the Commissioner does not issue a statement of position under section 89M, he is bound instead by the ground of assessment which he has given in the notice of proposed adjustment** the taxpayer has rejected by the notice of response triggering the right of challenge."  
> \[emphasis added\]

NOPAs and NORs, Justice Keane held, do not serve only to exchange information; they go to issues of fact as well as law, and in order to challenge an assessment, the taxpayer must have rejected the proposed adjustment. While NOPAs and NORs can be overtaken by SOPs, SOPs are not mandatory and in the instant case, none was issued. Accordingly, "the boundaries of the case before the Authority, or this Court, are to be found in the last NOPA and NOR exchange between the Commissioner and the taxpayer".

Although not central to the decision, His Honour added that if he was wrong about this, then the section 108(1) time bar might not necessarily preclude the Commissioner advancing his proposed alternative ground, as no increase in Zentrum's liability is involved. Section 108(1) "speaks in terms of amount rather than liability", and has previously been given its literal meaning in _Dandelion_.

However, His Honour held that the Commissioner is confined in his appeal to the ground on which he assessed Zentrum, and which the Authority disallowed. The Commissioner would not be permitted to run a "sham" argument.

Commissioner partially successful on appeal
===========================================

2010 case note – CIR's appeal of High Court decisions - remission, arrangement, care and management, costs, freezing orders.

Case

Chesterfields Preschools Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1977, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner successfully appealed three decisions of the High Court and had a partial success of a fourth appeal. He received directions from the Court of Appeal for the steps necessary to satisfy the earlier orders of the High Court.

### Impact of decision

The decision is a mixed result for the Commissioner. While he is required to redo some aspects of earlier decisions, other aspects were upheld. It is helpful to have the Court’s views on what should be done to remedy the Commissioner’s mistakes and the Court’s view that this mistake did not originate from a deliberate attempt to not give effect to the High Court’s first judicial review judgment (as found in the second judicial review judgment).

Of particular interest is the Court’s express statement confining the litigation to its facts.

The Commissioner will not appeal any part of the decision where he was unsuccessful.

### Facts

The taxpayers and the Commissioner have been in protracted dispute on a number of legal fronts.

Following a first judicial review (1JR: reported (2007) 23 NZTC 212,125) and after several months of consideration the Commissioner made a series of decisions to give effect to that first judicial review. Those decisions are referred to as the Budhia decision.

The taxpayers were dissatisfied with the outcome of those decisions and commenced a further judicial review (2JR: reported (2009) 24 NZTC 23,148). This second judicial review concluded that the Commissioner had failed to give effect to the 1JR and that he was required to re-do the exercise.

The Commissioner appealed the 2JR on the basis that he had given full effect to the 1JR.

In addition there were three other appeals (all brought by the Commissioner) considered by the Court. Two of these related to the taxpayers’ attempt to vary orders restraining their ability to further encumber their assets to the Commissioner’s disadvantage. At two separate times, the High Court authorised the further encumbering of those assets. Both times the Commissioner successfully obtained an order of the Court of Appeal freezing the execution of the High Court decision. The substantive appeal from the variation decisions was heard with the 2JR appeal.

Additionally the High Court’s costs orders in the 1JR and 2JR against the Commissioner were appealed on the basis these were excessive (reported (2009) 24 NZTC 23,504).

### Decision

The Court pointed out that the 1JR had not been appealed and thus binds the parties on its findings. Nonetheless, 1JR was held not to be precedential in any way.

The court concluded that the Commissioner had complied with the 1JR only in part. To a degree the Budhia decision was upheld (regarding issues of GST registration and challenges to GST returns) but the balance was struck down (the relief from interest and penalties where these were attributable to the Commissioner’s inordinate delay).

The Court considered that section 6/6A was available for the Commissioner to mitigate the effects of “inordinate delay” as this case was extraordinary. The Court gave several alternatives as to what should happen next to resolve this case.

The Court rejected any suggestion that “proportionality” is a legal concept in judicial review.

The Court allowed the Commissioner’s appeal against the costs decisions of the High Court and the appeals against varying the Commissioner’s security.

Commissioner properly exercised discretion not to grant financial relief
========================================================================

2005 case note - Court found trusts were extensions of taxpayer's financial personality - judicial review, financial relief, serious hardship.

Case

William Murray McLean v CIR (Judicial Review)

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Mr McLean had a substantial tax debt arising from his participation in certain tax-driven investments schemes. The scheme deductions were disallowed by the Commissioner and penalties were applied. Mr McLean applied for financial relief but that was declined as the Commissioner was of the view that personal wealth had been quarantined into trusts which were effectively under the control of the taxpayer. Mr Mclean sought judicial review of the Commissioner's decision. The Court upheld the decision agreeing that the trusts were extensions of Mr McLean's financial personality.

### Facts

In 1994-95, through LAQCs the plaintiff invested in the Digitech and Salisbury Investment schemes. The Commissioner investigated the schemes and subsequently disallowed the tax losses claimed by the investors in them, including the plaintiff. Some of the investors in the schemes took challenge proceedings but their counsel conceded the challenges during the course of dispute resolution processes on 20 November 2000 (Digitech) and 20 February 2001 (Salisbury). Formal notices of reassessment were then issued to the investors. In the plaintiff's case a reassessment issued in December 2000 in relation to the Digitech tax losses claimed by the plaintiff and in March/April 2001 for the tax losses claimed in respect of the Salisbury scheme.

In the mid-1990s the plaintiff was a successful real estate agent. He traded using the company Samuel Vaile and Sons Limited. On 28 February 1996 the plaintiff established two trusts, the St Albans Trust (SAT) and the 1843 Trust (1843 Trust). The plaintiff is the primary beneficiary of both trusts. He is not married and does not have children. The initial trustees were the plaintiff and one of the accountants who promoted the Digitech and Salisbury schemes. On establishing the trusts the plaintiff immediately sold 8,000 of the 10,000 shares in Samuel Vaile and Sons Limited to the 1843 trust for $160,000. At the same time he advanced $160,000 to the 1843 Trust to complete the purchase. The purchase price was left outstanding with no demand to be made for 12 years.

The plaintiff transferred his residential property to SAT subject to the existing mortgage and a life interest in his favour and in 1997 the plaintiff's mother rewrote her will naming SAT as a beneficiary for one-third of the residue, effectively in place of the plaintiff.

During September 1999 the plaintiff came under pressure from financiers to sell down some of the properties owned by SAT. In March 2000 he surrendered his life interest in the St Albans Avenue property to SAT in exchange for $227,697 to enable SAT to sell the St Albans Avenue property. The $227,697 was payable upon demand, but the plaintiff agreed to postpone making demand for a period of 20 years. There was no provision for interest.

On 31 March 2001 the plaintiff gifted $27,000 to SAT. This continued gifting which had been made in 1998 and 1999. Between April 1997 and March 2000 the 1843 Trust borrowed money from Samuel Vaile and Sons Limited. In turn monies were drawn from the trust by the plaintiff for living expenses and for the purposes of SAT.

On 22 July 2001 the plaintiff's mother died. On 2 May 2002 the plaintiff entered a deed with the trustees of SAT and the trustees of his mother's estate recording that a mortgage registered over one of the properties owned by his mother's estate secured advances made for the benefit of both Samuel Vaile and Sons Limited and the plaintiff. The deed recorded that the mother's estate would discharge the debt and the repayment would constitute a partial distribution of SAT's entitlement to a third of the residuary estate. It further recorded that the sum was to be applied in reduction of the debt owned by SAT to the plaintiff.

On 21 June 2002 the plaintiff entered a deed with the trustees of the 1843 Trust in which he discharged the liability of the 1843 Trust for the $160,000 owed by the trust to him. He retook the 8,000 shares in settlement of the debt. However, by June 2002 the shares in Samuel Vaile and Son Limited were worthless. On the same day the 1843 Trust retransferred the rights to the use of the name Samuel Vaile and Sons Limited to SAT for $27,000.

During this time, the plaintiff applied to the Commissioner for financial relief, citing "serious hardship". He said he did not personally have any funds, but offered the Commissioner the shares in the LAQC companies he had used for the purposes of the Digitech and Salisbury schemes or alternatively $5,000 in cash which he stated he would have to borrow from his sister. In 2002 he made another settlement offer of $36,000 over three years and finally $72,000 over three years. The Commissioner took the view that the plaintiff's dealings with his trusts and the effective alienation of his assets into those structures, disentitled him from financial relief. The Commissioner sought and obtained judgment for the debt as it then stood but agreed to a stay of execution pending the outcome of these judicial review proceedings.

### Decision

His Honour Justice Venning traversed the above facts in some detail and reviewed the case law on judicial review of debt matters. Counsel for the plaintiff sought to distinguish the _Raynel_ and _Clarke & Money_ decisions on the bases that they were "take-it-or-leave-it" offers or that the plaintiff had not wound up his LAQCs. His Honour did not consider those points of distinction material. He dismissed the application as being entirely without merit and awarded costs on that basis.

> "Those actions show a willingness by the plaintiff to engage in transactions with the trusts, ultimately designed to reduce his assets, primarily the debts owing by the trusts to him, at a time when he was well aware of the Commissioner's challenge to the Digitech and Salisbury schemes and further even during the period after he had sought relief from the Commissioner."
> 
> "In the present case while the plaintiff's offer is not on a take it or leave it basis, in the context of the size of the taxation liability the offers and the terms are modest. The initial offer of $5,000 on the basis he had nothing and would have to borrow from his sister was in commercial terms, a try-on. The Commissioner was entitled to treat the offers that followed, for payment over a long time period of a figure substantially below the core debt, with circumspection."
> 
> "A particularly material factor the Commissioner was entitled to take into account was that while the plaintiff was engaged in the negotiation process with the Commissioner, he was also engaged in transactions that reduced the value of his assets. The plaintiff or for that matter, another taxpayer can not put himself in a financial position in order to force the Commissioner to accept whatever offer he chooses to make."
> 
> "In the present case the following factors are relevant to the Commissioner's decision:
> 
> *   The plaintiff participated in a tax avoidance arrangement.
> *   The plaintiff took steps to alienate his property and transfer it to trusts.
> *   The plaintiff engaged in an exercise to forgive or set off the debts the trusts owed him at a time he knew the Commissioner challenged the tax write off.
> *   A number of the transactions he entered with the trusts support an inference that he intended to defeat the Commissioner's claims.
> *   The plaintiff did not make completely full and frank disclosure. In light of those matters, the Commissioner was entitled to reject the appication for relief and settlement offers of the plaintiff."
> 
> "I endorse the comments of Randerson J in _Raynel_. The Commissioner in the present case was quite entitled and indeed obliged to have regard to the integrity of the tax system and the importance of promoting compliance with the Inland Revenue Acts. In this case the clear inference is that notwithstanding the plaintiff's knowledge of his obligations to the Revenue the plaintiff ordered his affairs principally through the use of the SAT and 1843 trusts to do as much as he could to reduce his personal assets and to place as many obstacles as possible in the way of the Commissioner recovering funds from him personally. It would do nothing for the integrity of the tax system if the plaintiff were permitted to act in that way to force the Commissioner to accept a settlement."
> 
> "As I have noted the review was misguided. The plaintiff and his advisers are aware of the decision of _Raynel_. Despite knowledge of that clear statement of principle the plaintiff pursued these proceedings. He is to pay the costs consequences of that. Costs to the Commissioner on a 2B basis together with disbursements."

Commissioner's application of the serious hardship provisions upheld by the Court of Appeal
===========================================================================================

2011 case note – CIR's application of the serious hardship provisions upheld by Court of Appeal - financial relief, minimum living standards, judicial review.

Case

Jillian Claire Larmer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The appeal failed as the Court of Appeal found that the Commissioner correctly applied section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and contrary to the argument by the taxpayer, had considered the most recent information available to him in applying section 177.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms the following.

The purpose of section 177 of the TAA is to enable the Commissioner to give financial relief to a taxpayer who would otherwise be placed in serious hardship, as defined in section 177A(1) of the TAA.

Partial relief is still relief for the purposes of section 177.

While not expressly mentioned, it would appear that the Commissioner may continue with assessing applications for financial relief at the date the application is made and considering all outstanding tax owing by a taxpayer as a global sum. However, where it is appropriate and results in partial relief for a taxpayer, the year-by-year approach to applications for financial hardship is open to the Commissioner to adopt.

In interpreting section 177A(1) of the TAA, regard must be had to what caused a taxpayer's significant financial difficulties.

The year-by-year approach represents a practical way of granting relief and applying section 177 of the TAA, where the facts allow such an application.

### Facts

Inland Revenue commenced debt recovery proceedings against the taxpayer in respect of income tax and goods and services tax amounting to $175,641.68.

On 8 July 2008 the taxpayer applied for financial relief under the serious hardship provisions of the TAA claiming that her serious hardship was the result of significant financial difficulty that arose from her inability to meet minimum living expenses accord to normal community standards. The Commissioner declined the taxpayer's application for relief and the taxpayer responded by applying to the High Court for judicial review. On 23 October 2008, a judicial settlement conference resolved the taxpayer's application on the basis that the Commissioner would reconsider his decision after giving the taxpayer an opportunity to provide further information.

On 10 December 2008, the taxpayer filed a new application for relief. The Commissioner determined that she met the criteria for serious hardship in respect of the tax years ended 31 March 2000 to 31 March 2003 but not during tax years subsequent to 2003. The taxpayer applied for judicial review of this second decision declining relief for the years subsequent to 2003.

In the High Court, McKenzie J found that there was no reviewable error by the Commissioner in considering whether in the year in which the obligation to pay the tax arose the taxpayer was in serious hardship and accordingly allowing the taxpayer relief in the 2000 to 2003 tax years and not the tax years subsequent to 2003. The taxpayer appealed the decision of McKenzie J.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal found in favour of the Commissioner and dismissed the Appellant's appeal.

#### Was the year-by-year approach taken by the Commissioner available to him in applying s 177?

The taxpayer argued that McKenzie J's decision in the High Court on this aspect was wrong for the following reasons:

1.  The TAA required the Commissioner to asses the taxpayer's requests for financial relief at the date they were made, and in respect of "recovery of outstanding tax". That meant all outstanding tax as a global sum.
2.  Accordingly, the taxpayer's requests for financial relief cannot be assessed on a year-by-year approach.
3.  The effect of the scheme of the TAA is that the Commissioner is not entitled to accept the taxpayer's requests for relief in respect of some tax years and decline them in respect of other tax years.
4.  Having accepted the taxpayer's requests for relief made in 2008, the Commissioner cannot decline those requests for relief in respect of the tax years ended 31 march 2004 to 31 March 2008.

The Court did not agree and upheld McKenzie J's analysis in the High Court for four reasons:

1.  Firstly, McKenzie J's interpretation of section 177 of the TAA was purposive as required by section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999. The purpose of section 177 is to enable the Commissioner to give financial relief to a taxpayer who would otherwise be placed in serious hardship, as defined in section 177A. A consequence of the taxpayer's argument that all outstanding tax as a global sum be assessed at the date a request for financial relief is made, could result in a taxpayer being denied relief. The Court could not view "relief" to be an all or nothing concept as argued by the taxpayer, rather the Court considered "some relief is still relief".
2.  Closely related to the first point, the Court considered that McKenzie J's interpretation of section 177 of the TAA accords with sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. The Court referred particularly to section 6(2)(b) and (f) - the right of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to the law; and the reciprocal responsibility of the Commissioner and Inland Revenue to administer the TAA in that manner.
3.  The Court in explaining their third reason, noted the explanation by McKenzie J that the Commissioners year-by-year approach represented a practical way of granting relief where section 177A(1)(a) applied, while denying it where section 177A(1)(b)(i) applied. The Court stated that the key to interpreting section 177A and applying it is causation, namely what caused the taxpayer's financial difficulties? The Court agreed with McKenzie J's finding that in some years the cause was the taxpayer's low income, but in others it was her tax liabilities. The Court noted that this was essentially an application of section 177A to the facts before McKenzie J.
4.  Lastly the Court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the Commissioner's approach is proscribed by section 177(3). The Court considered that construing section 177 purposively in order to facilitate financial relief where it could be properly granted, permitted a year-by-year approach. Accordingly, the Commissioner could accept the taxpayer's request for one tax year and decline if for another. Further, the Court stated that even if that interpretation is not open, the Commissioner's approach can be viewed as a counter offer made under section 177(3)(c) of the TAA.

The Court noted that the year-by-year approach, which was taken in considering the taxpayer's application for financial relief, will not be appropriate in every case. An example given by the Court of when the year-by-year approach will not be appropriate is where the taxpayer's difficulties do not span more than one tax year. Otherwise, where it is appropriate and results in partial relief for the taxpayer, the Court stated the year-by-year approach is open for the Commissioner to adopt.

Commissioner's decision not to allow financial relief upheld
============================================================

2005 case note - judicial review of the CIR's decision not to allow financial relief - serious hardship, maximise revenue.

Case

Mason Clarke v CIR, Christopher John Money v CIR

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Two taxpayers sought judicial review of the Commissioner's decision not to allow financial relief. They had accumulated very large debts to the Commissioner made up of outstanding tax, penalties and interest. The Court reviewed the correspondence, offers and counter-offers and held that the Commissioner had exercised his statutory discretions correctly and had not breached any statutory duty.

### Facts

Messrs Clarke and Money each applied to the Commissioner under ss 176 and 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA") for relief from huge tax debts which they said they could not pay. Both had invested in the Digi-Tech and Salisbury Investment schemes and after reassessment and the imposition of penalties (which were neither disputed nor challenged), by 2004 they owed taxes of $581,000 and $865,000 respectively.

There was a prolonged course of correspondence, information requests, offer and counter-offer but Mr Clarke's final position was that he offered a single lump-sum payment of $10,000 in full and final settlement of his tax debts. Mr Money's final offer was $25,000 in full and final settlement. The Commissioner declined these offers and invited the taxpayers to come up with a proposal to address the full quantum of tax, penalties and interest due.

The plaintiffs commenced judicial review proceedings alleging that the Commissioner had breached his duty to accept only what the debtor taxpayers can pay. The Commissioner defended the action saying that his overarching duty is to maximise the revenue.

### Decision

Priestly J summarised the correspondence and negotiations between the parties and cited large extracts from the IRD area managers' letters which declined the final offer from each plaintiff. He noted that formal relief had been sought under section 177 TAA but that section 176 obliged the Commissioner to "maximise" the recovery of tax unless "serious hardship" would result. His Honour also noted the prohibition in section 177C(3) against writing off any outstanding tax where a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position or evasion had been applied.

His Honour summarised the factors which the Commissioner must consider:

> "The various statutory duties and discretions imposed and conferred on the defendant by the above provisions are, in my judgment consistent with and probably derived from the obligation contained in section 6 of the Act to protect the integrity of the tax system. Highly relevant too is the Commissioner's duty contained in section 6A(3) which provides:
> 
> (3) In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner's charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to -
> 
> (a) The resources available to the Commissioner; and
> 
> (b) The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and
> 
> (c) The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers."

In that light, his Honour noted the limits the Courts had placed on judicial review in tax matters:

> "From both jurisdictional and constitutional standpoints the plaintiffs' claim is a startling one. There is no evidence of the defendant having acted in an irrational or unreasonable manner. The powerful remedy of judicial review cannot be used, in a taxation context, as a quasi-appeal. It is trite to observe that the remedy is a check on unlawfulness and jurisdictional error."

Priestly J supported that proposition with extensive quotes from _Duncan v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,735 and _Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18, 583.

> "As did Baragwanath J in _Duncan v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (op cit) the last paragraph in Randerson J's judgment stresses the proper function of judicial review. I emphasise again that there is no evidence suggesting the defendant has failed to consider his relevant statutory obligations. Nor is there evidence that, by declining to accept the sums offered by the plaintiffs and writing off the balance of their respective debts, he was acting irrationally or unreasonably."

Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the Commissioner's investigations had not been extensive and had on occasions been premised on erroneous assumptions. He submitted in essence that the onus was on the Commissioner to prove that the plaintiffs could in fact pay more. The Commissioner submitted on the other hand, and his Honour agreed, that the Commissioner merely had to be satisfied that "serious hardship" did not apply and hardship occasioned by an obligation to pay tax didn't count.

His Honour clearly stated that the Commissioner's discretion under section 177(3) (to give financial relief or not) "must be exercised by him and him alone. It is impermissible for the Court to usurp the defendant's functions in that area."

> "Finally, there are the cogent policy considerations contained in _Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (op cit). The stance of the defendant, both before and after the issue of these proceedings, as is evidenced in the two letters to the plaintiffs' counsel, does not display irrationality. In the circumstances of these two taxpayers I detect nothing unreasonable. In the exercise of his discretion under section 177 the defendant is fully entitled to consider a whole range of factors including the circumstances which led to the plaintiffs' taxation debts; the nature and extent of the plaintiffs' co-operation and negotiating stance; the speed with which they have provided requested information and the extent of that information; his obligations under section 6 and section 6A(3); and matters of consistency in administration."

Most importantly, his Honour stated that there was no breach of any statutory duty where the Commissioner seeks to recover sums which may not in fact be recoverable. Neither is forcing a taxpayer into bankruptcy inconsistent with the obligation to maximise the recovery of tax.

> "Nor in my judgment is there any breach of the broader and paramount obligation of the Commissioner to uphold the integrity of the tax system required by section 6, nor of his duty under section 6A(3). Particularly in a case such as this, unpalatable outcomes for some taxpayers may be important in promoting voluntary compliance, which is a section 6A(3)(b) consideration."

Commissioner's decision reviewed
================================

2005 case note – No judicial review for CIR's decision to not accept the plaintiff's NOPA filed outside the statutory response period - exceptional circumstances.

Case

Claire Avon Rae Hollis v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

No ground of judicial review existed in relation to the Commissioner's decision to not accept the plaintiff's NOPA which was filed outside the statutory response period.

### Facts

This was a Judicial Review of the decision of the Commissioner to refuse to accept the late filing of a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") under section 89K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA").

Prior to 2004 the plaintiff had been in dispute with the Accident Compensation Corporation ("ACC") over entitlement to compensation.  During the 2004 income tax year the dispute was resolved and the plaintiff was granted employment-related compensation from ACC.

While the payment was made in two lump sums they effectively related to an earlier period of years.  After discussions between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, the Commissioner agreed to allow the ACC payments to be allocated back into the years in which they effectively related, rather than in the year they were received.

Following this decision the plaintiff's Tax advisors, Coffey Davidson Limited, filed income tax returns reflecting this agreement for the income tax years ended 31 March 2000 through 2004 inclusive.

Following the filing of these income tax returns the Commissioner issued notices of assessment with respect to the income tax years ended 31 March 2000, 2001 and 2002 and income statements for the 2003 and 2004 income tax years.

These notices of assessment and income statements were issued by the Commissioner to the plaintiff's tax agents.  The plaintiff's tax agents however, failed to pass these on to the plaintiff until around two months after they were originally issued by the Commissioner.

Having finally received the relevant information from her tax agents, the plaintiff prepared a NOPA for the 2000 through 2004 income tax years inclusive, which was then issued to the Commissioner along with a covering note requesting that the NOPA be accepted despite being issued outside the statutory response period required by the TAA.

For all save the 2004 income tax year, the NOPA was issued outside the two month statutory response period.  Because of the operation of Part III of the TAA no assessment for the 2004 year has yet been made and as such the plaintiff will have two months to challenge that assessment by NOPA once such an assessment is made.

For the 2000 through 2003 income tax years a number of grounds were raised by the plaintiff in support for having her late NOPA accepted.  These included:

1.  The fact that the plaintiff was awaiting a Court of Appeal decision and other reviews and appeals relating to her entitlement to a benefit and ACC, which might affect her tax position and assist her.
2.  Her tax agents, her accountants, did not pass on the relevant notice of assessment and income statements until the two month response period had expired or practically expired.
3.  There was a dispute between herself and the Commissioner as to the correctness of the income tax returns.
4.  The Commissioner should allow the underlying merits of the plaintiff's case to be heard and resolved.
5.  Judge Barber (of the Taxation Review Authority) had previously made comments about the need for a liberal approach to be given to the interpretation of exceptional circumstances.

The Commissioner, through a duly delegated officer, concluded that none of these reasons constituted exceptional circumstances.

### Decision

His Honour found for the Commissioner after working through the following submissions made by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's first submission revolved around the difficulty of potentially different decisions on her tax liability for the 2004 income tax year, compared to her 2000 through 2003 income tax years.  This arose as all parties agreed the plaintiff still had the right to NOPA the 2004 income tax year after the Commissioner makes a formal assessment for that year.

The plaintiff made the point that if she is successful in disputing her 2004 income tax assessment there will be conflicting tax liabilities for the 2000 through 2003 income tax years as all the years relate to exactly the same issues.  Basically, the plaintiff submitted this was an exceptional circumstance.

His Honour noted that the plaintiff had never put this point to the Commissioner in support of her argument for exceptional circumstances.  In any event His Honour noted that as counsel for the Commissioner had pointed out, if the plaintiff was successful in her dispute over her 2004 income tax year she would be able to apply to the Commissioner under section 113 of the TAA to have her earlier income tax years amended accordingly.  Therefore, this was not a ground of review for the plaintiff.

His Honour then dealt with a number of submissions made by the plaintiff relating to the circumstances by which she was late in filing her NOPA.

His Honour concluded it was clear that the plaintiff did not formally know about the notices of assessment and income statements until her accountants had finally passed them on to her.

His Honour noted that once the plaintiff had received the notices, she called Inland Revenue and spoke to an employee who told her, that despite being out of time or almost out of time, there may have been grounds to justify exceptional circumstances.

His Honour again noted that the plaintiff had never put this point to the Commissioner in support of her argument for exceptional circumstances.  Furthermore, the plaintiff did not claim to have been misled by this information nor did she claim that it had delayed her in issuing her NOPA.

His Honour concluded that although it is unwise for Inland Revenue employees to give such advice, on the facts of this case it did not provide a ground of review.

His Honour also concluded that although the plaintiff had not raised any substantive grounds of review she did nevertheless have an effective remedy in this case.  That was to proceed through with the dispute in relation to the 2004 income tax year and if she was successful with this, she could apply to the Commissioner under section 113 of the TAA to have her 2000 through 2003 income tax years amended accordingly.

Commissioner's decision to decline instalment arrangement upheld
================================================================

2011 case note – CIR's decision to decline instalment arrangement upheld - judicial review, Court's discretion.

Case

Priscilla Anne Kea v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court held that it would have been wrong for it to grant a remedy to the plaintiff (even if a reviewable error had been made) because the plaintiff misrepresented her position and the facts upon which the instalment arrangement proposal relied were no longer applicable. The Court further held that the Commissioner had taken into account relevant factors and that his decision to decline the plaintiff's instalment arrangement proposal was not unreasonable or irrational.

### Impact of decision

This case considers the limits of the Commissioner's discretion under section 177B(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and the relationship of the relief provisions with sections 6 and 6A of the TAA.

### Facts

The plaintiff made an application for judicial review of the Commissioner's decision to decline her instalment arrangement proposal of 17 December 2010. The plaintiff had already made a number of earlier proposals and those proposals had been declined.

The plaintiff had received a total income of $791,932 over an eight-year period from 31 March 2003 to 31 March 2010. During that period she filed tax returns. However, she only paid a total amount of tax of $2,303.

On 24 November 2010 the Court issued a bankruptcy notice to the plaintiff and by 13 December 2010 the plaintiff had committed an act of bankruptcy. The bankruptcy proceedings were adjourned until the outcome of the judicial review proceeding.

### Decision

#### _Court's discretion to refuse relief_

Justice Ronald Young held that two factors identified by the Commissioner overwhelmingly establish that it would have been wrong for the Court to grant a remedy to the plaintiff even if a reviewable error had been made:

*   Firstly, the plaintiff did not mention in her proposal or in response to any of the Commissioner's enquiries that her December 2010 contract (upon which her proposal to pay instalments was based) was for two months only. His Honour held that this was a material misrepresentation.
*   Secondly, the provision of relief would not serve a useful purpose because the facts upon which the plaintiff's 17 December 2010 proposal was made were no longer applicable.

#### _Considering irrelevant matters_

His Honour held that the factors which the Commissioner took into account in his decision-making were relevant, authorised by the TAA and despite submissions by the plaintiff to the contrary, came within the broad ground set out in section 177B(2)(a) of the TAA. In particular, his Honour held that the Commissioner was entitled to conclude that agreeing to the plaintiff's proposal would not "maximise the recovery of outstanding tax" as the plaintiff could not be relied upon to make good her promises to pay the instalments.

In any event, his Honour rejected the plaintiff's submission that section 177B(2) is a code and that the Commissioner can only reject a proposal for an instalment arrangement on the four grounds identified. His Honour held that the language of section 177B(2) is empowering rather than restrictive or prohibiting. It provides that the Commissioner "may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement if ... to do so would not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer". Accordingly, his Honour held that the broader taxation obligations on the Commissioner pursuant to sections 6 and 6A were still relevant and should not be set aside.

#### _Unreasonableness_

His Honour rejected the plaintiff's claim that the decision of the Commissioner was unreasonable or irrational. His Honour noted that the Commissioner had accurately marshalled the relevant facts and that the conclusions reached were open on those facts. In particular, the plaintiff's history provided ample evidence upon which the Commissioner was entitled to reject the plaintiff's proposal because it would not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax where the plaintiff was not reliable and her proposal was unlikely to be realised. Furthermore, his Honour held that it was a relevant factor for the Commissioner to take into account the need to promote voluntary compliance with tax obligations. His Honour held that the plaintiff had flouted her tax obligations and continued to do so.

#### _Factual errors_

His Honour also rejected the plaintiff's criticisms that the Commissioner had made certain factual errors which the plaintiff alleged were "symptomatic" of the Commissioner's approach when dealing with her. Rather, his Honour held that the Commissioner had been extremely patient in giving the plaintiff years of opportunity to pay her tax.

Commissioner's discretion to decline making a ruling on application of section GA 1
===================================================================================

2012 amendment to the Tax Administration Act allows the CIR to decline to provide a ruling on how the reconstruction provision applies.

_Section 91E(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

New section 91E(3B) will allow the Commissioner to decline to provide a ruling on how the reconstruction provision in section GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies or would apply.

### Background

The purpose of the binding rulings regime is to allow taxpayers who apply for a ruling to obtain certainty on how taxation laws apply to an arrangement disclosed to the Commissioner. It is intended that in most cases rulings will be sought and obtained before entering into the arrangement.

If the Commissioner rules that an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement, under the existing law the Commissioner may also be asked by the applicant to rule on how section GA 1 will apply. Section GA 1 is the reconstruction provision which allows the Commissioner to adjust the taxable income of a person affected by an arrangement in order to counteract a tax avoidance arrangement.

New section 91E(3B) gives the Commissioner a discretion to decide not to rule on the application of section GA 1. The discretion is unlikely to arise as an issue very often because it would require the Commissioner to take a position that an arrangement is avoidance and for a taxpayer (who still enters into such an arrangement) to seek a ruling on how the reconstruction power will apply.

In order to rule on section GA 1, the Commissioner will need to undertake a thorough investigation of the arrangement, including the persons who may be affected by the arrangement, and other likely situations which might have arisen had the tax avoidance arrangement not been entered into. This can be a lengthy process and rulings are not intended to be investigations or audits, nor is it appropriate or feasible for the Commissioner to handle rulings in that way. Often, because of timing issues, the tax advantage will not have fully crystallised or be able to be properly quantified until a full audit or investigation occurs. In addition, a ruling on section GA 1 could be used to constrain the Commissioner's ability to argue on the appropriate reconstruction in the context of the tax disputes process. Given the difficulty of arguments regarding counterfactuals and reconstruction, this may be undesirable.

A tax avoidance arrangement may affect more than one person. Accordingly, the Commissioner may need to adjust the taxable income of a number of people in order to appropriately counteract the tax advantages obtained. A taxpayer who is not a party to a tax avoidance arrangement can still be subject to the Commissioner's reconstruction power if they have obtained a tax advantage from the arrangement, even though they may not be aware that they have benefited from the arrangement. These matters can be difficult to determine using the binding rulings regime for complex arrangements involving multiple parties (who may not be applicants). This difficulty will be even more pronounced if this involves prospective arrangements.  

If an applicant for a ruling were able to require the Commissioner to rule on section GA 1, the Commissioner would have to rely on information (if obtainable) provided by the applicant about these other persons. The binding rulings regime is not the most appropriate way to determine what corrective adjustments may be required to be made to all taxpayers who have benefited, or would benefit, from a tax avoidance arrangement.

Given these difficulties, it will not always be feasible or appropriate for the Commissioner to rule in a definitive and binding manner on the application of the reconstruction power.

### Key features

This section provides the Commissioner with a discretion to decide not to provide a ruling on how the reconstruction provision applies or would apply.

### Application date

The new section will apply from the date of Royal assent, being 2 November 2012.

Commissioner's interim operational position for GST and Bodies Corporate
========================================================================

CIR's interim operational position for GST and Bodies Corporate 23 Jun 2014 – GST exemptions.

### Background

The Minister of Revenue has recently announced the Government’s intention to pass legislation to exempt bodies corporate (established under the Unit Titles Act 1972 or 2010) from GST. The proposed law change is intended to avoid the need for unnecessary registration of potentially several thousand bodies corporate and to promote consistency with other forms of residential home ownership.

It is proposed that retrospective legislation will be passed that will:

*   exempt supplies between a body corporate and its owners from GST from 1 October 1986; and
*   provide transitional provisions that will allow any body corporate that was registered for GST to remain registered until 6 June 2014 (the date of announcement).

When enacted, and with effect from 6 June 2014, no body corporate will be able to register (or be registered) in respect of supplies made to its owners.

As there will be a period of time between the retrospective application date of the proposed legislation and its enactment, it is recognised that there are a number of interim issues that potentially arise.

The following questions and answers set out the Commissioner’s current view, and the operational approach that the Commissioner will be taking to address these issues. Inland Revenue will continue to apply the current law until it is amended. Where possible we will also act consistently with the proposed law, where doing so is not inconsistent with the current law.

However, it must be recognised that until the law is changed there will inherently be some uncertainty. For example, the detail of the proposed legislation may change. It is strongly recommended that any affected body corporate, or other affected taxpayer, seeks advice from a tax professional.

The following FAQ are to provide guidance to taxpayers on Inland Revenue’s interim operational approach.

### General

_1\. Is Inland Revenue going to finalise its view on whether a body corporate is liable to register for GST?_ 

Inland Revenue previously published an issues paper on whether bodies corporate conduct a taxable activity. The preliminary conclusion in that paper was that the levies imposed by bodies corporate are consideration for a taxable supply. Comments were received that both agreed and disagreed with that view.

The Government is now proposing to clarify the law. Therefore, Inland Revenue has adopted the view expressed in the issues paper, but subject to the interim operational position previously published.

Inland Revenue’s view is that a body corporate is entitled to register for GST if it receives levies from unit owners. If the body corporate is making taxable supplies of more than $60,000 per year, it is required to register for GST. Consistent with our previous interim operational position, we will not require any specific body corporate to register.

#### Already GST registered before announcement

_2\. Once the law is amended, will all GST registered bodies corporate be deregistered?_ 

Not necessarily.

The effect of the proposed law change is that goods or services that are supplied by a body corporate “under a power or duty of the body corporate as set out in section 84 of \[the Unit Titles Act 2010\]” will be exempt supplies. Therefore, a body corporate that only makes such supplies will not be conducting a taxable activity and will be deregistered.

However, if a body corporate is making other supplies (for example, renting car parks to third parties), it may still be liable to be registered (and remain registered). Alternatively, the body corporate will be able to voluntarily register in respect of such supplies.

_3\. My body corporate is currently registered. Does it have to continue filing GST returns?_ 

Yes.

If the body corporate is already registered for GST and is liable to be registered for GST, it is required to continue to comply with its obligations (including charging GST on supplies it makes and filing GST returns).

However, if a body corporate voluntarily registered for GST, and is not required to be registered for GST (i.e., the body corporate’s taxable supplies are less than $60,000), it may choose to deregister. If you wish to deregister, you will have to contact Inland Revenue.

_4\. Can I keep filing GST returns, and get GST refunds, despite the announcement?_ 

Yes.

Until the Government’s proposal is enacted, a body corporate that is registered for GST can keep filing GST returns and can claim any refunds that it is due. However, if the Government’s proposal is enacted, all bodies corporate will be deregistered from 6 June 2014 and any refunds arising after that date will be required to be repaid.

_5\. If the body corporate remains registered and keeps charging GST on its levies, will Inland Revenue refund the GST the body corporate has charged its owners (output tax) once the law is changed?_ 

Yes.

If a body corporate stays registered, it will have to keep charging GST on the supplies that it makes, usually the body corporate levies.

If the proposal is enacted, a body corporate that has only been making exempt supplies will be deregistered with effect from 6 June 2014. This will mean that the supplies made by the body corporate will, retrospectively, not have been liable to GST. However, as GST will have been charged on the levy imposed by the body corporate, technically, but only retrospectively, GST will have been charged by an unregistered person.

Normally, when GST is charged by an unregistered person, Inland Revenue requires that GST to be paid to Inland Revenue, as otherwise it results in a windfall gain to the person who has charged GST, as it is unlikely to be returned to the recipients of the supply. In this case, the GST will already have been paid to Inland Revenue, and therefore should be retained by Inland Revenue and not refunded.

However, in this case the nature of the body corporate should be recognised. If the GST output tax is returned to the body corporate, it is effectively being returned to the members of the body corporate, the owners, who paid the output tax. Therefore, there is unlikely to be a windfall gain to the body corporate.

It is therefore intended that when any GST returns are amended, both the output tax accounted for by the body corporate in respect of the levies and any input tax claimed, will be reversed. If this gives rise, overall, to a refund for the body corporate, it will be paid by Inland Revenue.

_6\. If the body corporate remains registered and keeps charging GST on its levies, will it have to refund to its owners the GST it has charged to its owners, once the law is changed?_ 

Maybe.

Whether or not the body corporate refunds an amount that it has charged its owners is a matter between the body corporate and those owners.

_7\. My body corporate is already registered, from a date after 1 April 2010. Do we have to backdate our registration to 1 April 2010?_ 

No.

If you are happy with your current registration date, it does not have to be changed.

Under the Government’s proposal, a body corporate can choose to have its effective date of registration back-dated to either the first day of their first taxable period that occurs after 1 April 2010 or the date it first became liable to be registered, whichever is the later.

_8\. My body corporate was first registered on a date after 1 April 2010. Can its registration now be backdated to an earlier date?_ 

Yes, you may be able to choose to backdate the registration.

Inland Revenue’s previous interim operational position was that it would not backdate an existing GST registration, or apply a new registration from an earlier date.

However, Inland Revenue has reconsidered that position and, consistent with the Government’s proposal, Inland Revenue will, if requested, backdate an existing GST registration to the later of:

*   the first day of the body corporate’s first taxable period that occurs after 1 April 2010; or
*   the first day on which the body corporate is liable to be registered under section 51(1) of the GST Act.

If a registered body corporate wants to have their registration backdated, it will have to contact Inland Revenue. Once the registration is backdated, the body corporate will have to furnish all outstanding returns and pay any GST that is due.

If the body corporate was voluntarily registered (that is, it is not liable to be registered under the GST Act), Inland Revenue will not back-date its GST registration. This is because the proposed amendments will only apply to bodies corporate that were liable to be registered.

_9\. My body corporate has been registered from a date earlier than 1 April 2010. Do we have to change our registration date?_ 

No.

Existing registrations from an earlier date will not be changed.

_10\. If my body corporate gets a GST refund for a period after the announcement, will it have to pay it back if the proposed law is passed?_ 

Yes.

If the law is changed as proposed, the body corporate will be deemed to have made exempt supplies. If the body corporate only made exempt supplies, then it will be deregistered with effect from 6 June 2014 and will have to repay any GST refunds it received after that date.

If the body corporate made other taxable supplies, it will need to furnish amended GST returns for the period after 6 June 2014.

_11\. If I have to repay a refund, will I have to pay use of money interest?_ 

Yes.

If the law is changed as proposed, and refunds have to be repaid, use of money interest will be payable.

However, Inland Revenue will consider any requests that it receives for the remission of such interest under section 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. While it is not possible to say in advance how such requests would be decided, if a body corporate that was registered before 6 June 2014, and is unable to be deregistered until the law is changed, has a retrospective liability to repay GST as a result, then remission of the interest is likely to be considered favourably.

Inland Revenue will pay interest on any overpayments that arise as a result of amending assessments.

_12\. If I have to repay a refund, will I have to pay late payment penalties?_ 

Probably not.

When an assessment is amended and tax is to be paid, time is given to repay the amount before late payment penalties apply. This is at least 30 days.

Therefore, so long as the amount is paid within the time allowed, late payment penalties will not apply.

_13\. My body corporate is registered for GST. Can we now deregister with effect from the date of announcement?_ 

Probably not.

Inland Revenue will not deregister a body corporate that is liable to be registered under the current law (that is, the law that applies until the Government’s proposal is enacted).

However, if a body corporate is not required to be registered, that is, it is voluntarily registered, it may apply to deregister at any time.

Tax consequences may arise from deregistering, so advice should be sought from a tax professional.

_14\. If I deregister my voluntarily registered body corporate, will I have to pay output tax on the assets owned by the body corporate?_ 

Maybe.

When a registered person ceases to conduct a taxable activity, any assets or other goods that were part of the taxable activity, that are retained, are deemed to be supplied to the registered person. This means that any assets owned by the body corporate will be deemed to be provided to the body corporate and subject to GST.

This could include common property, and any other goods that the body corporate has acquired and still holds. This will not include the individual units or flats, as they are property owned by the members of the body corporate, rather than the body corporate itself.

It should be noted that this potential liability is a matter that the Government’s discussion document is seeking specific comment on.

_15\. If my body corporate doesn’t de-register with effect from 6 June 2014, what will my body corporate have to do once the law is changed?_ 

If the Government’s proposals are enacted, there are a number of actions that will need to be taken.

If, once the proposals have been enacted, the body corporate has only been making exempt supplies, the body corporate will need to contact Inland Revenue and request that the body corporate be deregistered with effect from 6 June 2014.

If, once the proposals have been enacted, the body corporate has been making both exempt supplies and taxable supplies, the body corporate will need to contact Inland Revenue and provide sufficient information to allow Inland Revenue to amend your GST returns.

The proposals do not alter liability to interest and late payment penalties, so they will apply in accordance with the existing rules.

Deregistration may result in GST being payable by the body corporate as a result of the retention of assets. Whether this occurs will depend on the circumstances of that body corporate.

#### Not registered before announcement

_16\. My body corporate has never been registered for GST. Do I now have to register for GST?_ 

No.

Inland Revenue will not require any body corporate that is not registered to now register. This is consistent with Inland Revenue’s interim operational position published on 8 May 2013.

_17\. My body corporate is not registered. Can we now register for GST, despite the Government’s announcement?_ 

Yes, however this may lead to a future tax liability.

Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the current law is that a body corporate that receives levies is carrying on a taxable activity. Consistent with Inland Revenue’s interim operational position, a body corporate can therefore choose to register.

If it is enacted, the Government’s proposal means that the body corporate will be deregistered with effect from 6 June 2014 and any GST returns will have to be amended. The body corporate will have to repay any refunds it received after the date of deregistration.

_18\. If my body corporate registers after the date of the announcement, can we backdate the registration?_ 

No.

If a body corporate registers for GST after 6 June 2014, Inland Revenue will not backdate the GST registration.

This is consistent with both the Commissioner’s current interim operational position and the Government’s proposal.

_19\. If I register after the date of announcement and get a GST refund for the period after the date of registration, do I have to repay it?_ 

Yes.

If the law is changed as proposed by the Government, any GST refunds that relate to making exempt supplies after 6 June 2014 will have to be repaid.

Late payment penalties and use of money interest will apply in the normal manner. This will include allowing time to pay any amount that arises from an amended GST assessment.

_20\. My body corporate sent in an application to register before the announcement, but I haven’t heard from Inland Revenue. Will I be treated as registered for GST prior to the announcement?_ 

Yes.

If an application to register for GST was received by Inland Revenue before 6 June 2014, it will still be processed, and the body corporate will be registered with effect from the date requested on the application (if Inland Revenue agrees with that date).

#### GST registered owners

_21\. I am a GST registered owner of a unit in an unregistered body corporate, and I use the unit in my taxable activity. Am I now able to claim GST input tax incurred by the body corporate?_ 

No.

Currently, a GST registered owner is unable to claim an input tax credit on the levies that they pay to their unregistered body corporate. This is because the body corporate has not charged them GST, but the levy includes the GST incurred by the body corporate. This results in the GST registered person having to meet the cost of GST, but being unable to claim an input tax credit.

Under the Government’s proposals, a GST registered owner will be able to claim their share of the input tax incurred by an unregistered body corporate (to the extent that it is attributable to the owner’s taxable activity).

However, until such time as the law is changed, there is no basis on which such a claim can be made. Once the law is changed, Inland Revenue will publish further guidance. It is expected that a GST registered owner will be able to request that Inland Revenue amend their GST returns, if they are able to obtain sufficient supporting information from their body corporate.

_22\. I am a GST registered owner in a currently GST registered body corporate. Once the Government’s proposals are enacted, my body corporate will have to deregister from 6 June 2014. What will that mean for the input tax that I have claimed on the GST inclusive levies that I paid?_ 

Under the Government’s proposals, a GST registered owner will be able to claim their share of the input tax incurred by an unregistered body corporate (to the extent that it is attributable to the owner’s taxable activity). If a body corporate is retrospectively deregistered, this will mean that no GST was properly payable on the levy, and therefore should not be claimed as an input tax credit by the GST registered owner.

However, as the owner will still be entitled to claim their share of the GST paid by the body corporate during the period, it is not intended to require the GST registered owner to amend their GST returns for the periods between 6 June 2014 and the date on which the body corporate is deregistered.

Commissioner's right to remove and copy electronic information
==============================================================

2008 case note – scope of the CIR's section 16 powers - CIR's right to access and remove documents, electronic information, privilege and encryption.

Case

Avowal Administrative Attorneys Limited and Ors v the District Court at North Shore and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA")

### Summary

The High Court held that the definition of "book and document" in the TAA included computer hard drives. The Commissioner therefore had the right to remove hard drives for copying under section 16 of the TAA. This decision should be read together with the interim judgment released on 28 February 2008.

### Impact of decision

This decision explains the scope of the Commissioner's section 16 powers. It clarifies when and to what extent the Commissioner is required to do a relevance check prior to removing electronic documents for copying, particularly in circumstances involving privilege claims or encryption of hard drives.

### Facts

On 8 November 2006, the Commissioner and the Australian Tax Office ("the ATO") conducted simultaneous access operations on both sides of the Tasman. The operations followed a request by the ATO to the Commissioner in 2004 under Article 26 of the Australia-New Zealand Double Tax Agreement ("the DTA"). The ATO provided background information which indicated that a number of entities based in or operating in New Zealand were promoting, marketing and implementing a wide range of tax avoidance schemes.

Using his powers under section 16 of the TAA, the Commissioner entered seven premises, both private and commercial, and removed hardcopy documents and hard drives for copying. Seven applicants commenced judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner, and another applicant later joined the proceedings.

### Decision

**Are hard drives a "book or document"?**  
The Court stated that the definition of "book and document" in the TAA was a wide one and not limited to the information contained within the book or document. Information can be stored electronically; tapes, discs and computer reels are examples within the TAA definition of information stored electronically.

A hard drive is an integral part of a computer. When reference is made to information stored on a computer, it must include information stored on a hard drive. The function of storing information on a computer that was formerly carried out by computer reels is now carried out by the hard drive. The definition of "books and documents" is out of date to the extent that it refers to computer reels. "Computer reels" in the definition must now be read as "hard drive", so the hard drive of a computer is a "book or document" for the purposes of the Act. Therefore, section 16 of the TAA authorises IRD officers to inspect and copy hard drives which they consider necessary and relevant, and section 16B authorises the removal of the hard drive to make copies, or the removal of the computer if the hard drive cannot be readily removed.

**Privilege**  
At the Avowal sites, a blanket claim to privilege was made over all electronic information. The IRD officers considered that it would not be appropriate to conduct a relevance search because of the privilege claim. The Court stated that this was a cautious approach to take, but not one for which the IRD officers could be criticised.

Where there is a blanket claim to privilege, an officer exercising a search power may look at a document, including a document over which privilege is claimed, for the purpose of determining whether it may be relevant or privileged. However, the IRD officers cannot be criticised for deciding not to challenge the claim to privilege in these circumstances, particularly given that provision is made in section 20(5) of the TAA for a process to determine privilege claims. The copying of privileged material is not a breach of privilege where such a process is provided.

The purpose of the keyword search (relevance check) is to protect the occupier's rights against unreasonable search, to ensure that the search is directed at relevant material and to ensure that it is conducted reasonably. However privilege is also an important right. It was not unreasonable for the IRD officers to accept the claim to privilege and to deal with it in a manner consistent with section 20(5) of the TAA, rather than insisting on conducting a keyword search. In the circumstances of the particular search, the general claim to privilege meant that the IRD officers were not required to carry out a relevance check before copying and/or removing the hard drives.

At the Tauranga site, privilege was claimed over all hardcopy and electronic documents that were to be removed. The officer in charge instructed his team to scan the material solely to determine whether or not it was relevant and nothing else. As noted above, the Court considered that this did not breach privilege.

**Ability to copy the entire hard drive**  
The applicants submitted that once a relevance search was done, only the documents identified as relevant could be copied off the hard drive. The Court rejected this submission, holding that while it may have been technically possible for the IRD computer technicians to have done this, as a matter of principle, this approach is not required by the authorities. The fact that the hard drive may also contain irrelevant or privileged information does not mean that it cannot be copied or removed.

What is required is an assessment by the IRD officers in relation to each hard drive copied, first to determine whether there is relevant material on it and second whether it is necessary to copy that material so that it can be removed for later analysis.

**Encryption**  
At the Motueka sites, four of the hard drives copied were encrypted. The IRD computer technician did not conduct a keyword search of these computers. The applicants submitted that the IRD could not copy or remove an encrypted file because no relevance check could be done on that file. The Court rejected the submission. It stated that the purpose of the relevance check was to provide a balance between the ability of the Commissioner to exercise his section 16 powers and the rights of the individual to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.

The Court stated that the encryption of a hard drive made a relevance check pointless. The Court held that the ultimate test was whether the inspection was conducted in a reasonable fashion and whether the search and decision to copy was a reasonable one, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. The decision must be made on the basis that copying is necessary or relevant or considered likely to provide relevant information. The conclusion that the encrypted hard drives were likely to provide information for the purposes of the investigation was reasonable. Therefore, it was open to the IRD officers to copy or remove the encrypted hard drives.

Prior to the final hearing, the applicants indicated that they were withdrawing their challenge to the removal of hard copy documents and to the removal of electronic information at three of the seven sites.

Of the four sites at which the removal of electronic information was challenged, the High Court upheld the Commissioner's actions at the Avowal and Tauranga sites. At the Browns Bay site, the Court ordered the return of a back-up hard drive over which no relevance check was carried out, but upheld the copying of a laptop. At the Motueka site, the Court ordered the return of the laptop clone and the second hard drive, but upheld the copying of the encrypted hard drive.

Commissioner's right to withhold a GST refund
=============================================

2008 case note - Section 46 of the GST Act, CIR's right to withhold a refund, section 27 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908.

Case

Contract Pacific Limited v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001; Tax Administration Act 1994; Bills of Exchange Act 1908 ("BOEA"); Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GSTA")

### Summary

The High Court concluded that in any investigation of a refund that engages section 46(2)(a) of the GSTA, requests for information made under that investigation will engage section 46(2)(b) as well. Any such requests that do not comply with the time limits in section 46(4) will cause the Commissioner to lose his authority to withhold the refund while he carries out his investigation.

### Impact of decision

If the Commissioner, during an investigation that engages section 46(2)(a) of the GSTA, makes a request for information, this will engage section 46(2)(b). Consequently, the Commissioner will need to issue any requests for information as part of that investigation within the time limits set out in section 46(4) or the Commissioner will lose his authority to withhold the refund while he carries out his investigation.

### Facts

At relevant times, Contract Pacific carried on the business of an inbound tour operator, selling New Zealand-based holiday packages to overseas wholesalers who then sold to overseas retailers. Those retailers in turn sold to overseas-based holidaymakers who were to visit New Zealand.

Between July 1993 and April 1999, Contract Pacific included GST in the sale prices for the services it sold to overseas wholesalers while other inbound tour operators did not.

In May 1999, the law was changed (with a retrospective effect) to remove any ambiguity over liability to include GST in the sale prices for New Zealand-based services sold to overseas persons for the purpose of on-sale to New Zealand-bound visitors.

On 26 June 2000, on advice, Contract Pacific filed a GST return in which it sought a readjustment and refund of the GST it had paid between 1 July 1993 and 30 April 1999.

The Department's internal computer records for 28 June 2000 record a GST assessment from the taxpayer for a refund of $7,345,396.94. With the effect of additional sums, the entire refund totalled $7,542,295.51.

On 10 July 2000, the Commissioner advised that the GST refund had been withheld pending investigation of the readjustment claim.

Through an administrative error, a notice of assessment and refund cheque for $7,542,295.51 were issued on 5 February 2001. On 9 February 2001, the Commissioner became aware of the error and took steps to stop payment on the refund cheque.

Until 2 April 2001, the Commissioner advised the GST claimants that further investigation of their claims was required. On 2 April 2001, the Government introduced the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill ("the Bill").

On 2 July 2001 a notice of assessment was sent which disallowed the credit adjustment and consequential refund Contract Pacific sought.

On 24 October 2001, the Bill came into force as the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 ("2001 Act"), with retrospective effect. The general effect of the new legislation (section 241) was to make clear there was and always had been liability to pay GST on the service dispute. There was a savings provision that exempted a small category of persons from its effect. Contract Pacific would come within this savings provision if the circumstances of receiving the refund cheque meant it had been paid a refund.

After the enactment of the 2001 Act, the Commissioner entered into written agreements with the various GST claimants pursuant to section 89I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") to resolve the claims for readjustment of GST paid on facilitation fees and quantification of the Commissioner's liability to pay use of money interest.

On 11 December 2001, the Commissioner sent a letter to Contract Pacific which stated that the Commissioner's investigation into the inbound tour component of the taxpayer's GST affairs had been completed, resulting in the reassessment of periods ended 28 February 2001 and 30 April 2001 to allow a refund that reflected the overpaid GST for the period 30 June 1993 to 30 April 2001.

On 18 April 2005, a request was made to the Commissioner for payment of $6,281,767 plus interest, being the balance of the dishonoured refund cheque of $7,542.295 after the payment of the facilitation fee credit adjustment was deducted. The Commissioner rejected the claim.

### Decision

As it was contended that the credit adjustment agreements were a complete bar to Contract Pacific's legal claims, the Court decided to consider the third issue first. Duffy J concluded that contrary to the Commissioner's assertion, the credit adjustment agreements did not bar Contract Pacific from suing for the balance of the credit adjustments it claimed it was due.

Duffy J then went on to consider the remaining three issues.

#### Issue one

Duffy J held that whether or not in this case there was antecedent debt or liability that was capable of constituting valuable consideration under the BOEA turned on the interpretation of section 20(5) and section 46 of the GSTA.

Section 20(5) requires the Commissioner to refund any excess where the total amount that may be deducted for a taxpayer's output tax exceeds the aggregate amount of the output tax for that taxable period. Section 46 deals with the Commissioner's right to withhold payments. It mandates that if the Commissioner is required to refund an amount under section 20(5), he shall do so within 15 days of receipt of the return subject only to his powers under section 46(2) to withhold payment.

After referring to the decision in **CIR v Sea Hunter Fishing Limited** (2002) 20 NZTC 17,478, Duffy J concluded that section 46 is a code for the authority to withhold payment of disputed GST refunds. In her Honour's opinion, there is only one interpretation of section 46(2) that does not undermine Parliament's intent to impose strict limits on the Commissioner's authority to withhold a refund. This is that whenever the Commissioner is faced with a refund issue under section 46 that requires both an investigation and the collection of further information, the two limbs of the section must be used in conjunction. Therefore, in any investigation of a refund claim that engages section 46(2)(a), requests for information will engage section 46(2)(b) as well. Any such requests that do not comply with the time limits in section 46(4) will cause the Commissioner to lose his authority to withhold the refund while he carries out his investigation. While the Commissioner need not engage both limbs of section 46(2), where his actions do entail both an investigation and a request for information he must comply with the prescribed time limit.

In this dispute, the Commissioner had issued a notice under section 46(2)(a), notifying his intention to investigate the matter, and had done so within the 15-day time limit prescribed in section 46(5). However, the Commissioner also made requests for information pursuant to that investigation, but these were made outside the prescribed time limits in section 46(4). Accordingly, Duffy J concluded that he "lost his authority to withhold the disputed refund".

Further, Duffy J found that the effect of finding that the Commissioner lost his authority to withhold the payment when the refund was issued meant that he was under an antecedent liability to pay the refund to Contract Pacific. That liability was sufficient to provide valuable consideration for the purposes of section 27(1) (b) of the BOEA. Consequently, this entitled Contract Pacific to judgment for that amount. Her Honour also held that the passing of section 241 of the 2001 Act could not on itself cause a failure of that consideration.

#### Issue two

Contract Pacific had argued (in the alternative) that it was subject to the savings provisions in section 241(6) (a) or alternatively (c) of the BOEA.

In relation to the arguments under section 241(6) (a), Contract Pacific asserted that it had been "paid" a refund on or before 14 May 2001 and was therefore immune from the retrospective effect of the legislation. Duffy J concluded that under the common law, the issue of a cheque is a payment. Further, her Honour held that given it had already been concluded that the cheque issued on 5 February 2001 was valuable consideration, the position was "unaffected by section 241(6) and remains the same today as it was then".

In relation to the arguments put forward regarding section 241(6) (c) (ie that Contract Pacific was exempt given the Commissioner, on or before 14 May 2001, reduced the amount that would otherwise be tax payable in respect of the supply), Duffy J considered it unnecessary to determine whether Contract Pacific was entitled to a refund by virtue of that provision. This was because Contract Pacific had accepted that the success of both causes of action under section 241 depended on whether or not the Court found the refund cheque was a payment of the credit adjustment refund the company claimed (ie the first issue). In addition, Duffy J had some concerns regarding the Court's jurisdiction to grant the relief sought.

#### Issue three

The Commissioner sought to argue that even if Contract Pacific could succeed in the action on the cheque, the consequential liability to pay the proceeds could be negated by set-off and that given a notice of assessment was issued which the taxpayer failed to respond to, it was too late for Contract Pacific to dispute the assessment.

Duffy J rejected this action. Her Honour found that the letter of 11 December 2001 was **not sent as** a notice of assessment but did note that there is a difference between an assessment and a notice of assessment. However, Duffy J found it unnecessary to conclude whether or not the letter of 11 December 2001 was **in law** a notice of assessment.

This was partly because her Honour did not want to risk offending against the limits in the TAA on the power of the Court to make determinations outside Part 8A in relation to disputed assessments. In addition, Duffy J noted that the set-off had not been pleaded by the Commissioner and was brought late in the proceedings, denying Contract Pacific the opportunity to "shape its case".

Commissioner's right to withhold refunds confirmed by Supreme Court
===================================================================

2010 case note – Supreme Court confirmed that once notice has been given by CIR the 15-day working limit to pay refund no longer applies – GST, s 46.

Case

Contract Pacific Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Supreme Court confirmed that once notice has been given by the Commissioner under either section 26(4) or 46(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act), the 15-day working limit set out in section 46(1)(a) to pay the refund no longer applies and no refund is payable until the Commissioner is relevantly satisfied pursuant to section 46(1)(b) of the GST Act.

### Impact of decision

This decision has clarified the Commissioner's position with regard to section 46 and confirms that once notice is given under either subsections (4) or (5), no refund is payable until the Commissioner is relevantly satisfied pursuant to section 46(1)(b).

The decision has also confirmed that if the Commissioner makes a timely request for information under section 46(4) (as opposed to the notification of an investigation under section 46(5)) but later determines that a fuller investigation is required, the Commissioner is not required to pay the refund should any notification of such investigation occur outside the initial 15 working days.

In addition, the Court confirmed that if the Commissioner makes an initial information request within 15 working days, the refund is not payable should he make a subsequent request for further information outside the time limit set down in section 46(4)(b).

### Facts

At all relevant times, Contract Pacific Ltd (Contract Pacific) carried on the business of an inbound tour operator, selling New Zealand-based holiday packages to overseas wholesalers who then sold to overseas retailers. Those retailers in turn sold the packages to tourists set to visit New Zealand.

Between July 1993 and April 1999, Contract Pacific included GST in the sale prices for the services it sold to overseas wholesalers.

In May 1999, the law was changed to remove any ambiguity over liability to include GST in the sale prices for New Zealand-based services sold to overseas persons for the purpose of on-sale to New Zealand-bound visitors.

On 26 June 2000, Contract Pacific filed a GST return in which it sought a readjustment and refund of the GST it had paid between 1 July 1993 and 30 April 1999.

On 10 July 2000, the Commissioner advised that the GST refund had been withheld pending investigation of the readjustment claim.

During a meeting between the parties on 19 January 2001, the Commissioner requested the taxpayer provide further information about the refund claim. This was provided by letter dated 24 January 2001.

Through an administrative error, a notice of assessment and refund cheque for $7,542,295.51 were issued on 5 February 2001. On 9 February 2001, the Commissioner became aware of the error and took steps to stop payment on the refund cheque before it was presented.

On 24 October 2001, the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 (2001 Act), was passed with retrospective effect. The general effect of section 241 of the 2001 Act was to make clear there was and always had been liability to pay GST on services provided to overseas persons. A savings provision (section 241(6)) was enacted that exempted a small category of persons from this effect. Contract Pacific would come within this savings provision if the circumstances of receiving the refund cheque in error meant it had been "paid a refund".

After the enactment of the 2001 Act, the Commissioner entered into written agreements with various GST claimants, including Contract Pacific, pursuant to section 89I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to resolve the claims for readjustments for GST paid on facilitation fees and quantification of the Commissioner's liability to pay use-of-money interest.

On 11 December 2001, the Commissioner sent a letter to Contract Pacific which stated that the Commissioner's investigation into the inbound tour operator component of the taxpayer's GST affairs had been completed, resulting in the reassessment of the periods ended 28 February 2001 and 30 April 2001 to allow a refund that reflected the overpaid GST for the period 30 June 1993 to 30 April 2001.

On 18 April 2005, Contract Pacific wrote to the Commissioner requesting payment of $6,281,767 plus interest, being the balance of the stopped refund cheque of $7,542,295.51 after the payment of the facilitation fee credit adjustment was deducted. The Commissioner rejected the claim.

Contract Pacific later sued the Commissioner on the cheque issued in error on 5 February 2001, arguing that the Commissioner had breached section 46 of the GST Act and had paid the taxpayer a refund for the purposes of the savings provision of the 2001 Act.

### High Court judgment

The High Court ((2009) 24 NZTC 23,092) confirmed that the Commissioner had issued a notice under section 46(2)(a) of the GST Act, notifying his intention to investigate the matter, and had done so within the 15-day time limit prescribed in section 46(5). However, the High Court held that as the Commissioner had also made requests for information pursuant to that investigation, and these were made outside the prescribed time limits in section 46(4), he had "lost his authority to withhold the disputed refund".

The High Court also held that the cheque issued by the Commissioner was valuable consideration, and therefore the position was "unaffected by section 241(6) of the 2001 Act". However, Duffy J did conclude that in any event, under the common law, the cheque was a "payment" for the purposes of section 241(6)(a).

### Court of Appeal judgment

The Court of Appeal ((2010) 24 NZTC 24,006) allowed the Commissioner's appeal and set aside the High Court judgment. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Commissioner, when investigating Contract Pacific's GST return, had satisfied the time limits contained in section 46(5) of the GST Act and therefore there was no obligation to make a refund.

The Court also concluded that the Commissioner's investigation is not subject to any limitation, curtailment or restriction. Accordingly, if in the course of the investigation the Commissioner requires additional information, he can request it and such request will not engage section 46(2)(b).

The Court also confirmed there will be investigations that are complex and require a number of information requests, and there will be others only requiring additional information that has been overlooked. The Court held that "it is not sensible for these two different kinds of inquiries to be governed by the same approach. The more expansive must necessarily include the narrower process".

Contract Pacific appealed to the Supreme Court.

### Decision

The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.

#### _Issue one - section 46 of the GST Act_

The Supreme Court confirmed that while the purpose of section 46 is to require the Commissioner to act promptly in processing and paying refunds, the tax system would be subject to abuse if the Commissioner was required in all cases to pay first and investigate later.

The Court held that the provision seeks to balance these two policy considerations by providing the 15-day time limit to either pay the refund or give the taxpayer notice. The Court confirmed, referring to the decision of _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Sea Hunter Fishing Ltd_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,478, that if the Commissioner does not give notice under either subsections (4) or (5) within 15 working days he will be required to issue the refund regardless of whether he is relevantly satisfied that the refund is payable.

However, the Court held that once notice is given under either subsections (4) or (5), the 15-day working limit set out in section 46(1)(a) to pay the refund no longer applies and no refund is payable until the Commissioner is relevantly satisfied pursuant to section 46(1)(b).

The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that an investigation, as contemplated by subsections 46(1)(b) and 46(2), includes the request of information from the taxpayer (the registered person) and must sensibly encompass all or any of the wide powers available to the Commissioner under the TAA.

The Court also rejected Contract Pacific's argument that while the Commissioner was able to request information from third parties pursuant to his investigation at any time without breaching section 46, he was not able to request information after 15 working days from the taxpayer (being the registered person) without having to release the refund. The Court confirmed that this would place the Commissioner in the position of being unable to seek information from the most obvious and perhaps only source to complete the investigation; the registered person. The Court held that the two processes in section 46 are not entirely discrete in that "the greater includes the lesser; it does not exclude it".

The Court ultimately held that as the Commissioner had given notice pursuant to section 46(5) within 15 working days, the governing provision was section 46(1)(b). Consequently, the Commissioner was not required to pay the refund until he was relevantly satisfied pursuant to section 46(1)(b).

The Court also considered the position where the Commissioner's initial notice is a request for information followed by the commencement of an investigation and confirmed that in that situation the Commissioner should not be expected to have to pay the refund should he ultimately decide the return warrants investigation. The Court referred to Simon France J's decision in _Riccarton Construction Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2010) 24 NZTC 24,191 and confirmed that it was a "commonsense and practical approach to the section". Blanchard J noted that if it were otherwise, there would be little reason in providing for any other step in section 46(2) other than an investigation since the Commissioner would be a significant risk if he merely requested information and indeed "would be foolish to do so".

The Court recognised that the result of this interpretation is there are also no equivalent sanctions should the Commissioner not issue any subsequent requests for information under section 46(4)(b) within 15 working days of receiving the initial information. The Court stated that it assumed the Commissioner would still continue to employ that procedure in routine inquiries to ensure reasonable expedition.

Blanchard J also noted that the section was poorly drafted and requires remedial construction.

#### _Issue two - section 241(6) of the 2001 Act_

As the Court found in favour of the Commissioner in relation to section 46, the Court considered it unnecessary to address the second issue.

Commissioner's statutory demands upheld
=======================================

2013 case note – CIR's statutory demands upheld - substantial dispute, abuse of process, liquidation.

Case

Accent Management Limited and Lexington Resources Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The companies challenged the statutory demands issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") on the grounds that there was a substantial dispute whether or not the debts were owing or due and that the demands ought to have been set aside as an abuse of process. The Court upheld the statutory demand and ordered that the companies pay the amount demanded within 10 working days.

### Impact of decision

If Accent Management Limited ("Accent") and Lexington Resources Limited ("Lexington") fail to pay the amount demanded within 10 working days of the judgment the Commissioner may apply to liquidate both companies.

### Facts

Accent and Lexington were both issued with statutory demands on 18 April 2013 by the Commissioner. Accent and Lexington are both parties associated with the Trinity scheme and had their tax liability confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 ("Ben Nevis").

In the statutory demands, the Commissioner demanded payment of $3,250,265.74 from Accent for amounts owing under the 1998 tax year and $2,115,309.48 from Lexington for amounts owing under the 1997 tax year.

Both Accent and Lexington applied to set aside the statutory demands on the grounds that:

*   there was a substantial dispute whether or not the debts were owing or due relying on section 290(4)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 ("Companies Act"); and
*   the demands ought to have been set aside on other grounds, in that in the circumstances of the case, serving the statutory demands was an abuse of process (this ground relied on section 290(4)(c) of the Companies Act).

The applicants sought orders declaring that the document purporting to be a statutory demand was not a statutory demand or, in the alternative, setting aside the statutory demand.

### Decision

The Court ordered that Accent and Lexington pay the amount demanded within 10 working days of the judgment and, should a default in payment be made, the defendant may make an application to put Accent and Lexington into liquidation.

#### _Grounds for setting aside statutory demands_

Under section 290(4)(a) of the Companies Act, the High Court may set aside a statutory demand if there is substantial dispute whether or not the debt is owing or due. Faire AJ stated that for the Court to determine this, the applicant must show a fairly arguable basis upon which it is not liable for the amount claimed (as approved in _United Homes (1998) Ltd v Workman_ \[2001\] 3 NZLR 447 (CA), at 451–452).

The Court may also set aside a statutory demand if it is satisfied that the demand ought to be set aside on other grounds (Companies Act, section 290(4)(c)). To do this, the Court must determine whether the creditor's prima facie entitlement is outweighed by some factor or factors making it plainly unjust for liquidation to ensue (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chester Trustee Services Limited_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR (CA) 395, at \[3\]). A company may not allege solvency as a ground for setting aside a statutory demand. A company cannot avoid paying a debt, merely by proving that it is able to pay the debt (_AMC Construction Ltd v Frews Contracting Ltd_ \[2008\] NZCA 389, (2008) 19 PRNZ 13, at \[7\]).

#### _Commissioner's authority to issue statutory demands_

Faire AJ rejected the plaintiffs' submission that the Commissioner was not authorised to issue a statutory demand on behalf of the Crown. His honour found that the Commissioner is the creditor in respect of a taxpayer who has not paid his or her tax. In the matter of taxes, the Commissioner is the statutory agent of the Crown (_Cates v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1982\] 1 NZLR 530 (CA), (1982) 5 NZTC 61,237).

Further, the issuing of a statutory demand is one of the steps necessary to bring a suit against a company and within the Commissioner's authority (Tax Administration Act 1994, section 156).

#### _Substantial dispute_

Faire AJ found that there is no longer any substantial dispute in respect of the tax assessments because the assessments were upheld by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_. Further, an additional part of the debt related to a sealed cost order which cannot be disputed.

The plaintiffs asserted that an active appeal against a decision of Priestley J, dismissing their claim that the original High Court Ben Nevis decision was a "nullity" (_Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ \[2013\] NZHC 1447, (20113) 26 NZTC 21-020), meant there was still a substantial dispute in respect of the tax assessments. This argument was rejected by Faire AJ who found that Priestley J's decision stands until it is successfully appealed.

A question was raised on the issue of the quantum of the statutory demand. The Court was asked to determine whether or not a GST credit available to Accent could be off-set against Accent's income, in reliance on the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 46(6). In an affidavit for the Commissioner it was asserted that the credits could be transferred to the 1994 year, where there is a substantial debt for unpaid taxes owing. This was accepted by AJ Faire.
