Judicial review granted for delay
=================================

2008 case note - taxpayers granted application for judicial review due to total time taken in the prosecution and undue delay.

Case

Peter Allan Harris v the District Court at Auckland and CIR

Legislative References

Act Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayers were granted application for judicial review, holding that, considering the total time taken in the prosecution, there had been undue delay, and that in the circumstances, the District Court Judge should have exercised his inherent power to prevent an abuse of process and to direct a stay of the proceedings.

### Facts

On 8 November 2004, Notices under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) were sent requesting information in support of certain returns filed by Mr Harris personally and on behalf of three companies. This resulted in a box of documents being supplied by Mr Harris to the Department; however, much of the information requested was allegedly not supplied.

From 30 November 2004 to 9 February 2005, further correspondence was issued to Mr Harris and/or his companies giving notice of intention to prosecute unless the default was remedied, which led to four informations under section 143A(1)(b) of the TAA being sworn on 25 July 2005. Those informations were replaced by fresh informations on 25 November 2005, which also alleged offences under section 143A (1) (b) of the TAA.

After various procedural steps, on 12 February 2007, the informations were ruled to be nullities as not coming within section 150A TAA and not laid within time.

Shortly after, on 16 February 2007, fresh informations were sworn in terms of section 143 (1)(b) of the TAA. After various procedural steps, the accused applied to have the informations dismissed at the 3 April 2008 fixture. Judge Burns ruled against Mr Harris, which led to these judicial review proceedings.

### Decision

Application for review granted.  
Order of staying prosecutions granted.

Held  

1.  The informations were not out of time, as contrary to the applicant's arguments section150A of the TAA did apply.

The effect of section 150A (2) was to restrict the extension of time to offences against the TAA that relate to:

1.  a tax law that is a provision of the Income Tax Act 2004, or
2.  a tax law that is a provision of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, or
3.  an obligation that exists in relation to either of those Acts, ie either the Income Tax Act or the Goods and Services Tax Act.

The Crown submission that the obligation to provide information under section 17 of the TAA in this matter was for the purpose of administration of the Income Tax Act was accepted, which was supported by the obligation in section AA 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to satisfy the obligations imposed by the TAA.

2.  His Honour considered that it would be premature to comment on the submissions that the informations were a nullity in any event as the District Court had not yet ruled on the issue of whether apparent defects in the dates of the alleged offending in the informations ought to be amended pursuant to section 43 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957.
3.  His Honour reviewed the leading case in relation to the application of the right under section 25(b) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, _Martin v District Court at Tauranga_ (1995) 12 CRNZ 509 (CA), and considered that the total delay from the laying of the informations in Februrary 2007 to the hearing on 3 April 2008 was 14 months, which was not an extraordinarily long or excessive period, and could not be construed as undue. His Honour concluded that the Judge was right to find that the delay from the current prosecutions to 3 April 2008 was not such as to constitute a breach of Mr Harris' rights under section 25(b) of the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act.
4.  His Honour then considered the applicant's alternative submission on delay: that the overall delay in the prosecution was such that the District Court Judge should have exercised his inherent power to prevent an abuse of process. After considering the factors to take into account when considering whether to dismiss for an abuse of process as recently summarised by Randerson J in _W v R_ (1998) 16 CRNZ 33, his Honour considered that in the particular circumstances of this case, including the principal reason for the delay being the issuing of informations under section 143A(1)(b) of the TAA out of time (to which section 150A of the TAA did _not_ apply), and the seriousness of the offending alleged, that the delay overall was so long and unjustified that it would be an abuse of process to put Mr Harris on trial for these informations now.
5.  His Honour declined to disturb the Judge's discretion to deal with the issue of disclosure by adjourning the matter to allow disclosure issues to be remedied, particularly as the District Court Judge had the advantage of seeing the witness give evidence on that matter and had accepted the explanation that the disclosure issue was as a consequence of an inadvertent, accidental omission and that it was not done deliberately.

Judicial review - not an extremely rare case
============================================

2012 case note – Court found that claim not within 'rare case' category - judicial review, challenge procedures, genuine assessments, interviews.

Case

Ali & Fa'agutu v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The plaintiffs alleged the Commissioner's assessments were not genuine assessments and sought judicial review.

The High Court confirmed that the Supreme Court decision in _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158 has made it clear that section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") is a complete bar to judicial review proceedings seeking to overturn the Commissioner's assessments unless the claim can come within the category of rare cases where it is not practically possible for a taxpayer to attack an assessment under the disputes and challenge procedures. The Supreme Court had observed that this would be extremely rare.

### Facts

The Commissioner made default assessments against each of the plaintiffs in June 2007 on the basis the plaintiffs were engaged in a joint-venture business buying and selling properties.

The plaintiffs issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in September 2007. The Commissioner rejected the NOPA, noting tax returns had not been filed. However, the Commissioner advised the plaintiffs that the assessments would be considered under section 113 of the TAA. The Commissioner ultimately amended some of the assessments for Ms Fa'agutu but confirmed that the remaining assessments would not be amended. The plaintiffs did not take any formal steps to dispute or challenge the assessments.

Over the following two years, the Commissioner and the plaintiffs had various meetings, discussions and correspondence regarding the debt. Ultimately, no amount was paid by the plaintiffs.

On 9 March 2010, the Commissioner filed Notices of Claim in the District Court seeking judgment for the debts. Judgment was obtained in October 2010.

Following a number of further discussions and correspondence, a settlement offer was made by the plaintiffs in February 2011. This offer was declined as the Commissioner had been made aware by the plaintiffs that they held substantial equity in their residential property. The Commissioner made a counter offer which was left open for 20 days. This was rejected by the plaintiffs. The Commissioner proceeded to seal the District Court judgments in August and September 2011. Bankruptcy notices were then filed in the High Court in respect of the plaintiffs in October 2011.

On 11 November 2011, the plaintiffs filed judicial review proceedings seeking the High Court remit the matter back to the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") for assessment and review.

### The pleadings

The statements of claim filed by the plaintiffs alleged that the Commissioner, in filing proceedings in the District Court, had denied the plaintiffs their right to fully exhaust all the options and procedures provided under Parts 8 and 8A of the TAA. Further, it was alleged that at the time the District Court proceedings were issued, the plaintiffs believed negotiations with the Commissioner regarding the debt were still proceeding.

However, in submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs advanced the plaintiffs' case on the basis the Commissioner's assessments were not genuine assessments.

At issue was whether the Commissioner's assessments were genuine assessments.

### Decision

Toogood J referred to section 109 of the TAA and confirmed that the Supreme Court decision in _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158 has made it clear that section 109 is a complete bar to judicial review proceedings seeking to overturn the Commissioner's assessments unless the claim could come within the category of rare cases where it is not practically possible for a taxpayer to attack an assessment under the disputes and challenge procedures. It was observed by the Supreme Court that this would be extremely rare.

The plaintiffs in this case submitted that these proceedings were not an attack on the merits of the assessments, but rather on the legitimacy of the process and the integrity of the Commissioner's decision-making. With regard to the arguments in relation to legitimacy, the plaintiffs raised a number of points:

*   Given the weight and seriousness of an investigation, the plaintiffs were entitled to basic rights afforded by natural justice, including being adequately represented.
*   The plaintiffs are humble laypersons and the transactions were not the sort of sophisticated commercial arrangements which gave rise to some of the relevant leading cases. It was also asserted that Mr Ali is in poor health.
*   The plaintiffs were only interviewed once before the initial default assessments were made.
*   The Commissioner should have disclosed the information he had already obtained during his investigation prior to the interviews and should not have asked the plaintiffs open-ended questions when he already knew the answer.

Toogood J confirmed that there is no statutory or other authority suggesting the Commissioner was obliged to disclose information in initial interviews. His Honour also referred to the initial audit letter (which set out the nature of the audit and invited voluntary disclosure), the advice given at the outset of the interview that this was voluntary, that the plaintiffs were entitled to have an adviser present, and that they could refuse to answer and further that any information could later be used in evidence.

As to representation, Toogood J confirmed that in fact the plaintiffs were accompanied by their tax agent at their interviews. His Honour also stated that the assessments were made on the basis of the information obtained during the interviews, information subsequently supplied by the plaintiffs and information from third parties.

His Honour also confirmed that the Commissioner was not obliged to make full disclosure of all information he holds until he provides a statement of position pursuant to section 89M of the TAA.

Toogood J concluded from the undisputed facts that the Commissioner had been more than patient with the plaintiffs and that they had been given every opportunity to avail themselves of the disputes and challenge procedures in the TAA.

As to the argument the assessments were no more than arbitrary conjecture or demonstrably unfair, the plaintiffs claimed that the Commissioner had predetermined the income based on information obtained prior to the interview with Mr Ali and thereafter had a closed mind. Toogood J rejected this argument, confirming the Commissioner went to considerable lengths to provide the plaintiffs with opportunities to satisfy him as to the nature and extent of the property dealings. Further, the Commissioner considered the plaintiffs' health and financial circumstances pursuant to the hardship provisions and was tolerant over approximately four years of investigation and discussion. In addition, the Commissioner had considered assertions made by the plaintiffs for the purposes of section 113 of the TAA, despite their failure to file returns, and was prepared to amend assessments for Ms Fa'agutu. The Court considered that this demonstrated the Commissioner's careful consideration of the evidence submitted.

Ultimately, his Honour concluded that, this was not a claim within the category of "extremely rare" cases envisaged by the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce_ and accordingly section 109 was a complete bar to these proceedings.

Judicial review of decision not to recalculate
==============================================

2014 case note - judicial review of decision not to recalculate following a tax challenge - collections, s 6/6A powers, Trinity scheme.

Case

Peebles & Bradbury & Anors v Attorney-General & Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

This was a judicial review by Trinity investors asserting that following a tax challenge, the subsequent collection/recovery of tax is a new phase and there is a duty on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") to recalculate the amount owing. The High Court rejected that there was any such duty and noted the Commissioner is entitled to collect the amount fixed in the challenge proceedings.

### Impact of decision

The taxpayer is obliged to pay on completion of the challenge procedure and if the taxpayer does not pay, the Commissioner is obliged to collect unless it is impracticable to do so. The High Court did not consider there is any intervening duty to reconsider the amount of the taxpayer's liability if proceedings to collect are required.

### Facts

Mr Peebles and Mr Bradbury ("the plaintiffs") were investors in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme and were unsuccessful in their tax challenges against the Commissioner in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court judgment, _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289_,_ was issued in December 2008 and since then the plaintiffs have not paid the amount they were assessed or any additional amount that has accrued over that time.

In December 2013, the Commissioner issued recovery proceedings ("the proceedings") to obtain summary judgment against the plaintiffs for sums she disputes are owed.

The plaintiffs, in turn, sought judicial review against the Commissioner for refusing to discontinue the recovery proceedings against them.

The judicial review was premised on the argument that, notwithstanding the Supreme Court's determination of their tax challenge, the Commissioner should have recalculated the tax due under a different provision of the Income Tax Act 1994. The plaintiffs argued that the Commissioner has a duty not to seek to recover more tax than is properly payable and that the Commissioner failed to have regard to that duty, therefore she made an error of law when she decided to commence/continue with the proceedings.

The Commissioner opposed the plaintiffs' application on the following grounds:

1.  the decision to commence or continue proceedings to recover tax is not amenable to review;
2.  she is not subject to any duty to the plaintiffs in the nature alleged; and
3.  if a ground of review was established, the Court ought to decline relief on the basis that the plaintiffs' application is another attempt to avoid or delay meeting their obligations.

### Decision

#### _Is a decision to commence and/or continue with recovery proceedings amenable to judicial review?_

Peters J considered the Commissioner's submissions on this issue, namely that the Court should not generally review a decision as to the conduct of litigation made by the Commissioner in discharging her duties in the care and management of taxes.

While there were several authorities in support of the Commissioner's submissions, her Honour made reference to _Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 (HC), where Randerson J stated Courts would be slow to intervene with such decisions but left open the possibility that the Court may intervene in such a decision if the Court is satisfied that the Commissioner had made a material error of law.

Accordingly, Peters J felt it was necessary to consider whether or not the Commissioner has a duty not to seek to collect more tax than is properly payable, even if there are assessments for greater amounts.

#### _Does the Commissioner have a duty not to seek to collect more tax than is properly payable, even if there are assessments for greater amounts?_

The plaintiffs argued that the collections phase is a new phase within which the Commissioner is required to review the position. Further, the Commissioner has a duty for collection purposes to recalculate the amount payable to ensure that she is not seeking to recover more than is actually payable prior to initiating recovery action.

The Commissioner argued that she is not subject to a duty to recalculate the amount of tax she is seeking to collect, and that the amount she was seeking was the correct amount, as confirmed by the Supreme Court judgment.

Peters J agreed that the Commissioner is not subject to a duty to recalculate the amount of tax before deciding to commence and/or continue with recovery proceedings if that taxpayer defaults in their obligation to pay and proceedings to collect are required.

Her Honour further noted that the Commissioner is entitled to seek the sum due from a taxpayer, which is fixed on the outcome of the challenge procedure. If the taxpayer does not pay the amount owed, then the Commissioner is obliged to collect unless it is impracticable to do so.

Given the High Court's findings on this issue, it was not necessary for her Honour to consider the other grounds argued. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' application for judicial review was dismissed.

Judicial review of decision to remove tax agent from list of approved tax agents
================================================================================

2014 case note – High Court dismissed application for judicial review of decision to remove tax agent status.

Case

Accountants First Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court dismissed the application for judicial review. The Court found the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") fully complied with her obligations under s 34B(9) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") to give the tax agent reasons for any proposed decision to remove the tax agent from the list of approved tax agents.

### Impact of decision

A decision-maker does not need to conduct a consultation as required by s 34B(9)(b) of the TAA, provided:

1.  the tax agent is fully and fairly aware of the basis on which the decision-maker is considering removing him or her from the list of tax agents; and
2.  the decision maker fully and fairly takes into account any submissions made by the tax agent before deciding whether or not to remove the tax agent from the list of approved tax agents.

### Facts

Accountants First Ltd ("Accountants First") was incorporated on 3 October 2005. Its sole director is Mr Kamal. He, his wife and the Imran Kamal Trustee Company Ltd are the shareholders of Accountants First. Soon after it was incorporated, Accountants First was granted approved tax agent status by the Commissioner under s 34B(4) and (5) of the TAA.

In February 2001, the Commissioner commenced an investigation into the tax affairs of Accountants First and Mr Kamal. The investigation revealed that between March and July 2006, Accountants First claimed input tax credits in respect of fictitious tax invoices for three goods and services tax periods, resulting in Accountants First evading tax amounting to $55,735.50.

On 18 December 2012, Mr Kamal pleaded guilty to six charges of tax evasion under the TAA. On 15 February 2013, Mr Kamal was sentenced to three months' home detention and 150 hours of community work. On the same day, Accountants First was convicted and discharged in relation to charges laid under the same provisions of the TAA.

Mr Kamal sought name suppression in the District Court because of concerns about Mrs Kamal's health. While his original application was dismissed, Mr Kamal successfully appealed that decision to the High Court. However, the High Court later revoked name suppression because Mr Kamal's evidence "proved to be very questionable".

Following the conclusion of the prosecution against Accountants First and Mr Kamal, officers of the Commissioner commenced a process to determine if Accountants First's tax agent status should be revoked. This process involved two decisions.

#### _First decision_

In May 2013, the Commissioner sent the shareholders of Accountants First letters advising that their company's tax agent status was being reviewed. The letters explained this was because of Mr Kamal's convictions and the duty of the Commissioner to protect the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner sought a response within 30 days.

In June, the Commissioner received a submission from Accountants First's barrister at the time, Mr Coleman, explaining why the company's tax status should not be revoked (June submission).

After a meeting between officers of the Commissioner, Mr Kamal and Mr Coleman in August 2013, the Department sent letters to Accountants First's shareholders advising that a decision had been made to remove the company from the list of approved tax agents.

In October 2013, Accountants First filed judicial review proceedings and an application for interim relief. The application claimed that in making her decision, the Commissioner was unreasonable and/or failed to take into account relevant considerations and/or took into account irrelevant considerations.

#### _Second decision_

In December 2013, an officer of the Commissioner realised that the officer who had made the decision to revoke Accountants First's tax agency status did not have delegated authority from the Commissioner to make that decision.

In a letter to Accountants First's new barrister, Mr Weaver, Crown Law outlined the situation and explained that the decision made in September was not valid. It was also explained that a new decision-maker, with appropriate delegation, would consider whether Accountants First should be removed from the list of approved tax agents because of Mr Kamal's criminal convictions.

The matter was then given to a senior officer of the Commissioner who had the appropriate delegated authority. In an affidavit to the court, the senior officer swore that she carefully considered all matters on the file, including the June submission from Accountants First and the minutes of the meeting in August 2013.

In February 2014, the senior officer made the decision to remove Accountants First from the list of approved tax agents. In March 2014, the Department sent a letter to the shareholders of Accountants First notifying them of the decision and the reasons for the decision. Accountants First filed an application for judicial review on 20 March 2014 pleading two breaches of s 34B(9) of the TAA.

### Decision

#### _Reasons for proposing to remove tax agent status_

The Court identified the Commissioner's clear and unequivocal duty imposed by s 34B(9) of the TAA to give a tax agent reasons for any proposed decision to remove the tax agent from the list of approved tax agents.

Collins J was satisfied that the Commissioner complied with her obligations under s 34B(9) of the TAA when she explained in May 2013 the reasons why she was considering removing Accountants First from the list of approved tax agents and when Accountants First was given the opportunity to make submissions, which it did in June and August 2013.

Mr Weaver argued that the Commissioner was obliged to again state her reasons for proposing to remove Accountants First when the second decision to consider removal was made.

His Honour stated that even if there was a further obligation on the Commissioner, this was complied with when Crown Law sent its letter restating those reasons in December 2013.

#### _Consultation_

The Court explained that s 34B(9) of the TAA also places a clear and unequivocal duty upon the Commissioner to consider arguments against the proposed decision that were advanced by the tax agent. Collins J considered whether the Commissioner had a duty to again consult with Accountants First when Ms Young made the second decision to remove it as an approved tax agent.

After considering relevant decisions, Collins J concluded that a duty to consult further only arises if the information relied upon by the decision-maker has materially changed.

His Honour found that the senior officer's decision to remove Accountants First from the list of approved taxpayers was based on the same key factors that Accountants First addressed in its original June submissions. The other matters that were referred to by the senior officer when reaching her decision were ancillary matters of no consequence. Furthermore, the Court pointed out that the fact the first decision-maker lacked authorisation did not invalidate the steps taken under s34B(9) of the TAA before the first decision was made.

The Court concluded that this reflects the realities of how administrative decisions have to be made in large organisations such as Inland Revenue. Everyday issues are consulted upon at one level and then escalated up the organisation to senior officers who are delegated with the responsibility to make decisions in the name of the Commissioner.

The court found that the Commissioner fully complied with her obligations under s 34B(9) of the TAA and therefore dismissed the application for judicial review.

Judicial review proceedings for assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act is not a bypass mechanism for dispute and challenge procedures
=========================================================================================================================================================

2013 case note – Court finds that judicial review proceedings for assessment is not a bypass mechanism for dispute and challenge procedures.

Case

Arai Korp Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

Arai Korp Ltd sought to judicially review the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") decision not to invoke section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") in respect of the applicant's income tax assessments for the 2004 and 2005 income years. The original assessments, which were default assessments, were made by the Commissioner in 2006 and were not disputed nor challenged by Arai Korp Ltd ("Arai Korp") at that time. Arai Korp's application for judicial review was only filed in August 2011 against a background of liquidation proceedings brought by the Commissioner against Arai Korp. The Commissioner had already successfully prosecuted Arai Korp for failing to file income tax returns. The Court found that the Commissioner had not considered the merits of Arai Korp's application for reassessment but that was not fatal as the Commissioner's decision was not unreasonable based on the facts and because Arai Korp had been attempting to circumvent the disputes and challenge procedures.

### Impact of Decision

This decision applied the Supreme Court's decision in _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 "_that disputable decisions (which include assessments) may not be challenged by way of judicial review unless the taxpayer cannot practically invoke the relevant statutory procedure. Cases of that kind are likely to be extremely rare"._

This case confirms that taxpayers who attempt to circumnavigate the statutory disputes and challenge procedures by issuing judicial review proceedings will be unlikely, in most cases, to be successful with their application for review.

### Facts

Default assessments were issued by the Commissioner to Arai Korp Limited for the 2004 and 2005 income tax years on 17 November 2006. These default assessments have never been disputed by Arai Korp through the disputes procedure in the TAA.

The default assessments concerned the proceeds of the sale of a subdivision property situated at 618 Maungatautari Road, Karapiro Cambridge ("the property").

The property was originally owned by Mr Murray Athol Osmond (who is the director of Arai Korp and the director of the sole shareholder, Aniwaniwa Trustee Limited).

On 27 March 1997, the property, save for Units J, K, L and F, were sold to Ran Kor Resources Limited. On or about 30 September 1999, this agreement was allegedly assigned by Ran Kor Resources Limited to Arai Korp.

On 30 September 1999, Arai Korp alleged that Mr Osmond agreed to sell units J, K and L to Arai Korp.

On 28 April 2000, Arai Korp allegedly borrowed funds from the National Bank to purchase Lot 1 and Lot 2 and complete the subdivision.

By 17 October 2003, the subdivision was completed and new titles were issued for Units A to L in the subdivision.

In the 2004 and 2005 income years, Arai Korp made various sales of these units. Notwithstanding this, no income tax returns were filed for Arai Korp. The Commissioner successfully prosecuted Arai Korp for failure to file its returns. The income tax returns for the 2004 and 2005 income years were due on 7 July 2004 and 7 July 2005 respectively.

On 13 November 2006, as a result of an investigation, the Commissioner default assessed Arai Korp for the 2004 and 2005 income years. These assessments were based on Arai Korp's Goods and Services Tax returns.

The Commissioner brought collection proceedings and, after being granted summary judgment, she brought liquidation proceedings. After the commencement of the liquidation proceedings, the applicant sent a letter dated 22 May 2011 to Inland Revenue seeking agreement to fresh tax returns being completed by Arai Korp or for consent to an appeal to the Taxation Review Authority out of time.

The Commissioner treated the letter of 22 May 2011 as being, in effect, a request under section 113 of the TAA to make an amended assessment and, having considered the request, declined it.

Arai Korp issued judicial review proceedings asserting that the Commissioner's decision not to invoke section 113 of the TAA breached the rules of natural justice, that it contained mistakes of fact, that the Commissioner failed to take into account relevant considerations, that she took into account irrelevant considerations and that it was manifestly unreasonable.

### Decision

The sole question for the Court was whether the Commissioner's refusal to exercise the discretion vested in her by section 113 of the TAA was manifestly unreasonable.

Section 113 is clear in its terms, conferring a wide-ranging discretion on the Commissioner that can be exercised on her own motion or at the request of a taxpayer. The discretion is available in order to ensure that an assessment is correct. In exercising the discretion, the Commissioner must use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system, which includes protecting the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly and according to law. There is no duty to reassess and so, whilst the Commissioner can reassess, there is no obligation to do so.

In essence here, the reasons why the Commissioner, by her delegated officer, declined the request by Arai Korp were that:

*   1.  there had been a full investigation and the Commissioner was confident that the default assessments were correct;
    2.  Arai Korp was trying to reopen the dispute process and accommodating its request would be treating it more favourably than other taxpayers;
    3.  additional resources would have to be devoted to verifying the income and deductions belatedly sought by Arai Korp;
    4.  the request was not in regard to consequential or genuine errors;
    5.  the facts of case did not meet the criteria detailed in the Commissioner's Standard Practice Statement 07/03.

The Court considered each of the reasons relied on by the Commissioner for her decision.

**_Correctness of Default Assessment_**

That there are strict statutory criteria for an extension of time in relation to the disputes or challenge procedures does not affect the broad discretion available under section 113 of the TAA. When faced with an application to exercise the discretion, the Commissioner has to consider whether the assessment is correct. If a convoluted argument is raised to show the assessment is incorrect, then it is to be expected that the Commissioner will be considerably more circumspect and will take into account whether or not the dispute or challenge procedures have been followed by the taxpayer.

Here, the Court found the Commissioner should have given consideration to the merits of Arai Korp's arguments and whether they were capable of affecting the correctness of the default assessments. If the Commissioner had concluded that the matters raised by Arai Korp could not affect the default assessments, that would have been the end of the matter. If she had concluded that Arai Korp might have a bona fide argument, then she should have either determined whether the default assessments were correct or, alternatively, considered whether there were other relevant factors which precluded the exercise of the discretion in any event.

However, although the correctness of the default assessments was a relevant factor, it was not a paramount consideration on the facts of this case and the Court was not persuaded that a failure to address the correctness of the assessment was fatal to the decision to not exercise the discretion in section 113 of the TAA.

### _Dispute process_

There are strict timelines within which the dispute process is required to be initiated. These can only be extended in defined circumstances. Here there was no application for an extension of time by Arai Korp and it had not taken any steps required by section 89K of the TAA.

The Court agreed that section 113 of the TAA is not intended to be used by taxpayers, or indeed the Commissioner, as a way of circumventing the statutory disputes procedure. This is put beyond doubt by section 109 of the TAA. Parliament has put in place detailed provisions detailing how tax disputes are to be resolved, there are strict timelines and there must be finality. The provisions are designed to prevent "administrative chaos".

Arguments as to the substance of assessment can only be raised in challenge proceedings and cannot be raised by way of judicial review. The legitimacy of the process and the validity of the outcome may be challenged in judicial review proceedings on established administrative law grounds. This case is not one of the "extremely rare" cases mentioned by the Supreme Court in _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 where an assessment may be challenged by judicial review. Except in extremely rare circumstances, judicial review cannot be used as a backdoor method for considering the merits of the assessments. Here, Arai Corp was challenging the correctness of the assessments and was doing no more than trying to bypass the dispute process. To allow Arai Korp to do so would be to undermine the statutory scheme and treat it more favourably than other taxpayers.

The Commissioner was entitled to take these matters into account and cannot be criticised for doing so.

### _Available Resources_

The Commissioner took into account that the earlier investigation would have to be reopened and resources applied to investigate the request. The Court held this was a relevant factor to take into account in the exercise of the discretion in section 113 of the TAA and the Commissioner had not erred by doing so.

### _Consequential/Genuine Errors_

The Court was not persuaded that section 113 of the TAA distinguishes consequential or genuine errors. However, here, this factor was not crucial to the decision to not invoke section 113 of the TAA.

### _Standard Practice Statement_

The Court found it was not inappropriate for the Commissioner to refer to the Standard Practice Statement. She did not "slavishly follow its dictates" but, rather, applied her mind to the facts and exercised the discretion by reference to those facts.

The Court concluded that the Commissioner's decision to decline Arai Korp's request under section 113 of the TAA was not manifestly unreasonable, the section was not meant to be used to bypass the dispute procedure and this was what Arai Corp was attempting to do. The Court dismissed the application for review.

Judicial Review: The Commissioner's powers under sections 16 and 16b of the Tax Administration Act 1994
=======================================================================================================

2010 case note - access operation carried out by CIR to obtain information - Section 16, blanket privilege claim, 'book or document', double tax agreement.

Case

Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd & Ors v The District Court at North Shore & the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The access operation carried out by the Commissioner pursuant to section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) was used to obtain information which was necessary or relevant for the investigation of activities affecting New Zealand tax liabilities.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that:

1.  the Commissioner's interpretation of the extent of his section 16 and 16B powers is correct
2.  a preliminary screening on site will not necessarily be a prerequisite to a reasonable access operation (particularly where the Commissioner has obtained sufficient information under an earlier investigation to consider it necessary to copy information)
3.  in the event the Commissioner faces a blanket claim of privilege, removal of the hard drives for inspection once the privilege claim is resolved is an appropriate action
4.  a hard drive is a "book or document" for the purposes of section 16
5.  the Commissioner is not under any obligation to undertake an access operation which not only complies with section 16 but also with the equivalent Australian provision, case law and practice guidelines.

### Facts

On 8 November 2006, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("Commissioner") and the Australian Tax Office ("ATO") conducted simultaneous access operations on both sides of the Tasman. The operations followed a request by the ATO to the Commissioner in 2004 under Article 26 of the Australia-New Zealand Double Tax Agreement ("DTA"). The ATO provided background information which indicated that a number of entities based in or operating in New Zealand were promoting, marketing and implementing a wide range of tax avoidance schemes.

Using his powers under section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), the Commissioner entered seven premises, both private and commercial, and removed hard copy documents and hard drives for copying. The taxpayers filed a judicial review on a number of grounds culminating in a High Court judgment in favour of the Commissioner on 22 December 2008.

A stay application (pending appeal) filed by the taxpayers was also dismissed on 1 May 2009. In addition, the taxpayers filed a further application to recall directions made by the High Court on 8 October 2009 (in relation to the process for reviewing the information obtained during the access operations). Venning J, in his judgment dated 21 December 2009, set out the refined procedure for the Commissioner to follow in reviewing the information.

The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court judgment of 22 December 2008 on the judicial review.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal found in favour of the Commissioner.

Before considering the issues, the Court briefly considered the powers in sections 16 and 16B generally, and did note that the existence of section 16C of the TAA (which was not in force at the time of the access operations in this case) means that the issues in this appeal may now be of limited significance for future access operations carried out by the Commissioner.

#### Ground One - preliminary keyword searches

The search and inspection powers under section 16(1) are subject to section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and, like all public officials, the Commissioner must exercise the power in a manner that conforms to the reasonableness requirement of section 21. The Court noted that while a preliminary screening (as envisaged by the Australian Full Federal Court in _J M A Accounting_) was undoubtedly good practice, it was not a necessary prerequisite to a reasonable access operation under section 16.

This issue was then considered separately in relation to the Auckland and Motueka sites.

##### The Auckland site

The taxpayer had argued that despite the blanket privilege claim made at the Auckland site, the Commissioner should still have continued to undertake a preliminary screening to determine the relevance of any information rather than remove the hard drives. The Court, however, concluded that the Commissioner had acted reasonably in relation to the Auckland site.

The Court again stated that a preliminary screening was not necessary. It noted further that in this case it may be that the prior investigation carried out by the Commissioner provided him with a sufficient basis for considering inspection necessary. However, as neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal had heard argument on that aspect, the Court decided not to make a finding on that basis.

The Court referred to the taxpayer's assertion that section 16B provides that the only documents that could be removed were those considered necessary or relevant under section 16 and concluded that it was not apparent that section 16B needed to be read down this way. In any event, the Court concluded that once the privilege claim was made, it was open to the Commissioner to determine that it was necessary to remove the hard drives to inspect later once the privilege claim was resolved.

The Court also dismissed the argument raised by the taxpayer that the Commissioner was unable to remove the hard drives and give them to the District Court pursuant to section 20(5) (rather that the District Court had to request the information). The Court held that the power of the District Court to require the production of information relating to a privilege claim does not restrict the ability of the Commissioner to lodge the information voluntarily with the Court. Further, the Commissioner's actions were a pragmatic and sensible approach to ensuring the privilege claims were respected without prejudicing the access operation.

##### The Motueka site

The taxpayer had argued that the Commissioner did not intend to carry out preliminary screening at the site. In addition, the Commissioner's argument that the hard drives were cloned because encryption software was detected was incorrect as there was no evidence that the encryption was operative. Further, the Commissioner should first have asked the proprietor to remove the encryption before determining the relevance of the information on the hard drives.

The Court determined that it was the intention of the Commissioner to undertake preliminary screening unless encryption rendered that operation futile. Further, given the history of the investigation, it was reasonable for the Commissioner to conclude that hard drives containing encryption software would provide relevant information. In addition, the Court held that the Commissioner did not have to seek the assistance of the proprietor to remove the encryption given the Commissioner was sceptical about the outcome of any request.

#### Ground Two - operation solely for the ATO

The Court concluded that while it was acknowledged that the ATO had initiated an exchange of information, the access operation was carried out some two years after that initial exchange, pursuant to a New Zealand tax investigation and was for the purposes, at least partly, of investigating conduct affecting the New Zealand tax base and collection of tax in New Zealand.

##### Sections 81 and 88 of the TAA

The taxpayer had argued that the Commissioner has no obligation to supply information to the ATO, pursuant to Article 26 of the DTA, unless the information could have been obtained by the Federal Commissioner of Taxation in Australia utilising the same operation undertaken in NZ. The Court rejected this and held that it was clear that Article 26 simply provides that the Commissioner is not obliged to pass on information that would not be accessible under Australian law or practice. The Court went further to suggest that it would be an absurd result if the Commissioner was required to carry out access operations which not only complied with section 16 but with the Australian equivalent provision, case law and practice guidelines.

In any event, the Court concluded that the information obtained from the access operation would be obtainable under the Australian equivalent provision and therefore the Commissioner was obliged to supply it to the ATO.

The Court also agreed with the Commissioner that the fact that Article 26 provided only that there was no obligation on the Commissioner to provide information does not prevent the Commissioner from voluntarily doing so. However, the Court did note that, prima facie, section 88 requires secrecy be maintained unless the Commissioner is required to provide the information. However, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to conclude on this point given their earlier conclusion.

#### Ground Three - are hard drives "books or documents"?

The Court held that a "record" (for the purposes of the definition of "books or documents") includes both information as recorded and also the medium upon which the recording is made. Accordingly, a hard drive is a "record" and can therefore be cloned. The taxpayer had also asserted that a hard drive should be excluded due to the vast quantity of material it can hold but this distinction was rejected by the Court.

#### Ground Four - consent

Notwithstanding the fact that the Court had already concluded that the removal of the hard drives was permitted, the Court concluded that in any event Ms Chisnall (the Avowal representative present at the Auckland site) had consented to their removal.

#### Ground Five - advising on law reform

The Court accepted that there was no evidential basis for this finding by the High Court (in that it was not advanced by the Commissioner nor present in the warrant applications) but noted that this had no impact on the outcome of the present appeal.

#### Ground Six - contempt of NSW court

The Court firstly concluded that there was no evidence that the timing of the access operation coinciding with the criminal proceedings in Australia was "contrived" rather than merely coincidental. Further, the Court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the ATO requested information from the Commissioner who consequently acted in contempt. This was because the ATO gave an undertaking that no information derived from the section 16 access operations in New Zealand would be communicated to anyone associated with certain related criminal prosecutions. The Court noted that in this regard no information derived from the access operation was in fact exchanged by the time the criminal proceedings took place. The Court also rejected the taxpayer's assertion that the removal of a laptop hard drive belonging to Mr Petroulias from the Motueka site also resulted in a contempt in that it contained information relevant to the defence of the criminal proceedings.

### Conclusion

The access operation carried out pursuant to section 16 was used to obtain information which was necessary or relevant for the investigation of activities affecting New Zealand tax liabilities.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Expenditure Control JULY 2017 UPDATE - STAGE 2 OF TRANSFORMING NEW ZEALAND’S REVENUE SYSTEM Proposal 1. This paper provides an update regarding preparations for implementing Stage 2 of New Zealand’s revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the progress being made, as outlined in the attached Transformation Update dated July 2017. Executive Summary 2. Significant progress has been made in modernising the revenue system with the migration of GST to new systems and processes. While customers with simple and straight- forward GST transactions are working well with new systems and processes for GST, there are some negative impacts for customers with more complex circumstances. Tax agents in particular are experiencing some challenges from having to work in two systems (FIRST and START). 1 To address these issues some targeted improvements are underway, such as a dedicated GST phone queue for tax agents. 3. Three months on from go-live, work is beginning to stabilise. Inland Revenue has experienced some service impacts as both customers and staff get used to working with the new system and these will be reflected in the department’s annual performance results. While the department is making every effort to minimise the impact on customers, the introduction of new services and the need to work in two systems until transformation is complete means there is likely to be some impact as people get used to new services. Inland Revenue is actively involving agents and customers in design and training as a way of mitigating the impacts. 4. GST is a relatively simple tax. Complexity for both customers and Inland Revenue increases significantly from here as both Stages 2 and 3 are substantially more complex than Stage 1. There are also dependencies between these stages, meaning that they will overlap and run concurrently for a period during 2018/19. Inland Revenue is currently tracking slightly behind schedule with solution design and build for Stage 2 and is working to get back on plan. Proactive release This document was released by Inland Revenue under section 81(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by progressively increasing the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 1 5. Once Stage 2 has been fully implemented, the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced. There will be fewer errors, less chance of getting into debt, less need for compliance checks, and greater certainty. The benefits of using eServices or software will become more apparent. 6. Making individuals’ income tax obligations simpler and more certain are proposed during Stage 2. Most individuals will pay what they need to and get what they’re entitled to during the year without having to do anything. Earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. Digital accounts will be pre- populated and individuals will only need to confirm that the information in their account is correct. Inland Revenue will calculate any tax owed or refund due. 7. Implementation will be through a series of releases over 2018 and 2019. All inco me tax products, the first release of Stage 3 - Working for Families, and gaming machine duty will be migrated to new systems and processes. Working for Families will be migrated to START at the same time as income tax begins to be processed in START on 1 April 2019. This will minimise the impacts of co-existence on both customers and Inland Revenue, and ensure that customers continue to receive timely payments. Income and provisional tax information will be collected in START from 1 April 2018 to enable pre-population to begin. 8. The Accounting Income Method (AIM) option for calculating provisional tax and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners will be implemented from 1 April 2018. AIM will enable smaller businesses to better match their tax payments to their cash flow. 9. Improvements to how pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and investment income information are collected and used mean Inland Revenue will more quickly receive income information from people’s employers and information about any interest they have earned on investments. Wit h more up-to-date information, Inland Revenue will be better able to ensure people pay and receive the right amounts. 10. These changes will affect a wider group of stakeholders over a longer period of time compared to implementing GST. Work with groups such as software developers and a group of progressive small business accountants is underway to ensure that changes are successfully designed and implemented to meet the needs of customers. Active engagement with key stakeholders and industry groups continues and will step up over the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. 11. Inland Revenue is now operating two core systems and operational risk has increased due to co-existence. Migrating products and services to START as quickly as possible will limit the period of time that the core systems need to co-exist, is the best way to manage risk, and minimises disruption for customers. 12. The tax policy work programme, the implementation of Stage 2, and Budget 2017 changes combined mean that Inland Revenue has limited capacity to implement additional changes. 2 Business transformation is a once-in-a- generation opportunity to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system 13. A modern, digital, revenue system will serve the needs of all New Zealanders. It will help customers to get their tax and social policy payments right first time, avoid errors and give them a clearer view of what they’ve paid and what they owe during the year. The revenue system will be simple to comply with and responsive to customers’ changing circumstances. It will be easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. They will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements, as tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. 14. More complete information will be available to Inland Revenue earlier, which will lead to greater accuracy and mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Government will be able to make policy changes more quickly and cost effectively and there will be more opportunities to provide broader access to the information Inland Revenue holds. 15. Modernising the revenue system will significantly contribute to improving digital interactions with government, the Business Growth Agenda and a growing, healthy economy, along with achieving Better Public Services Results 7, 9 and 10. GST has been migrated to new systems and processes and customer behaviour is changing 16. It’s now easier for customers with simple and straight-forward transactions to file and pay their GST on time. Better digital services have given customers more control. They can choose from more filing and paying options, can set up reminders for due dates and change their previous returns, all without needing to contact Inland Revenue. 17. Shifts in customer behaviour are already evident and customer uptake of new services is strong. At the end of May 2017, more than 625,000 returns had been filed using the new web service and an additional 66,000 returns were filed through customers’ accounting software. This service has only been available to Xero and MYOB customers since April 2016 and is being extended to a wider group of software providers as part of Stage 2. More than 9,400 new migrants, visa holders and organisations had used the new digital registration service via the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to register for an IRD number. 18. For the year to date to May 2017, 77% of customers filed their GST returns electronically, compared with 72% for the year to date to May 2016 and 63% for the year to date to May 2015. 19. However there have been some negative impacts for customers with more co mplex circumstances. So me customers, particularly tax agents, experienced challenges with initial set-up tasks, navigating the new system and working in a digital environment for the first time. 3 20. The department is now operating two core systems and operational risk has increased due to co-existence. The co-existence of business functions and technical capabilities is amongst the most complex challenges to be managed for both customers and Inland Revenue. 21. An on-going challenge for tax agents is the need to work in two systems during the period of co-existence. Inland Revenue has worked with agents and their representative groups to identify the top five issues with the new GST system. These are notifications, client maintenance, bank account maintenance, reports and printouts, and transaction management. Inland Revenue is currently exploring which of these can be fixed before Stage 2. Tax agent focus groups will be set up by July 2017 to discuss both Stage 1 and Stage 2 functionality. 22. In addition to migrating GST to START, Inland Revenue replaced some elements of its foundational technology as part of Stage 1. This included new data centres and the workflow management system for contact centres. 23. Three months on from go-live, work is beginning to stabilise. Inland Revenue has experienced some service impacts as both customers and staff get used to working with the new systems and to managing work across two systems. To address these issues, work is underway to deliver targeted improvements. For example, a new phone queue for tax agents to deal with any GST-related matters they have in a more timely way. 24. Inland Revenue remains on track to realise the benefits committed from the implementation of Stage 1. 25. New Zealand businesses are continuing to secure a considerable amount of transformation work. Over the period from July 2014 to May 2017, 74% of contractor and consultant spend went to New Zealand resident businesses. Both Inland Revenue’s delivery partners, FAST and Accenture, have recruited New Zealand staff. FAST have employed 11 New Zealanders out of 55 total employees in New Zealand and more are likely to be employed. Accenture have employed in excess of 40. The lessons learnt from implementing GST are being applied to future stages 26. Considerable effort is going into applying the lessons learned from Stage 1 implementation, including valuable insights on customer readiness, to Stage 2 design and delivery planning. The insights gained are shaping Inland Revenue’s approach in three key areas in particular – co-existence, customer user experience, and stakeholder engagement. 27. While Inland Revenue is dealing with the co-existence challenges of working in two systems, it has become apparent that it is more difficult for customers to do so. The release plan for Stage 2 recognises the need to minimise the impacts of co-existence and the volume of change being introduced for customers as well as Inland Revenue. 28. Customer user experience will increasingly focus on end-to-end services. Dedicated roles have been established to focus on customer experiences, including digital. Opportunities will be provided for tax agents and businesses to validate new eServices and provide their 4 feedback before go-live to help ensure that new services meet their and their customers’ needs. 29. Although transformation is about creating a modern, digital, revenue system, the focus is not solely on designing digital services. Customer contact today is very heavily reliant on the voice channel and Inland Revenue consistently receives feedback that customers like the experiences they have with the contact centres. Through transformation, Inland Revenue will ensure that contact centres continue to be able to support customers as well as investing in digital channels. 30. Inland Revenue will engage with stakeholders more and engage earlier. An account management function has been established with dedicated resources and a clear mandate to ensure all stakeholders understand and are ready to adopt the changes being introduced in Stage 2. Through their Account Manager, stakeholders will have a single view of all changes they need to be aware of including migration of products and services to START, AEOI and changes to the collection of information. 31. Inland Revenue is working with groups such as software developers, and a group of progressive small business accountants to ensure that these changes are successfully designed and implemented and meet the needs of customers. Active engagement with key stakeholders and industry groups continues and will step up over the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. Transformation is moving to a model of a series of releases within stages 32. Stage 2 will be implemented in a series of releases over 2018 and 2019 as this reduces risk and business and customer impacts. There are also dependencies between Stages 2 and 3, meaning they will run concurrently for a period during 2018/19. 33. The AIM option for calculating provisional tax and AEOI will be implemented fro m 1 April 2018. All income tax products, the first release of Stage 3 – Working for Families, and gaming machine duty will be progressively migrated to new systems and processes. 34. By April 2019 customers will have: • More on-line services for all tax products; • Integrated tax and business processes; • Faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax; • Faster tax refunds; and • Less likelihood of tax debt and more payment options. 35. Improvements to how PAYE and investment income information are collected and the implementation of AEOI will be made progressively: • From 1 April 2018 AIM will be introduced, employers will be able to voluntarily file PAYE information on a payday basis, and financial institutions will be able to vo luntarily report non-residents information for AEOI. 5 • From 30 June 2018 financial institutions will be required to report non-residents information for AEOI. • From 1 April 2019 employers will be required to file PAYE information on a payday basis, the electronic filing threshold will be reduced, and payers of investment income will be able to voluntarily fil e detailed information about recipients each month or the months in which payments are made. • From 1 April 2020 payers of investment income will be required to fil e detailed information about recipients each month or the months in which payments are made. • From 1 April 2021 the first full year of pre-populated PAYE and investment income information will be available. 36. Working for Families will be migrated to START at the same time as income tax begins to be processed in START on 1 April 2019. This will maintain customer experiences and minimise the impacts of co-existence for both customers and Inland Revenue. 37. Inco me and provisio nal tax informat ion for the 2018/19 year will be collected in START from 1 April 2018. This will include the AIM option for calculating provisional tax and PAYE information from employers voluntarily filing on payday. From 1 April 2018, Inland Revenue will begin pre-populating income information. FIRST will process income tax returns for the 2017/18 tax year and process all prior period returns until 31 March 2019. Any challenges with historical income tax and related data will be resolved in FIRST before being migrated to START on 1 April 2019. 38. Migrating income tax and Working for Families together avoids splitting the administration of Working for Families across two systems. It removes the need to build a complex set of connections between FIRST and START, and prevents the slower processing times that would result from data moving between the two systems. Migrating income tax and Working for Families together maintains the timeliness of payments and customer experiences. 39. Student Loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver payments are based on the incomes of individuals, rather than a combined family income so the same issues do not arise. Student Loan, Child Support and KiwiSaver will be migrated to START as part of Stage 3 as planned. This does not affect the timing of the Government’s programme of legislative social policy reforms. 40. Inland Revenue is currently tracking slightly behind schedule with solution design and build for Stage 2 and is working to get back on plan. The department is confident this can be achieved without disrupting future implementation dates. Customers’ tax affairs will be further simplified during 2018 and 2019 41. AIM will enable smaller businesses to calculate provisio nal tax to pay based on more real-time information so that payments better reflect cash flows. Tax payments will be smaller and more frequent. AIM will make filing and paying tax easier so customers can 6 focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration. Software will help with correctly classifying transactions to ensure tax is right from the start, which will reduce errors and provide customers with greater confidence that they’ve done the right thing. 42. Changes to the collection and use of PAYE and investment income information mean that Inland Revenue will more quickly receive income information from people’s employers and information about any interest they have earned on investments. With more up to date information, Inland Revenue will be able to react more quickly when people’s circumstances change to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. 43. These changes, once fully implemented, will significantly reduce the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations. There will be fewer errors and interactions with Inland Revenue, less chance of getting into debt, and less need for compliance checks. Businesses will have greater certainty that they’ve done the right thing. 44. Making individuals’ income tax obligations simpler and more certain are proposed during Stage 2. Consultation on a discussion document proposing that most individuals would not have to provide information to Inland Revenue closes shortly. The main proposal is that people who only receive income which is reported to Inland Revenue would no longer have to provide year-end income information or file returns. Inland Revenue would automatically calculate and issue refunds or request payment of tax owed, above agreed thresholds. A summary of the submissions received will be provided to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to consider in September 2017. 45. The benefits to customers using eServices or software to meet their obligations will become more apparent during Stage 2. These changes cover a wide range of stakeholders over an extended period 46. Business customers, emplo yers, tax agents, and payroll intermediaries will need to adapt their systems and processes to ensure they continue to meet their obligations and/or their customers’ needs. The key changes are: • AIM will be an option for businesses for calculating their provisional tax through internet connected accounting software. • Emplo yers will file payroll details on a pay period basis and more of them will file electronically. • START will make it simpler and faster for customers to manage all their tax obligations with greater certainty. 47. The implementation of AEOI and improvements to the collection and use of investment income information will mean additional changes for financial institutions and payers of investment income. Financial institutions will experience changes in a number of different areas reflecting their various roles in the revenue system. 7 48. Additional resourcing and support will be required for some areas in Inland Revenue to meet customer demand during the period of change and co-existence. Inland Revenue is expecting and planning for increased customer contacts in specific areas over the period that new requirements and changes to systems and processes are progressively introduced. A greater proportion of Inland Revenue people will adopt new systems and processes 49. Once Stage 2 is implemented, START will be the new tool for all front-line staff to look up employer and income tax information. A significant number, approximately 4,000 staff, are already familiar with START and using it for some of their day-to-day work. For most, it will mean using START for a much larger proportion of their work. 50. Similarly to Stage 1, training will consist of pre-learning, classroom and post go-live training. Refinements to reflect the larger and more complex scope of Stage 2 include more time for informal and on-the-job learning, more tailored practice prior to go-live and smaller groups for classroom-based training. 51. Inland Revenue’s organisational design will change in early 2018. Those designing customer services will be as close to the customer as possible and people working with customers will be empowered to make more decisions and resolve customers’ issues more quickly. Three new groups will be established by January 2018 and the majority of front line staff will transfer across to new roles in them. This timing ensures the department will be well-positioned for the implementation of Stage 2 beginning from 1 April 2018. 52. Inland Revenue will continue to have a presence in the communities it is represented in today, and will continue to look for opportunities to co-locate with other government agencies. Budget 2017 changes have some limited impacts on transformation and these are being managed 53. Changes in tax thresholds, Working for Families rates and the removal of the Independent Earner Tax Credit were announced in Budget 2017. These changes apply from 1 April 2018 and will impact on some Stage 2 and 3 products. 54. Inland Revenue has carefully considered how best to manage implementation of the Budget 2017 changes. The changes will be implemented in Inland Revenue’s constrained heritage environments through the department’s annual income tax cycle for businesses and individuals. There will be close co-ordination between the work required to implement the Budget changes and transformation, including ensuring customer communications are consistent and aligned. Transformation is the key vehicle for delivering Inland Revenue’s contribution to Better Public Services and wider government outcomes. 55. Initiatives being considered as part of Stage 2 that will enable improved outcomes for customers include: 8 • A more automated solution, integrated with START, to support the approved information sharing agreement (AISA) between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). • Inland Revenue will recognise all business customers by t heir New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) once MBIE has extended it to non-incorporated entities. This requires Inland Revenue to enhance the NZBN capabilities delivered as part of Stage 1. • Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) are exploring enabling digital registration and maintenance of customer information for individuals, including birth data. 56. Inland Revenue continues to work with other government agencies to share information that will unlock the value of data held by the public sector and simplify customers’ interactions with government. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (CAB-16-MIN-0654) enable Inland Revenue to extend information sharing with the NZ Police in cases of serious crime to include non-individuals and deceased persons. Cabinet approved (CAB-17-MIN-0208) an AISA between Inland Revenue and MSD in May 2017 which consolidates and expands information sharing with MSD. Modernisation of the revenue system is now well underway and remains inherently high risk 57. Inland Revenue has made significant progress with the implementation of Stage 1. However GST is a relatively simple tax. Complexity for both customers and Inland Revenue increases significantly from here. Both Stages 2 and 3 are substantially more complex than Stage 1. The requirements for co-existence, integration, testing, stakeholder engagement and change management are exponentially greater and more intensive compared to Stage 1. 58. As noted in paragraph 20, the department is now operating two core systems and operational risk has increased due to co-existence. The co-existence of business functions and technical capabilities is amongst the most complex challenges to be managed for both customers and Inland Revenue. Migrating products and services to START as quickly as possible will limit the period of time that the core systems need to co-exist, is the best way to manage risk, and will minimise any confusion or disruption for customers. 59. Stage 2 is very complex. It includes the migration of mult iple products to new systems and processes, and legislative changes. These changes affect a wider group of stakeholders over a longer period of time compared to implementing GST. 60. There are some emerging risks that Ministers should be aware of for Stage 2: • The complexity of Stage 2 and the progressive implementation of changes mean that releases require careful sequencing to ensure that customers, tax agents and software developers can absorb and adapt to new systems, processes, services and legislation. Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver these changes and support them following go-live will also be a key consideration in finalising the release plan. 9 • Some stakeholders with critical roles in the revenue system, such as software developers and large employers, may not be able to meet desired implementation timeframes. On-going engagement between Inland Revenue and stakeholders will bring any issues to light in a timely way. Any issues or trade-offs that may need to be made will be highlighted for Ministers to consider. • The ability of customers to absorb change may be tested. For some, changes to their systems, processes, services and reporting requirements will span three years – 1 April in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. As some changes are being introduced on a voluntary basis first, this will be made clear to customers in engagements with them and co mmunicat ions material. • Customers may perceive that their compliance costs have increased as a result of being required to report PAYE and investment income information more frequently. Emphasising the longer-term vision for the future revenue system – right first time, greater integration with business processes, less need to interact with Inland Revenue – will go some way towards addressing any perceptions of greater effort. • Inland Revenue’s customer facing staff are facing a period of significant change. In the early months of 2018 they will be moving into new roles in a new organisation design, and may be responding to increased customer contacts as releases in Stage 2 are implemented. 61. A summary of the most significant risks for transformation as at June 2017 is included in appendix 2 of the attached Transformation Update. 62. The implementation of Stage 2 combined with the tax policy work programme and Budget 2017 changes means that Inland Revenue has limited capacity to implement additional changes. The abilit y of stakeholders to absorb additional changes also needs to be considered. Aligning with changes in priorities is possible, although there may be some consequential implications for costs, benefits and risks. Any material changes or trade-offs would be highlighted for Ministers to consider. 63. Progress and risks are constantly re-assessed and regularly reported. Inland Revenue has been directed (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) to provide transformation progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year. The next transformation update will be provided to Cabinet by December 2017. An on-going monitoring programme is in place to provide assurance to stakeholders 64. Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews. Two external assurance reviews were completed towards the end of 2016. 65. A Gateway 4 (readiness for service) review in November 2016 found that “...Stage 1 go-live appears feasible. Management issues, if addressed promptly, should enable successful delivery . . . and would maintain a strong position in readiness for Stage 2.” 10 66. In December 2016 KPMG completed a fifth IQA and fourth TQA. The team noted that “... planning for Stage 2 deployment has been initiated in parallel with Stage 1. This is encouraging, as is the feedback that this planning is leveraging the lessons-learned from Stage 1.” 67. External reviews currently underway or recently completed include an IQA/TQA review undertaken by KPMG and a Gateway review. The results of these most recent reviews will be reported in the next progress update. Next steps 68. The next steps are to: • continue to work with stakeholders on the design and implementation of the AIM option for paying provisional tax; • support the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; • progress any technical legislative changes needed to support the implementation of Stage 2; • prepare final proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act for Cabinet to consider in November 2017; • prepare a technical issues paper on PAYE adjustments and error correction for Cabinet to consider during August 2017; • provide a summary of submissions on the Individuals discussion document for the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to consider by September 2017; • progress Cabinet consideration of the release of the social policy discussion document; and • prepare a transformation update for Cabinet to consider by December 2017. Financial implications 69. The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human rights implications 70. The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative implications 71. The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory impact analysis 72. The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. 11 Publicity 73. I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Consultation 74. A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Co mpensat ion Corporation, DIA, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, MBIE, the Ministry of Education, MSD, the New Zealand Customs Service and Statistics New Zealand. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Information Officer) 75. Corporate Centre agencies were consulted on this update. 76. Since the March update, Inland Revenue has made progress with preparations for Stage 2, incorporating lessons learned from Stage 1. As Inland Revenue notes, Stage 2 solution design and build is tracking slightly behind schedule. They are confident this will not impact on release dates. The most recent Independent Quality Assurance review focused on Programme readiness to exit the Stage 2 Design Phase. We understand the report and recommendations will be reported to Joint Ministers late July. The next Gateway review will build on findings from this report. 77. Inland Revenue are on track to deliver the benefits expected from Stage 1. Organisational design will change early 2018 and further in 2019. The new organisational structure is intended to enable realisation of the benefits committed to in the 2015 Business Transformation business case. Following consultation with internal and external stakeholders, the release of income tax has been moved from 2018 to 2019, to align with Working for Families. We will continue to monitor Inland Revenue’s progress towards future implementation dates and realisation of benefits. This includes monitoring risks that arise fro m coexistence between the old and new systems. 78. Inland Revenue continues to engage with the wider system, sharing lessons learned from Stage 1 and preparing for impacts from the implementation of Stage 2. The corporate centre will work with Inland Revenue to bring system impacts of Stage 2 to Ministers’ attention. 12 Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1. Note that Stage 2 is significantly more complex than the implementation of GST; 2. Note that Inland Revenue is moving to a model of a series of releases within stages to implement transformation; 3. Note that Stage 2 will be implemented in a series of releases over 2018 and 2019; 4. Note that the changes being introduced in Stage 2 affect a wide range of customers over an extended period; 5. Note that the next transformation update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by December 2017. Hon Judith Collins Minister of Revenue / /2017 13 Annex – Transformation Roadmap 14

It’s now easier for customers to file and pay their GST on time. Inland Revenue migrated GST to new systems and processes on 7 February 2017, ahead of schedule. Better digital services have given customers more control. They can choose from more filing and paying options, can set up reminders for due dates and change their previous returns, all without needing to contact Inland Revenue. Shifts in behaviour are already evident. More than 625,000 returns had been filed through the new web service as at 31 May 2017, and an additional 66,000 returns were filed through customers’ accounting software. Customers with simple and straight-forward GST transactions now have a much improved service experience. However there have been some negative impacts for customers with more complex circumstances. Tax agents in particular have experienced some challenges as a result of having to work in two systems. Work is underway to deliver targeted improvements and valuable insights have been provided on issues such as customer readiness that are informing preparations for Stage 2. Three months on from go-live, work is beginning to stabilise. Inland Revenue has experienced some service impacts as both customers and staff get used to working with the new system and to managing work across two systems. These impacts will be reflected in the department’s annual performance results. Inland Revenue remains on track to realise the benefits committed from the implementation of Stage 1. Stage 2 will further simplify customers’ tax affairs. Once Stage 2 has been implemented the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced. There will be fewer errors and interactions with Inland Revenue, less chance of getting into debt, and less need for compliance checks. Businesses will have greater certainty that they’ve done the right thing. Making individuals’ income tax obligations simpler and more certain are proposed during Stage 2. A discussion document proposing that most individuals would not have to provide information to Inland Revenue has recently been released for consultation. The proposals mean that most individuals will pay what they need to and get what they’re entitled to during the year without having to do anything. Earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. Digital accounts will be pre-populated and individuals will only need to confirm that the information in their account is correct. Inland Revenue will calculate any tax owed or refund due. By April 2019 customers will have: More online services for all tax products; Integrated tax and business processes; Faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax; Faster tax refunds; and Less likelihood of tax debt and more payment options. Inland Revenue intends to improve customer experiences throughout Stage 2 through frequent releases of solutions and enhancements that make compliance easier, simpler and more efficient for both customers and Inland Revenue. The costs and benefits of Stage 2 are consistent with the estimates made in the 2015 business case, and within the funding approved by Cabinet. The benefits to customers using eServices or software to meet their obligations will become more apparent during Stage 2. New Zealand businesses have secured 74% of transformation work from 1 July 2014 to 31 May 2017. Changes will be progressively introduced. Changes to how PAYE and investment income are collected and used will be introduced progressively. Customers will be able to voluntarily meet the new reporting requirements from 1 April 2018 for PAYE and 1 April 2019 for investment income, before these requirements become mandatory a year later. In confidence Page 4 Once fully implemented, Inland Revenue will receive income information from employers and payers of investment income more quickly. This will mean Inland Revenue can react more quickly when people’s circumstances change to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. Stage 2 will be implemented in a series of releases beginning from 1 April 2018. Together these changes will simplify customers’ tax affairs. All income tax products, the first release of Stage 3 – Working for Families, and gaming machine duty will be migrated to new systems and processes. Working for Families will be migrated to START at the same time as income tax begins to be processed in START on 1 April 2019. This will minimise the impacts of co-existence on both customers and Inland Revenue, and ensure that customers continue to receive timely payments. Income and provisional tax information will be collected in START from 1 April 2018 to enable pre- population to begin. The Accounting Income Method (AIM) option for calculating provisional tax, the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) and legislative changes will be implemented from 1 April 2018. AIM will enable smaller businesses to calculate provisional tax to pay based on more real-time information so that payments better reflect cash flows. Tax payments will be smaller and more frequent. AIM will make filing and paying tax easier, reduce errors and provide greater confidence to customers that they’ve done the right thing. Student Loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver will migrate to START in Stage 3 as planned. Stage 2 is more complex and affects a wider range of customers over a more extended period. A preliminary assessment of the effect of these changes on customers has been completed and will be updated in advance of each release. The implications for customers vary, and business customers, tax agents and service providers are the most critical groups for adapting their systems and processes so they can continue to meet their obligations and/or their customers’ needs. Additional resourcing and support will be required in some areas to support customers during the transition period and Inland Revenue will prioritise meeting customer demand. Recognising the complexity and breadth of Stage 2, Inland Revenue has made a considerable investment in early stakeholder engagement using an account management approach. Active engagement with customers and industry groups is on-going, and will step up over the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. To complement the implementation of Stage 2, Inland Revenue is putting a new organisation design in place. Inland Revenue intends to be an agile, intelligence-led organisation built around the needs of its customers. Those designing customer services will be as close to the customer as possible and people working with customers will be empowered to make more decisions and resolve customers’ issues more quickly. As a first step towards new ways of working, three new organisation groups will be established in January 2018. Staff were consulted on the proposal during May 2017 and final decisions will be communicated in mid-July 2017. Further organisational change will occur in 2019. Transformation will improve New Zealanders’ interaction with the revenue system and wider government. Transformation is a key vehicle for delivering Better Public Services and wider government outcomes. Inland Revenue is currently tracking slightly behind schedule with solution design and build for Stage 2 and is working to get back on plan. The department is confident this will be achieved without disrupting future implementation dates. Introduction In confidence Page 5 This update outlines the progress being made by Inland Revenue in preparing for the implementation of Stage 2 of transformation. It has been reviewed by the corporate centre. Business transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. A modern, digital, revenue system will serve the needs of all New Zealanders. It will help customers to get their tax and social policy payments right first time, avoid errors and give them a clearer view of what they’ve paid and what they owe during the year. The revenue system will be simple to comply with and responsive to customers’ changing circumstances. Customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements, as tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. Government will be able to make policy changes more quickly and cost effectively and there will be more opportunities to provide broader access to the information Inland Revenue holds. Customers’ interactions with government and Inland Revenue will fundamentally change. In the future, most customers will not need to interact with Inland Revenue as their information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. Those with less complex needs will only need to confirm their details using automated, straight-through digital services. Customers who do have to provide information will use their own systems and processes to do so as part of their everyday business activities. Information will be checked when it is received and errors fixed wherever possible. Earlier, more complete information will be available to Inland Revenue which will lead to greater accuracy and mean fewer under or over payments for customers. Inland Revenue recognises that paper will need to continue to be an option for some customers. Although digital channels will be designed with customers in mind - easy to use, intuitive and interactive - and their use strongly encouraged, some customers will be unable or unwilling to use them. For example, customers without access to internet services or computers, and those who would incur disproportionate compliance costs, e.g. the smallest employers. This need has been recognised in the legislative changes being made to streamline the collection of PAYE information from employers. Through transformation Inland Revenue will make a significant contribution to wider government outcomes. Modernising the revenue system will significantly contribute to improving digital interactions with government, the Business Growth Agenda and a growing, healthy economy, and achieving Better Public Services Results 9 and 10. GST has been migrated to new systems and processes In confidence Page 6 Inland Revenue migrated GST on 7 February 2017, ahead of schedule. New systems and processes were available for GST customers to use from 7 February 2017, nearly three months ahead of schedule. This represents a very significant and public step forward in the journey to bring New Zealand's revenue system into the modern world. Customers can now: file and pay their GST at the same time; make GST payments by direct debit, or credit or debit card; set up email and text message reminders of when GST returns and payments are due to avoid penalties; set up GST instalment payment plans and, in most cases, receive immediate confirmation and approval; and request a change to an already filed GST return. In addition to migrating GST to START, Inland Revenue replaced some elements of its foundational technology as part of Stage 1. This included new data centres and the workflow management system for contact centres. These are the first of many changes Inland Revenue will make over the next few years to make tax and social policy payments simpler for New Zealanders. Customers with simple and straight-forward GST transactions are working well with new systems and processes. Customer awareness of the GST changes being introduced was 79%, with awareness amongst myIR users at 90%. Amongst those who knew about the changes, 75% felt confident about using the new services. Tax agent awareness was 79%. 1 As at 31 May 2017: there had been more than 1.4 million logins to myGST; more than 625,000 returns had been filed using the new web service and an additional 66,000 returns were filed through customers’ accounting software; more than 100,000 direct debits had been made, meaning customers were able to file and pay their GST at the same time; more than 8,500 instalment arrangements had been set up online to pay off debt; and more than 9,400 new migrants, visa holders and organisations had registered for IRD numbers through the new digital registration service. Customers can identify themselves to Inland Revenue through their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN). Approximately 780,000 of Inland Revenue’s customer records have NZBNs. As part of Stage 1, Inland Revenue enabled customers to call free (0800) from their mobile phones. This not only provided an improved experience for customers who required support to adapt to the changes to GST, 1 Colmar Brunton Customer Readiness research February 2017 and BT Readiness and Communications Effectiveness Research March 2017 Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) are working together on the future roadmap for RealMe. However there have been some negative impacts for customers with more complex circumstances. Some customers, including tax agents, experienced challenges with initial set-up tasks, navigating the new system and working in a digital environment for the first time. An on-going challenge for agents is working in two systems. An active programme of communications and site visits including 1:1 sessions where needed has been put in place to resolve issues. Three months on from go-live, work is beginning to stabilise. Inland Revenue has experienced some service impacts as both customers and staff get used to working with the new system and to managing work across two systems, These impacts will be reflected in the department’s annual performance results. Phone calls are taking approximately 30% longer on average than planned. Some activities, such as manual instalment arrangements, write-offs and submissions, are taking longer to complete. To address these performance issues, targeted improvements have been introduced. For example, a new phone queue for tax agents to deal with any GST-related matters they have in a more timely way. Inland Revenue has worked with agents and their representative groups to identify the top five issues with the new GST system. They are notifications, client Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA In confidence Page 8 Customer experience Active engagement with key stakeholders and industry groups is continuing and will step up over the latter half of 2017 and into early 2018. Please refer to page 17 for more details. Customer user experience will increasingly focus on end- to-end services. Dedicated roles have been established to focus on customer experiences, including digital. A wider representative group of customers, including businesses, individuals and tax agents, will be provided with the opportunity to try new services before go-live. Software developers will be able to work with end-to- end services before release to ensure they meet the needs of their customers. Although transformation is about creating a modern, digital, revenue system, the focus is not solely on designing digital services. Customer contact today is very heavily reliant on the voice channel and Inland Revenue consistently receives feedback that customers like the experiences they have with the contact centres. Through transformation, Inland Revenue will ensure that contact centres continue to be able to support customers as well as investing in digital channels. Notwithstanding, Inland Revenue is looking to increase customers’ use of digital channels, in particular myIR. Changing policy and legislative settings In confidence Page 9 Work on policy and legislative settings continues on a broad range of fronts. The law changes needed to streamline the collection of PAYE are before parliament. Information about individual employees’ income and associated deductions will be required more regularly from their employers from the 2019/20 tax year. Receiving this information more regularly will help Inland Revenue to ensure that the right amounts are deducted from individuals to meet their obligations and to more accurately determine their social policy entitlements. Employers and payroll intermediaries will be required to file PAYE information on a payday basis from 1 April 2019. This will include information about new and departing staff, and employees’ dates of birth and contact details. They will be able to voluntarily file PAYE information on a payday basis from 1 April 2018 if they choose to. The dates PAYE and related deductions have to be paid to Inland Revenue won’t change. However employers will be able to make these payments on payday if they want to. Employers using payroll software will be able to file their information directly from their payroll system. The smallest employers will still be able to file on paper. The threshold above which electronic filing of PAYE information is required will reduce from $100,000 a year of PAYE and Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) deductions to $50,000 a year. Improvements to the collection and use of investment income information are also before parliament. Information about the investment income earned by individuals will be required more regularly from payers. Changes will be introduced progressively over the next three tax years. They will help Inland Revenue to ensure that the right amounts are withheld from individuals to meet their obligations. From 1 April 2018 portfolio investment entities (PIEs) will be required to obtain the IRD number of new investors or alternatively a self-certification that they are non- resident and do not have an IRD number. The due date for filing detailed interest and income information (excluding “locked in” schemes) will be 15 May 2019 for the 2018/19 tax year. From 1 April 2019 investment income payers will be able to submit investment income information on a monthly basis if they choose to. From 1 April 2020 investment income payers (other than PIEs) will be required to provide detailed recipient information on a monthly basis, or the month in which payments are made if that is less often than monthly. This will include date of birth information (if held) and joint ownership information. Ministers are considering submissions to the Tax Administration Act discussion document. Submitters were generally in support of the proposals. The next step is for the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to consider policy recommendations. Making individuals’ income tax obligations simpler and more certain are proposed to be implemented during Stage 2. A discussion document in the Making tax simpler series was released in June 2017. The proposals in the discussion document mean that most individuals would not have to provide information to Inland Revenue. The main proposal is that people who only receive income which is reported to Inland Revenue and has tax withheld by third parties (like salary and wages or interest and dividends) would no longer have to provide year-end income information or file returns. Inland Revenue would automatically calculate and issue refunds or request payment of tax owed. It would also be easier for people to correct the information Inland Revenue holds about them, or for them to provide additional information. Other proposals would make the administration of income tax simpler and more efficient. These include helping people to use the most appropriate tax code during the year, and allowing people to provide details during the year about donations they have made and to claim any credits through their tax returns. More proactive actions by Inland Revenue during the year would ensure the right amount of tax is paid and minimise the number of people with tax to pay or due a refund at the end of the year. In confidence Page 10 Improvements to the administration and delivery of Working for Families, Child Support and Student Loans are also proposed. A discussion document in the Making tax simpler series is awaiting Cabinet consideration. Any resulting reforms will be implemented as part of Stage 3. Other changes underway mean that Inland Revenue will more quickly receive income information from people’s employers and information about any interest they have earned on investments. With more up-to-date information, Inland Revenue will be able to react more quickly when people’s incomes change to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. The Working for Families and Child Support proposals are intended to improve the certainty, accuracy and timeliness of payments, minimise and manage debt, align and update key definitions, and cater for people with exceptional circumstances. The main proposal for Working for Families is that Inland Revenue would use information about actual income, instead of an estimate, to determine payments. Self- employed or business people would be able to provide information during the year about their recent income. The main proposal for Child Support is to use more up- to-date information about salary and wages to calculate payments. The Government is also proposing that, in future, Child Support assessments will include all the income of both parents, whether earned in a parent’s own name or through a company or trust. Child Support is proposed to be deducted from people’s pay, whether they are a contractor or an employee. There are two main proposals which affect Student Loans: extending the requirement for employers to deduct repayments to include people who do contract and casual agricultural work; and self-employed people or those with income that doesn’t have repayments deducted from it would have to make regular payments during the year. These proposals would help borrowers to stay on top of their loans by making regular payments throughout the year, rather than a big payment at the end of the year. A second phase of business tax is being scoped for discussion with Ministers. Since the business tax package was announced as part of Budget 2016, consultation with the private sector has been on-going to identify the next most important tax reforms for business. Following direction from the Ministers of Finance and Revenue, proposals that could further simplify the tax system, make getting tax right easier, and make it harder for businesses to get into debt and easier to get out are being further explored. :   On-going consultation will further test the proposals. Inland Revenue will adopt a flexible approach to fit around other transformation consultation and will engage with a wider group of businesses, including representatives of small businesses. This recognises the amount of consultation already planned for 2017 for both transformation and the government’s tax policy work programme. Final proposals agreed with Ministers will need to be balanced against the remaining stages of transformation and Inland Revenue’s other commitments.

Once Stage 2 has been implemented the effort required by businesses to keep on top of their tax obligations will be significantly reduced, enabling them to spend more time running their businesses. The likelihood of errors will be much reduced, resulting in greater certainty, fewer interactions, less debt, and less need for compliance checks. Businesses will have a clearer view of their tax position during the year and will be able to meet their tax obligations at minimum cost and minimum disruption. Proposals recently released for consultation mean that most individuals will pay what they need to and get what they’re entitled to during the year without having to do anything. Increasingly, earlier, more complete and more accurate information will be provided to Inland Revenue on their behalf. Digital accounts will be populated with the information Inland Revenue holds about individuals and progressively with information provided to Inland Revenue by others. For example, the investment income they earn from financial institutions. For the minority of individual customers who still need to interact with Inland Revenue, it will be quicker and lower effort for them to do what they need to do. Once Stage 2 has been fully implemented customers will have: More on-line services for all tax products; Integrated tax and business processes; Faster, more accurate tax information, providing near real-time visibility of tax; Faster tax refunds; and Less likelihood of tax debt and more payment options. Stage 2 is exponentially larger and more complex than Stage 1. In comparison to Stage 1 which focused on a single tax product and involved little legislative change, Stage 2 will see multiple products migrated to new systems and processes and legislative changes introduced. The changes being made will impact a wider group of customers over a longer period of time compared to implementing GST. All income tax products, the first release for Stage 3 - Working for Families, and gaming machine duty will be migrated to new systems and processes. The AIM option for calculating provisional tax and AEOI will be implemented from 1 April 2018. AIM will enable smaller businesses to calculate provisional tax to pay based on more real-time information so that payments better reflect cash flows. Tax payments will be smaller and more frequent. AIM will make filing and paying tax easier so customers can focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration. Software will help with correctly classifying transactions to ensure tax is right from the start, which will reduce errors and provide greater confidence in calculations of tax to pay. Together, new systems, processes and services and legislative changes, will simplify customers’ tax affairs and make it easier for them to meet their obligations. Transformation is moving to a model of a series of releases within stages. Changes will be implemented in a series of releases over 2018 and 2019. This reduces risk, and business and customer impacts. Some of the releases will be technical only, i.e. not visible to customers and staff, some will be legislative only, some will implement new systems and processes, and some will be a combination. Improvements to how PAYE and investment income information are collected, and the implementation of AEOI will be made progressively. The legislative release schedule is. From 1 April 2018 AIM will be introduced, employers will be able to voluntarily file PAYE information on a payday basis, and financial institutions will be able to voluntarily report non-residents’ information for AEOI. From 30 June 2018 financial institutions will be required to report non-residents’ information for AEOI. From 1 April 2019 employers will be required to file PAYE information on a payday basis, the electronic filing threshold will be reduced, and payers of investment income will be able to voluntarily file In confidence Page 12 detailed information about recipients each month or the months in which payments are made.  From 1 April 2020 payers of investment income will be required to file detailed information about recipients each month or the months in which payments are made The 2020/21 year will be the first full year of pre- populated monthly information for PAYE and investment income. Working for Families will be migrated to START at the same time as income tax begins to be processed in START on 1 April 2019. This will maintain customer experiences and minimise the impacts of co-existence for both customers and Inland Revenue. Income and provisional tax information for the 2018/19 year will be collected in START from 1 April 2018. This will include the AIM option for calculating provisional tax and PAYE information from employers voluntarily filing on payday. From 1 April 2018, Inland Revenue will begin pre-populating income information. FIRST will process income tax returns for the 2017/18 tax year and process all prior period returns until 31 March 2019. Any challenges with historical income tax and related data will be resolved in FIRST before being migrated to START on 1 April 2019. Calculating Working for Families tax credits is highly dependent on information about family circumstances and family income information. Administering Working for Families across two systems would not only require a complex set of connections to be built, processing times would be slower as data moved between the systems. During the transition period, the end result would be less timely payments and a lesser experience than customers receive today. The challenges experienced in Stage 1 by customers with more complex circumstances show that while Inland Revenue may be able to deal with co-existence issues, it is far more difficult for customers to do so. GST is a far simpler product than Working for Families, which is one of the more complex products that Inland Revenue administers. There are not the same issues with Student Loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver. These payment calculations are based on the incomes of individuals, rather than a combined family income. Student Loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver will be migrated to START as part of Stage 3 as planned. Improving customer experiences, particularly digital, is a key focus. Inland Revenue intends to improve customer experiences throughout Stage 2 through frequent releases of solutions and enhancements that make compliance easier, simpler and more efficient for both customers and Inland Revenue. Customer insights are being used to shape new approaches for specific customer segments. The initial focus is on start-up businesses to help them survive and thrive, and on tertiary students to reduce debt and improve outcomes. A young business digital welcome pack has been developed and is being tested with customers during June and July 2017. A prototype solution for personalised messaging will be developed and piloted for students moving overseas. Inland Revenue and the Tertiary Education Commission are working together to develop a calculator to help students with their borrowing choices by showing the true cost of a loan. To ensure customer feedback/input influences the design and delivery of services in Stage 2 Inland Revenue intends to set up customer labs. Tax agents will be included in this approach. In addition, work is underway on a future view of Inland Revenue’s website based around customer life events. Work continues on building Inland Revenue’s analytical and knowledge management capabilities. Inland Revenue has established an open panel for providers of advanced analytics products and services (please refer to page 20 for more details). Improved analytical capabilities will enable Inland Revenue to better use the information and data it has about customers to deliver more timely and targeted services. For example, providing proactive assistance at key events such as starting a business or employing someone for the first time. In June 2017 Inland Revenue began work with the panel on a proof of concept to:  Assess the technologies and operating model for an advanced analytics platform to answer the question “can an intelligent insight be created?”  Provide further assurance that implementing an advance analytics platform will deliver tangible value In confidence Page 13 to answer the question “can the intelligent insight be actioned?” Two different analytics platforms will be provisioned. Similar operations and service delivery type trials will be executed on both and the results compared before next steps are determined. The proof of concept will run for four months. This approach will better inform and de-risk any future investment in an advanced analytics platform. An enterprise content management solution will be piloted in September 2017 with Inland Revenue’s legal functions. This will enable information about complex legal cases to be more readily accessible. Inland Revenue is exploring options for modernising its enterprise support systems (ESS). The department is looking at the experiences of other agencies, including the NSW state government, in determining the optimal approach. Transformation of Inland Revenue’s corporate functions will begin in Stage 3. Transformation is the key vehicle for delivering Inland Revenue’s contribution to Better Public Services and wider government outcomes. Initiatives being considered as part of Stage 2 that will enable improved outcomes for customers include:  A more automated solution, integrated with START, to support the approved information sharing agreement (AISA) between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD).  Inland Revenue will recognise all business customers by their NZBN once the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has extended it to non-incorporated entities. This requires Inland Revenue to enhance the NZBN capabilities delivered as part of Stage 1.  Inland Revenue and DIA are exploring enabling digital registration and maintenance of customer information for individuals, including birth data. In addition, work continues with a range of agencies to ensure that existing information sharing arrangements will continue to work effectively following go-live of Stage 2. Inland Revenue is working with nine other agencies to ensure that 32 information sharing arrangements continue to operate after go-live. These include MSD, the Ministry of Justice, Land Information New Zealand, Statistics New Zealand, Treasury, DIA and the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Inland Revenue continues to work with other government agencies to share Information that will unlock the value of data held by the public sector. In March 2017, Inland Revenue and the Registrar of Companies signed a MoU following the passage of a Bill amending the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The MoU enables Inland Revenue to share information that will assist the Registrar of Companies to detect and enforce serious offences under the Companies Act 1993 and assist with prosecution. Also in March amendments to the TAA were passed to enable Inland Revenue to extend the existing sharing of information with the NZ Police in cases of serious crime to include non-individuals and deceased persons, under an AISA. In May 2017, Cabinet approved an AISA between Inland Revenue and MSD. The agreement consolidates and expands information sharing with MSD. Inland Revenue has also continued to work on providing simplified information to Govt.nz and worked with DIA, the Ministry of Health, and MSD on the successful delivery of Smartstart for new and expectant parents. A similar product for preparing for, and managing, bereavement is being developed. In April 2017, Inland Revenue and a credit reporting agency signed a MoU following amendments to the TAA. This MoU enables Inland Revenue to disclose taxpayers with significant tax debt to the agency, subject to certain criteria being met. This will enable businesses contemplating providing credit to make more informed decisions. In May 2017 Inland Revenue signed an agreement to disclose the same information to a second agency and expects to sign an agreement with a third later in 2017. In May 2017, an Order-in-Council was made setting the threshold above which tax debt information will be able to be shared with credit reporting agencies. Similarly to Stage 1, readiness assessments will be regularly completed in the lead up to go-live. The readiness of customers, business partners and Inland Revenue itself for changes will be assessed through a series of check-points. Readiness will be assessed across four major areas: Supporting customers to adapt to change In confidence Page 15 An early assessment indicates that the breadth of the changes will cover many customer and external groups over an extended period. The changes being introduced in Stage 2 will affect a larger number and wider range of customers than Stage 1. Many customers and tax agents will have gained some experience with new online services for GST, so will have some familiarity when other tax products are moved to START. During Stage 2, the benefits to customers using eServices or software to meet their obligations will become more apparent. However with the increased filing requirements for payday and investment income reporting, compliance costs are likely to increase for business customers who don’t use e-channels. A preliminary assessment indicates that implications for customers vary. Once detailed design for the new systems and processes in START has been completed, a reassessment will be completed to inform the development of detailed customer and service provider change management plans. An overview of these more detailed plans will be included in the next transformation update. It will be critical for Inland Revenue to support business customers, tax agents and service providers to adapt their systems and processes. Business customers, tax agents, and service providers, including software developers and personal tax summary intermediaries (PTSIs), will need to adapt their systems and processes to continue to meet their obligations and/or their customers’ needs. The key changes are:  Businesses choosing to use the AIM option for paying provisional tax will need internet connected accounting software.  Employers will file payroll details on a pay period basis.  More employers will be required to file electronically.  Software developers will need to build AIM (if they provide internet connected accounting software) and PAYE changes into their software.  Tax Agents will need to provide advice and support to their clients regarding the changes. Tax agents will also need to continue to evolve their business model from a traditional transactional role to more advisory and quality control checking of their clients’ systems and processes. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and not-for-profit organisations were surveyed in May 2017 to enable Inland Revenue to better understand their change capacity. The findings will be a key input into the detailed customer change management plans. It will be important for bookkeepers, payroll intermediaries, other government agencies and individual customers to adapt to the changes. These customer groups would be disrupted if they do not adapt their systems and processes. The key changes are:  Bookkeepers will need to adapt to the changes their business customers make.  Payroll intermediaries will need to make changes to their systems and processes to reflect the PAYE changes.  Government agencies will respond to changes across a number of areas – information sharing, legislative changes, payroll systems, and system interfaces.  Telephony suppliers/partners will help ensure SPK2IR (Inland Revenue’s voice recognition software) and START are connected. Only minimal change is expected for other suppliers/partners. Individuals with a myIR account will experience a new look and feel. People receiving some social policy entitlements from Inland Revenue will need to use two systems. Following consultation, proposals to make individuals’ tax obligations simpler and more certain will be finalised. Other groups need to be aware of the changes being made. For example industry groups are a key source for consultation and engagement for their members on policy and operational issues and provide communications directly to their members. In confidence Page 16 Inland Revenue is planning for some ‘hotspots’ where additional resourcing and support will be required for Stage 2 to meet customer demand. Particular areas of focus are:  Increased reporting requirements such as payday filing and investment income are expected to increase customer contacts and the need for proactive follow-up.  Campaigns informing and educating customers about new services and new requirements may lead to increased contacts.  Transitional dates – for example employers can elect to report PAYE information on a payday basis from 1 April 2018 and must do so from 1 April 2019 - may cause customer confusion. Customers may therefore require increased support from Inland Revenue.  Support for customers will be increased through the transition period, with a focus on education through community compliance and contact centres.  Inland Revenue expects that front-line staff will handle an increased number of queries from customers as the impacts from co-existence are greater than in Stage 1. For example, data to determine social policy assessments and entitlements will move between FIRST and START.  Inland Revenue is expecting to provide more hands on support for tax agents and other groups.  Direct engagement with software developers will be required to ensure they understand the new reporting requirements. An account management capability has been established to ensure a co-ordinated approach to stakeholder engagement. The scale and nature of the changes being introduced during Stage 2 mean that stakeholder engagement will be critical. Unlike Stage 1 where the changes were mainly GST-related, there are a number of areas where change is occurring in Stage 2 that affect a larger number of stakeholders. The diagram below shows the five broad segments which capture the differing relationships stakeholders have with Inland Revenue. Many stakeholders are part of more than one segment. For example, banks are customers in their own right, are service providers in their role as employers and work with Inland Revenue as an industry group to encourage their customers to get it right from the start. A government agency such as MSD is a customer, a service provider in their role as employer and a key part of information sharing arrangements across government. Recognising that relationships with stakeholders are multi-faceted, a centrally coordinated approach to engagements is essential. Stakeholders will have a single view of all changes they need to be aware of including migration of products and services to START, the implementation of AEOI, and changes to the collection of PAYE and investment income information. Consistent and co-ordinated relationship management will make it easy for stakeholders to understand what changes they may need to make to benefit from modernised information sharing processes and greater integration with Inland Revenue’s systems, and to know who in Inland Revenue to contact. Account Managers will supplement existing relationship management roles in Inland Revenue including:  Community Compliance Officers based around the country who provide education, enhance compliance and build relationships;  the Software Developers Liaison Unit who work on a day-to-day basis with software developers; and  the Large Enterprises team who provide specialist support to ensure corporate tax obligations are met. There are many more stakeholders to reach, requiring a much greater communications and engagement effort. The focus during mid-late 2017 will be on building awareness and understanding of the changes being introduced in Stage 2. Targeted audiences, including service providers, software developers and tax agent professional bodies, will need to understand the scope and impact of Stage 2. In confidence Page 17 Customers will be provided with information about changes, including clear identification of any action they need to take, in sufficient time ahead of each release. Existing channels will need to be supplemented with new ways to engage new or hard-to-reach audiences. Inland Revenue will focus on:  Face-to-face engagement through Inland Revenue- led external events such as forums, seminars and visits, and leveraging external business partners’ conferences and road-shows.  Increased use of video and multi-media to proactively show stakeholders what the changes will mean.  Expanding digital engagement through greater use of social media, webinars, and apps. New channels for Stage 2 include the account management team and greater customer involvement in user experience service design. This will mean more opportunities being provided for tax agents and businesses to validate new eServices and provide feedback before go-live. Inland Revenue’s community compliance team will run seminars with tax agents in the lead up to Stage 2 go-live to reinforce their knowledge of what the changes will mean for them and what they need to do on day 1. The community compliance team will also be more active with the SME/not for profit groups. The next transformation update will provide more detailed information about the communications and engagement activity planned for Stage 2. Inland Revenue continues to actively engage with key stakeholders and industry groups. Tax agent professional bodies Since December 2016, Inland Revenue has built on existing relationships with tax professional bodies including Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), the Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ) and the New Zealand Bookkeepers’ Association. Members have provided useful feedback on the new GST system at various conferences and working groups, some of which was strongly expressed. An increased level of engagement through these bodies is planned for the remainder of 2017 and there has been an enthusiastic response to the proposed focus groups to validate the Stage 2 user experience. Inland Revenue is continuing to work with the industry on the draft AIM determination and with a group of progressive small business accountants who are keen to remain involved as AIM moves towards implementation. An overview of how AIM will work was included in the MYOB small business seminar series, as well as through the Reckon client workshops, and ATAINZ engagements. Business and industry groups Active involvement by Inland Revenue in Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA) payroll conferences and on-going MBIE small business road-shows will be extended to other business and industry groups from the second half of 2017 onwards. There will be significant focus will on opportunities to engage with micro businesses, small-medium enterprises (SMEs) and not-for-profit organisations to maximise awareness of income tax changes and new options such as the introduction of AIM. Engagements will include involvement in customer seminars delivered by software developers on these topics. Work with software developers to help them prepare for Stage 2 is well underway. Inland Revenue is collaborating , particularly on the introduction of AIM and income tax changes. In addition, payroll software developers are being reminded about the PAYE administration changes going through the legislative process. They have been invited to register their interest for working with Inland Revenue on payday reporting software and implementation. Financial sector The department continues to work with financial industry representatives to help ready them for the implementation of AEOI, proposed changes to reporting requirements for investment income information and opportunities to extend the digital border. For AEOI, the first step for financial institutions is to begin identifying non-residents from July 2017. The first AEOI stakeholder reference group sessions were held towards the end of March 2017. A targeted public awareness campaign will be run from early June until mid-July 2017, and educational materials will be available on Inland Revenue’s website from July 2017. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA In confidence Page 18 Government Engagement with government agencies during May and June 2017 focused on information sharing and preparing their systems and processes for Stage 2. During the second half of 2017, engagement will extend to exploring opportunities to align transformation programmes and working with local and regional public entities to deliver messaging about transformation. Plans for readying staff to adopt new systems and processes as part of Stage 2 are well advanced. The breadth of changes being introduced in Stage 2 spans many teams and groups within Inland Revenue. In comparison to Stage 1, a far greater proportion of people in Inland Revenue are in roles, teams and business units which are critical to go-live so they can continue to do their work and support customers. Once Stage 2 is implemented START will be the new tool for all front-line staff to look up employer and income tax information and will co-exist with FIRST for social policy information. This includes Student Loans, KiwiSaver and Child Support teams to a degree not seen in Stage 1. A far greater proportion of work will be done in START as more products will have been migrated. Where GST was a small proportion of most people’s work, Stage 2 will move a larger portion of work into START. For most people at Inland Revenue, a much larger proportion of their work will be either in START or require co-existence with START. The approach to training staff has been refined based on feedback from staff and lessons from Stage 1. In contrast to Stage 1 when staff began using START for the first time, a significant number will already be familiar with and using it day-to-day for varying proportions of their work. Approximately 500-600 people will be using START for the first time. An integrated approach to readying staff for change will continue, with refinements from Stage 1 including more time for informal and on-the-job learning, more tailored practice prior to go-live and smaller groups for classroom based training. Training is expected to be delivered over a period of 4 to 6 months for approximately 4,700 staff. Similarly to Stage 1, training will consist of pre-learning, classroom training; and post go-live training. Not all 4,700 staff will need classroom training. On day 1 the focus will be on the key things Inland Revenue people need to know well for the first week versus other information that can be provided on a just- in-time basis. Four distinct groups require differing levels of change management to ready them for Stage 2 go-live:  Individuals and groups who could not continue to work if they were not ready for go-live (group A) - a high level of training, communications and change preparation.  Individuals whose work would be disrupted if they were not ready for go-live (group B) - a medium to high level of communications, and training and change management.  Individuals whose work could be disrupted if they were not ready for go-live (group C) - a low to medium level of training, and some communications and change management.  All other non-customer facing people (group D) – need awareness and communications. The majority of people will be in groups A and B. From June 2017, a detailed training needs analysis for each group will be developed, shared and tested. Implementing a new organisational design for Inland Revenue In confidence Page 19 A modern revenue system requires Inland Revenue to change the way it works and make more intelligent use of information. Inland Revenue is increasingly working more in partnerships across government and the private sector and is becoming more knowledge-based, supported by greater analytical capability. Once transformation is complete, Inland Revenue will be a smaller and more efficient organisation. The department’s overall workforce is expected to reduce by 25–30%, although total workforce numbers are not expected to change significantly until 2019/20. Creating an organisation that works together better to improve outcomes for customers. Inland Revenue intends to be an agile, intelligence-led organisation built around the needs of its customers. Those designing customer services will be as close to the customer as possible and people working with customers will be empowered to make more decisions and resolve customers’ issues more quickly. A new organisation design will enable people at Inland Revenue to:  apply their skills more broadly to a range of work;  work together more closely;  provide better services to customers; and  make the most of a new and evolving working environment, supported by technology. Five key shifts underpin the new organisation design. 1. Customer segments will create end-to-end customer experiences and accountability. 2. Teams will come together quickly from across Inland Revenue and be empowered to solve customer issues. 3. People with the right skills will be close to customers, providing capability when and where it’s needed. 4. Fewer, broader roles will allow people to deliver end to end customer services. 5. There will be a greater emphasis on leading and coaching, new performance measures, new decision- making frameworks and delegations, and new workflows. Inland Revenue has taken the first steps towards putting the future organisation in place. Two key elements of working differently are structures and roles. Three new Executive Leadership roles have been established effective from July 2017 to lead three new organisation groups:  Customer and Compliance Services – Individuals, Families and Micro Businesses (referred to as Customer and Compliance Services – Individuals);  Customer and Compliance Services – Small, Medium and Significant Enterprises (referred to Customer and Compliance Services – Business); and  Information and Intelligence Services. These new groups will be established by January 2018 to support more customer-centred delivery of services and new ways of working. From 9 to 29 May 2017 Inland Revenue consulted staff on the proposed design for three new groups and the proposed process for moving people into roles in them. The feedback received is currently being worked through. Final decisions are expected by mid-July 2017. A large number of staff (approximately 4,500 frontline staff and leaders) will be impacted by the changes if the proposal proceeds. There will be some job losses (based on the proposal, approximately 130 roles) although Inland Revenue hopes to manage most reductions through attrition and flexible working arrangements. The proposed timeframes for establishing the groups and moving people to new roles ensure Inland Revenue is well-positioned for the first release of Stage 2 on 1 April 2018. The Minister of Revenue will be kept informed of final decisions and progress in implementing the new organisation design. Further organisational change will occur in 2019. Front-of-house services will remain in all current locations. Inland Revenue will continue to have a presence in the communities it is represented in today and will continue to look for opportunities to co-locate with other government agencies. Inland Revenue and unions will continue to work together. Inland Revenue worked with the PSA and Taxpro to develop the new organisation design and appreciated their valuable contribution and input. There will continue to be on-going engagement with unions. Procuring the products and services required for transformation In confidence Page 20 All procurement processes continue to be consistent with Government Rules of Sourcing. Since the November 2016 update, Inland Revenue has completed further procurement activity to select the services and products required for future stages. A Statement of Work (SoW) was signed with Accenture NZ Ltd in February 2017 for the work needed to ensure heritage systems can co-exist with START for Stage 2. In March 2017 Inland Revenue established an open panel for providers of advanced analytics products and services. This has helped to ensure that Inland Revenue is attracting a range of businesses to transformation. More than 40 organisations are included on the panel, and smaller businesses are well represented. An open panel allows Inland Revenue to make use of future thinking in this evolving area as it develops, given the dynamic market place for these types of products and services. Options for the replacement of the department’s workplace technology are being discussed with the appropriate governance bodies. A decision is expected in the latter half of 2017 regarding the preferred option. Current arrangements are supported until 2021. Possible approaches to transforming Inland Revenue’s enterprise support services (ESS) are being explored. The programme roadmap indicates that transformation of corporate functions will begin during Stage 3 (2018- 2020) and completed during Stage 4 (2019-2021). Inland Revenue continues to consume common capabilities and ICT capabilities where they exist, meet the department’s business needs and are cost-effective. Examples to date are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software Framework Agreements and Telecommunications-as-a-Service (TaaS). The most recent example is making it easier for customers to contact Inland Revenue if necessary by enabling them to call free (0800) from their mobile phones. New Zealand businesses have secured a considerable amount of transformation work. Inland Revenue seeks a wide range of providers for transformation and will continue to do so. Opportunities are actively promoted to the market place, including New Zealand businesses – for example, advertising on GETS and communications with vendors. From 1 July 2014 to 31 May 2017, $211m has been spent on contractor and consultant services of which $155m (74%) has been spent on New Zealand resident businesses. In February 2016 for example, New Zealand company Spark and its subsidiary Revera secured one of the biggest contracts to date at $45-60 million over 10 years. The contract is to provide IaaS datacentres and associated services. Tenderers were sought from the all- of-Government IaaS panel. Inland Revenue expects that New Zealand businesses will continue to be actively involved in transformation. Other examples of New Zealand companies Inland Revenue has contracted include Assurity Consulting, Deloitte, Vodafone and Deloitte Asparona. Both delivery partners, FAST and Accenture, have recruited New Zealand staff. FAST has employed 11 New Zealanders as START developers out of 55 total employees in New Zealand. More are likely to be employed. Accenture have employed in excess of 40. Inland Revenue continues to share its commercial expertise with other agencies. Lessons learned have been shared with the Ministry of Health. Inland Revenue also shared insights with the Ministry regarding improved vendor segmentation and vendor management processes. Inland Revenue is working with DIA and MBIE to explore a single integrated solution for sourcing, contracts, purchasing and payments for vendor relationship management. The Ministry of Education and Inland Revenue are working closely together to help the Ministry reduce the time it takes to pay vendor invoices. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Managing and governing transformation In confidence Page 21 Transformation is tracking slightly behind plan. Transformation is currently tracking slightly behind schedule for Stage 2 and Inland Revenue is working to get back on plan. The department is confident that this will be achieved without disrupting future implementation dates. Expenses are tracking as expected. Monitoring focuses on delivery progress and realisation of benefits. Key performance indicators (KPIs) track delivery progress against scope, schedule, delivery partners, risks, issues, resources, financials, benefits, inter-dependences and stakeholder engagement. Progress against each of these areas is regularly reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Outcome measures track achievement of the investment objectives and realisation of the agreed benefits. There are three main measures of success:  easier for customers;  reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility); and  administrative savings to Inland Revenue. Progress towards achieving these outcomes is reported to Cabinet as part of these updates (refer to page 7 for progress in realising Stage 1 benefits). Transformation remains inherently high risk. Transformation is recognised as a high risk initiative. Robust risk management approaches are in place, and the assurance programme forms an important part of management of risks. The key risks facing transformation were identified and communicated to Ministers as part of the 2015 business case. Although implementation risk for Stage 1 was successfully mitigated, Stage 2 is higher risk given the breadth and complexity of products to be migrated and the consequent impacts on customers, staff, other stakeholders and Inland Revenue itself. The most significant risks and the risk profile for transformation are reported regularly to the PGC and to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. At the end of June 2017, the risk profile for transformation was light amber. This means that risks have been generally identified and documented with appropriate mitigations; however some areas require additional focus. Current risks reported to PGC relate to  The need for legislative change that has not been anticipated, resulting in Inland Revenue being unable to meet legislated timing.  Changes to scope, timescales and funding.  The scale of change impacting revenue distribution and collection, Inland Revenue’s ability to achieve performance targets, and source and retain people with the right skills.  Inland Revenue not meeting expectations regarding the realisation of benefits, adoption and/or delivery of all-of-Government capabilities.  Government losing confidence in Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver.  Co-existence. Please refer to appendix 2 for a summary of the most significant risks for transformation as at June 2017. While risks may become issues from time to time, this is not unexpected. Should any opportunities or issues arise that may impact timelines, costs, benefits or risk profile these will be highlighted for Ministers to consider. To date none of the significant programme-level risks have materialised. Inland Revenue has limited capacity to implement additional changes. The updated tax policy work programme combined with the implementation of Stage 2 of transformation, means Inland Revenue has very limited capacity to implement additional policy changes. These would need to be assessed on a case by case basis. Factors that will need to be taken into consideration when considering new opportunities are:  capacity to deliver further reforms in FIRST;  Inland Revenue’s change capacity; and  transformation costs and timelines assume that the implementation of policy changes is aligned with the roadmap. In confidence Page 22 Assurance reviews are on-going to provide confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews. The outcomes of previous assurance reviews are included in earlier business cases and transformation updates. The two most recent external assurance reviews were completed towards the end of 2016. A Gateway 4 (readiness for service) review in November 2016 rated delivery confidence as amber. The review found that “...Stage 1 go-live appears feasible. Management issues, if addressed promptly, should enable successful delivery . . . and would maintain a strong position in readiness for Stage 2.” In December 2016 KPMG completed a fifth IQA and fourth TQA. This review focused on readiness for go-live of Stage 1. Prior to finalising the report, KPMG presented their key findings to Inland Revenue’s PGC. As a result additional measures were put in place which reduced the risks identified in the review, and helped ensure a successful go-live on 7 February 2017. The review team found that "...the complexity & scale of the solution mean that the ‘go-live decision’ will require a carefully considered judgement call, balancing the needs of the programme to maintain progress with the demands of the stakeholder community." The team also noted that “... planning for Stage 2 deployment has been initiated in parallel with Stage 1. This is encouraging, as is the feedback that this planning is leveraging the lessons-learned from Stage 1.” For each review, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue are offered the opportunity to meet with reviewers and to be briefed by Inland Revenue on the findings once the review is complete. In addition, copies of all assurance reviews and Inland Revenue’s response to any action points raised are provided to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. An assurance plan for 2017 has been agreed with the corporate centre. Three external reviews are currently underway or have recently been completed and the findings will be reported in the next transformation update:  An IQA6 and TQA5 review undertaken by KPMG;  A Gateway 0 (strategic assessment); and  An Office of the Auditor General (OAG)/Audit NZ performance review of procurement and contract management. Two further external assurance reviews are scheduled for early 2018:  An IQA7 and TQA6 review undertaken by KPMG; and  A Gateway 0 (strategic assessment) focusing on Stage 3 progress and a Gateway 4 (readiness for service) review focusing on Stage 2 deployment. Sharing experiences with other change programmes In confidence Page 23 There continues to be good engagement between Inland Revenue other government change programmes. On-going meetings are underway with MSD and ACC to align changes where possible. Specific discussions have begun to assess the implications of the change to payday reporting for their new and current systems, and to assess the readiness of these agencies for change. Inland Revenue and ACC met in May 2017 to explore aligning online services for tax agents and intermediaries. A follow up meeting has been scheduled for July 2017. In May 2017, Inland Revenue and the Government Chief Information Officer (GCIO) hosted a session with Chief Information Officers (CIOs) from across the government sector. Inland Revenue shared the background to transformation, why a service aggregation model for managing suppliers was adopted, the reasons for selecting a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution, and why implementation started with GST. The technology scope was shared with the group and highlighted that transformation is about far more than implementing START. Inland Revenue shared the lessons from the success of the JCAPS to Oracle Fusion Middleware (known as J2FM) project, and the approach to the design and implementation of an intelligent workplace. Inland Revenue emphasised that both these initiatives focus on delivering critical business outcomes; technology is the means to the end rather than the end in itself. Engagement with other revenue authorities who have implemented START is on-going and enables Inland Revenue to learn from their experiences. In April and May 2017 members of Inland Revenue’s executive leadership team along with senior business managers visited FAST and FAST clients. The purpose of the trip was to better understand:  the customer service improvements that FAST and agencies expect to introduce in the next 5-7 years;  how others manage systems and performance; and  go-live experiences. The purpose of the visit to FAST was to build Inland Revenue’s understanding of the roadmap for GenTax (the proprietary name for START). Inland Revenue will work with FAST to further develop the core GenTax solution to provide a solid platform that will support the department’s needs including eServices, analytics, and social policy. There is a range of services FAST offer remotely, such as security and quality reviews, that Inland Revenue will explore further. The Employment Development Division (EDD) in California runs the unemployment insurance scheme on behalf of the state government. They have been using Gentax for five years. The purpose of this visit was to share ideas and experiences of working with FAST and their GenTax solution. Discussions centred on the model EDD has deployed for support and change, and how they’ve handled change in the business-as-usual state. Inland Revenue will look at adopting aspects of EDD’s approach, for example identifying a formal and explicit role for subject matter experts in business groups. This role will be the go to person for any issues with START following go-live. This is a natural extension of the role performed by the desk side support team in Stage 1, making it a more enduring role within the business. EDD have invested in Gentax analytics and have derived significant value from this investment. They are in the middle of a usability study which they have agreed to share with Inland Revenue once it is complete. Discussions with the Finnish Tax Administration (FTA) included their approach to testing and resolving incidents following roll out. Inland Revenue is currently reviewing its approach to testing for Stage 2, and is incorporating the lessons learned from the FTA. Benchmarking was also a topic of discussion and Inland Revenue and the FTA agreed that it would be valuable to explore this further. The next step is to identify one or two areas to work on together. By way of example, benchmarking could include the correlation between the number of test scenarios and defects. Overall, there were some good insights for Inland Revenue from these visits – particularly around getting better at reducing the number of defects. If the design is right, there will be fewer defects, and a smoother transition to production support. Appendix 1 – Transformation roadmap In confidence Page 24
July 2018 Transformation Update Go-live of Release 2 Implementation of Release 3 July 2018 Version: Final IN CONFIDENCE Table of Contents In confidence Page 2 Section Page Executive Summary 3 Release 2 was successfully implemented on 17 April 2018 5 Preparations for the implementation of Release 3 are progressing well 7 The next steps in changing Inland Revenue’s organisation design are underway 10 Transformation continues to be well managed and governed 11 Appendix 1: Transformation roadmap 13 Appendix 2: Release plan 14 Appendix 3: Lead and lag indicators 15 Appendix 4: Key transformation risks 16 Executive summary In confidence Page 3 New Zealand’s revenue system is being transformed in four broad stages – digital services, tax, social policy and a final wrap up – in a series of releases. The first two releases have been successfully implemented and are delivering benefits for customers. New systems and processes for GST were implemented on 7 February 2017, completing Stage 1. Release 2 was successfully implemented on 17 April 2018. In addition to successfully migrating withholding taxes to START, 1 this release included:  The accounting income method (AIM) provides a pay- as-you-go option for small businesses for provisional tax.  The automatic exchange of information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners helps combat global tax avoidance.  Employers are now able to send their information to Inland Revenue on payday if they choose to do so.  It is now easier for customers to meet their obligations for withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy, and gaming machine duty. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC  Income information is now being collected in START enabling pre-population of individuals’ information to begin. Attention has now turned to supporting customers as they use new services for the first time, particularly the first AIM filing dates. As at 29 June 2018, just over 1,100 customers were using AIM. Work on policy and legislative settings continues. Changes to the collection of PAYE information and the collection and use of investment income information are now law. Approximately 3,000 payday returns had been filed by just over 500 customers as at 29 June 2018. Changes to make tax simpler for individuals were approved by the Government in April 2018 and are now subject to legislation. Combined with changes to PAYE and investment income information, these changes mean that, over time, most salary and wage earners will pay what they need to and receive what they are entitled to during the year. Working for Families tax credits entitlements will be more accurately monitored and adjusted throughout the year. These changes are being progressively introduced and will be fully implemented by the 2020/21 year. In April 2019 income tax and Working for Families will move to new system and processes (Release 3) Release 3 will complete Stage 2, with the migration of income tax and, in addition, Working for Families on new systems and processes. This is a significant release as it will affect most New Zealanders. It is more complex and higher risk that the first two releases, as changes to systems, processes and legislation will affect businesses, individuals and financial institutions. For individual customers, the changes will be the biggest they have experienced in nearly 20 years. Progressively from April 2019, customers will have easy, digital access to all their tax and personal information, employers will provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue every payday, more businesses will file electronically, and payers of investment income can provide detailed recipient information on a more frequent basis if they choose to. Changes to Inland Revenue’s business The way customers interact with Inland Revenue will change considerably in the coming years. It will take two complete cycles for the benefits of the legislative and system and process changes to be fully realised. As a result of these changes, there will be far less need for customers to interact with Inland Revenue. 1.Cabinet has approved changes to make tax simpler and easier for individuals. 2.Cabinet has approved policy changes to modernise the rules and processes in the Tax Administration Act (TAA). 3.Cabinet has also approved improvements to PAYE error corrections and adjustments. 4.Drafting of the Bill to enact the individuals’ income tax, TAA and PAYE error correction changes is underway. In confidence Page 4 During the transition period, some customers will contact Inland Revenue to seek reassurance. At times, meeting customer demand may be challenging as the processes and activities customers are used to using change. This has been evident during the peak filing period this year. During June 2018, Inland Revenue experienced some issues with its digital services and is carefully monitoring them in managing the peak period of demand from April to July. Once the peak filing period has passed, Inland Revenue will identify what further enhancements could be made to its digital services. Changes to Inland Revenue’s capabilities Changes will be made to Inland Revenue’s digital channels and services to make it easier for customers to find what they’re looking for, understand their obligations and entitlements, and do what they need to do. A new data and intelligence platform will enable Inland Revenue to better understand customers’ needs, tailor services to them, and help them get things right from the start. Errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, will be better detected and detected earlier. The next steps in changing Inland Revenue’s organisation design are underway. The three new groups established in February 2018 with broader roles and new delegations are already making a difference for customers. Customer-facing staff are now able to make decisions when dealing with customers that previously would have had to be referred to their team manager and then a manager. This means customer queries are resolved more quickly. Between April and August 2018, the Executive Leadership Team is working with a range of staff and experts on how Inland Revenue could best work in 2021/22. The focus is on the parts of the organisation that support the customer-facing functions. Transformation is complex and high-risk. Transformation remains complex. Release 3 in particular presents additional challenges given the scale of the impacts for customers and Inland Revenue. There is considerable complexity in managing service performance across our two systems (co-existence), while endeavouring to ensure that customers are not adversely affected. This risk will not be fully mitigated until transformation is completed in 2021, and heritage systems (FIRST) are decommissioned. Maintaining momentum is key to reducing risk. Robust risk management approaches are in place, and risks are actively managed. More information about risks can be found on page 11 and in appendix 4. The most recent independent quality assurance and technical quality assurance review undertaken by KPMG notes that transformation continues to be well managed and to demonstrate the characteristics of a high performing team. Release 2 was successfully implemented on 17 April 2018 In confidence Page 5 Release 2 included new products, legislative changes, and new systems and processes for more taxes. It’s now easier for customers to meet their obligations for a wider range of taxes. Businesses can now file, pay and amend withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, gaming machine duty, and portfolio investment entity returns online, as well as GST returns. Income information for the 2018/19 year is now being collected in START. Customers have a new option for meeting their provisional tax obligations. Small businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million a year can now work out their provisional tax using AIM. Until AIM, businesses paid provisional tax at set times of the year, regardless of when they earned their income. AIM means small businesses can:  pay smaller amounts of provisional tax more often  get refunds of overpaid provisional tax during the year  avoid paying interest or penalties provided they pay what their software tells them to, on time  have their provisional tax calculations done for them by their software  have their information sent to Inland Revenue by their software – no extra step required. Following go-live, the focus for AIM shifted to the key filing dates in May and June 2018, when users began filing their first AIM statement of activity. The 28 June 2018 filing date was significant as it was the last opportunity for existing businesses to adopt AIM in the 2018-19 tax year. It is also when the bulk of activity from businesses that file on a two or six-monthly GST filing frequency occurred. Inland Revenue expects uptake of AIM to be modest in its first year, as the accounting industry adapts to new ways of working, the use of accounting software grows in small businesses, and the number of software providers offering the service increases. Uptake is likely to follow the trend for filing GST through software. That started with a pilot of just a few hundred customers in December 2016 and has grown to just over 81,000 customers as at May 2018. The implementation of AEOI will help combat global tax evasion. New Zealand is one of many countries that has committed to new global standards on the automatic exchange of information. This information is collected by financial institutions around the world for reporting to tax authorities, who then exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the correct amount of tax. Financial Institutions have three options to submit their information to Inland Revenue. The deadline to submit the first year’s information was 30 June 2018. Customer take up is in line with expectations. As at 29 June 2018:  Approximately 3,000 payday returns had been filed by just over 500 customers.  More than 30,000 withholding tax and fringe benefit tax returns had been filed.  Just over 1,100 customers were using AIM to file their provisional tax returns.  More than 700 AEOI registrations had been received. In addition, more than 500,000 employer monthly schedules had been filed, containing more than 10 million items of employee data. Responses from business customers and tax agents since go-live have been largely positive. Release 2 was a more complex implementation. Compared to GST, the Release 2 cut-over was more complex. More than 220 people, including people from 18 other organisations, worked around the clock in shifts to shutdown customer channels, migrate data from FIRST to START, complete business and technical checks, and start channels up again. Compared to implementing GST, slightly more accounts (1 million, compared to 880,000 for GST) and returns (13 million, compared to 8.1 million GST returns) were converted for Release 2 and more tasks (500 compared In confidence Page 6 to 350 for GST) were completed. Just over 51,000 tests were completed for Release 2, compared to approximately 17,500 for Release 1. No severity 1 (major impact on critical business activities) or 2 (major impact on business activities) defects were carried into go-live, and no priority 1 issues (critical impact) were raised following go-live. Acting on the lessons learned from implementing GST paid dividends. For Release 2, Inland Revenue made enhancements in several key areas to ensure a successful implementation.  Co-existence: a release-based implementation has minimised the need for customers to interact with two systems. Implementing GST showed that while Inland Revenue could deal with the challenges of working in two systems, it is more difficult for customers to do so.  Stakeholder engagement: a wider range of stakeholders was engaged earlier and more face-to- face education and support was provided.  Active involvement of users: opportunities for customers to validate the design of new services were provided throughout the design process. Proactive monitoring of systems is in place and there have been some unrelated issues with service availability since go-live. Proactive monitoring of systems is in place for GST, withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, gaming machine duty and payroll subsidy to ensure they are available and performing as expected. During June 2018, it has taken customers longer on occasion to login to myIR than acceptable and some services have been temporarily unavailable. While these issues were unrelated to Release 2, during transformation changes are being made to Inland Revenue’s existing systems, which are fragile and complex. Co-existence has added further to this challenge. As a result, issues may sometimes arise. Inland Revenue is well aware of the frustration customers experienced as a result of these challenges. Customer experience through online channels has returned to the levels normally expected. Inland Revenue did not apply late filing and late payment penalties to GST returns filed and paid by 4 July 2018. Inland Revenue is carefully monitoring its digital services in managing the peak period of demand from April to July. Once the peak filing period has passed, Inland Revenue will identify what enhancements could be made to its digital services. Well established processes for detecting and responding to incidents help to minimise the impacts on customers as much as possible. Inland Revenue has put the technology foundations in place to reliably deliver services. Minimising the risk of system outages and intermittent systems failure is one of the investment objectives for transformation. Inland Revenue has strengthened its infrastructure by investing in:  Two new data centres which give Inland Revenue greater flexibility and speed to scale up and down as needs change, and provide much greater back up in the event of an emergency such as a natural disaster.  A leading-edge security and identity access management system providing customers and staff with secure access to online services.  New middleware software which enables customers and partners to connect with Inland Revenue’s systems, and ensures systems “talk” to each other.  Automated service management processes to manage incidents and service requests more effectively. Notwithstanding this positive progress, operational risk remains high. Inland Revenue’s operational risk profile has increased now that transformation is underway, and will remain high until transformation is complete. Transitioning to new systems and processes as quickly as possible is the best way to manage risk as this will limit the period of time that the old and new systems need to co-exist. Preparations for the implementation of Release 3 are progressing well In confidence Page 7 Release 3 is a group of changes being implemented from April 2018 through to the end of June 2019. The changes include migrating more products to START in April 2019, legislative changes, and other changes to Inland Revenue’s capabilities. This is a significant release as the products in scope affect most New Zealanders. It is more complex and higher risk than the first two releases, as changes to systems, processes and legislation will affect businesses, individuals and financial institutions. For individual customers, the proposed legislative changes will be the biggest they have experienced in nearly 20 years. Some changes are being made progressively, such as changes to the collection and use of employment and investment income information, to give customers time to make the necessary changes. Release 3 in April 2019 will further simplify customers’ interactions with Inland Revenue. Once Release 3 is implemented in April 2019:  It will be easier for customers to meet their income tax obligations and receive their correct Working for Families entitlements.  Customers will be able to enrol digitally for products and services.  Payers of investment income will be able to send detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue every month, or the months in which income is paid, if they choose to.  Employers will send their PAYE information to Inland Revenue on payday.  More businesses will file electronically. From April 2019, employers will have integrated tax and business processes, making it quicker and easier for them to meet their obligations. All customers will have access to faster, more accurate information, providing near real-time visibility of all their tax obligations. Customers will have a lot more certainty as there will be much less chance of them going into debt and any refunds will be paid more quickly. The way customers interact with the revenue system will change considerably in the coming years. Changes to the collection of PAYE information, the collection and use of investment income information, and changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax 2 mean that, over time, most salary and wage earners will pay what they need to, and receive what they are entitled to, during the year. Working for Families tax credits entitlements will be more accurately monitored and adjusted throughout the year. These changes are being introduced progressively and will be fully implemented by the 2020/21 year. 2 Subject to legislation From the 2018/19 tax year, 3 all individuals will have their end-of-year position assessed. Refunds or tax to pay will be automatically issued to customers Inland Revenue is confident it holds enough income information about. This will be most salary and wage earners. Businesses will be able to file all their taxes through myIR and use new functions, such as more embedded calculations. Businesses will increasingly be able to use their own systems and processes to meet their obligations as they will be integrated with our systems and processes. From the 2019/20 year, employers will be filing employee information every payday, and some payers of investment income will be voluntarily providing more detailed information about recipients of investment income more often. This will allow Inland Revenue to act earlier to help customers get things right. More people will pay what they need to, and receive what they are entitled to during the year, so there will be fewer customers with end-of-year balances and their balances will be smaller. From the 2020/21 year, Inland Revenue will be receiving more detailed and timely employment and investment income information for individuals. The number of customers with end-of-year balances should drop further, as should the average amount. 3 Ibid In confidence Page 8 It will take two complete cycles for the benefits of these changes to be fully realised. As a result, there will be far less need for customers to contact Inland Revenue and less need for year-end square-up processes. Customers’ tax and entitlements will be adjusted during the year as their circumstances change. All their information will be available to customers in myIR. A customer information campaign will, subject to appropriate approval, 4 educate and inform customers about the changes being made and the benefits to them. Inland Revenue recognises the need to invest considerable time and effort in supporting customers to adapt to the changes being made. The department is working through how best to transition customers to these new processes and reporting requirements. Release 3 will mean changes for most New Zealanders. Inland Revenue has undertaken a high level assessment of the impact on customers of the changes being implemented as part of Release 3. Most customers are impacted to some degree. 4 Cabinet Office Circular CO (15) 4  Individuals – income tax will be migrated to new systems and processes and, based on proposed legislative changes, Inland Revenue will introduce a new way of finalising end-of-year income with refunds or tax to pay automatically issued to customers. This, combined with a new myIR eServices, will be the biggest change individual customers have experienced since the personal tax summary (PTS) was introduced in 2000.  Families - Working for Families Tax Credits will be processed using new systems and processes, and entitlements will be more accurately monitored and adjusted throughout the year.  Employers will be required to provide employment information to Inland Revenue every payday from 1 April 2019. Date of birth and contact information for new employees will also need to be provided.  More business will be required to file electronically.  Tax Agents will be impacted by changes to income tax.  PTS intermediaries may notice a substantial change in their business model over the next few years as Inland Revenue begins to pre-populate and automate more end-of-year information and offer more eServices to customers (subject to legislation).  Tax Pooling Intermediaries and bookkeepers will have access to more online services.  Banks and other payers of investment income will need to report detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue, and report more frequently. Once Release 3 has been implemented, customers will have easy access to all their tax and customer information (such as name, address and bank account details) through myIR. Families will also experience changes to how they find their Working for Families information and keep it up-to- date. A family screen in myIR will show details such as whom they receive payments for and who they share the care of children with. Customers will also be able to track why their entitlement amount has changed. Businesses will be able to file all their taxes through myIR and to use new functionality, such as more embedded calculations. Now that the impacts on different customer groups are understood, the next step is to identify what is required to ensure that:  affected customers are aware of and ready for the changes being introduced, and  Inland Revenue is ready to support them as their interactions with the department change and as they use new services for the first time. This work is expected to be completed by the end of August 2018 and details will be included in the November 2018 transformation update. In confidence Page 9 Once all taxes are migrated to START, there will be significantly better agility for tax products. Once Release 3 has been implemented in April 2019, all taxes will be administered in START. Completion of this major milestone will provide the Government with significantly improved agility for any changes it wishes to make to tax products. START would be the delivery vehicle for any of the Tax Working Group’s tax-related recommendations that are accepted by the Government. Factors that will need to be taken into account when considering new opportunities are:  Inland Revenue’s capacity to deliver  customers’ capacity to absorb change and Inland Revenue’s capacity to support customers through change  operational risk in light of co-existence until transformation is completed in 2021. Transformation costs and timelines assume that implementation of policy changes are aligned with the programme roadmap and delivery of system changes to minimise costs and impacts on customers. Release 3 will also include some changes to Inland Revenue’s capabilities. In addition to the changes being delivered by START and legislative reforms, other changes will be made to some of Inland Revenue key capabilities to better support customers.  Digital channels and services will be revamped to tailor services to customers, help them find what they’re looking for faster, understand their obligations and entitlements, and make it easier for them to do what they need to do.  A new data and intelligence platform will enable Inland Revenue to better understand customers’ needs, tailor services accordingly, and help customers get things right from the start. Errors and non- compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, will be better detected and detected earlier.  New tools and equipment will be progressively rolled out to support Inland Revenue’s new organisation design and ways of working. This will also support more remote working, so Inland Revenue can be where customers are.  A new platform for Inland Revenue’s enterprise support services will improve the processes that support the day-to-day running of the department. To administer a modern revenue system, Inland Revenue will have to change the way it works and make more intelligent use of information. New skills and abilities are required to better understand customers’ circumstances and needs across wider government, and to identify policy and service design opportunities to improve the overall wellbeing of New Zealanders. New technology and legislative changes alone will not deliver the full range of benefits to customers and government. Some key implementation decisions have yet to be made. Some implementation decisions in key areas yet to be considered include:  How to ensure a smooth transition for individual customers through changes to the way tax is assessed and refunds are paid out.  When and how to ensure compliance with newly introduced requirements, such as payday reporting, or changed requirements, such as the lower electronic filing threshold. Inland Revenue is working through how best to manage transitioning customers through these changes. Any significant implications and potential trade-offs will be highlighted for Ministers to consider before decisions are finalised. The next steps in changing Inland Revenue’s organisation design are underway In confidence Page 10 Inland Revenue is creating a workforce with the right knowledge and capabilities to meet the needs of customers both now and in the future. This will be achieved by investing in the skills and capabilities of our people, and making changes to leadership and culture, decision making frameworks and delegations, workflows, structures and roles. Customer-facing functions have changed first. Three new business groups have been operating since 12 February 2018:  Customer and Compliance Services—Individuals  Customer and Compliance Services—Business  Information and Intelligence Services. New delegations, combined with broader roles, mean that customers are having their queries responded to more quickly. Devolved decision-making is already helping provide a better service to customers, with some queries being resolved in hours rather than weeks. Notwithstanding, there are challenges in meeting customer demand as noted earlier. The next steps in changing Inland Revenue’s organisation design are underway. Between April and August 2018, the Executive Leadership Team is working with a range of staff and experts on how Inland Revenue could best work in 2021/22. The focus is on the parts of the organisation that support the customer-facing functions. The Public Service Association, Taxpro and the National Union of Public Employees are being involved at key points, and have been invited to nominate members to take part in each stream of work. Inland Revenue will progressively transition to a new organisation design. Consultation and implementation of change processes will take place at different times for different groups. Transformation continues to be well managed and governed In confidence Page 11 Transformation is tracking to plan. Schedule and costs are tracking as expected. The first two releases were implemented on or ahead of time and under budget. Monitoring focuses on delivery progress and realisation of benefits. A set of time-bound lead and lag indicators, and case studies monitors progress in achieving the outcomes of transformation. Please refer to appendix 3 for current progress. Transformation remains inherently high risk. There is no doubt that transformation is complex and challenging. Inland Revenue is now operating two systems and the department’s risk profile has increased. It will remain high until the completion of transformation due to the need for old and new systems to co- exist. The most significant risks and their mitigation plans, and the risk profile for transformation are reported regularly to the Portfolio Governance Committee and to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue. As at June 2018, the risk profile for transformation remained amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in defined areas. Two new risks have been raised since the last update, relating to:  Validating payday filing information when it is received by Inland Revenue so that only correct information is accepted.  The complexity of the employer monthly schedule (EMS) solution. Until Release 3 is implemented, processing of the EMS will be split across FIRST and START. The most significant risks to transformation are actively managed. The table below shows the top three risks as at June 2018. Risk Mitigation Expected resolution Unisys support for FIRST ending in June 2021 The main mitigation is completing transformation as quickly as possible. This risk will only materialise for products still on FIRST in June 2021 and in addition there would need to be an incident where a service in FIRST could not be recovered. Inland Revenue is exploring all options for reducing the risk associated with mainframe support ending. Once this work has concluded by the end of 2018, the rating of this risk will improve. The complexity of the EMS The current process is to accept information when it is filed and check it later – which adds time and cost for both Inland Revenue and employers. In the future, all information will ideally be validated when it is received so that errors can be easily corrected by employers before they file it. Mitigations include assisting customers to get data right at source, managing exceptions, and working closely with the software industry and employers. The status of this risk will be reassessed by the end of 2018 as Inland Revenue firms up its approach to validating information as it is filed. Retaining people working on transformation To date, Inland Revenue has been successful in managing this risk. While there has been some attrition, this is not unexpected in a programme of this length. On-going Please refer to appendix 4 for a summary of the most significant risks for transformation as at June 2018. Transformation is recognised as a high risk initiative. Robust risk management approaches are in place, and the assurance programme forms an important part of management of risks. In confidence Page 12 One external assurance review has been completed since the last update in February 2018. In May 2018, KPMG’s seventh IQA and sixth TQA review (IQA7 / TQA6) was positive. Overall, KPMG rated transformation as amber. KPMG noted that “... the Programme continues to be well managed as it progresses towards both its short and long term goals”. KPMG note further that “Programme control remains good (indeed in many areas the Programme continues to be amongst the most effective we have seen)”. Three further external assurance reviews are scheduled before Release 3 goes live in April 2019:  An IQA 8 / TQA 7 mid-release review to be undertaken by KPMG in approximately August 2018.  An IQA 9 / TQA 8 readiness for go-live review to be undertaken by KPMG in approximately February 2019.  A Gateway 0 (strategic assessment) and 4 (readiness for service) review in approximately February 2019 Appendix 1 – Transformation roadmap In confidence Page 13 Appendix 2 – Release plan In confidence Page 14 Appendix 3 – Lead and lag indicators In confidence Page 15 The table below outlines progress as at 31 May 2018, except for the measures number of customers who find it easy to comply and system availability for customer-facing e-channels. These figures are as at 31 March 2018 and 30 April 2018 respectively. Please note that the information in this table is provisional only and will not be finalised until end-of-year reconciliations have been completed. An updated table containing audited numbers for the 2017-18 financial year will be included in the November 2018 Transformation Update, along with an early view of any figures for the 2018-19 year which are available. Outcome Measurement 2017-18 2023-24 target Actual As at June 2018 Target Easier for customers Increase in the number of GST customers using accounting software to manage their obligations: 18% 31/05/18 26% 85%  Number of customers (cumulative) 81,488 31/05/18 -  % of GST returns 13% 31/05/18 - Increase in the number of customers who find it easy to comply 82% 31/03/18 82% 90% Reduction in customer tax compliance burden (pa hours per SME) 10hrs 31/05/18 3hrs 18hrs Increase in system availability for customer facing eChannels 98.4% 30/04/18 99.2% 99.5% Customer outcomes achieved from information sharing and security of information Measured through case studies Economic benefit through reduction in customer tax compliance burden ($m) $50m 31/05/18 $30m $1,330m Cumulative additional Crown revenue to Government ($m) - - - $2,880m Reduced time and cost to implement policy Reduction in the time and cost to implement policy Measured through case studies Increase revenue system resilience as assessed by Inland Revenue Partial 31/05/18 Low High Inland Revenue is more efficient Administrative savings for IR ($m) $11m 31/05/18 $5m $495m Appendix 4 – Key transformation risks In confidence Page 16 Type of Risk Risk Name Current risk Residual risk Interdependencies There is a risk that FIRST (including its infrastructure and associated systems) may develop a fault post June 2021, which impacts Inland Revenue’s ability to collect tax and pay disbursements until the fault is resolved Extreme Very High Interdependencies There is a risk that the complexity of the Employer Monthly Schedule (EMS) solution leads to potential financial/customer implications. Very High High People There is a risk that the programme will not be able to retain the right people with the right skills at the right time. Very High High Stakeholders There is a risk that the benefits to the Crown, customers and Inland Revenue that were committed to Cabinet in the 2015 business case are not realised and/or are not realised within required timeframes. Very High High External Environment There is a risk that the scope, timing and priorities of transformation may change due to external factors. High High External Environment There is a risk that external decision-making takes longer than planned and timescales are extended. High High Interdependencies Payday filing submissions may not be of sufficient quality to enable straight through processing. High Medium Interdependencies There is a risk that an increase to the time, effort and complexity in completing operational business-as-usual tasks, manually, during co-existence will put at risk Inland Revenue’s ability to meet its agreed performance targets throughout the duration of transformation. High Low Stakeholders There is a risk of misalignment between the programme’s agreed scope, roadmap and delivery timeframes, and expectations on the programme to deliver all-of-government (AoG) capabilities, irrespective of whether they meet Inland Revenue’s requirements and are sufficiently mature. Medium Medium Stakeholders There is a risk that government loses confidence in Inland Revenue's ability to deliver transformation. Medium Medium People There is a risk that the programme will be unable to attract and source the right people with the right skills at the right time. Medium Medium Financial There is a risk that the contingency agreed by Cabinet as part of the business case funding approval is applied to fund other competing priorities/pressures, creating a risk of insufficient funding to complete delivery of transformation. Medium Medium Organisational Compliance There is a risk that the large amount of time transformation requires from business groups during the solution delivery (and other) phase significantly disrupts Inland Revenue’s business-as-usual activities.

Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. Stage 4 budget 6. Including transitional funding until 30 June 2022, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $254.0 million for operating expenditure and $90.3 million for capital expenditure. We are on track to come in on budget for Stage 4. 7. Transitional costs and the contingency have changed this month for operating expenditure. • On 5 May 2021, our Strategic Governance Board provisioned funding for transitional costs for business groups. • Contingency funding has increased slightly this month as a result of business groups not requiring all the funding set aside for the 2020/21 year. Recommended action 8. I recommend that you note the contents of this report.

This final release will move child support to new systems and processes and upgrade the online services all customers use and the START software our people use. 10. As at the date of this report, the release remains on track for the October 2021 go- live, dealing with the usual pressure points at this stage of a release of completing development, verification, and testing. Business system testing (making sure START works as expected) is slightly behind schedule and will overlap scaled business simulation testing (testing of key end-to-end processes). This decision was made prior to the closure of the Asteron building and has occurred in previous releases. It is not a cause for concern. Scaled business simulation testing began on 26 July 2021 as planned. 11. However, we now have the closure of the Asteron building to contend with, which has unfortunately come at a critical time for the release. Our delivery risk profile has significantly increased and we are seeing some early impacts on productivity. We have some challenges we need to address, particularly in the areas of software development and testing which benefit from teams working collaboratively. Both of these areas are on the critical path for the release. W hile we can work remotely effectively as we proved when we implemented Release 4 last year, we are at a very different point in the delivery cycle for this release compared to where we were last year. We still have development, testing and cutover activity to complete, whereas for R elease 4 we largely had just cutover activity to complete. 12. We are closely monitoring progress to ensure the critical path is maintained. Obtaining more accommodation in the Wellington CBD quickly is key. While we have secured some short-term office space, this is only a temporary solution and does not fully mitigate the risk to the release. We are using this space to rotate release-critical teams on a one week in the office and one week from home basis. 13. Data conversion is tracking to schedule, with conversions now including the full reconciliation process. A full reconciliation means matching the data extracted from our old system to the data converted to our new system to ensure everything has migrated correctly and that if there are any issues, we identify them and understand what we need to do to resolve them. 14. The first round of mock go-live testing (a dress rehearsal for go-live) was completed as planned on 16 July 2021, with a similar level of issues identified to the first mock go- lives for previous releases. The second round of mock go-live testing is scheduled to begin on 9 August 2021 and planning is underway. 15. On 22 July 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) approved the second checkpoint in our readiness assessment framework. The checkpoint results indicate that this release is on par or slightly better than Release 4 (the April 2020 release) was at the same point in time. Readying our people 16. Train the trainer sessions and the training pilot are now underway. Training will take place from August to November 2021 and will again be a mix of classroom sessions and online learning. 17. We are holding a number of “masterclasses ’’ for our people about the changes to online services. Five sessions in total are being held, with the sessions on navigation, look and feel, intermediaries, and individuals and families already completed. More than 320 people dialled into the first session, around 300 to the second, and just over 330 to the third. Feedback has been positive, and the sessions are available on demand for people to view. 5 IR2021/307: Transformation status update: July 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. Two further masterclasses are scheduled. On 12 August 2021, a masterclass about changes fo r micro, not for profit, and small to medium-sized businesses will be held. On 26 August 2021, the second masterclass about changes for significant enterprises, will be held. 19. We are again holding “deep-dive” sessions for our people, as we have for previous releases. Two sessions on the changes for child support customers were held during the month, with around 200 of our people dialling in to each. Readying our customers 20. We have begun directly contacting customers to let them know what the changes mean for them or those they represent. On 16 July 2021, we sent information to tax agents directing them to information on our website, including webinars. 21. During the month, we made a further three webinars available on our website: • Introduction to the myIR upgrade. This is for all audiences and introduces the changes to look, feel, and navigation in the new version of myIR. • Introduction to the new navigation in myIR. There are two webinars on this topic, one for businesses and individuals and one for tax intermediaries. This webinar goes into more detail about navigating in the new version of myIR. Other updates Independent quality assurance 22. Fieldwork for KPMG’s twelfth independent quality assurance and eleventh technical quality assurance (IQA 12/TQA 11) review has been completed. We expect to receive the draft report during August 2021. 23. The Gateway “4/0” review was completed on 23 July 2021. Reviewers rated the programme amber/green, which means “Successful delivery appears probable however constant attention will be needed to ensure risks do not materialise into major issues threatening delivery”. The review team sounded a note of caution about the Asteron building situation. They note that if this “ endures for more than a few weeks, there is the potential for productivity to be severely impeded and delivery confidence (mainly related to timing) of the next release could decrease rapidly”. The review team made six recommendations, three were rated “do now” or do by go-live and three were for us to consider. We will report the findings of the review in full to the Minister of Revenue shortly. Online services’ performance 24. We have identified a risk that our overnight batch processes may run longer into the business day (i.e. post 8am), and potentially have an impact on online performance. We have identified a number infrastructure changes that could help mitigate this. At this stage, due to the tight timeframe and high workload on the team, we have determined that the risk does not warrant making these changes prior to the October go-live. We will continue to monitor the situation and prepare to react if this becomes a material issue after go-live. Follow-up reports to our July 2021 Transformation Update 25. We are preparing two reports in response to questions asked when the Commissioner and I appeared before the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee on 8 July 2021 to discuss our July 2021 Transformation Update. The reports cover: • The investment made in analytical capabilities and how this supports a right from the start approach. 6 IR2021/307: Transformation status update: July 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • How we are working with other agencies to contribute to data management frameworks and standards and sharing our experiences. 26. We expect to provide these reports to the Minister of Revenue by mid-August 2021. Key risks and issues 27. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 28. Please note that the issues and risks in this report, and their respective ratings, were updated just prior to the closure of the Asteron building so do not reflect any impacts that may have. 29. We are monitoring one issue (a risk that has been realised) relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. The rating of this issue has improved from very high to high as we can continue to operate effectively when alert levels escalate. 30. As of Ju ly 2021, the programme has a total of 49 open risks 2 , of which 11 are reported to the PGC. 31. The status of four risks reported to the PGC, all related to decommissioning of our heritage systems, improved during the month. Three of the risks were reported as having an improved status last month (IR2021/243 refers) and have since improved further. 32. The current rating of the risk relating to delays in decommissioning the heritage business-to-business KiwiSaver solution by 30 June 2022 improved from very high to high. This risk is unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance) to occur as there is a contingency solution in place. A full risk assessment was approved by our Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (one of our governance bodies) on 15 July 2021. 33. The current rating of the risk relating to decommissioning our data warehouse (an application our staff use to analyse data) has improved from very high to high. This risk is unlikely to occur (a 3% to 10% chance) as it has largely been mitigated. 34. The residual 3 rating of the risk relating to delays in decommissioning SAP, which we use for our payroll solution, has improved from high to medium. The residual likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring) to rare (a less than 2% chance of occurring). The project to move our payroll solution to the cloud is now underway. 35. The residual rating of the risk relating to delays in decommissioning FIRST satellite functions (processes that are attached to our heritage core system FIRST) has improved from high to medium. The residual likelihood of this risk occurring has improved from unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance of occurring) to rare (a less than 2% chance of occurring). as we have begun work on the archiving solution for FIRST. 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 During July 2021, three programme risks were closed. The status of eight programme level risks improved. 3 The predicted level of risk once all proposed actions have been implemented. 7 IR2021/307: Transformation status update: July 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 36. The top three risks for transformation are: • Realising the benefits we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated. • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes. • Changes to the scope and timeframes of the programme resulting from external factors. Coming up in the next two months 37. Key activities over the next two months include: August 2021 • Complete a further readiness assessment checkpoint for child support and upgraded online services to assess if we are where we expect to be. • Complete the first round of scaled business simulation testing and begin the second round. • Complete the second mock go-live. September 2021 • Complete business system testing. • Complete the second round of scaled business simulation testing and begin the third round. • Complete the third mock go-live. • Complete a further readiness assessment checkpoint for child support and upgraded online services to assess if we are ready to begin cutover in October 2021.

We are in the usual high pressure phase of the release, iterating between design, build and verify, and testing the solution. Design, build, and verification are in the final stages and we are two-thirds of the way through business system testing (making sure START works as expected). We remain on track to meet the October go-live. 10. As reported (IR2020/228 refers), and as in prior releases, we expect to use some of the timeline contingency due to the complexity of the child support solution and work to simplify our online services. This will result in business systems testing overlapping with the first round of mock go-live (a dress rehearsal for go-live) and scaled business simulation testing (testing of key end-to-end business scenarios). 11. Data conversion is tracking to schedule, with a heightened focus on resolving any issues we find. Testing on converted “real” data has started, which is key to mitigating the risk of unexpected outcomes for child support customers after go-live (IR2020/180 refers). 12. Our first webinars for businesses and employers, individuals and families, and intermediaries will shortly be available on our webinar page: ird.govt.nz/bt-webinars. These webinars will provide an overview of the October 2021 changes. 13. Preparation of training and communications material for our people continues, alongside building child support content into Te Mātāwai (online help for our people who work with customers). 14. On 17 June 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) approved the first checkpoint in our readiness assessment framework. This is the framework we use to assess how ready customers, stakeholders, the wider business, and the programme are for an upcoming release. For each checkpoint we assess whether we are where we expected to be or not. There are three further checkpoints in the lead up to go-live. Other updates KiwiSaver default provider review 15. The outcome of the KiwiSaver default provider review will result in about 80% of members in default funds needing to be transferred, based on our current analysis. This equates to around 276,000 members and $3.4 billion of funds. 16. We held two workshops for scheme providers during the month – one for the existing, unsuccessful default providers, and the second for the newly appointed default providers – outlining our intended implementation approach and timeframes. No major concerns were raised by providers. 17. The high-level timeline we are working to is: • July 2021 – begin reconciliation of membership lists to minimise the chances of incorrectly transferring members or not transferring members when we should. • November 2021 – test the transfer process. • December 2021 to February 2022 - transfer members. 18. While members usually contact their scheme provider with any queries, we are expecting and planning for some members to contact us. 5 IR2021/243: Transformation status update: June 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Independent quality assurance 19. Fieldwork for KPMG’s twelfth independent quality assurance and eleventh technical quality assurance (IQA 12/TQA 11) review is scheduled to begin in July 2021. T his review will focus on readiness for the upcoming October release and will also review the progress of other work such as decommissioning and business transition and integration given the programme’s closure by mid-2022. 20. Fieldwork for a Gateway “4/0” review will also begin in mid-July 2021. The focus of the “4” review will be similar to the IQA 12/TQA 11 review. The “0” review is a broad, strategic review to confirm we are on track to deliver the intended outcomes. 21. We intend to report the outcomes of both reviews to you by September 2021. Resurgence support payment 22. We are working with the Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office to support activation of the Resurgence Support Payment. Key risks and issues 23. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 2 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 24. We are monitoring one issue (a risk that has been realised) relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 25. The issue previously reported to the PGC relating to the lack of resources in the security architecture 3 area has been closed. A Security Architect has been appointed and has already joined the team. 26. As at June 2021, the programme has a total of 52 open risks 4 , of which 11 are reported to the PGC. 27. The risk relating to a potential misalignment between the programme’s agreed scope, roadmap and delivery timeframes and expectations to deliver all -of -government capabilities was closed during the month. All mitigations have been completed and there is no longer a risk to the programme. 28. The status of four risks reported to the PGC, all related to decommissioning of our heritage systems, improved during the month. This is to be expected at this stage of the programme as we have completed analysis to a very detailed level and decommissioning is well underway. 29.

“Just be honest mate and pay your tax,” say tradies
===================================================

**30 September 2015**

A survey of Auckland tradespeople shows an Inland Revenue campaign highlighting cash jobs has hit home, with four in five believing they’ll get caught if they cheat on their taxes.

The survey of nearly 420 tradies followed an advertising campaign in Auckland during April and May, with the message that tradespeople need to declare all their income, including cash, “or risk everything”.

Inland Revenue’s Group Manager Investigations and Advice, Patrick Goggin, said the survey results show that the message that doing under-the-table jobs is a tax crime is getting through.

“There was a high level of awareness of the campaign, with nearly two-thirds of tradies recalling it and more than half considering it was relevant to all tradespeople. That’s a great result for what was only a trial campaign,” Mr Goggin said.

The survey showed more tradies agreed that if they cheat on their tax, it is likely they’ll get caught, when compared to a similar survey in 2012, he said.

“This year half of tradies agreed with that statement, compared to just over a third back in 2012. That shows tradespeople do realise Inland Revenue will take action if it finds out they’re not declaring all their income.”

Mr Goggin said while the majority of tradespeople “do the right thing” by paying their taxes, there’s a minority who are cheating the system and ripping off taxpayers.

“Unfortunately our survey found that in the Auckland region, there’s anecdotal evidence that up to a quarter of building and construction involves under the table work. If that’s true, that’s a lot of tax not being paid and that would have funded vital services we all benefit from such as schools, hospitals and social services.

“I think what’s encouraging though is that tradies are talking about their tax obligations with their mates in the industry and with their customers. And most are saying it’s no longer okay to do work for cash and not declaring it.

“Some of the comments they told us were: ‘About time IRD cracked down on it’, and ‘Just be honest mate, and pay your tax’. And more than three-quarters of respondents disagreed with the statement ‘I don’t think of tax cheating as a real crime’.”

Mr Goggin said although Inland Revenue had identified the building and construction industry as being a high risk for tax evasion, all levels of tax evasion from any industry were treated very seriously.

Keeping payments manageable (2023)
==================================

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue continues to take the approach that every payment or return missed by a customer is an opportunity for us to act early and resolve it. This aligns with a key tax belief we want New Zealanders to hold—that we’ll help people trying to do the right thing. 

Of the returns that customers filed, 96% were on time. 89% of the payments that customers made were paid on time. However, more customers missed payments this year. At 30 June 2023, 44,000 more customers had tax debt than in June 2022.  

Overdue general tax and Working for Families debt at the end of the year amounted to $5.8 billion, $957 million higher than in June 2022. Overdue student loan debt was 9.3% higher and debt owed on COVID-19 support products grew from $34 million last year to $104 million. 

On the other hand, child support debt fell 8%: There’s more here.

[Management of debt and unfiled returns](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/our-services/our-services-for-customers/management-of-debt-and-unfiled-returns)

These total amounts of overdue debt are point-in-time numbers, and most customers quickly resolve what they owe. However, we did see a slight decline in the resolution of new customer debt: 59% was resolved within 6 months compared to 62% in 2021–22. 

We have stayed focused on connecting with customers and stepping in to resolve issues early. 

Instalment arrangements, where customers pay debt over time, are a ‘workhorse’ in our approach to help customers manage their payments. 163,000 arrangements were set up this year, compared to 140,000 in 2021–22. 

Customers can set up an arrangement themselves online, and it’s one way we help people gain more control over their situation.

Customers who set up their own arrangement tended to stick to them more—63% of arrangements set up by customers themselves online were kept to compared to 48% of arrangements set up with our support.

As at 30 June 2023, there were 77,000 active arrangements for tax and student loan debt, covering $1.62 billion.

Re-engaging overseas-based student loan customers

Over the past couple of years, Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has taken a supportive approach with student loan customers. We wanted to keep borrowers engaged  even if they could not make a loan repayment.

As at June 2023, 94% of New Zealand-based customers and 26% of overseas-based borrowers were making required repayments.

In the second half of the year, we generated an extra $2.3 million in repayments by contacting 46,000 overseas-based customers and reaching out through social media.

Starting in April 2023, we have sent approximately 3,000 cases a month to third parties in Australia that can pursue collection, and recently 300 cases to a UK collector. Third-party collection is showing good results–it contributed $10 million of the overall $40 million in repayments made in the final 3 months of this year.

Tax relief a core tool

Another way to help customers overcome short-term issues is the Commissioner’s ability to offer tax relief in the form of writing off tax. Government allocates an amount for write-offs every year.

This year, 213,000 customers in difficult financial circumstances were granted a write-off. 

In response to COVID-19, we applied an indicator in our system in 2020 that identified around 400,000 businesses that qualified for relief from penalties and interest if they paid their core tax. This has prevented around $524.8 million in debt from going into the tax system since 2020. 

We have begun to retire use of this COVID-19 indicator for recovering businesses, although we continued to write off penalties and interest for those still affected this year.

When customers do not engage

Despite our efforts, a number of customers do not engage with us. This year, we contacted 2,850 customers with a notice of legal proceedings - these are customers with significant debt who have demonstrated insolvent behaviours. 

35% of those contacted settled their tax in full or through instalment arrangements or part-payments. Where appropriate, customers received a write-off. 

### Stepping up liquidations activity

40% of the 2,850 businesses we contacted took no action—a next step is to begin the liquidations process. We served over 1,000 statutory demands this year.. 

Liquidation is an essential role we play to stop unviable businesses from incurring more debt, support the trading community and ensure a level playing field for businesses that are meeting their tax obligations. 

Across the trading community, 1,929 businesses entered formal insolvency this year, compared to 1,347 in 2021–22. Approximately 75% of these customers had a tax debt.

We stay focused on risks

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue will keep using marketing and education to reach customers missing payments, and data to tailor approaches to help them. 

We’re having good success upskilling our people to be able to negotiate appropriate solutions with customers facing debt.

We also continue to liquidate unviable businesses, and focus on employer debt and the few customers with high-value debt.

As at 30 June 2023, GST debt accounts for 39% of overdue general tax and Working for Families debt. We are seeing the impacts of economic conditions on customers such as sole-traders and small-to-medium-sized businesses. Some have faced tough choices about who and when they pay. 

We are taking preventive measures to halt this growth.

*   $5.8 billion in general tax and Working for Families debt was overdue at 30 June 2023   
    *   2022: $4.8 billion
    *   2021: $4.4 billion.
*   As at 30 June 2023 524,000 customers had a tax payment that was overdue   
    *   315,000 customers owed less than $1,000.
*   $754 million of debt was written off or remitted this year   
    *   2022: $689 million.
*   $231 million of the $754 million written off was penalties and interest remitted for customers impacted by COVID-19.

Kiwifruit Psa-V issues and effects on growers - information for agents
======================================================================

General article 2012 discusses kiwifruit Psa-V orchard specific tax issues including the cost of removal of vines, replacement costs and the write off of licenses.

As at 28 February 2012, and updated on 7 December 2012 for the proposed amendments in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2012.

The following information discusses various kiwifruit Psa-V orchard specific tax issues in some detail. Each situation could be unique and we recommend that this be discussed as necessary with the appropriate Agent Account Manager. This discussion has been updated to reflect the proposals in the Bill. However it should be noted that these are not yet law.

#### Removal of vines

One of the orchardist's management options is to remove the kiwifruit vines, either by being pulled entirely or being cut off below the graft. Any associated tax book value of the vines and/or the grafts can be claimed as an expense in the year the vines or grafts are destroyed. This is the "default" treatment which applies except where the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule (refer section DO 6 and its associated sections) can and is applied.

The concessionary repairs and maintenance rule, by election, applies where less than 15% of an orchard of "listed horticultural plants" is replaced by "listed horticultural plants" over a three year period (but limited to a maximum of 7.5% per year). Where the election is made, the tax book value of the plants that were replaced is not deductible, but rather the replacement costs are deductible as repairs and maintenance. The tax book value of the original plants carries forwards as the tax book value of the replacement plants.

The replacement does not have to be like "listed horticultural plant" with like "listed horticultural plant". So, for example, kiwifruit could be replaced with say avocados.

If the election is not made the default treatment applies. The election is made by the orchardist including the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule deduction in their tax return. No separate notice is necessary.

Full details of the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule are contained in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17 No 1 - February 2005. The above is only a summary.

Currently, the actual costs of removal of the vine or the rootstock cannot be claimed because it's considered to be a capital expense that does not fall within the ambit of subpart DO. The Government has agreed to retrospectively change the law so that these costs will be deductible and this decision is reflected in the Bill.

If the vine is cut off below the graft and later it is decided to pull the rootstock any remaining tax book value of the rootstock is treated as above.

#### Replanting/re-grafting of kiwifruit

Where the default treatment described above applies, the costs of replanting or re-grafting a new variety of kiwifruit are capital costs that are amortisable (refer subpart DO).

Where the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule can and is applied, as is discussed above, the costs of replanting or re-grafting are deductible as repairs and maintenance.

#### Kiwifruit removed and another crop grown using existing orchard structures

The costs of removing the kiwifruit have been dealt with above.

Where the default treatment described above applies, the costs of the replacement crop are treated as a new crop for tax purposes. Thus consideration will need to be given as to whether the new crop is dealt with under subpart DO or not.

Where the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule can and is applied, as is discussed above, the costs of replanting or re-grafting are deductible as repairs and maintenance.

#### Kiwifruit and orchard structures removed and another crop grown

The costs of removing the kiwifruit have been dealt with above.

The tax book value of the structures is not deductible as it is considered to be a capital expenditure or loss and no explicit provision is made in subpart DO for a deduction. The Government has agreed to retrospectively change the law so that these costs will be deductible and this decision is reflected in the Bill.

Where the concessionary repairs and maintenance rule can and is applied, as is discussed above, the costs of replanting or re-grafting are deductible as repairs and maintenance.

Where the default treatment described above applies, the costs of the replacement crop are treated as a new crop for tax purposes. Thus consideration will need to be given as to whether the new crop is dealt with under subpart DO or not.

In this context, if the orchard is grassed then an immediate deduction is available if the expenditure is not incurred in the course of a "significant capital activity" (refer section DO 1(1)(g)). However, for example, if the only land owned is the orchard then it seems likely that the grass would be part of "a significant capital activity", being the removal of the orchard plants and infra-structure. If this is the case, the cost of the grass should be capitalised and amortised (refer section DO 4).

#### Write off of kiwifruit licenses

Over the last few years many growers have purchased licenses to grow varieties of kiwifruit. These are able to be amortised over a period of time - depending on the license PVR (Plant Variety Right) date. Given the Psa-V issues, these licences may now be worth a lot less or may even be worthless.

If the license was acquired from Zespri or a third party then on the face of it a deduction is available for any loss on sale provided the license was not used or available for use before 1 April 1993. Alternatively, if the taxpayer reasonably decides that the licence is worthless, a deduction for its tax book value as at the start of the income year that such a licence becomes worthless may be allowed.

If the license was acquired from an associated person, we recommend that you seek specific professional advice.

#### Receipt of financial assistance package

The taxation treatment of the receipt by a kiwifruit grower of financial assistance depends on the facts.

To the extent the receipt is for loss of income or profits it's taxable.

To the extent the receipt is related to a tax deductible expense or loss (e.g. of a capital asset where the write off is deductible) it is also likely to be taxable (refer section CG 4).

Except where the receipt is to subsidise the capital costs of replanting (see below), any vine or orchard infra-structure removal costs or any replanting costs are dealt with as discussed above, independently of the receipt of financial assistance.

If the receipt is to subsidise the capital costs of replanting, the "capital contribution" rules do not currently apply. This is because the capital costs of replanting do not result in "depreciable property". The Government has agreed to retrospectively change the law so that the “capital contribution” rules will apply and this decision is reflected in the Bill.

The tax impact of this will vary depending on individual situations but the general rules are as described above. However, each situation will be unique and we recommend that this be discussed with the appropriate Agent Account Manager.

[Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19 "Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007")

Kiwisaver amendments
====================

2007 enhancements to KiwiSaver include a tax credit for contributions paid by members of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund.

##### Sections CX 1B, KJ 1 to KJ 5 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; section 68C of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections 4, 6, 14, 25, 46, 56, 93 to 94, 128A, 209, 233 and clauses 12, 14 and 17 of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989; and the schedule to the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992.

The government announced a set of enhancements to KiwiSaver in Budget 2007.  The enhancements include a tax credit for contributions paid by members of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The Act also makes a number of technical amendments relating to KiwiSaver and the complying superannuation fund rules.

The Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill was also introduced into Parliament on 17 May 2007.  The bill introduced further Budget announcements, including the KiwiSaver employer tax credit and compulsory employer contributions.  The bill received its first reading on 17 May and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration.  It is expected to be enacted by the end of the year.

### Key features

#### Member tax credit

From 1 July 2007, people who contribute to a KiwiSaver scheme (or a complying superannuation fund)[1](#01)
 will be eligible for a member tax credit that matches the amount of their contribution to the scheme up to $1,042.86 a year ($20 a week).  The member tax credit applies to contributions received by the scheme in the member credit year (1 July to 30 June).

The tax credit will be available to employees, the self-employed and other people who are not employees, such as beneficiaries.  Employer contributions and contributions withdrawn under a mortgage diversion facility do not count for purposes of the member tax credit.

##### Eligibility for the member tax credit

The tax credit will be available to:

*   members of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund; and
*   who are 18 years of age and over; and
*   whose principal place of residence is in New Zealand; or
*   who are government employees who are living outside New Zealand; or
*   who are working overseas as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the Student Loan Act regulations.

A person's principal place of residence is considered to be the main (principal) place where the person resides or their main abode. That is, one's home or dwelling place - the place where one lives. "Home" is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as "the fixed residence of a family or household, one's own house, the dwelling in which one habitually lives or which one regards as one's proper abode".  In _Geothermal Energy Ltd v CIR_ \[1979\] 2 NZLR 324, Justice Beattie stated that "home" "...is simply the location of what for the present constitutes the centre of gravity of the domestic life of the taxpayer - the axis around which his domestic life revolves". This suggests that it is where the member normally lives.

**Example 1**  
On 2 July 2007, Kara begins working at the local bakery.  Kara is a New Zealand citizen and is 17 years old.  Because Kara is under 18 years of age, she is eligible to join KiwiSaver but is not entitled to the member tax credit. If Kara joins KiwiSaver she will receive the $1,000 kick-start contribution and the fee subsidy.

**Example 2**  
Graham is a 44-year old KiwiSaver member, who is married with three children and lives in Christchurch.  Graham gets seconded to Melbourne for three months and rents an apartment there for the duration of his secondment. Graham returns to Christchurch every second weekend and his family visits him in Melbourne for a week during his stay. As Graham's principal place of residence is in Christchurch with his wife and family, Graham is eligible for the member tax credit for any contributions he makes during this period.

In order for a member of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund to receive the total member tax credit of $1,042.86 a year, they must satisfy the eligibility criteria each day of the member tax credit year.

**Example 3**

Elaine joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2008, 91 days before the end of the member credit year (30 June 2008).  Elaine makes contributions to her KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $2,000.  To work out Elaine's member tax credit entitlement for the 2007-2008 member tax credit year the formula is:

Number of days Elaine has been a member of KiwiSaver during the member credit year divided by 365 multiplied by the lesser of either the:

*   amount of contributions Elaine has made to her KiwiSaver scheme during the member tax credit year; or
*   $1,042.86.

**91 divided by 365 multiplied by $1,042.86 equals $260**

**Example 4**  
Ian joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2008, 91 days before the end of the member tax credit year (30 June 2008). Ian makes contributions to his KiwiSaver scheme during this 91-day period totalling $900. Ian's member tax credit entitlement for the 2007-2008 member credit year is:

**91divided by 365 multiplied by $900 equals $224.38**

Members of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund will be ineligible for a member tax credit upon the date of eligibility for fund withdrawal from a KiwiSaver scheme.  That is, the later of:

*   reaching the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (currently 65); or
*   the date on which they have been a member of a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund for five years.

**Example 5**  
Anna joins KiwiSaver on 6 January 2008, the day of her 61st birthday.  Anna will be entitled to the member tax credit for the contributions she has made to her KiwiSaver account until 6 January 2013, the day on which she will have been a member for five years (that is, the date of eligibility to withdraw funds).

####   
**Payment of the member tax credit**

The superannuation provider will claim tax credits annually (on 30 June) on behalf of individual members.  However, it can also claim a part-year tax credit for those who stop being a member of KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund during the year.  When it receives the tax credit, the provider will apportion it across the investments the member has subscribed to or been allocated.  If the person involved is a member of both a KiwiSaver scheme and a complying superannuation fund (or a member of more than one complying superannuation fund), the amount of the credit will be apportioned between the schemes on the basis of the contributions made to each.

#### Withdrawal of the member tax credit

Withdrawal of the member tax credit will be permitted in the following circumstances:

*   the later of the date of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation (currently 65 years) or five years' membership in a KiwiSaver scheme;
*   in cases of serious illness; and
*   upon death, to the member's estate.

Withdrawal of the member tax credit will not be permitted in the following circumstances:

*   to assist with the purchase of a member's first home;
*   for purposes of significant financial hardship; or
*   to help with mortgage repayments (mortgage diversion).

If members permanently emigrate and withdraw their interest, the nominal value of the tax credit, up to the value of their accumulation in their scheme, will be repaid to the government.  There is no requirement to withdraw from a KiwiSaver scheme upon permanent emigration.

#### Treatment of tax credit for tax purposes

The member tax credit will be treated as excluded income for income tax purposes.  For GST purposes, it will be treated as a non-taxable grant or subsidy.

#### Miscellaneous amendments regarding the member tax credit

The Act makes associated amendments to the definition of "complying fund rules" in the Income Tax Act 2004 and to section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act (notification of transfers and requirement to transfer funds and information).  The purpose of the changes is to ensure that member tax information is transferred when a member transfers to another fund.

The Act incorporates the terms relating to the member tax credit into the KiwiSaver and complying superannuation fund trust deeds.  The amendment also ensures that the law relating to this tax credit applies despite anything to the contrary in the trust deed.

The Act provides a transitional measure in relation to prospectuses and investment statements issued before 1 July 2007, to ensure that they remain valid as a result of the new member tax credit.  The Act also amends the KiwiSaver Scheme rules in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act to reflect the member tax credit.

The Act amends the definition of "Crown contribution" to include the member tax credit.

#### Further KiwiSaver amendments

##### Employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes

From 1 July 2007, it will be mandatory for all employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme to be paid through Inland Revenue using the employer monthly schedule process. This requirement is to allow Inland Revenue to police the payment by employers of the proposed compulsory employer contribution.  The change is being made from 1 July 2007, to minimise compliance costs for employers in having to change systems from 1 April 2008, when the proposed compulsory employer contribution comes into force. Section 94 has been repealed as a result of this requirement.

##### Complying superannuation fund rules

The Act amends the definition of "complying fund rules" in the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act, to ensure that the rules for complying superannuation funds apply to superannuation schemes (or sections within schemes) that are defined contribution schemes in nature, as intended.

##### Government employees

The Act clarifies how the KiwiSaver Act applies to government employees who are serving outside New Zealand.  KiwiSaver will apply to them only if they are employed under New Zealand terms and conditions and if it is lawful to offer KiwiSaver membership in the jurisdiction they are serving in.  Furthermore, the amendment to section 14 will exclude government employees working overseas from the automatic enrolment rules.

The Act amends the definition of "permanent employees" in section 25 and section 46, to exclude employees who are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules.  As a result, employers will be:

*   eligible to be an exempt employer even though some employees who work overseas are not able to join; and
*   able to choose a KiwiSaver scheme to which all new permanent employees will be allocated, even though some new permanent employees who work overseas are not able to join.

A government department will not be excluded from being an exempt employer because they have some employees who are living overseas in a jurisdiction where offers of membership to KiwiSaver may be unlawful.

####  Application dates

The amendments relating to the member tax credit and employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes come into force on 1 July 2007. The amendments relating to government employees and the complying superannuation rules came into force on the date of enactment, 21 May 2007.

**1**A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Financial Markets Authority as having met certain criteria, such as those relating to KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability.

KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act 2015
==================================

KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act 2015 repeals the Crown's $1,000 one-off kick-start payment to new enrolments.

The KiwiSaver Budget Measures Bill was introduced under urgency on 21 May 2015, passing through all stages that same day. It received Royal assent on 27 May 2015, bringing into force the repeal of the Crown's $1,000 one-off kick-start payment to new enrolments as announced in Budget 2015.

The Act amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006.

### Repeal of the KiwiSaver kick-start payment

_Sections 223(4), 226(1), 226(3), 226(1B), 226(1C), 240 and Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006_

As part of Budget 2015, the $1,000 Crown contribution paid to all new KiwiSaver members (the kick-start) was repealed, effective from 2pm on 21 May.

#### Background

One objective of KiwiSaver is to boost the retirement savings of individuals who would otherwise not be in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement.

The KiwiSaver Act 2006 includes several subsidies to encourage additional savings but these subsidies are poorly targeted as the scheme is open to all New Zealand residents. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that members have simply shifted savings from one product to KiwiSaver, rather than made additional savings as a result of the subsidies. Removing the kick-start for new enrolments in KiwiSaver is intended to reduce the cost of the scheme and improve its value for money.

#### Key features

The main features of the new rules are as follows.

The kick-start is repealed from 2pm on 21 May 2015.

The requirement for providers to retain the kick-start when a member makes an early withdrawal for a first home has been replaced with a requirement to retain $1,000 in the member's account so that it remains open.

#### _Commissioner's discretion_

The Commissioner has discretion to determine when the three-month wait-period for paying the $1,000 KiwiSaver kick-start contribution begins.[1](#1)
 Whether this date is before or after the repeal of the kick-start determines eligibility.

Individuals can join KiwiSaver by:

*   being automatically enrolled when they start employment or opting in at any time via their employer _(employer enrolments)_; or
*   opting-in via their KiwiSaver provider _(provider enrolment)_.

Before enactment of the KiwiSaver Budget Measures Bill, enrolment under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 took effect on the earliest of the date the Commissioner received a person's first contribution or the date the Commissioner was notified or otherwise knew that the person had become a member of KiwiSaver.

In practice, this meant enrolment under the employment methods took effect when Inland Revenue received an enrolled person's first KiwiSaver deductions, and enrolment via a provider occurred when the individual's account was opened. Inland Revenue was required to pay the kick-start contribution as soon as practicable, three months after the person became a KiwiSaver member.

Under the new rules, eligibility for the kick-start turns on whether an individual was enrolled by 2pm on 21 May. However, there can be some uncertainty around the exact time and date when an individual has enrolled. To ensure everyone who is entitled to the kick-start receives it, the KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act provides the Commissioner with discretion to determine when the three-month wait-period for paying out the kick-start began.

As KiwiSaver, income tax and all other deductions made from an employee's pay are processed monthly via an Employer Monthly Schedule, section 226 has been amended, effective from 1 May, to ensure that the Commissioner's discretion applies to anyone who incurred their first KiwiSaver deductions in May.

#### _Non-compliance with financial markets legislation_

Under new section 240, KiwiSaver providers are not at risk of being in breach of securities law or the Fair Trading Act 1986 in relation to documents that had already been issued.

Prospectuses and investment statements issued by providers under the Securities Act 1978 will not have to reflect the changes made in the KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act 2015 if they were issued before 22 July 2015.

Product disclosure statements issued under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 will not have to be updated to reflect the changes made in the KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act 2015 until 22 July 2015.

Non-compliance with the Fair Trading Act 1986 is ignored to the extent that the non-compliance results from changes made in the KiwiSaver Budget Measures Act 2015 and does not continue on or after 22 July 2015. This ensures that advertisements that may refer to the kick-start are not immediately in breach of the Fair Trading Act 1986 after the kick-start's repeal.

#### Application dates

The new Commissioner's discretion came into force on 1 May 2015. The remaining changes came into force at 2pm on 21 May 2015.

1 The kick-start is not paid in the first three months to allow a member to choose to opt-out if they have been automatically enrolled, or to select a KiwiSaver scheme before the Commissioner allocates them to a default provider.

Kiwisaver - creditable membership
=================================

QB (Jul 2008) considers KiwiSaver, 'creditable membership' and eligibility for the member tax credit.

Answers to some questions we've received on "creditable membership" and eligibility for the member tax credit.

**Question**

What does the word "membership" in paragraph (a) of the definition of "creditable membership" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 mean?

**Answer**

As this has caused confusion, Inland Revenue has recently clarified its view that "membership" in paragraph (a) of the definition of "creditable membership" commences from the earlier of an account being opened by a provider for a member (in anticipation of securities being allotted) or securities allotting.

This interpretation will not change the position for members who are automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver - their creditable membership will commence in accordance with paragraph (b)(i) of the definition (as deductions will usually commence prior to their account being opened). This will mean however that for members who contract directly via a provider, their MTC eligibility will generally commence from when their provider opens up an account for them as opposed to when funds are first transferred to the provider.

Consider the following example:

*   Joe opts to join KiwiSaver via a provider on 5 January 2008 who opens an account for him. Joe makes no contributions at this time.
*   On 5 April 2008 Joe's $1,000 kick-start contribution is paid to his provider.
*   On 15 June 2008 Joe makes his first contribution of $3,000 to his provider.

Given Inland Revenue's interpretation of "membership" commencing from the date on which an account is opened for a member, Joe's eligibility for the member tax credit will commence from 5 January 2008. However, if Joe's provider had not opened an account for him in January, his eligibility for the member tax credit would have occurred (under paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of "creditable membership") from 1 April (the first of the month in which his $1,000 kick-start contribution was paid to his provider and thus an account opened).

**Question**

What does Inland Revenue's clarification of the word "membership" mean for members who joined KiwiSaver via a provider during the transitional period (1July 2007 to 30 September 2007) and made a contribution prior to 31 October 2007?

**Answer**

This interpretation has no impact on members who joined KiwiSaver during the transitional period and made a contribution prior to 31 October 2007. These members fall within the paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of "creditable membership". Accordingly, their eligibility for the member tax credit will commence from the earlier of:

*   the first of the month in which their KiwiSaver provider received a valid application for KiwiSaver membership from them, or
*   the first of the month in which their first contribution to KiwiSaver was received by their scheme provider or Inland Revenue.  
      
    

**Question**

What does Inland Revenue's clarification of the word "membership" mean for members who joined KiwiSaver via a provider during the transitional period (1July 2007 to 30 September 2007) but did not make their first contribution until after 31October 2007?

**Answer** 

The eligibility for the member tax credit for these members will commence from the earlier of:

*   the actual day that their KiwiSaver provider opened up an account for them, or
*   the first of the month in which their first contribution to KiwiSaver was received by their scheme provider or Inland Revenue.

KiwiSaver debt continues to fall
================================

**05 August 2016**

The amount of KiwiSaver employee deductions and employer contributions not passed on to Inland Revenue since the scheme began was just $24.9 million as at June 30 2016.

This is $4.45 million less than the rolling debt figure as at June 30 2015, a 15.2% reduction, and is a result of Inland Revenue’s successful ongoing debt recovery work programme.

KiwiSaver debt at June 30 2016 was made up of $12.32 million in employee contributions, $9.34 million in employer contributions, and $3.24 million in penalties and interest.

Employee contributions not passed on to IR by employers are guaranteed by the Government.

During the life of the KiwiSaver scheme, Inland Revenue has passed on $7.96 billion in employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. This means 99.87% of employer contributions have been passed on to KiwiSaver scheme providers.

KiwiSaver debt is a rolling total and includes employee and employer contributions not paid to IR over the life of the scheme, plus penalties and interest for non-payment. It remains less than 0.5% of the total Inland Revenue tax debt portfolio.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Rowan McArthur says the vast majority of employers do meet their return filing and payment responsibilities, and any employer who’s having trouble meeting their obligations is encouraged to get in touch with the agency as soon as possible.

“When employers don’t pass on the deductions they are required to, we will take action if we are unable to resolve the situation and implement a repayment plan.

“If an employer continues to be non-compliant, this could result in further action such as an application for liquidation, bankruptcy or prosecution.”

Recovery of unpaid amounts can also include placing deduction notices on other funds held by an employer; registering caveats and mortgages over properties; and obtaining personal guarantees or solicitors’ undertakings. 

**Key statistics:**

*   As at 30 June 2015 there were 15,242 employers with KiwiSaver debt
*   As at 30 June 2016 there were 11,241 employers with KiwiSaver debt, 4000 fewer than the previous year
*   As at 30 June 2015 there was $29.4 million in outstanding KiwiSaver debt, $4 million less than the previous year
*   As at 30 June 2016 there was $24.9 million in outstanding KiwiSaver debt, $4.5 million less than the previous year

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What

KiwiSaver deductions employers do for their KiwiSaver employees.

Who

Employers

When

Each time employees in KiwiSaver are paid their salary or wages.

Each time you pay salary or wages to an employee in a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund you deduct contributions from their pay. This deduction is your employee's contribution to their scheme.

KiwiSaver employee contribution rates
-------------------------------------

The rate you deduct employee contributions can be either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross pay. Your employee tells you which rate to use on their KiwiSaver deduction form – KS2.

If an employee does not choose a contribution rate, use the default rate of 3%.

How gross pay affects KiwiSaver employee deductions
---------------------------------------------------

You need to know what payments to include in gross pay for KiwiSaver or complying fund. It helps calculate your employee’s deduction and your contribution.

Calculating your KiwiSaver or complying fund contributions is different to other PAYE calculations.

When to start deducting KiwiSaver contributions
-----------------------------------------------

You start deducting KiwiSaver contributions for:

*   those employees you’ve automatically enrolled from their first pay
*   employees who've chosen to opt into KiwiSaver from their first pay after you’re notified. (That's notified by us or your employee.)

Not starting employee KiwiSaver deductions
------------------------------------------

If you have not started deductions for an employee, and they're not on a savings suspension, we'll let you know.

We'll let you know you must start deductions for employees:

*   you should've enrolled
*   who are already in KiwiSaver.

You do not need to backdate deductions for them.

We may penalise you if do not start deductions after we've notified you.

When to stop KiwiSaver deductions from employee pay
---------------------------------------------------

Stop deducting KiwiSaver contributions for an employee when they give you either a:

*   savings suspension notice approved by us
*   Non-deduction notice - KS51 (because they’re eligible to withdraw their savings).

Changing employee KiwiSaver deduction rates
-------------------------------------------

Employees can ask you to change their contribution rate in writing or by completing a KiwiSaver deduction form (KS2).

Alternatively, they can request a rate change by contacting their KiwiSaver provider or submitting a contribution rate change request to us through myIR. We will send you a letter with a list of contribution rate changes requested through scheme providers or myIR on a weekly basis.

They can only change their contribution rate once every 3 months unless you agree to a shorter timeframe.

Payments to retired employees
-----------------------------

Some ongoing payments you make to your retired employees are not counted as gross pay. This includes these periodic payments:

*   pension
*   retiring allowance
*   superannuation
*   other allowance or annuity relating to their past employment.

Employees with special circumstances
------------------------------------

There are situations that may affect an employee's deduction and your employer contributions. For example, injured employees or those on paid parental leave.

KiwiSaver end-payment date
==========================

2012 KiwiSaver amendments clarify contributions and withdrawals when a member reaches their end-payment date, and their funds are no longer locked-in.

_Sections 4, 22, 62, 112B and clauses 3 and 4 of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006_

Amendments have been made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to clarify aspects of contributions and withdrawals when a member reaches their end-payment date, and their KiwiSaver accumulated funds are no longer locked-in.

### Key features

*   The start date for employees who are enrolled in KiwiSaver by their employers is clarified to be the 15th of the month in which the employee's first KiwiSaver contribution is deducted, for the purposes of calculating the five-year minimum membership period before a member reaches their end payment date.
*   Employees who have reached their end payment date can cease having employee contributions deducted simply by providing their employer with a "non-deduction notice" to cease deductions. Employees who wish to continue contributing to KiwiSaver through direct employer deductions from their salary and wages can still do so.

### Detailed analysis

#### Membership start date

Under the standard withdrawal provisions, a member's KiwiSaver funds are locked in until the later of the date on which the member turns 65, or five years from the start of membership (the "5-year qualification date").

For members who join KiwiSaver by signing up directly with a provider, the date on which they become a KiwiSaver member is established when they sign up.

However, under the KiwiSaver Act employees can also join KiwiSaver via their employer, either by being automatically enrolled as a new employee or by giving their employer a deduction notice. For the purposes of determining when KiwiSaver membership started, the date on which the employee's KiwiSaver contributions began is the relevant factor. The changes to clause 4, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 clarify this position.

Clause 4 now provides for a "5-year qualification date" for members who enrol into KiwiSaver via their employer. This has been standardised to be calculated from the 15th day of the month in which the first employee contribution is deducted by the employer. This standardisation of the date to the 15th the month aligns with the date Inland Revenue currently treats KiwiSaver employee contributions as received for other purposes.

#### Employee contributions post end-payment date

KiwiSaver members who have reached their end-payment date may choose to remain in KiwiSaver. They may be able to access their accumulated funds by making partial withdrawals while keeping their KiwiSaver accounts open.

KiwiSaver members may also choose to continue to make contributions to KiwiSaver, although these contributions will no longer attract the Crown's annual contribution (member tax credit).

Members who are still employed may continue to have employee contributions deducted from their salary and wages.

However some members may choose to stop making regular employee contributions once they have reached their end-payment date, because they have access to their KiwiSaver funds. New section 112B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 enables these employees to give their employer a "non-deduction notice" directing their employer to cease to deduct employee contributions.

Employers should cease deducting employee contributions from the first payment of salary and wages after the non-deduction notice is received.

Employees may request their employers to start deducting employee contributions again at a later date, by providing a _KiwiSaver deduction notice (KS2)_. An employee cannot provide a KiwiSaver deduction notice within three months of asking their employer to cease deductions via a non-deduction notice, unless the employer agrees.

### Application date

The changes apply from 1 July 2012, being the earliest possible date on which members could reach their end-payment date.

Executive summary 1.1 Introduction This is the final report from the evaluation of KiwiSaver, undertaken between July 2007 and June 2014, a period of seven years. Over that time a substantial number of research and monitoring activities were undertaken resulting in a rich picture of KiwiSaver from its initial implementation through to early outcomes. The evaluation was a joint agency evaluation and, as such, it collected evidence from a range of perspectives. The primary legislative objectives of KiwiSaver are to:  encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of retirement similar to those in pre-retirement  increase individuals’ wellbeing and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits. This report brings the comprehensive information collected through this evaluation together in one place. Previously, this information has been reported in regular monitoring reports to the Minister of Finance and in stand-alone research reports. These reports are published on Inland Revenue’s website. The report also offers recommendations for any further research and/or evaluation of KiwiSaver. The purpose of this report is two-fold:  to provide evidence of the effectiveness of KiwiSaver, when considered against the objectives of the policy  to consider the effectiveness of the KiwiSaver evaluation and make recommendations for possible future evaluation and/or research into KiwiSaver. Note these recommendations do not assume further work will be undertaken. 1.2 Method This report was primarily developed through a desktop exercise, which involved reading all research and monitoring reports from across the seven years of the KiwiSaver evaluation. No additional analysis of any data collected during the KiwiSaver evaluation was undertaken for the purposes of this report. Readers are referred to these reports should they require more detail about the information presented here. This material has been collated under each of the five objectives of the KiwiSaver evaluation:  To assess the implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver to inform on-going development and services delivery (Section 4)  To monitor KiwiSaver usage to understand the scale and pattern of uptake (Section 5)  To assess whether the key features of KiwiSaver are generating expected outcomes (Section 6)  To determine the impact of KiwiSaver on individuals’ saving habits and asset accumulation (Section 7)  To determine the impact of KiwiSaver on superannuation markets and the financial sector (Section 8). In addition, members of the steering group were interviewed about the efficacy of the evaluation. This survey is reported in Appendix 10. 1.3 Report structure The report begins with a brief description of KiwiSaver and a summary of the design and method of the evaluation. Findings related to each of the objectives of the evaluation are then collated in Sections 4 to 8. Each section has a brief summary at the end. The final three sections of the report consider:  the value for money of KiwiSaver, including considerations of additionality, the extent to which the estimated target market has been reached, the impact on the accumulation of net wealth and the cost to the Crown of every dollar saved (Section 9)  the conclusions section brings together the key points from each of the previous sections of the report (Section 10)  the effectiveness of the evaluation and recommendations for future research and 2 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit evaluation activities are discussed in the final section (Section 11). The appendices contain a number of large data tables referred to in the report and copied from the relevant research/evaluation report. 1.4 Key findings 1.4.1 Implementation and delivery The following is a summary of findings reported in Section 4.0 of the report about the implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver as experienced by employers, providers and employees.  Both employers and providers interviewed/surveyed during the early years of KiwiSaver were generally supportive of KiwiSaver. They believed the implementation had been effectively managed. In particular, the engagement models used were seen as highly successful.  Employers reported the impact on their workload had been minimal. The average compliance cost for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in 2009 was $770. This decreased to $661 in 2013.  Few employers (18%) reported changing their remuneration practices as a result of KiwiSaver. Those who did applied a “salary sacrifice”. It is important to note that KiwiSaver can have complicated effects on wage rates which may not have been captured in this research.  The number of providers dropped from 54 in 2009 to 45 in 2013. Of these, four had assets of over $3 billion.  While it was reported that many employees found KiwiSaver an easy way to save money there were also difficulties. These were the 4% contribution rate in 2008, a concern that future governments might change KiwiSaver and the apparent inflexibility of the scheme. 1.4.2 Scale and patterns of uptake The following is a high-level summary of key points from Section 5 of the report.  By June 2013, the cumulative KiwiSaver membership had reached 2.15 million, equating to 53% of the eligible population. This was a net increase of over 1.4 million from the 716,637 members in June 2008.  Although membership continues to grow, the year- on-year increase in net membership has been steadily declining, with only a 9% increase in 2013 compared with 54% in 2009.  The proportion of members opting in has remained consistent over time (between 61% and 63%). Given the high proportion of members on wages or salaries it is likely these are individuals who have not changed jobs or who initially opted-out and then decided to join.  It appears that KiwiSaver knowledge is associated with income and the accumulation of assets. The more assets individuals have, the higher their level of knowledge about KiwiSaver.  Of respondents to the 2010 survey 21% were highly engaged with KiwiSaver, ie, they will have made informed decisions about whether to join, their provider and their investment type. There was a very strong correlation between levels of engagement and knowledge. 1.4.3 The efficacy of the key features of KiwiSaver KiwiSaver was designed to make:  KiwiSaver attractive to individuals  it easy for people to join  it hard to get savings out. It was aimed at encouraging members to firstly join and secondly to save. The data in this report suggests these incentives have been more successful at getting people to join KiwiSaver than promoting additional savings. Key findings related to the efficacy of the features as reported in Section 6 include the following:  KiwiSaver is providing an important platform for employees to save. The deductions of up to 56% of KiwiSaver members are being made at source from salary or wages.  The proportion of members opting in remains high compared with those auto-enrolled, reflecting active membership. Further, there is evidence to suggest increased engagement with KiwiSaver accounts when choosing providers and schemes.  In 2013, 58% of members who had KiwiSaver deductions taken from their salary and wages were contributing the 3% default rate. This reflects the importance of setting the default rate at an appropriate level.  There is a considerable group, 38% of all members in 2013, not making any contributions. This is larger than can be accounted for by contributions holidays; particularly when one considers that many on holidays do make voluntary contributions.  It has become less common for people to opt out. In 2013, for the first time, the number who had opted out had decreased after four years of rises. It should be noted that the percentage change had been decreasing over that time.  For those earning solely wages or salary the median contribution in 2013 was $859; for those earning 3 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit only non-salary or wage income the median was $1,040.  Administrative data shows that the number of members on long holidays (five years) continues to grow while the number on shorter holidays has decreased. There also appears to be a decrease in the number of members commencing a holiday.  The cost of the home ownership features is likely to increase as more members begin to access them. The proportion of residential sales drawing on First Home Deposit Subsidy support increased from 0.1% in July 2010 to 5.3% in December 2012 as more members became eligible to access the subsidy.  The main reason members gave for joining in the 2010 survey was that it was an easy way to save. The second reason was the contributions from the Crown and their employer. There is likely to be an interaction effect between these two reasons with the contributions also making it easy to save more. 1.4.4 Savings habits and asset accumulation Key findings related to the savings habits and asset accumulation of New Zealanders are summarised here. These are a snapshot rather than a detailed discussion of the long-term impact of KiwiSaver.  In 2010, using a flow measure of savings, the estimated level of “additionality” (ie, KiwiSaver contributions that were additional savings rather than substituting from other forms of saving) was 36%. This has not significantly changed in 2013.  In 2013, KiwiSaver contributions appear to have increasingly been made at the expense of paying off mortgage or other debt.  Higher levels of knowledge regarding KiwiSaver and more planning around retirement income were associated with higher incomes and higher net worth. This relates to findings in other sections, which suggest engagement is related to the value of savings and assets.  Of all respondents to the 2010 survey 53% thought their standard of living in retirement would stay the same, 27% expected it to decrease and 18% expected it to increase. KiwiSaver members were significantly more likely to report their standard of living would decrease than non-members.  The main retirement income source for both KiwiSaver households (44%) and non-KiwiSaver households (38%) was New Zealand Superannuation. The next most commonly reported main source for KiwiSaver households was KiwiSaver (25%) compared with income from the sale or rent of property for non-KiwiSaver households (22%).  Analysis of the 2010 survey0F 1 showed that 78% of respondents had an expected excess retirement income for meeting needs; 50% had an excess for being comfortable. There was no evidence that KiwiSaver membership was associated with any expected shortfall in retirement.  In a 2013 survey of early retirees withdrawing funds from KiwiSaver, 73% believed that their retirement income was either adequate or more than adequate. Only 16% did not have other savings and investments. For 42% of respondents these exceeded $100,000. The more savings they had in KiwiSaver, the more they were likely to also have other savings and investments.  The analysis of the linked KiwiSaver and Statistics New Zealand’s Survey of Family, Income and Employment (SoFIE) data set, for asset accumulation1F 2 found that KiwiSaver had not been successful in improving the accumulation of net wealth of its members. There was no evidence of a positive effect on net wealth accumulation from KiwiSaver for any subgroup when classified by gender, homeownership or income. The only group for whom there was a large positive effect was the one for those aged between 25 and 34. However, an independent review suggested some caution needed to be taken in considering these findings. 1.4.5 Superannuation markets and the financial sector There has not been a lot of work done in this area through the evaluation. The main study was undertaken in 2010.  The 2010 study concluded that KiwiSaver was providing a stimulus to the New Zealand financial sector and that it was a medium to long-term growth opportunity for the sector.  Since then more recent analysis2F 3 has shown that a significant proportion of KiwiSaver funds are invested overseas and relatively conservatively. The impact on the capital markets remains small.  As of March 2013, scheme providers held $16.6 billion in KiwiSaver schemes; an estimated 19% of the superannuation and managed funds market. 1.4.6 Value for money Value for money can be difficult to measure due to difficulties defining the target population for KiwiSaver and the limitations of using data from only the early stages of KiwiSaver. 1 Law, D, Meehan, L & Scobie, G (2011).

Observations on Reserve Bank’s Household Financial Assets 2003- 2013. Pension Briefing 2014-1. University of Auckland Business School 4 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  In 2013, KiwiSaver cost the Crown $677 million in contribution payments to members. This was a decrease from $1.5 billion in 2012 when the member tax credit was halved. Overall, in the first five years payments to members and employers have cost the Crown $5.3 billion.  In 2010 the KiwiSaver scheme appeared to be reaching about one third of the estimated target population. This implied that the ongoing cost of the scheme for each target member, based on one particular approach to estimating the target group, was around $4,000 per year.  A costs and benefit analysis shows that for the period 2007/08 to 2013/13, the additional savings amongst the estimated target group for each $ of government spending ranged from $0.20 to $0.38 as the level of government contributions dropped with fewer new enrolments and policy changes. The analysis also used a narrower target group which produced a lower value for money. Given the importance of the assumptions used, this analysis could produce different results (better value for money) if a wider definition of the target group was used. The costs to the Crown are reducing over time as membership growth slows. The reduction to the member tax credit in 2012 and the increase in the default contribution rate will have, at least partially, caused this. However, there is the potential for the First Home Deposit Subsidy to reverse this trend should the uptake increase significantly.  25% of the Crown subsidies were paid to the highest income quartile. The same group contributed more than 45% of the savings. 1.5 Conclusions This report has drawn together seven years of evaluative activity under the key objectives of the evaluation. It also includes a 2014 value for money study. With the exception of administrative data, much of the data reported was collected in the first 3.5 years of the implementation of KiwiSaver. That notwithstanding, the evaluation has provided a comprehensive picture of the implementation and early outcomes of KiwiSaver. It has been praised internationally as the most comprehensive evaluation of a retirement scheme undertakenP3F 4 P. Essentially KiwiSaver needs to be measured against its policy objectives, which were to:  encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a 4 Collard, S, & Moore, N (2009). Review of International Pension Reform. Research Report No 663. Department for Work and Pensions. Available from https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachmen t\_data/file/214434/rrep663.pdf position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement  increase individual’s well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement and to provide retirement benefits. Based on evidence collected across the first seven years of KiwiSaver, and in particular the first 3.5 years the success of KiwiSaver in achieving these is marginal at best. The features designed to attract individuals to the scheme have been successful in doing so. However, the extent to which it has attracted the estimated target market, as defined in the 2011 Treasury Working Paper, appears to be limited, with substantial leakage. Further, much of the savings accrued through KiwiSaver are the result of substitution from other forms of savings and debt reduction. There is evidence to suggest that in the short term KiwiSaver has not had a positive effect on the accumulation of the net wealth of its members when compared with non-members. There is also evidence to suggest that any accumulated wealth has come at a significant cost to the Crown through contributions. The cumulated cost-benefit analysis undertaken does suggest that this could be improving, albeit from a low base. Consideration needs to be given to the extent to which judgements of KiwiSaver based on data collected primarily in the first 3.5 years of its existence can be seen as anything other than short-term impacts. The question that remains is whether these outcomes are likely to be different in the future. What, for example, could the impact of KiwiSaver be for those who are only just entering the workforce and will be contributing for thirty plus years compared with those who withdrew their funds in 2013 and contributed for approximately five years? One could also question the impact of the global financial crisis on these findings. 5 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 1.6 Limitations There are a number of limitations to the data reported throughout this evaluation. These relate, amongst other things, to the timing of the evaluation and to the nature and size of the sample populations. More specifically the limitations include:  the self-reported nature of much of the data about retirement income expectations and living standards in retirement  the timeframe of the evaluation and its inability to do more than provide indications of early outcomes with regard to policy objectives. Key data were collected in 2010 or earlier, when KiwiSaver was 3.5 years old  the focus, in 2014, on early retirees who are likely to be an outlier group whose behaviour and experiences are not generalisable to those who will be in KiwiSaver for much longer prior to retirement  the difficulty of determining causality in a complex environment  the possible influence of other factors (eg, the global financial crisis) on the outcomes  the small sample sizes in some of the qualitative work. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 6 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 2. KiwiSaver: A brief introduction In this section a brief introduction to KiwiSaver is provided as a context for the evaluation and the findings reported subsequently. 2.1 The purpose of KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based savings scheme, designed to help people prepare for their retirement. It does, however, make provisions for the self-employed and children. The primary legislative objectives of KiwiSaver are to:  encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of retirement similar to those in pre-retirement  increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits. The policy drivers for the implementation of KiwiSaver were the perceived low levels of private saving for retirement and a concern that middle-income New Zealanders, in particular, were at risk of experiencing a substantial drop in their living standards during retirement. A Treasury study (Le, et al, 2007)P4F 5 P had shown that 20% of the population needed to save more for retirement. There were also fears that younger workers could have lower standards of living than current retirees and those approaching retirement. This was due to higher levels of personal debt from student loans, having children later in life and potentially fewer mortgage free homes (Kritszer, 2008)P5F 6 P. However, the prevalence of these policy drivers was questioned at the time. The extent to which these policy objectives have been met and whether KiwiSaver has provided value for money are discussed in the final sections of this report. This includes a consideration of the additionality of any savings in KiwiSaver accounts and the extent to which individuals within the target market have been reached. 5 Le, T, Scobie, G and Gibson, J (2007). Are Kiwis saving enough for retirement? Preliimary evidence from SOFIE. New Zealand Treasury. 6 Kritszer, B (2008). KiwiSaver: New Zealand’s new subsidized retirement savings plan. Social Security Bulletin, Vol 67, 4), pps 113– 119. 2.2 The mechanics of KiwiSaver The key mechanics, or design features, of KiwiSaver are described in Appendix 1. These include features related to KiwiSaver being a work-based scheme including the automatic-enrolment and opt-out features and the incentives to attract membership, such as the kick-start payment and member tax credit. Findings related to the effectiveness of these features as they have been implemented are provided in Section 6 of this report. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 7 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 3. The KiwiSaver evaluation 3.1 The evaluation strategy: Purpose, focus and scope The KiwiSaver Joint Evaluation Strategy (the Strategy)P6F 7 P was developed to cover the period from 2006/2007 through to 2012/2013. The purpose of the Strategy was to guide evaluation activities over the lifetime of the evaluation and to provide a common point of reference for the agencies involved. Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), The Treasury, the Commission for Financial Capability, the Financial Markets Authority, the Ministry of Social Development, Victoria University of Wellington and Statistics New Zealand provided input and/or were consulted during the development of the Strategy. They also provided representatives to the Steering Group, which was formed to oversee the comprehensive evaluation that was undertaken. The Strategy outlined the focus, purpose and scope of the evaluation. The focus of the evaluation was stated as being KiwiSaver, not the broader “savings” policy. The purpose of the evaluation was to establish whether and how KiwiSaver was addressing and meeting its policy objectives. The scope was defined by the statement of general policy and purpose in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 as well as methodological and practical considerations, such as a realistic timescale. It was recognised that it would be difficult to determine the extent to which KiwiSaver contributed directly to a range of indirect outcomes and to extend evaluation activities beyond the foreseeable future to look at longer term economic or financial outcomes. For these reasons the initial scope was:  to assess all process aspects of the implementation of KiwiSaver  to measure whether there had been a change in savings behaviour as a result of KiwiSaver. 7 The strategy can be accessed from: http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/research/report- ks/research-ks-joint-eval-strategy.html 3.2 Evaluation objectives The objectives of the KiwiSaver evaluation are listed below with the relevant sections of the report identified in brackets. 1. To assess the implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver to inform ongoing development and services delivery (Section 4) 2. To monitor KiwiSaver usage to understand the scale and pattern of uptake (Section 5) 3. To assess whether the key features of KiwiSaver are generating expected outcomes (Section 6) 4. To determine the impact of KiwiSaver on individuals’ saving habits and asset accumulation (Section 7) 5. To determine the impact of KiwiSaver on superannuation markets and the financial sector (Section 8). Key questions and indicators for each of these objectives are provided in the appendices to the Strategy. 3.3 Evaluation design The overall evaluation approach was to, where possible, embed the collection and extraction of evaluation information into the design of KiwiSaver. This was to be augmented with additional research activities as necessary. The rationale for this was to:  minimise research costs  minimise the imposition of survey work on provider, employers and individuals  establish long-term data collection . The evaluation of KiwiSaver commenced in the 2007/2008 financial year, with the final evaluation activities being undertaken at the end of the 2013/2014 financial year, one year later than anticipated. The initial six-year time frame for the evaluation was to take into account the early implementation of KiwiSaver, the roll- out of the home ownership assistance and the expectation that longer term trends and broader 8 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit impacts were unlikely to emerge until the end of the evaluation period. The evaluation was coordinated by Inland Revenue, but implemented by Inland Revenue, MBIE and the Treasury. A memorandum of understanding, regarding the use of KiwiSaver data, was signed by these agencies in 2011. 3.4 Evaluation method Data for the evaluation were collected through four different sources/methods: 1. The evaluation relied heavily on administrative data collected by Inland Revenue for monitoring membership and contributions trends. These data have been reported in the annual reports to the MinisterP7F 8 P. 2. Data from the SoFIEP8F 9 P–Inland Revenue linked data set (the linked data set) were used to gather more detailed information about membership demographics and the accumulation of net wealth. 3. A number of research activities were undertaken at different stages of the implementation of KiwiSaver. These included individual and panel surveys (face- to-face and telephone). Participant groups in these surveys included providers, employers and individuals (members and non-members). Stand- alone reports were developed and reported for much of this workP9F 10 P, which was generally contracted out to a research provider. These studies are listed in Appendix 2. 4. Specific analyses were undertaken of the wider data set by individual agencies, including MBIE, the Treasury and Inland Revenue. While MBIE focused on the housing incentives and supply side, the Treasury and Inland Revenue focused on value for money questions, additionality and the economic impacts of KiwiSaver. 3.5 Limitations to the evaluation There are a number of limitations to the KiwiSaver evaluation to date, which means some caution is needed when reading this report. These limitations are primarily related to the timing of the evaluation activities and the relatively short time period that KiwiSaver has been in existence. Many of these were noted when the evaluation was first planned. They have also been referred to in key reports. 8 These reports can be accessed at http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/research/report-ks/ 9 Survey of Family, Income and Employment 10 These reports can be accessed at http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/research/report-ks/ More specifically the key limitations include the following: 1. At the time of this report KiwiSaver had only been operational since 2007 (seven years). This is problematic in terms of measuring long-term economic impacts or the impact of KiwiSaver on retirement well-being. 2. Much of the evidence centres on analysis of the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set. These data were collected in the first 3.5 years of KiwiSaver. This also coincided with the first 3.5 years of the global financial crisis. 3. In 2013/2014, the first retirees to withdraw funds will only have been in the scheme for five years; those using it for first home purchases will only have had three years of savings. Neither of these groups could be seen as representative of the long- term impact of KiwiSaver on asset accumulation, or decumulation. Their experiences and behaviour will be influenced by the short time they’ve had to save. 4. The KiwiSaver policy objectives state that KiwiSaver is aimed at individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. This group is frequently referred to as the target market. However, no explicit, demographic definition of this group was provided at the beginning of the evaluation. As a result, evaluating the effectiveness of KiwiSaver in reaching the intended market has always been problematic. 5. Critical elements of the value for money analyses, related to the flow measurements, rely on respondents’ perceptions and self-reported data. These include the measure of additionality and the extent to which the target market has been reached and any subsequent leakage. 6. A number of factors influence well-being in retirement and the ability of individuals to save for their retirement. This makes it difficult to attribute any causality to KiwiSaver or to ascribe definitive reasons for respondent behaviours. KiwiSaver also has significant impacts on, and is influenced by, other outcomes that are of policy and public interest. These impacts include fiscal effects, effects on levels and forms of saving and investment, and on the financial sector, and redistributive effects that arise because the benefits and costs do not fall equally on all individuals. This broader context for KiwiSaver makes it difficult to evaluate its overall impact. Focusing too narrowly on its primary objectives can, potentially, ignore some of the other impacts of KiwiSaver. However, focusing too broadly will minimise the validity of any evaluation. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 9 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 4. The implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver 4.1 Introduction This section considers the first objective of the KiwiSaver evaluation, which was to: assess the implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver to inform ongoing development and services delivery. It summarises information related to the experiences of providers, employers and employees (KiwiSaver members) with regard to the implementation of KiwiSaver. Much of the information reported in this section was used to inform the ongoing development and delivery of KiwiSaver prior to 2010. As such its value today is limited to historical record. More recent evidence relates to the attitudes and behaviours of different stakeholders, in particular, members. Key findings that are pertinent in 2014 have been included in the separate summary report. Evidence for this section was collated from:  Inland Revenue administrative data  panel interviews in 2007 and 2008 of employers (n=63) and their employees (n=34)  interviews with 18 providers in 2007  a survey of 1,728 small and medium enterprise (SME) employers in 2009 about KiwiSaver compliance costs. This was repeated in 2013  a supplementary survey of 640 tax advisors was also undertaken regarding compliance costs  in 2010, a further 253 SME employers were surveyed as a follow-up to the 2009 survey. These were employers who had changed their approach to remuneration due to KiwiSaver and/or had a workplace superannuation scheme prior to 2007  the 2010 survey of 750 individuals comprising both KiwiSaver members and non-members  the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set (the linked data set)  the 2013 provider surveys (n=23) and interviews (n=11) undertaken as part of the early withdrawal research  the 2014 qualitative research for which 35 participants were interviewed (15 individuals, 15 employers and 5 providers). This is a very small sample size. Key findings from across these research activities have been collated under the respondent categories. 4.2 Employers 4.2.1 Support for KiwiSaver Overall, the employers interviewed in 2007 were supportive of KiwiSaver—believing a retirement savings plan was a good idea. However, across the 15 employers in the 2014 qualitative research a range of attitudes and behaviours towards contributing to KiwiSaver were found. These ranged from those that were openly supportive through to those who expressed a grudging acceptance that they had to comply. A key determinant appears to have been the perceived affordability of the contributions and the ability of their business to absorb any costs. 4.2.2 Impact on workload In 2007, employers on the panel reported that the impact on their workloads had been minimal and less than anticipated. The implementation had been straightforward for most and they reported understanding the employer guide and set-up processes. Larger enterprises reported more difficulties and spending more time on initial implementation than SMEs. This was seen as being due to their more complex human resources processes and payroll schemes. The business owner or a payroll/accounts administrator was generally responsible for KiwiSaver in SMEs, while larger enterprises reported employing a team of people to implement KiwiSaver. 4.2.3 Inland Revenue communications Inland Revenue’s employer-specific communications were seen as central to the successful implementation of KiwiSaver. The campaign had reached all respondent employers on the 2007 panel and there were very high levels of awareness around most of the communication materials. The majority of employers interviewed as part of the panel (81%) reported that Inland Revenue material was straightforward and easy to understand. A 10 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit similar proportion (82%) reported they had received the material in time. 4.2.4 Awareness of obligations In 2007, there was some variation in the extent to which employers reported being aware of their obligations. Most knew they had to check if new employees were eligible to join KiwiSaver and distribute KiwiSaver packs to both new and existing eligible employees. They also knew they had to deduct contributions and forward them to Inland Revenue with PAYE payments. However, there were lower levels of reported awareness with regard to sending details of new employees who had been automatically enrolled, acting upon an employee’s contributions holiday notice or the need to provide employees with an investment statement if they had an approved alternative scheme. There was also some confusion over the processes around auto-enrolment and opting out. This confusion had the potential to create conflict between employers and employees. In some instances, employers did not auto-enrol new employees as they had not realised it was mandatory to do so. The same group of participants was again interviewed in 2008. At that time they seemed more certain about how to meet their obligations and less concerned about operational issues. KiwiSaver had, reportedly, become part of their usual staff induction and payroll processes. They had also become more familiar with how KiwiSaver worked and most found it easy to include the compulsory employer contribution and employer tax credit in the PAYE process. 4.2.5 Compliance costs Compliance costs for KiwiSaver include the cost of administering KiwiSaver, the use of a tax advisor, learning about KiwiSaver and dealing with Inland Revenue. Both internal and external compliance costs were considered in detail in both 2009 and 2013 through the surveys of SMEs (Table 1). Table 1: Overall compliance costs for SMEs by business size in 2009 and 2013 2009 2013 Micro businesses (1–5 employees) $623 $654 Small businesses (6–19 employees) $743 $724 Medium businesses (20+ employees) $721 $645 Average cost regardless of size $770 $661 Source: 2009, 2014 survey data Other findings from these surveys are presented in Table 2. Of note is the marked drop in the average external costs. This is likely due to the embedding of KiwiSaver into payroll practices in 2013, meaning there is minimal requirement for a tax advisor to be involved. Table 2: KiwiSaver compliance costs 2009 2013 Average hours spent on internal processes 14.5 14.9 Percentage of time spent by business owners 70% 52% Percentage increase in payroll compliance costs 40–50% 50–60% Percentage of SMEs using a tax advisor for KiwiSaver 68% 20% Average external cost $49 $12 Source: 2009, 2013 survey data KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 11 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit In the 2014 qualitative research, it was reported that larger organisations tended to absorb the administration costs into their overall compliance activities. Smaller businesses reported that as long as their employee turnover was low and/or or the pay systems straightforward, the administrative costs were also low. This was because KiwiSaver could then be absorbed into overall PAYE administration. 4.2.6 Remuneration approaches Consideration of remuneration approaches was considered in a number of separate studies:  In 2007, the employers on the panel wondered about the implications of employer contributions on their future cost structures and the ability of their companies to offer pay rises.  In 2009, it was reported from the survey of employers that the introduction of KiwiSaver had led to changes in the approach to remuneration for only 18% of the businesses.  Responses were similar in the 2010 follow-up survey, when most employers (81%) reported not changing their remuneration practices.  Employers, in the 2010 survey of SMEs, who had made changes most commonly applied a “salary sacrifice”, which tended to negatively impact on the uptake of KiwiSaver. That is, they paid those on KiwiSaver less than those who were not. This was, reportedly, done for reasons of fairness.  Individual members interviewed in the 2014 qualitative research, tended to view their KiwiSaver contributions as “extra” money, not part of their salary or wage package. Many also said they had not explicitly negotiated their salary or wage taking KiwiSaver into account, although some were aware that recovery of costs is achieved by some employers through such discussions. 4.2.7 Employer contributions Findings related to employer contributions in the 2010 survey of SMEs included the following:  Most respondent employers (89%) reporting being able to absorb their contributions as an extra cost to the business.  The majority (81%) were contributing the minimum default rate of 2%.  The most common additional rate, for those who were contributing more than the default rate, was 2%.  These respondents did not report changing their additional contributions when the employer tax credit was removed. 4.2.8 Existing superannuation schemes In 2009, very few respondent businesses (2%) reported having an existing superannuation scheme prior to the introduction of KiwiSaver. For those who had schemes, the 2010 research findings suggested that KiwiSaver was complementing, rather than replacing or adversely affecting, existing registered workplace superannuation schemes. Of the 84 businesses, in the 2010 study, that had a scheme prior to 2007, most (71%) were still operating the scheme independently of KiwiSaver. In many instances, this was because the scheme offered employees unique benefits. These included higher employer contributions and being able to get a lump sum when they left. 4.2.9 Informing employee decisions Most employers (62%) surveyed in 2010 had not taken up the option of nominating a KiwiSaver scheme for employees to join if they did not choose their own. There was concern expressed by some employers that they would be morally responsible for the scheme’s performance if they did so. Similarly, the majority of employers surveyed (78%) did not make general information about managing money available to employees. However, when this information was available, in combination with extra contributions and no existing scheme, the uptake of KiwiSaver was greater than when it was not. This suggests that when employers are actively involved in promoting the retirement savings of their employees through KiwiSaver there is greater uptake. The concern for employers would seem to be the moral responsibility they then assume for their employees’ savings. 4.3 Providers 4.3.1 KiwiSaver schemes Since 2008, the number of KiwiSaver schemes has ranged from 54 in 2009 to 45 in 2013 (Figure 1), one less than in 2008. Of the 45 schemes in 2013, four had assets of over $1 billion at 30 June, with four having assets of less than $1 million. Just over half of the schemes (n=25) had assets of more than $50 million. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 12 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 1: Number of schemes over time Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 4.3.2 Engagement with Inland Revenue Providers interviewed in 2007 (n=18) were asked about the engagement model implemented by Inland Revenue during the early implementation of KiwiSaver. Key findings include the following:  Overall, they considered the model had been successful.  They viewed it as a new and innovative development on the part of Inland Revenue.  Larger providers reported being more satisfied than smaller ones.  Inland Revenue had been more flexible and consultative than they had expected.  They were particularly appreciative of the relationship manager positions and the forums, which were seen as informative and timely.  While there were some weaknesses identified, these were perceived as being due to the tight timeframes for implementation and a lack of relationship managers given the number of providers.  It was generally accepted that the engagement with the default providers was prioritised. 4.3.3 Communication with their members In 2013, Inland Revenue interviewed 11 providers as part of a study of the first withdrawals for retirement purposes. Amongst other things the providers were asked about communications with their members. Key findings include the following:  The providers reported using a range of methods including letters, email and telephone. Some also reported using social media, text and face-to-face meetings.  The default providers appeared to initiate communication with their members less frequently than others.  The majority of providers directly inform their members of their account balance yearly.  All providers were aware of the need to better target their communications and products to eligible members in the future as KiwiSaver balances grow. 4.3.4 Processes for withdrawal of funds As part of the survey (23 respondents) the 2013 provider research also considered the processes for withdrawing funds. Key findings include the following:  Most providers reported flexibility is allowed in the types and frequencies of withdrawals eligible members can make.  All providers allow members to withdraw their savings either partially or wholly as lump sums.  Nearly all (only four do not) also allow them to make regular withdrawals.  Most providers do not place a limit on the number of times members can make a partial lump sum withdrawal.  Most providers allow members to withdraw fortnightly.  The majority of providers allowing regular withdrawals allow this to occur monthly (17 out of 19). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 200820092010201120122013 13 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  Most providers place a limit on the minimum amount that can be withdrawn. 4.4 Employees (individuals) 4.4.1 The efficacy of the design features in promoting membership The early panel research, in 2007 and 2008, considered the extent to which a number of design features were working as intended. Later research in this area is reported in Section 6. Key findings included the following:  Employees were reportedly encouraged to join KiwiSaver because of the ease with which they could save and because they felt like they were getting “free money”.  However, those features designed to keep savings locked in until retirement had also, reportedly, proven to be a challenge for others. This was seen as being due to the apparent inflexibility of the scheme. This was particularly true in 2007, but less evident in 2008.  Further, a concern that future governments might change, or discontinue, KiwiSaver had, reportedly, led some existing employees to postpone joining the scheme. This was true in both 2007 and 2008.  In 2008, the 4% default contribution reportedly remained the main feature discouraging individuals from joining.  These employees did not believe they could afford this level of contribution. What is not clear is whether this was due to limited incomes, other competing life-stage priorities or other investments. This is worth noting, particularly if consideration is ever given to increasing contribution rates. While the features have encouraged people to join, there is less evidence to suggest they have promoted long-term savings behaviours or led to substantial additional savings (as discussed in subsequent sections). 4.4.2 Learning about KiwiSaver features In 2007 and 2008 members were, reportedly, more aware of the general features of KiwiSaver than the home ownership features. This was to be expected, as there had been no public awareness campaign about either the mortgage diversion optionP10F 11 P or the first home ownership incentives. The research in 2008 highlighted that there was still a need for financial education for both members and potential members. Some panel participants wanted guidance for members on how to choose a scheme 11 The mortgage diversion option was only available prior to 2009 and only where a provider agreed. provider and what information they should receive from their provider. More consideration was given in 2010 to the efficacy of the information strategies used to inform the general public about KiwiSaver and retirement savings.  KiwiSaver members were, firstly, asked whether they felt they had enough information to help them decide whether or not to join KiwiSaver. The majority of KiwiSaver members (80%) reported that they had.  Secondly, they were shown a card with visual illustrations of Sorted11F 12 information sources and asked if they had ever used Sorted information (such as the Sorted website, booklet and seminars) to help them make a decision about KiwiSaver. Around one in five (19%) KiwiSaver members used Sorted information to make a decision about KiwiSaver. The extent to which these respondents were actually knowledgeable about KiwiSaver is reported in section 5.5.2, which discusses the findings from the construction of a knowledge index. In this work it was found that 53% of KiwiSaver members had excellent levels of knowledgeP12F 13 P. 4.4.3 Making decisions about their investments In the 2010 survey of individuals, KiwiSaver members were asked about their provider and investment fund decisions. Both these actions were included in the construction of an engagement index, which is discussed in detail in section 5.5.3. 4.4.3.1 Choosing a provider Key findings from the 2010 survey of individuals related to choosing a provider include:  50% of members surveyed had chosen their own provider  27% had joined their employer’s chosen provider  27% had considered more than one provider. Of those who had chosen their own provider, 40% said they had considered what other providers could offer. This was a higher proportion than of those who had been allocated a default provider (17%) or chosen their employer’s provider (13%). This suggests there is a distinct delineation between active engagement and passive involvement through the default features. The most commonly reported determinants of choice, when selecting a provider, were related to perceptions of the financial security of the provider. These were 12 Sorted is an independent money guide website, providing a range of resources for New Zealanders. https://www.sorted.org.nz/?gclid=COyH1Zvkt78CFYQIvAodGK4ACw 13 Note this is a comparative measure not an exact one. 14 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit mentioned by 62% of KiwiSaver members who had been actively engaged in the process of choosing a provider. More specifically, KiwiSaver members reported looking for a:  provider with a good reputation, which may have included factors other than financial security  financially stable organisation  provider that offers the level of risk they are willing to take. Other reported determinants included:  familiarity with the provider  perceptions of financial advantage  recommendations by others  characteristics of the investment funds offered. 4.4.3.2 Choosing an investment fund When asked about their investment fund, 40% of KiwiSaver members in the 2010 survey of individuals did not know what type of investment fund they had. This group included relatively high proportions of:  young people  Māori and Pasifika people  single people  those with a combined income of up to $30,000. In this group of characteristics, lower incomes are often associated with the other three descriptors, suggesting income may be the key determinant. This could be related to the amount of money they have invested, or are able to invest. Of those who knew what type of investment fund they had, 39% had considered more than one type. This group had relatively high proportions of those who were:  employed full time  had a combined annual income of over $80,000  had postgraduate qualifications  had a greater knowledge of KiwiSaver. KiwiSaver members, in the 2010 survey, reported choosing different types of investment funds for a variety of reasons:  Of respondent members 68% gave a reason related to the expected risk and financial return of the investment.  The most important individual driver, and the factor that best helped people differentiate between funds, was getting the best long-term returns—33% said this was important.  Intolerance for short-term fluctuations was also evident, with 27% saying that lower risks of ups and downs in the short term was an important factor.  Not surprisingly, an individual’s attitude to risk was a key influencing factor on their choice of fund. 4.4.4 The withdrawal experience The 2013 early retirement survey asked respondents about their experiences in withdrawing funds. Key findings from the study include the following:  Almost all members (96%) were aware of their eligibility to withdraw funds.  This awareness came primarily from personal knowledge when they joined (55%) and through communications from their provider (35%).  Most (75%) found the withdrawal process easy. 4.5 Summary of key points The purpose of this section was to assess the implementation and delivery of KiwiSaver. Much of the data reported was collected prior to 2010 and informed the early implementation of KiwiSaver. Its value can be seen in the early changes made to both processes and the scheme design features. Key findings related to employers’ experiences of KiwiSaver during its initial implementation include the following:  Overall, employers interviewed in 2007 were supportive of KiwiSaver although various views were expressed in 2014. The key determinant of employer attitude appears to be the perceived affordability of the contributions.  In 2007, employers reported the impact on their workload had been minimal and less than anticipated.  Inland Revenue employer specific communications were seen as central to the successful implementation of KiwiSaver  By 2008, employers seemed largely aware of their obligations and not overly concerned about operational issues.  Across SMEs the average compliance cost in 2009 was $705. This decreased to $661 in 2013. External costs seem to have been the major area of reduction.  In 2010, 81% of employers interviewed said they had not changed their remuneration practices as a result of KiwiSaver. Those who had made changes most commonly reported applying a “salary sacrifice”. 15 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  In 2001, most employers (89%) reporting being able to absorb their employer contributions.  In 2009, very few respondent businesses (2%) reported having an existing superannuation scheme prior to KiwiSaver.  Concern was expressed amongst employers about either promoting a scheme with their employees or providing information. They appear to have been worried about being morally responsible for the performance of any scheme if they did so. Key findings related to providers’ experiences of KiwiSaver during its initial implementation include the following:  The number of providers dropped from 54 in 2009 to 45 in 2013.  In 2013, four schemes had assets of over $3 billion at 30 June. Just over half of the schemes had assets of more than $50 million.  Providers were satisfied with the early engagement with Inland Revenue, considering the communications strategy to have been successful.  A number of methods were used by providers to communicate with their members. All providers interviewed in 2013 reported a need to better target communications and products in the future. Key findings related to employee/individual experiences of KiwiSaver during its initial implementation include the following:  A key deterrent for individuals to join was a concern that future governments might change or discontinue KiwiSaver.  The 4% default contribution rate in 2008 was seen as unaffordable for a number of individuals and was reportedly the main reason they did not join.  The apparent inflexibility of the scheme also seen as a difficulty.  The main reason for joining KiwiSaver appears to be that it is seen as an easy way to save.  In 2010, the majority of KiwiSaver members (80%) reported they had enough information to help them decide whether to join or not.  Around 19% reported using Sorted. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 16 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 5. KiwiSaver usage: Scale and patterns of uptake 5.1 Introduction This section considers the second evaluation objective: to monitor KiwiSaver usage to understand the scale and pattern of uptake. To meet this objective, trend data related to membership and contributions are reported. These data provide evidence about the demographics of KiwiSaver members, the increase in membership over time and the amount of money being contributed by members. Contributions by the Crown and employers are discussed in Section 6 of the report, as they are key incentives to drive membership. There were three primary sources for data related to member and non-member demographics and characteristics. These were:  the 2010 survey of individuals (the 2010 survey)  Inland Revenue administrative data  the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set (linked data set) using waves 6 to 813F 14 of the SoFIE study from October 2007 to September 2010. The linked data set composes administrative data and data from a longitudinal study. As such it has been reported wherever possible, rather than the 2010 survey data. The sample sizes (weighted and unweighted) for the linked data set are provided in Table 3. These figures relate to all data reported in this section and referred to as being from the linked data set as well as the tables in Appendices 4, 5 and 6. 14 October 2007 to September 2010 KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 17 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 3: Sample sizes for the linked data set Unweighted (n) Weighted (n) KiwiSaver members 6,889 908,962 Never been a member 10,982 1,224,802 All persons 17,871 2,133,764 Source: 2009, 2014 survey data 5.2 KiwiSaver membership By June 2013, the cumulative KiwiSaver membership had reached 2.15 million (as reported in administrative data). This was a net increase of over 1.4 million (200% increase) from the 716,637 members in June 2008. The June 2013 number of members equated to 53% of the eligible population including:  32% of eligible children  72% of people aged between 18 and 24. 5.3 Enrolment trends Although membership numbers continue to grow, as shown in Figure 2, the year-on-year increase in net membership has been steadily declining, with only a 9% increase in 2013 (Table 4), possibly due to near saturation. Figure 2: Total net enrolments (cumulative) over time Source: Inland Revenue administrative data Table 4: Year-on-year increases in membership 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Cumulative total 716,637 1,100,540 1,459,942 1,755,932 1,966,444 2,146,843 Number change 383,903 359,402 295,990 210,512 180,399 Percentage change 54% 33% 20% 12% 9% Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 0 250,000 500,000 750,000 1,000,000 1,250,000 1,500,000 1,750,000 2,000,000 2,250,000 2,500,000 200820092010201120122013 KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 18 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Members can join KiwiSaver in three ways:  opting in through a provider  opting in through their employer  being auto-enrolled. Analysis of membership enrolments through administrative data over time (Figure 3) shows that:  the proportion of members opting in has remained relatively consistent over time (between 61% and 63%).  the proportion of members opting in through a provider has increased (38% in 2008 compared with 49% in 2013; reaching 50% in 2011 and 2012). Figure 3: Proportion of members joining KiwiSaver by enrolment method Source: Inland Revenue administrative data The number of individuals being auto-enrolled is influenced by the employment market, the number of people joining that market for the first time and the extent to which the market is fluid (ie, people are changing jobs). The number of individuals opting in is more difficult to explain, particularly given the consistency of the proportion over time. In 2008, one could have argued that the initial high proportion of opt-ins, relative to those auto-enrolling, would decrease. This is because individuals will continue to be automatically enrolled over time, either through being newly employed or changing employers for the first time. However, opting in is an active choice and the fact that KiwiSaver continues to attract additional members through this method is interesting. Given KiwiSaver has only been operational since July 2007, it is possible there remain significant numbers of people who have either not changed employers or did so when KiwiSaver was still new and, at that stage, opted-out. Based on the figures reported in section 6.2.1 about income sources, it appears that members who have opted-in are predominantly wage or salary earners who have not changed jobs, or initially opted-out than decided to opt-in. 5.4 Individual member demographics A substantial amount of work was undertaken to profile KiwiSaver members through the linked data set. These analyses are too detailed to include in any depth in this report. However, key tables from the report have been included in the appendices as a reference for those interested in considering this further.  Appendix 4 is a detailed summary of membership and non-membership profiles.  Appendix 5 summarises demographic profiles by membership status and enrolment type. The analyses included a comparison between KiwiSaver members and those who had never enrolled. Certain characteristics were found to be more common amongst members than amongst those who had never been enrolled. Those in the following demographic groups were more likely to be KiwiSaver members than not:  18–24 years old  university educated  partnered 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 200820092010201120122013 Auto enrolled Opt in via employer Opt in via provider 19 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  working in lower white-collar positions  working in retail, manufacturing, rental and health care industries  earning $30,000 or less. The following groups were more likely to never have joined KiwiSaver:  33–55 years old  no formal qualification  working in upper blue-collar positions  no employment income  ethnic minority groups with high earnings ($80,000 and above). 5.5 Behavioural characteristics of members In addition to demographic characteristics the behavioural characteristics of members were also considered in the 2010 survey of individuals. These were their:  attitude to financial risk  knowledge/awareness of KiwiSaver  engagement with KiwiSaver. 5.5.1 Risk taking Attitude towards risk was not found to be a defining characteristic for whether or not a person joined KiwiSaver. Survey respondents, whether KiwiSaver members or not, did not see themselves as risk takers:  47% of all respondents said they were average risk takers  43% of all respondents reported being low risk takers. Amongst both members and non-members, responses varied in terms of their willingness to accept more risk to achieve possible higher returns:  44% of members and 43% of non-members either disagreed or strongly disagreed that they were willing to accept more risk  non-members may be a little more risk averse, with members 12% strongly disagreeing compared to 7% of members. When this survey was undertaken, confidence in investment funds was generally low with many people having been financially hurt by the global financial crisis. This may have prevented some from joining KiwiSaver and influenced the extent to which they were willing to take risk. Conversely, KiwiSaver was perceived by many as a safe option through an erroneous belief that it was government guaranteed.P14F 15 P 5.5.2 Knowledge of KiwiSaver features As discussed subsequently, there are a number of features of the KiwiSaver policy that are designed to either make it easy to join or attractive to do so through incentives. For these to promote membership, individuals need to be aware of them. In the 2010 survey of individuals, respondents were asked about their awareness of the different features. Key findings related to levels of awareness across all respondents were:  92% knew about the kick-start  58% knew about the members tax credit  81% knew about the employer contributions  64% of potential new homebuyers knew about the first home withdrawal and 34% about the first home subsidy  71% of respondents were aware of nine out of sixteen listed features, a “good level of knowledge”  KiwiSaver members were more aware than non- members of the different features. In addition to their knowledge of individual features, each respondent was assigned a KiwiSaver “knowledge score”, ranging from 0 to 16. This score was based on the number of KiwiSaver features that each respondent reported being aware of. For analysis purposes, respondents were grouped into four segments based on their knowledge score. The question of what really constitutes a “good” level of knowledge was not determined. Using this index, it was found that KiwiSaver members’ knowledge of KiwiSaver is significantly higher than that of non-KiwiSaver members. The only level where the difference between members and non-members was not statistically significant was for those with “good” levels of knowledge. 15 A UMR national survey showed that 48% of KiwiSaver members surveyed thought their scheme had a government guarantee. This survey was undertaken in March 2010 and reported in The Press on 15 March. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 20 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 5: Percentage of each respondent group by level of reported knowledge Members Non-members Total sample Poor (0–4) 2 14 9 Reasonable (5–8) 13 23 19 Good (9–12) 32 33 32 Excellent (13–16) 53 31 39 Source: KiwiSaver Evaluation: Survey of Individuals, 37TUhttp://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/0/3/03e46600437177c5a25eb24e9c145ab7/ks-evaluation-individuals.pdfU37T While the direction of causality cannot be determined— does membership drive knowledge or knowledge drive membership—there is an obvious correlation between the two. The profiles of these different knowledge groups were also considered. Higher knowledge of KiwiSaver tended to be associated with:  larger proportions of 50–65 year olds  New Zealand Europeans  people with partners  homeowners  people with excellent or very good health  those with higher combined annual incomes and higher net worth  people with higher educational qualifications  those in full-time employment. Conversely, lower knowledge of KiwiSaver tends to be associated with larger proportions of:  18–29 year olds  Māori, Pacific and Asian peoples  single people  those who don’t own a home  those with less positive health  those with lower combined annual incomes  those with lower net worth  those with lower educational qualifications  those with lower levels of participation in paid employment. It appears that knowledge of KiwiSaver is related to income and the accumulation of assets. The direction of causality is difficult to determine and is likely to be two- way. The more money people earn and the more assets they are likely to have accumulated the greater the concern they may have about both the security of those assets and how they can be grown. 5.5.3 Engagement with KiwiSaver An engagement score from 0 to 6 was also constructed. Points were allocated based on the extent to which members had made an active or passive decision across different stages of the enrolment process and as members. These included, for example, how many providers they had considered, how many investment funds they had considered and whether they had changed their contribution rate. Table 6: Percentage of KiwiSaver members at each level of engagement Engagement Members % 0 (not engaged) 15 1 18 2 7 3 17 4 11 5 12 6 (highly engaged) 21 Source: Ibid KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 21 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit As is shown in Table 6, 21% of members were found to be highly engaged. This group made informed decisions about whether to join, their provider and their investment type. The 15% with a score of 0 made no decisions about their KiwiSaver. They will have been automatically enrolled and stayed with a default scheme. High levels of engagement with KiwiSaver tended to be associated with:  50 to 65 year olds  New Zealand Europeans  people with a partner  current homeowners  higher combined annual incomes (over $80,000)  higher net worth  higher educational qualifications (postgraduate university qualification)  self-employed people. Conversely, lower levels of engagement with KiwiSaver tended to be associated with:  higher proportions of 18–29 year olds  single people  those who do not own a home  lower combined annual incomes (especially under $30,000)  lower net worth (especially negative net worth)  lower educational qualifications (especially school qualifications). These findings suggest that, overall, levels of engagement with KiwiSaver were not high in 2010. At that time, these levels of engagement were seen as potentially being a consequence of the design features of KiwiSaver (auto enrolment, default providers). The thought then was that as savings grew, engagement would also increase. Evidence reported subsequently with regard to choosing and/or changing providers and schemes suggests this may be happening. There is a strong positive correlation between levels of engagement with KiwiSaver and knowledge of KiwiSaver. Only 33% of those with an engagement score of 0 or 1 have “excellent” knowledge of KiwiSaver compared to 54% of those with an engagement score of 2 to 4 and 72% with an engagement score of 5 or 6. This is also reflected in the similar demographics for these groups. 5.5.4 Attitudes of members towards savings In the 2014 qualitative research, where 10 KiwiSaver members and 5 non-members were interviewed, it was suggested that a variety of attitudes were driving behaviour. Some respondents were largely passive members of KiwiSaver making few, if any, decisions regarding their KiwiSaver accounts. Others were highly self-directed, confident and able to make their own decisions. A number of reasons were suggested in the report for why individuals might not have joined KiwiSaver. These included:  not being convinced that it was the right thing to do  not having sufficient, uncommitted, resources to save for their retirement  prioritising spending over saving. In the same research, it was suggested that life-stage and financial drivers are likely to “marry with KiwiSaver triggers and types of funds” and that that there is a potential for individuals to migrate from non- membership to membership. It was also suggested that attitudes and behaviours could change over time. These changes were seen as being driven by changes to an individual’s life-stage and/or circumstances, increased knowledge and/or confidence in either KiwiSaver or their own decision-making, or as the amount invested grows. 5.6 Summary of key points The purpose of this section was to report information related to the scale and pattern of uptake of KiwiSaver. Key findings include the following:  By June 2013, the cumulative KiwiSaver membership had reached 2.15 million, equating to 53% of the eligible population. This was a net increase of over 1.4 million from the 716,637 members in June 2008.  Although membership continues to grow, the year- on-year increase in net membership has been steadily declining with only a 9% increase in 2013 compared with 54% in 2009.  The proportion of members opting in has remained consistent over time (between 61% and 63%). Given the high proportion of members on wages or salaries it is likely these are individuals who have not changed jobs or who initially opted-out and then changed their minds.  From the 2010 survey it was found that attitude towards financial risk was not a defining characteristic for whether or not an individual joined KiwiSaver. Nearly half of members (44%) and non-members (43%) reported they either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that they 22 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit were willing to accept more risk to achieve possible higher returns.  Of respondents to the 2010 survey 71%were aware of 9 out of 16 KiwiSaver features. It appears that KiwiSaver knowledge is associated with income and the accumulation of assets. The more assets an individual has the higher their level of knowledge about KiwiSaver.  Of respondents to the 2010 survey 21% were highly engaged with KiwiSaver. That is they will have made informed decisions about whether to join, their provider and their investment type. There was a very strong correlation between levels of engagement and knowledge. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 23 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 6. The features of Kiwi Saver 6.1 Introduction This section considers the third evaluation objective: to assess whether the key features of KiwiSaver are generating expected outcomes. A brief description of each feature is included at the start of most sections. Appendix 1 also contains a description of each. Information presented in this section was drawn from:  administrative data  the 2010 survey of individuals (the 2010 survey)  the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set (the linked data set). The features have been grouped into the following three categories: 1. Those that make it easy to join KiwiSaver:  being administered by employers  automatic enrolment when changing employers  deductions made at source  default contribution rate  default KiwiSaver scheme 2. Those that make it hard to get savings out of KiwiSaver before the age of 65:  limited opportunity to opt-out  locked-in savings 3. Those that make it attractive (incentives):  kick-start payment  member tax credit  ability to withdraw savings towards a first home mortgage and first home deposit subsidy  contributions holidays  employer contribution. A number of changes have been made to these KiwiSaver features since it was first introduced. These are summarised in chronological order in Appendix 3. 6.2 Making it easy to join 6.2.1 Kiwi-Saver as a work-based scheme As a work-based scheme KiwiSaver is designed to enable members to make contributions through salary or wage deductions, minimising the effort required. It is also designed to include employer contributions. This means:  the scheme is essentially administered by employers  individuals are automatically enrolled when they begin any new employment (unless already members)  deductions are made at source. The impact of KiwiSaver being a work-based scheme can be seen in the income sources of members (Figure 4):P 15F 16  the majority of KiwiSaver members (55%) earn a salary and/or wage only  a further 19% earn a salary and/or wage plus other income  for up to 56% of KiwiSaver members their deductions will be made at source  only 4% of members’ incomes come solely from non-wage or salary sources Those with no income sources are likely to be predominantly children or young adults, signed up by parents or other family. 16 These figures are from Inland Revenue administrative data KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 24 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 4: Number of members by source of income (2013 annual report) Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.2.2 Automatic enrolment All individuals who start a new job, whether a first job or through changing employers, are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. If they do not wish to belong they must opt-out between two and eight weeks after their auto- enrolment. In June 2013, 39% of members had been auto-enrolled compared with 61% who had opted-in through a provider or their employer (Figure 3). This has remained consistent since 2009 with the number auto-enrolled each year ranging from 37% to 39% of the cumulative total for the year. The linked data set was used to compare the demographic characteristics dependent on how individuals had enrolled. Compared to other enrolment methods, KiwiSaver members who were automatically enrolled have relatively high proportions of being:  single and young (18–24 years old)  Māori and Pacific islander  secondary school educated  in lower white-collar positions  in employment earning $30,000 dollars or less. KiwiSaver members who opted in through a provider have relatively higher proportions of being:  55 plus  Asian  middle-aged female  self-employed  in receipt of interest and investment  beneficiaries  unemployed. Those who opted-in through the employer have higher proportions of being:  35–55 years old  European  university educated  in upper white-collar positions  in employment earning between $30,000 and $80,000. 6.2.3 Choosing a KiwiSaver scheme Members can choose their own KiwiSaver provider, join one that has been nominated by their employer, or be allocated to a default scheme by Inland Revenue. As with auto-enrolment, the default scheme feature is designed to make it easy for members. It removes the necessity to make decisions unless they wish to. It also minimises the need for financial knowledge. Both of these can have unintended consequences in terms of the levels of engagement and knowledge of individuals with regard to their KiwiSaver accounts. Administrative data were used to directly compare whether members have made an active choice, or were allocated to a scheme by either Inland Revenue or their employer over time (Figure 5). 0 200,000 400,000 600,000 800,000 1,000,000 1,200,000 1,400,000 Salary/wage onlySalary/wage + other Other onlyNo income 25 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Highlighted is the extent to which members have chosen their own scheme. Points to note include:  those in an employer-nominated scheme decreased slightly from 13% in 2008 to 9% since 2011  the proportion of those choosing their own scheme has been gradually increasing from 49% in 2008 to 67% in 2013. In 2008, 38% of members were in a default scheme compared with 25% in 2013. Figure 5: Percentage of all members by means of choosing a scheme Source: Inland Revenue administrative data Analysis of the linked data set showed that, in 2010, the method by which an individual was enrolled largely determined the choice of scheme (Table 7). In the next section the extent to which members change schemes once enrolled is discussed. Table 7: Enrolment method and scheme choice (percentage) Enrolment type % Method of choosing scheme % Active Default Employer Opt-in via provider 39.4 98.2 1.0 0.2 Opt-in via employer 22.1 10.2 70.1 19.5 Auto-enrolled 38.6 1.7 74.2 23.9 Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.2.4 Changing schemes (providers) Members who have been automatically enrolled can transfer schemes (providers) within a three-month provisional holding period. Members can also elect to change schemes at any point during their membership. In the 2010 survey KiwiSaver members were asked whether they had ever changed providers. The same question was considered in the analysis of the linked data set. The majority of member respondents to the 2010 survey (90%) had not changed their provider. Those who had changed provider were more likely to have chosen their provider in the first place; again suggesting there is a group of members who are very actively engaged, compared with some who do not take a strong interest 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 200820092010201120122013 Active choice Employer Default 26 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit in their funds. Further detail is given on levels of engagement in section 5.5.3. Analysis of the linked data set also showed that, in 2010, only a few members had changed schemes. The demographic profile of KiwiSaver members who had changed schemes was considered in the analysis of the linked data set. Appendix 6 provides details of the results of this analysis. More recent administrative data shows that increasing numbers of members are choosing to change schemes (Figure 6). This suggests increasing engagement with retirement savings by individuals. Key points to note include the following:  In 2013, the number of members who had transferred schemes was 136,167.  This was an increase of 24% (26,117 members) over 2012 numbers. This was after a decrease in the number of transfers since 2010.  With the exception of 2008, the majority of transfers occur outside the holding period.  The number of transfers peak in March and May each year. This could indicate a link to the tax year; people are likely to be engaged in financial decisions at this time of the year when completing tax returns. There is a marked increase between 2009 and 2010. This is followed by a decline for three years before a noticeable increase between 2012 and 2013. Figure 6: Number of members transferring schemes Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.2.5 Default contribution rates There is a minimum default rate for KiwiSaver. This is the rate individual contributions are set at when they are deducted at source. Individuals can also choose to set their deductions at a higher rate. The contribution rate is an area of KiwiSaver that has undergone multiple changes. When KiwiSaver was first introduced, the minimum contribution from salary or wages was 4%, this decreased to 2% in 2009 before being raised to 3% in April 2013. This is the default rate. Currently, members on wages or salaries can also choose to contribute 4% or 8%. Other options such as lump sum payments or regular payments for those not on a wage or salary will be determined by their scheme provider. As Figure 7 clearly shows, the default, or minimum rate, has been the most common, over time, whether 2% or 3%:  41% of all members were paying the default rate in 2010, when it was 2%  58% are paying the default rate of 3% in 2013  the proportion of members contributing 4% has decreased from 55% in 2010 to 36% in 2013. The decrease in those paying 4% does not appear related to the change to 3% as the main decrease was between 2010 and 2011. Rather it may be related to concerns over the economy at the time and individual perceptions of what was affordable. 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 160,000 200820092010201120122013 Holding period Standard KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 27 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 7: Proportion of members contributing each rate by year Source: Inland Revenue administrative data In the 2010 survey only 15% of KiwiSaver members who made contributions directly from a salary or wage reported making a change to their contribution rate since joining KiwiSaver:  3% had increased their rate  12% had decreased their rate  3% had made additional contributions. Of the 1,000 early retirement withdrawal respondents surveyed in 2013:  81% contributed at the minimum 4% rate when they joined  6% reported they decreased their contributions to 2% in 2009 when the minimum rate dropped. This supports the view that most members, deducting at source, remain on the minimum default rate. It also explains why there was still a relatively large proportion contributing at 4% in 2010. However, it must be remembered that this group would all have been approaching 60 when they joined and are likely to be an outlier group based on a very bounded set of demographic characteristics. Overall, the findings reported here highlight the importance of the default rate. To achieve the goals of the policy regarding providing for people in retirement the default rate needs to be matched to member’s needs and aspirations for retirement, without being so high that they find it too difficult to maintain, or too low for them to achieve their goals. 6.2.6 Contribution amounts While the minimum contribution rate is clearly an important factor in determining the amount of savings achieved through KiwiSaver it is also important to consider how much has been saved. During the analysis of the linked data set, cumulative contributions over time were analysed. Appendix 7 summarises the mean and median levels of cumulated contributions for a cohort of members who joined KiwiSaver during wave 6 through to the end of wave 8P16F 17 P. Key findings from this analysis were as follows:  Members who opted-in through an employer had the largest mean value of total contributions.  There is a direct correlation between income and contributions.  Males generally have a higher mean value of contribution than females.  The value of contributions peaks at 45–55 years of age.  Compared to contributions made by other ethnic groups Māori cumulate the least.  Members who earn salaries and wages contribute the most. There is a group of KiwiSaver members who are not contributing to their accounts (Table 8). This group is larger than that on contribution holidays alone and, as reported subsequently (section 6.4.3), many of those on contributions holidays do make voluntary contributions. These members could be children who were joined by their parents or self-employed individuals. They could also be members who were in a salary or wage position but are no longer employed in that manner. 17 October 2007 to September 2010 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 2010201120122013 8% 4% 3% 2% KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 28 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 8: Percentage of KiwiSaver members not contributing to their accounts Year Proportion of KiwiSaver members not contributing (all ages) Proportion of Kiwisaver members not contributing (18+) 30 June 2010 35% 22% 30 June 2011 37% 24% 30 June 2012 37% 26% 30 June 2013 38% 27% Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.3 Locked-in features Two design features of KiwiSaver are aimed at locking in members’ savings once they have been enrolled. These are a limited opportunity to opt-out and the limited opportunities to withdraw savings until members are 65. As discussed in the earlier research, in the past these features have acted as difficulties for some. 6.3.1 Optingout of KiwiSaver The first of the features aimed at making it difficult for individuals to get savings out of KiwiSaver is the need to actively opt-out within eight weeks of starting a new job. This feature ensures people join KiwiSaver, ie, membership is the default position. Their contributions, and those of their employer, begin the day they start work. Choosing to opt-out is an active process. Appendix 5 provides demographic information about members who have opted-out. It shows that compared to those who had never been KiwiSaver members, those who had opted-out have relatively high proportions of individuals who are:  18–34 years old  university educated  earning $30,000 or less in employment  working in lower level positions. This is very similar to the demographic of those who are auto-enrolled. In the 2010 survey of individuals, the main reasons respondents gave for opting out were:  affordability (32%)  the belief that there were better financial alternatives (30%). These were similar reasons to those provided in the early employer panel research in 2007/2008. Over time, those opting out have fallen as a proportion of those being auto-enrolled (Figure 8). Figure 8: Percentage of those auto-enrolled that opt out Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 200820092010201120122013 KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 29 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit In 2013, the cumulative number of individuals who had opted-out of KiwiSaver, and remained out, was 249,872. This was the first time the cumulative number who had opted-out had decreased after four years of rises. However, the percentage increase had been declining over time (Table 9). Table 9: Year-on-year increases in numbers opting out 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Cumulative total 137,762 221,045 245,898 249,549 255,935 249,872 Number change 83,283 24,853 3,651 6,386 –6,063 Percentage change 60% 11% 1% 3% -2% Source: Inland Revenue administrative data Whatever the underlying reason for the decreases reported here, one could argue the auto-enrolled/opt- out feature is now more effective than it was in the early days of KiwiSaver. The one word of caution here is the increase in those taking longer holidays and those not making contributions. This could well be affordability and short-term prioritising of funds. 6.3.2 Locked-in savings KiwiSaver contributions are generally locked-in until members are 65. Provided they have been a member for a minimum of five years they can then withdraw all or part of their savings. If the provider agrees, they can also make regular withdrawals at this time. Members can only make early withdrawals for the following reasons: 1. buying their first home provided he or she has been a member for three years and the home is for them to live in. The first withdrawals under this facility started in 2010 2. significant financial hardship 3. moving overseas permanently (excluding emigration to Australia)P17F 18 P. 4. serious illness or permanent disability affecting their ability to work. In June 2013, the cumulative number of individuals who had closed their accounts was 71,720. This was more than double the 2012 number (32,227). This was largely due to the first KiwiSaver members being able to close their accounts for retirement purposes (Figure 9). 18 KiwiSaver members emigrating to Australia can elect to have their funds (including their member tax credits) transferred to an Australian Superannuation Scheme. They cannot withdraw their funds. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 30 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 9: Cumulative number of individuals closing their accounts Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.3.3 Withdrawal for retirement Between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013, 73,992 members became eligible to withdraw their savings for retirement purposes. This was the first cohort of members able to do so. Of these 28,549 (39%) did so, with the majority making full withdrawals. In the first year of KiwiSaver a larger proportion of those aged 60 plus joined compared to later years. Consequently, there were over 25,000 members eligible to withdraw their funds in July/August 2012 compared to the 6,000 in July/August 2013 (Table 10). In 2013, two pieces of research were undertaken regarding the withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds for retirement using this group of early retirees:  a telephone survey of 1,000 eligible KiwiSaver members.  an online survey (n=25) and interviews (n=11) with KiwiSaver providers. In considering the findings from these pieces of research, it is important to remember their generalisability is limited. The early retirees are essentially outliers as they are a very specific group of people. They only had a limited period of membership and typically had small amounts accumulated in KiwiSaver. Their withdrawal behaviour may be quite different from retirees who, in the longer term will have larger amounts to withdraw. Those who joined KiwiSaver shortly before retirement may also be different from those who joined at much younger ages. The early retirees are likely to have other retirement plans and would have been nearing the end of their working careers. Joining KiwiSaver was likely to have been a deliberate decision to increase their retirement funds through the incentives. 6.3.4 The funds available to early retirees As evidenced in Table 10, the first groups able to withdraw funds from KiwiSaver had limited savings:  in 2012 66% had less than $15,000 saved  in 2013 69% had less than $15,000 saved  in both years just over a third had between $10,000 and $15,000 saved (39% and 35%). 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 80000 200820092010201120122013 Retirement withdrawls Other withdrawls KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 31 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 10: Members eligible to withdraw funds in July/August of each year by estimated total contribution funds Estimated savings ($) 2012 2013 n % n % 1,000 117 <1 180 3 1001–5000 1,507 6 771 12 5001–10,000 3,694 21 1,185 19 10,001–15,000 11,359 39 2,209 35 15,001–20,000 4,278 17 834 13 20,001–25,000 2,102 8 492 8 25,001–30,000 1,021 4 233 4 30,001–35,000 551 2 139 2 35,000+ 843 3 249 4 Total 25,472 100 6,292 100 Source: Inland Revenue administrative data 6.3.5 The withdrawal behaviour of the early retirees The withdrawal behaviour of this early group of retirees was studied in the 2013 early withdrawal research. Key findings include:  36% of the sample had withdrawn all of their savings  57% had not withdrawn any of their savings  7% had made a partial withdrawal. This withdrawal behaviour was found to be strongly correlated with the value of their KiwiSaver accounts (Table 11):  Those with balances up to $15,000 were likely to have withdrawn their entire savings.  Those with balances over $15,000 were more likely to have withdrawn none of their savings. The group most likely to have withdrawn some of their savings were those with more than $30,000.

These findings were supported by the survey of providers, undertaken at the same time, where it was reported that only a few members were making partial withdrawals and even fewer were making regular withdrawals. The providers did suggest that this was likely to change over time as KiwiSaver balances grew. Respondents to the 2013 survey were also asked when they intended to have fully withdrawn their KiwiSaver funds. As Table 12shows:  36% had already done so  36% intended to do so within the next five years  11% intended to do so in more than five years.

Table 13: Year-on-year increases in the proportion of individuals withdrawing funds for reasons other than retirement 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Cumulative number 1,044 8,240 13,656 25,559 32,337 43,171 Additional number 7,196 5,416 11,903 6,668 10,944 Percentage increase 689% 66% 87% 26% 34% Source: Inland Revenue administrative data KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 33 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 6.4 Making KiwiSaver attractive There are a number of features built into KiwiSaver to make it more attractive for individuals to join. These include the contributions from the Crown and employers. Two other features designed to make KiwiSaver more attractive, and lessen the severity of the locked-in savings, are the ability to withdraw funds for a first home and the contributions holiday. A further incentive is the First Home Deposit Subsidy (FDS). 6.4.1 Employer contributions One of the incentives of KiwiSaver, and a feature of it being a work-based scheme, is the employer contribution. Employer contributions were one of the reasons given for joining KiwiSaver by 56% of respondent members to the 2010 survey of individuals; it was the most important reason for 5%. Key findings related to this feature include the following:  Over the year to June 2013, Inland Revenue passed $833 million in employer contributions to scheme providers for investment in their employees’ accounts.  Over the first five years of KiwiSaver employers contributed $3.5 billion to KiwiSaver accounts.  Most employers (81%) contribute the minimum 3% of the salary or wages of their employees. 6.4.2 Crown contributions The Crown contributes to KiwiSaver accounts in two ways:  the kick-start payment of $1,000  the annual member tax credit. An annual member tax credit (MTC) is paid to members 18 years or older until they are eligible to withdraw their savings for retirement purposes. To receive the maximum annual MTC payment members must have been a member for a full 12-month period and contributed at least $1042.86 to their account. The maximum amount of the MTC was decreased in 2011 from $1042.86 to $521.43. Employer contributions and government contributions do not count towards the eligibility for this credit. Along with the employer contributions these are the two main incentives for individuals to join KiwiSaver. In the 2010 survey, 67% of respondents said these incentives were a reason for joining; with 19% saying they were the most important reason. Key findings related to these incentives include the following:  In the 2012 year, $455 million in MTC payments was made to 1,232,453 members.  Less than half of these members (45%, n=556,652) received the maximum amount.  This proportion remained stable from 2009 through to 2012.  The median annual contribution rate for members earning solely wages or salary was $859 in 2013.  For those earning only non-salary or wage income the median contribution was $1040. The explanation for this low percentage of eligible members receiving the full tax credit appears to be related to the default contribution rate. A full-time worker on the minimum wage would have contributed approximately $936. This would be insufficient to receive the full credit. Part-time workers would be even less likely to reach the threshold. That the median contribution for non-salary or wage members is close to the amount required to achieve the full tax credit suggests many of these members are contributing to maximise the value of the MTC they receive. 6.4.3 Contributions holidays Another feature designed to make KiwiSaver more attractive to potential members is the opportunity to take contributions holidays. Members who have been making contributions for 12 months or more can take a contributions holiday of between three months and five years. Early holidays (before 12 months) are considered only in the case of financial hardship. In the 2010 survey, contributions holidays were a reason for joining KiwiSaver for 12% of members, with 9% of respondents saying they were the most important reason. As at June 2013, 127,974 members had taken a contributions holiday since the initiative began. Of these 101,145 were on holiday at that time. Of note from Table 14 and Table 15:  the number on a hardship holiday has steadily declined  the number on an ordinary holiday has steadily increased. This is likely due to the cumulative effect of those on holidays for more than one year  the annual percentage increase is actually decreasing. This suggests fewer new people taking a holiday over time  most have only taken one holiday. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 34 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 14: Number of members on a contributions holiday (years ended 30 June) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Ordinary 25,112 45,069 63,324 83,151 101,141 Hardship 3,820 813 494 383 219 274 Total 3,280 25,935 45,563 63,707 83,370 101,145 Number increase 22,655 19,628 18,144 19,663 17,775 Percentage increase 691% 76% 40% 31% 21% Source: Inland Revenue administrative data Table 15: Number of contributions holidays taken by members (June 2013) Holidays (n) Number % 1 111,172 87 2 10,374 8 3 3,756 3 4+ 2,132 2 Total 127,974 100 Source: Inland Revenue administrative data Administrative data show that the number of people on long holidays (five years) continues to increase, while the number on short holidays (up to one year) has decreased. In the analysis of the linked data set consideration was given to the demographics of those on contributions holidays at the time (Appendix 8). The analysis showed that:  the income distribution of those on contributions holidays was generally consistent with the income distribution of KiwiSaver members  the gender distribution was also consistent with that of KiwiSaver members  76% of those on a contributions holiday were aged between 18 and 44, with many of them aged between 25 and 34. Members on a holiday can make voluntary contributions. Administrative data, reported in June 2011, showed that most had made contributions during that time. This would suggest that financial reasons are driving the decision to take a holiday. It may be these members do not feel they can afford the regular contributions from their salaries or wages. A contributions holiday would be one way of controlling their contributions. Key findings from the 2010 survey with regard to those on contributions holidays include the following:  46% of those who had taken a holiday did so due to financial hardship related to employment factors  75% of those who had taken a holiday had experienced a major life change in the last 12 months compared to only 57% who had not taken a holiday  20% of those who had taken a holiday described their health as only “fair” or “poor” compared with 5% of those who had not. 6.4.4 Purchasing a home KiwiSaver, while essentially a retirement income scheme, also aims to enable New Zealanders to accumulate more assets. Given the extent to which home ownership can be seen as not only an investment for retirement but also important for wellbeing, there are two homeowner features built into the design of KiwiSaver. These are: 1. the first home deposit subsidy (FDS). The FDS is $1,000 for each year an individual has been contributing to KiwiSaver, up to a maximum of $5,000. Couples can receive a combined subsidy of $10,000. To receive the subsidy members must 35 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit have been contributing at the default rate for at least three years. 2. the first home withdrawal (FHW). Through the FHW members can withdraw all their savings (with the exception of the Crown contributions) to purchase their first home. Again they must have been a member for three years and be going to live in the purchased house. The objective of these features is to assist members to enter home ownership by helping them overcome the barrier of not having sufficient funds to purchase a first home. Both became operational in July 2010 when the first members were eligible to withdraw funds. In the 2010 survey, it was found that these incentives were a reason for joining for 24% of members; with 10% saying they were the most important reason. Housing- specific research undertaken by the Department of Building and Housing (now Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment or MBIE) showed that a number of people joined KiwiSaver specifically for the first-home buyers package. Housing subsidies could have an important impact on Crown costs moving forward. As the proportion of younger members increases through automatic enrolment it is likely the use of these subsidies will also increase. In addition, from 1 April 2015 the subsidy available for first home buyers who purchase newly built homes will double. 6.4.4.1 Intentions to use the features In the 2010 survey of individuals, KiwiSaver members who were aware of the deposit subsidy were asked how likely they would be to apply for a home deposit subsidy. Their responses suggest usage will increase over time. Key findings include the following:  72% of KiwiSaver members who were aware of the feature said they were either “very likely” or “quite likely” to apply for a subsidy.  over a quarter (28%) intended to apply within two years of its introduction  four in 10 (42%) intended to apply within five years and 24% sometime after 2015  it was also found that 56% of those who were aware of the first home deposit subsidy were likely to buy a home in the next five years compared to 38% of those who were not aware of this feature. Reasons for disinterest in using either feature primarily related to greater importance being placed on retirement savings (28%) and financial constraints (22%) than on home ownership. 6.4.4.2 Uptake of the features A study of the uptake of the homeownership features, using administrative data, was completed in 2013 by the MBIE. It showed there has been an increase in the use of these features since 2010. This increase is most likely a reflection of the growing number of people who have become eligible to use these features. It may also reflect rising house prices and the, well documented, difficulties faced by first-home buyers in some regions. The study showed that, as at December 2012:  more than 11,000 withdrawals for first homes had been made  there were more than 5,800 recipients of the deposit subsidy18F 19  the highest users of both components were younger people (under 35 years)  the proportion of residential sales drawing on FDS support increased from 0.1% in July 2010 to 5.3% in December 2012. In the study it was found that:  most applications for the FDS were from two or more people and were to purchase a first home  three quarters of these sought the minimum subsidy of three years  half of the applications were for houses under $300,000  of the applicants, almost three-quarters were New Zealand European  most applicants had an annual income of between $30,000 and $60,000  the highest proportion of approvals was for the Auckland region  prior to applying, most had already been saving for a deposit and they applied because they needed extra funds  for over half of those who received a deposit subsidy the extra funds were essential to being able to purchase a home. 19 Not everyone who withdraws qualifies for a subsidy as well as there are both income limits for the applicants and price caps on the home. 36 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 6.5 The overall efficacy of KiwiSaver features In the 2010 survey, KiwiSaver members were asked why they had joined KiwiSaver. They could give more than one reason but also had to indicate the most important reason. Their responses provide some indication of the efficacy of these incentives. A similar question was asked in the 2013 survey about the early withdrawals for retirement. Findings from the 2010 survey include the following:  The most commonly reported reasons for joining were the Crown and employer contributions. Combined, these were mentioned by 77% of respondents.  A similar proportion (75%) reported that KiwiSaver was a means of saving for retirement.  Saving for retirement was the most commonly reported ”most important reason”; designated as such by 46% of respondents compared with 29% of respondents who said the contributions were. What is important to note here is that most respondents reported joining KiwiSaver because it was a good way to save. The incentives played a part in their decisions but were not the most important reason they joined. A word of caution though—it is not possible to determine the extent to which the incentives are part of why KiwiSaver is a good way to save. There could well be an interaction effect and the incentives are the primary reason. In the 2010 survey, the main reasons given for not joining KiwiSaver were:  affordability (32% of non-member respondents)  other investment opportunities being better (30%)  they had not got around to it (28%). Respondents to the 2013 survey were also asked why they had joined KiwiSaver. In considering these responses it is important to remember the very limited demographic of this group, particularly in reference to any comparison with the 2010 survey results. The reasons they gave were as follows:  47% reported the contributions were the main reason for joining  40% said KiwiSaver was a good and easy way to save  31% said it was a way to secure income for retirement. 6.6 Summary of key points The purpose of this section was to consider the extent to which the key features of KiwiSaver were generating expected outcomes. Points to note from this section include the following:  The majority of KiwiSaver contributions are made by employees. For up to 56% of KiwiSaver members their deductions are being made at source from salary or wages.  Interestingly, the proportion of members who are auto-enrolled is comparatively low (39% in 2013) compared with those who opt-in (61%). This proportion has remained consistent. Given how many members earn salaries or wages it would seem that a relatively high proportion of people either have not changed jobs, or initially opted-out and have since changed their minds about membership.  There is evidence to suggest increased engagement with KiwiSaver accounts. The proportion of those choosing their own scheme has been gradually increasing from 49% in 2008 to 67% in 2013. In addition, in 2008, 38% of members were in a default scheme compared with 25% in 2013. Finally, there has been a marked increase in the number of members transferring schemes. In 2013, 136,167 members did so. This was 24% more than in 2012.  The default contribution rate has remained the most common over time. In 2010, when it was 2%, 41% of members were contributing it. In 2013, 58% of members who had KiwiSaver deductions taken from their salary and wages were contributing the default rate of 3%. Of note is that the initial 4% default rate was reportedly considered unaffordable by some and a challenge to joining. This highlights the importance of the default rate and setting it at a rate that enables sufficient savings without being so high that many perceive it as unaffordable.  There is a large group of KiwiSaver members who are not making contributions in 2013 (38% of members). This is larger than can be accounted for by contributions holidays, particularly when one considers that many on holidays do make voluntary contributions.  It appears the auto-enrol/opt-out feature has become increasingly successful in promoting membership. In 2013, for the first time, the cumulative number who had opted-out had decreased after four years of rises. It should be noted that the percentage change had been decreasing over that time.  The first group able to withdraw funds from KiwiSaver had limited funds available to them due to the short time they had been members. How 37 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit they withdrew/intended to withdraw their funds (lump sums or regular payments) was strongly correlated with the value of their account. Those with smaller balances were more likely to have withdrawn all their funds.  The rate of increase of those withdrawing their funds for reasons other than retirement has slowed markedly in 2012/13 compared with 2010/11.  Over the first five years of KiwiSaver, employers contributed $3.5 billion to KiwiSaver accounts. In the year to June 2013 they contributed $833 million.  In the 2012 year, $455 million in member tax credits was paid to 1.232,453 members. Less than half these members received the full tax credit.  For those earning solely wages or salary the median contribution in 2013 was $859; for those earning only non-salary or wage income the median was $1040.  Administrative data shows that the number of members on long holidays (five years) continues to grow while the number on shorter holidays has decreased. There also appears to be a decrease in the number of members commencing a holiday.  The cost of the home ownership features is likely to increase as more members begin to access them. The proportion of residential sales drawing on FDS support increased from 0.1% in July 2010 to 5.3% in December 2012. While the KiwiSaver scheme has promoted KiwiSaver membership, evidence reported subsequently suggests it has been less effective in promoting additional savings. There are also considerable numbers who are on contributions holidays or not contributing for other reasons. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 38 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 7. Individuals’ savings habits and asset accumulation 7.1 Introduction This section looks at the fourth of the evaluation objectives: to determine the impact of KiwiSaver on individual’s savings habits and asset accumulation. Data for this section have been drawn from analyses of:  the 2010 survey of individuals (the 2010 survey)  analysis of the 2010 survey data in the 2011 TWP19F 20  the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set (the linked data set) in the 2014 TWP20F 21  the 2013 KiwiSaver early retirement withdrawal survey (individuals) (the 2013 withdrawal survey)  KiwiSaver early retirement withdrawal research with KiwiSaver providers (provider’s research)  the 2014 additionality and substitution research (additionality research). 7.2 Additional savings and retirement savings substitution KiwiSaver is intended to foster additional savings amongst a specific group of individuals, namely those who are not in a position to enjoy standards of retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. However, subsidised schemes are also likely to promote substitution,ie, the diversion of funds from other forms of saving that do not offer the same level of subsidy or incentives. The question of additionality was examined in both the 2010 survey and in a 2014 survey of KiwiSaver members using flow measures of savings. (This was supplemented with an examination of KiwiSaver on stock measures of savings as discussed in section 7.5 below.) 20 Law, D., Meehan, L. & Scobie, G., (2011) KiwiSaver: An Initial Evaluation of the Impact on Retirement Saving, Wellington, The Treasury, Treasury Working Paper 11/04 21 Law, D. & Scobie, G. (2014). KiwiSaver and the Accumulation of Net Wealth, Wellington, The Treasury, Treasury Working Paper The additionality research repeated the questions from the 2010 survey with some minor modifications to clarify responses. The 2011 TWP also undertook a separate analysis of the 2010 survey data. In both surveys, members were asked to distribute 10 points across various categories, some of which were related to saving and debt reduction, while others related to consumption. For savings to be deemed additional they had to be related to consumption only. Substitution was defined as any contributions sourced from any other form of savings including debt reduction. 7.2.1 Additionality in 2010 As Table 16 shows, in 2010 KiwiSaver member respondents reported that 36% (3.64 points) of their KiwiSaver contributions would have been spent in the absence of KiwiSaver. This is the amount of savings viewed as additional with 64% (6.36 points) seen as substitution.

Respondents who owned their home were found to have allocated around 15% more of their KiwiSaver contributions to other forms of saving, or paying down debt than those who did not own a home. This difference was not solely due to mortgage repayment. Homeowners would have also allocated more of their contributions to both superannuation schemes and other savings or investments for retirement than non-homeowners. In addition, respondents were assigned a score of between 0 and 10 representing the sum of the points they allocated to the saving and debt reduction categories. Essentially this score represented the extent to which their KiwiSaver contributions were substitutes for other forms of saving—the higher the score, the greater the substitution. Key findings include the following:  From the total sample of respondents, 47% had a score of 8 representing high levels of substitution.  Over 40% of homeowners would have saved all their contributions compared to only 20% of non- home owners. These scores were then used to develop a regression model to consider the impact of a wider range of factors on the reported levels of substitution. The results indicated that:  those owning a home would have saved 12 percentage points more than non-homeowners in the absence of KiwiSaver  respondents with higher levels of education would have saved 4 percentage points more of their contributions for each additional year of education  those in part-time employment tended to spend more of their contributions than those working full time (12 percentage points)  females also tended to spend more than males (7 percentage points). In the original analysis of the 2010 survey, it was reported that 45% of respondents were not likely to have saved for their retirement in the absence of KiwiSaver. This group contained relatively high proportions of individuals:  with household incomes of $30,000 or less  aged under 50  with only a vague idea or no idea of their likely retirement income. This supports the notion that the value of assets and savings could drive knowledge and awareness, which in turn could promote membership and savings. This would explain why homeowners were more likely to have diverted other savings and/or debt reduction into KiwiSaver—they are already focused on some form of asset accumulation. 7.2.2 Additionality in 2014 compared with 2010 In 2014 there was no additional analysis of the survey data collected. In Table 17 the results from the 2014 survey are directly compared with those in 2010 as reported in the original survey report. Of note:  The level of additionality, defined as savings that would otherwise have been spent on consumption, has decreased from 36% to 31%. 40 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit The source of KiwiSaver contributions appears to have been increasingly derived from funds that would otherwise have been used for paying off mortgages or other debt (24% in 2010, compared with 32% in 2014). Table 17: How KiwiSaver contributions would be spent in the absence of KiwiSaver (percentage) 2010 % 2014 % Spend on daily activities and normal outgoings 36 31 Pay off mortgage and other debt 24 32 Other savings investment for retirement 18 15 Superannuation 9 8 Savings or investment for something other than retirement 13 14 Source: Ibid In 2014, consideration was given to how additionality varied by income and age (Table 18). The proportion of KiwiSaver funds that are considered additional were higher for those on lower incomes and for those who were younger. This is not surprising as they would be the least likely to already have other savings and investments. They will also have significant working lives to save and as such their balances on retirement are likely to be greater than those currently being reported. Table 18: Proportion of funds that are additional by income and age Additional % Personal income Up to and including $30,000 $30,001 to $60,000 Over $60,000 39 31 17 Age 18–34 35 –54 55–64 35 30 29 Source: Ibid KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 41 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 7.3 Attitudes and behaviours towards retirement 7.3.1 Financial planning for retirement Respondents to the 2010 survey were asked how much financial planning they had conducted for their retirement. Key findings were as follows:  half of the respondents said they had planned “a lot” (20%) or a “fair amount” (30%)  a further 32% said they had planned “a little”  17% had “not planned at all”. They were also asked what level of knowledge they had about their (and their partner’s) expected retirement income. Overall their reported levels of knowledge were not high:  36% had a good (8%) or reasonable (28%) idea of their retirement income  23% had a vague idea  41% had no idea or had not thought about financial planning at all. Membership of KiwiSaver or not did not make a significant difference to either the extent of financial planning or their level of knowledge of their expected retirement income. Those who had thought about financial planning either “a lot” or “fair amount”, and those with higher levels of knowledge, contained high proportions of:  homeowners  high-income groups  those with high net worth. There is obviously a relationship between savings and assets value and the amount of planning and knowledge. The direction of this relationship is not known. Further analysis undertaken by the Treasury (Law, et al, 2011) of these data showed two factors significantly reduced the likelihood of a respondent having undertaken financial planning. They found that those who reported poorer health and those who expected NZ Super to be their main source of income were less likely to engage in financial planning for their retirement. This is likely to be linked to perceptions of the value of doing so. 7.3.2 Expected standard of living in retirement All respondents to the 2010 survey were also asked how they thought their standard of living would change after retirement:  53% expected it to stay the same  27% expected it to decrease  18% expected it to increase. However, 33% of KiwiSaver members surveyed reported that their standard of living would decrease in retirement. This was significantly higher than the equivalent proportion for non-members (23%). 7.3.3 Expected length of retirement All respondents to the 2010 survey were asked about the length of time they expected to be retired for. The length of time was calculated by asking respondents the age they expected to live to and when they expected to retire. The difference between these was the length of time they would be retired for. Key findings included the following:  the most common length of time was 20–29 years (28%)  33% expected it to be less than that (0–19 years)  17% expected it to be longer (30+ years)  KiwiSaver members did not differ from non- members. The length of time of retirement did not influence other variables. However, those who had thought through their likely income in retirement were more likely to expect to retire before 65. 7.4 Income in retirement 7.4.1 Sources of income All respondents to the 2010 survey were asked what sources of income they expected to use in retirement and what the main source would be. Appendix 9 summarises the findings from this question and compares the responses of KiwiSaver members and non- members. The main income sources for KiwiSaver households are: 1. NZ Super (44%) 2. KiwiSaver (25%) 3. income from the sale or rent of property (12%) 4. stocks and shares or savings accounts (11%) 5. superannuation or work-based savings schemes (11%) 6. paid work (9%). The main income sources for non-KiwiSaver households are: 1. NZ Super (38%) 2. income from the sale or rent of property (22%) 3. stocks and shares or savings accounts (14%) 42 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 4. superannuation or work-based savings schemes (10%) 5. paid work (9%) 6. selling a business (7%). Those expecting to use KiwiSaver as their main source of income contained relatively high proportions of:  those with a low net worth  non-home owners  those under 50  those with a combined income under $50,000. In the 2013 survey of early withdrawers it was found that only 16% of respondents did not have other savings and investments and 42% had savings and investments of more than $100,000 (Table 19). Table 19: Percentage of all respondents by value of other savings and investments Total % (=1000) None 16 Less than 20,000 12 $20,001–$50,000 12 $50,001–$100,000 12 More than $100,000 42 Source: KiwiSaver early retirement withdrawal survey.

Of particular note:  Members with up to $10,000 in KiwiSaver are much more likely to have less than $20,000 in other savings and investments.  Members with more than $30,000 in KiwiSaver are much more likely to have more than $100,000 in other savings and investments.

At the same time it underlines the fact that some are clearly planning for retirement even in the absence of KiwiSaver. 7.4.2 The perceived adequacy of retirement income The adequacy of the expected income in retirement of respondents to the 2010 survey was analysed in the 2011 TWP.P21F 22 P The findings from this analysis (Table 21), for any expected shortfall or excess in retirement income, showed that:  78% of all respondents reported an expected excess retirement income for meeting needs  50% of all respondents reported an expected excess for being comfortable in retirement. For those reporting shortfalls, the median shortfall based on meeting basic needs was $6,800 while it was $12,000 for being comfortable. For those reporting an excess, the median excess was $10,800 based on basic needs compared with $5,200 for being comfortable. 22 Law, D., Meehan, L. & Scobie, G., (2011), KiwiSaver: An Initial Evaluation of the Impact on Retirement Saving.

This is very similar to the results from the 2010 survey. A similar proportion of respondents had other savings and investments to rely on beyond KiwiSaver. Those with less in other savings and investments, single people and renters, were the groups most likely to report their savings were inadequate to some extent, for meeting their living costs in the immediate future and throughout retirement. 7.5 The accumulation of net wealth The SoFIE–Inland Revenue data set was used to determine the extent to which KiwiSaver has resulted in greater accumulations of net wealth amongst its members. The final sample size employed in the study was approximately 10,000 individuals, of whom 39% were KiwiSaver members. Two approaches were employed in the analysis. The first was to compare wealth changes over the period between KiwiSaver and non-KiwiSaver members (known as difference in differences analysis). The second was various panel regression techniques, which allow for other factors that might affect changes in wealth to be taken into account. The overall conclusion of this work is that it is not possible to reject the hypothesis that KiwiSaver has had no effect on net wealth accumulation (indeed, the only regression result with statistical power indicates that KiwiSaver members accumulated less wealth over the period compared to non-KiwiSaver members). This potentially paints a bleaker picture than the flow-based additionality work described in section 7.2, which concluded that KiwiSaver did result in additional savings. At the same time, the Treasury paper points out that there is reason for caution in interpreting the findings of their study because of significant measurement error in key variables and wide change in net wealth. Efforts to correct for these are only likely to be partially successful. Also data is available for only a relatively short time. An independent review of the studyP22F 23 P also discussed some potential limitations and recommended caution in drawing the conclusion that KiwiSaver had had a negative impact on the accumulation of net wealth. 7.6 Using KiwiSaver in retirement The 2013 early withdrawal survey was the first opportunity to consider the use of KiwiSaver funds in retirement. This is because they were the first cohort of members who were ready to retire. Again though, caution is needed in generalising these findings beyond this group. Many had other sources of incomes and their balances in KiwiSaver were not large. One of the questions asked was how they had used, or intended to use their KiwiSaver funds. Respondents could give more than one answer (Table 22). Key findings include the following: 23 Guest, R, MacDonald, K, Drew, M & Bianchi, R (2014). KiwiSaver Conclusions Report. Griffith University: Australia, p 14 45 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  Over half (58%) plan to put the money into other savings or investments.  Half (50%) intended to spend or had already spent it.  Of those who had withdrawn all their KiwiSaver funds most were likely to reinvest it (69%). Those who had made a partial withdrawal were most likely to have spent or be intending to spend the money (67%).

The main reasons for doing so were related to a perception of better return or security. For others, a driver was to improve ease of access to their funds. Those who reported spending or intending to spend their funds (50%) were asked about their expenditure. The most commonly mentioned expenditure was holidays (61%). This was followed by home improvements or a new home (37%), major purchases such as cars or boats (32%) and health and medical expenses (29%). Only 22% envisaged spending their savings on everyday living expenses such as food and bills. The amount respondents had saved in KiwiSaver did not seem to affect their intentions with one exception. Those with less than $5,000 were the group most likely to use the money to pay off debt and were least likely to put the money into other savings or investments. The value of other savings or investments they had did influence their use of their KiwiSaver funds. It is likely this is because of the total retirement package including KiwiSaver, rather than these funds alone. As is shown in Table 23:  the more money saved or invested the more likely they were to reinvest their KiwiSaver funds. It could be they saw KiwiSaver as a short-term, relatively high return investment given the other contributions  those with no other investments were the most likely to pay off their mortgage or other debt.

Key findings from this section include:  In 2010, using a flow measure of savings it was estimated that 36% of KiwiSaver contributions represented additional savings, with 64% substitution from other forms of savings. In 2013, the estimated level of additionality had fallen to 31%.  Half of the respondents to the 2010 survey reported they had planned either “a lot” or “a fair amount” for their retirement. 36% said they had a “good” or “reasonable” idea of their retirement income. Those who had poor health and those who expected NZ Super to be their main source of income were less likely to engage in financial planning. Higher levels of knowledge and more planning were associated with higher incomes and higher net worth.  Of all respondents to the 2010 survey 53% thought their standard of living in retirement would stay the same, 27% expected it to decrease and 18% expected it to increase. KiwiSaver members were significantly more likely to report their standard of living would decrease than non-members.  The main retirement income source for both KiwiSaver households (44%) and non-KiwiSaver households (38%) was NZ Super. The next most commonly reported main source for KiwiSaver households was KiwiSaver (25%) compared with income from the sale or rent of property for non- KiwiSaver households (22%).  The analysis in the 2011 TWP of the 2010 survey showed that 78% of respondents had an expected excess retirement income for meeting needs; 50% had an excess for being comfortable. This analysis found no evidence that KiwiSaver membership was associated with any expected shortfall in retirement.  In the 2013 withdrawal survey of early retirees, 73% believed that their retirement income was either adequate or more than adequate. Only 16% did not have other savings and investments. For 42% of respondents these exceeded $100,000. The more savings they had in KiwiSaver the more they were likely to also have other savings and investments. This suggests KiwiSaver was a means of broadening their portfolio, although the financial incentives could have equally played a role. The value of their other savings and investments influenced their use of their KiwiSaver funds. The more money they had saved or invested the more likely they were to reinvest their KiwiSaver money once they were able to withdraw it.  The analysis in the 2014 TWP of the linked data set, with regard to asset accumulation, found no evidence of KiwiSaver leading to the accumulation of net wealth. Indeed, panel regressions found a negative effect for KiwiSaver membership. This was only statistically significant in one of six regressions. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 47 Prepared by: National Research & Evaluation Unit Section 8. Superannuation markets and the financial sector 8.1 Introduction This section of the report considers the final objective of the evaluation: To determine the impact of KiwiSaver on superannuation markets and the financial sector The results of a study undertaken in 2010 by the Ministry of Economic Development (now MBIE) were used to consider this question. Data were collected through surveys and interviews with providers, and desktop research. In addition Inland Revenue administrative data are reported. 8.2 KiwiSaver scheme fund balances As of 31 March 2013, scheme providers held $16.6 billion in KiwiSaver schemes—an estimated 19% of the superannuation and managed funds market. This had grown from an initial $701 million in 2008 (Table 24). The total comprised member contributions, employer contributions, Crown payments and investment returns.

The specific focus of the 2010 evaluation was the effect of KiwiSaver on the superannuation and managed funds market and the wider financial services sector. This evaluation used two sets of indicators:  the firm dynamics indicators: to show the health of the KiwiSaver market  the market dynamics indicators: to show how the KiwiSaver market relates to other superannuation and managed funds more generally. The conclusions drawn from the study were as follows:  KiwiSaver was providing a stimulus to the New Zealand financial sector. Providers saw KiwiSaver as 24 MBIE report on KiwiSaver supply side evaluation a medium/long-term growth opportunity. Building the necessary infrastructure to support the product had made it marginally profitable in most cases.  The global financial crisis and resulting volatility of investment returns had not impeded KiwiSaver’s growth significantly, but had reduced its profitability for providers because the negative investment returns reduced the funds under management. This in turn, drives the level of income managers receive.  The number of providers was currently stable but more consolidation occurring would be consistent with a healthy industry.  To date the funds flow had had only a small positive impact on New Zealand capital markets.  KiwiSaver funds had a marginally higher weighting to domestic assets than other superannuation schemes or managed funds. 48 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit 8.4 Summary of key points In summary, the supply side study of the period up to 2010 concluded that KiwiSaver was providing a stimulus to the New Zealand financial sector and that it was a medium to long-term growth opportunity for the sector. Since then more recent analysisP24F 25 P has shown that a significant proportion of KiwiSaver funds are invested overseas and relatively conservatively. The impact on the capital markets remains small. 25 Retirement Policy and Research Centre. (2014). Observations on Reserve Bank’s Household Financial Assets 2003–2013. Pension Briefing 2014-1. University of Auckland Business School KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 49 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 9. Value for money of KiwiSaver 9.1 Introduction The 2011 TWP reported that the strong growth in KiwiSaver membership and the private benefits from increased retirement savings had come at a significant public cost. Given the contributions were being funded through increases in public debt they argued that the impact of the scheme needed to be evaluated in light of this cost—essentially a consideration of the value for money KiwiSaver represents. This section considers the broader picture of the value for money of KiwiSaver. It looks at Crown contributions, the level of additionality achieved, the extent to which the target market was met, the impact on national savings and the cumulative costs and benefits. Evidence for this section has come from a range of data sources including:  administrative data  the 2010 survey  the 2013 study of additionality and substitution  the SoFIE–Inland Revenue linked data set. 9.2 Considering value for money A study of the value for money of KiwiSaver was completed in 2014. A relatively simple approach was taken in this study, combining direct costs with the results of earlier studies on the level of additionality and leakage of KiwiSaver benefits to those outside its target. There are uncertainties regarding the influence of some factors on KiwiSaver although these are unlikely to have a substantial impact on the value for money conclusions. The factors driving this uncertainty included:  the timeframe since the introduction of KiwiSaver  the impact of KiwiSaver on employment costs  the changes made to KiwiSaver over the time period of the evaluation  the impact of economic cycles and the markedly volatile period within which KiwiSaver has been implemented. 9.3 The costs to the Crown Direct KiwiSaver costs to the Crown come from the $1,000 kick-start to new members and the annual member tax credit. Until 2009 there was also an employer tax credit and a fee subsidy of $40 per member. In 2013, KiwiSaver cost the Crown $677 million in contribution payments to members. This was a decrease from $1.5 billion in 2012 when the member tax credit was halved. Overall, in the first five years of KiwiSaver, payments to members and employers have cost the Crown $5.3 billion. As a proportion of the total value of funds passed to providers for investment in members’ accounts, the contribution from the Crown is declining over time. 9.4 Effectiveness of KiwiSaver in meeting the target market The policy objective of KiwiSaver is to encourage a savings habit and asset accumulation amongst individuals who may not be in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre- retirement. This suggests a “target population”, which the scheme is intended to help. The extent to which KiwiSaver had reached this market was considered in the 2011 TWP, which used data from the 2010 survey. It is difficult to accurately define a “target group” for KiwiSaver having regard to the legislative purpose and applicable to the data set available. Other approaches to defining a “target group” and a more sophisticated data set could result in very different value for money estimates. The 2011 TWP, which analysed the 2010 survey data, used a specific definition for the target population, which was defined by two characteristics:  An individual expected to have income in retirement that was less than what they self- 50 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit identified to meet their basic needs or to live comfortably.  If an individual were to join KiwiSaver at least 30% of their contributions would have to represent new savings. Using these criteria the 2011 TWP concluded that very few KiwiSaver members were part of the target population definition. If the target population was taken to be those expecting insufficient income in retirement to live comfortably, the study found that 22% of KiwiSaver members fit within the target. This fell to only 7% if the target were instead defined as those who did not expect to be able to meet their basic needs in retirement. This implied that the ongoing cost of the scheme for each target member, based on living comfortably, was around $4,000 per year. The cost based on those in need was even higher at $13,000 per year. The study also found that at March 2010, 47% (based on living comfortably) or 33% (based on meeting basic needs) of the target population had joined KiwiSaver. 9.5 Cumulative costs and benefits How the total costs of KiwiSaver relate to the contributions that have been made was considered through an analysis of Inland Revenue administration data combined with the results of studies on the extent KiwiSaver contributions represent new savings (additionality) and the extent KiwiSaver benefits have accrued to those outside the target population (leakage). This allowed a comparison between the additional savings of those in the KiwiSaver target population and the costs incurred by government. The cost to the government was defined as:  the cost of all incentives available to KiwiSaver members over the review period  the administration costs faced by Inland Revenue and Housing New Zealand (now MBIE) in administering KiwiSaver. This analysis (Table 25) showed that the government is spending $1 to get $0.38 of individual savings, factoring in additionality and leakage under a definition of KiwiSaver’s target being those individuals expecting to be unable to live comfortably in retirement. Table 25: Overall costs and benefits 2008/09 2010/11 2012/13 Additional savings member contributions made by KiwiSaver target per $ of government cost $0.20 $0.22 $0.38 Percentage growth in membership +33.4% +17.8% +9.1% Percentage growth in members’ mean annual contribution –6.2% –0.8% +9.5% Source: Government retirement savings incentives in New Zealand: do they provide value for money? A value for money analysis of the KiwiSaver programme from its inception to 30 June 2013 (to be published) There are three main drivers for the improvement in the cost ratio in 2012/13 when for every government dollar, additional savings among the target rose to $0.38. These were:  the declining growth rate of new members significantly reduced the cost of the kick-start incentive from $471 million in 2008/2009 to $217 million in 2012/2013  the reduced member tax credit from July 2011 reduced that cost from $664 million in 2010/11 to $455 million in 2012/2013  in 2012/2013 members’ mean contributions increased faster than membership. The increase in contribution rates from 2% to 3% will have been an important factor in driving this. It is too soon to tell whether this slight improvement in value for money will be sustained over time. Factors to be considered include whether the growth in membership continues to slow, impacting on the cost of the kick-start. Also to be considered is whether the first- home deposit subsidy becomes a significant element of cost going forward. It is probably too early to assume 51 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit that the policy framework is stable, ie, that further changes will not be made to KiwiSaver. The analysis of the distribution of incentives relative to contributions across three income bands and four age groups shows that the actual incidence of incentives is not disproportionately favouring the highest income group. The assumptions on which this analysis was based are explained in the detailed report. The additionality figures used are those from the 2010 and 2014 surveys of individuals reported earlier. 9.6 Summary The following are the key findings from this section of the report:  In 2013, KiwiSaver cost the Crown $677 million in contribution payments to members. This was a decrease from $1.5 billion in 2012 when the member tax credit was halved. Overall, in the first five years payments to members and employers have cost the Crown $5.3 billion.  In 2010, the estimated level of additionality was 36%, this decreased to 31% in 2013. In 2010, homeowners were found to have allocated around 15% more of their KiwiSaver contributions to other forms of saving or paying off debt than those who did not own a home.  In 2013, increases in KiwiSaver contributions appear to have been increasingly related to paying off mortgages or other debt.  The 2011 Treasury Working Paper (Law, et al, 2011) reported that in 2010 the KiwiSaver scheme appeared to be reaching about only one third of the target population with leakage estimated to be as high as 93%. This implied that the ongoing cost of the scheme for each estimated target member was around $4,000 per year.  A costs and benefit analysis shows that for the period 2007/08 to 2013/13, the additional savings amongst the estimated target group for each $ of government spending ranged from $0.20 to $0.38 as the level of government contributions dropped with less new enrolments and policy changes. The analysis also used a narrower target group which produced a lower value for money. Given the importance of the assumptions used, this analysis could produce different results (better value for money) if a wider definition of the target group were used.  The costs to the Crown are reducing over time as membership growth slows. The reduction to the member tax credit and the increase in the default rate have also had an effect.  The actual incidence of incentives is not disproportionately favouring the highest income group. The trend in the mean subsidy paid within income bands is evening out. Further, the proportion of subsidies paid to the highest income group is less than 25% of the total while they contribute more than 45% of the savings. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 52 Prepared by: National Research & Evaluation Unit Section 10. Conclusions Essentially, KiwiSaver needs to be measured against its policy objectives, which were:  to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of retirement similar to those in pre-retirement  to increase individual’s well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement and to provide retirement benefits. This report has drawn together seven years of evaluative activity under the key objectives of the evaluation. It also includes a 2014 Value for Money study. Based on the evidence collected across the evaluation the success of KiwiSaver in achieving its policy goals in the short- term appears to be marginal at best. There is an argument that KiwiSaver is promoting saving for retirement, ie, more individuals now belong to a retirement scheme from which it is very difficult to withdraw funds prior to retirement. Further, they are locked into this scheme. As such, one could argue the features of KiwiSaver designed to attract members have worked. The proportion of new members who have opted-in has continued to remain high (over 60%), suggesting KiwiSaver remains an attractive option. Further, fewer individuals are opting out. Whether this leads to long-term benefits and the impact of KiwiSaver on the retirement lives of the 18–25 year old members, who will have had 30 plus years to contribute, cannot be extrapolated from the experiences of the early retirees who had only five years of contributions. However, there is concern over the amount individuals are saving, in particular the extent to which this is additional saving. The level of additionality has remained relatively constant between 2010 and 2013 and suggests only about a third of KiwiSaver contributions represent new savings. There is a considerable proportion of members not contributing or on contributions holidays. Both would seem to be a way of individuals managing the locked-in features of KiwiSaver. The reasons for this behaviour would seem to be related to perceived affordability and major life events, which can alter priorities. It would also appear that KiwiSaver has not been successful in improving the accumulation of net wealth for its members. Rather, over the period under review (up to 2010) KiwiSaver appears to have had a negative impact when compared with non-members. Again this was over a relatively short time period and it is possible this will change over time. It could be, for example, that the default schemes are too conservative for short-term wealth accumulation, but will be more secure in the long term. There are also concerns about the extent to which KiwiSaver has been effective in meeting the target market. Based on the perceptions of individuals with regard to their retirement income and needs, there appears to have been significant leakage, ie, KiwiSaver is reaching a large number of individuals outside the estimated target group. Further, it appears to have reached only about one-third of the target market, as defined for this evaluation. Finally, the value for money study showed that KiwiSaver is currently expensive in terms of the cumulative costs and benefits. These findings need to be considered in light of the limitations and concerns expressed throughout this report and in the feedback from the independent reviewers. They are a point in time analysis of the early effectiveness of KiwiSaver. The extent to which they indicate its success in five or 10 years cannot be readily extrapolated from these data given the numerous factors that can influence these findings. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 53 Prepared by: National Research & Evaluation Unit Section 11. The KiwiSaver evaluation programme In this section the effectiveness of the KiwiSaver evaluation programme is considered along with recommendations for the future, should an evaluation be required. To date this has been a very comprehensive and extensive evaluation. Substantial amounts of data have been collated and analysed across many different activities. The richness and breadth of the story this evaluation tells should not be underestimated. Nor should its potential value to a number of agencies and for a number of different purposes. It has been praised internationally as the most comprehensive evaluation of a retirement scheme undertaken.P25F 26 11.1 The effectiveness of the evaluation The effectiveness of the evaluation should be measured primarily against its ability to judge the success of the policy against its objectives. It should also be measured by its usefulness to key stakeholders or owners of the evaluation. 11.1.1 Evaluating against policy objectives Its ability to achieve this first indicator has been discussed already. The evaluation has essentially met this indicator given the constraints of the time-period within which it was implemented. This is particularly true if one considers this to be a process and early outcomes evaluation. Any programme of evaluation should be open to criticism. There has perhaps been a tendency to do discrete pieces of work rather than building up a systematic research programme, allowing for ready comparisons over time. However, there is certainly a rich and comprehensive evidence base regarding KiwiSaver across the first years of its implementation. Much of the potential usefulness of this work will depend on the extent to which this work is used as a baseline in the future, and to which the discrete pieces of work to date are built into a longitudinal research programme. 26 Collard, S, & Moore, N (2009). Review of International Pension Reform. Research Report No 663. Department for Work and Pensions. Available from https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachmen t\_data/file/214434/rrep663.pdf 11.1.2 Survey of Steering Group members The members of the Steering Group were asked to complete a short survey regarding the effectiveness and future of the KiwiSaver evaluation. There were nine respondents to the survey from across six agencies. A full report from that survey is provided in Appendix 10. Respondents were asked to indicate the level of effectiveness of the evaluation in meeting each of its objectives on a scale of 1–6.  The lowest reported mean level of effectiveness was 3.1 (slightly good), reported for determining the impact of KiwiSaver on superannuation markets and the financial sector.  The highest mean level of effectiveness was 4.5 (moderately/very good), given for understanding the scale and pattern of uptake of KiwiSaver. They were also asked to rate the evaluation against some general criteria:  The lowest rating of 3.7 was for the value for money of the information provided.  The highest rating of 5.1 (very good) was given for the overall model of a lead agency with others doing their own research. 11.2 The future of the evaluation programme In the survey the Steering Group was also asked about the future of the evaluation programme. The majority view was that Inland Revenue should continue to lead the work. However, there was little consensus about the evaluation model. Respondents were asked to rank five different options from most preferred (1) to least preferred (5). No one option dominated, with all five having an average rating of 3. This reflects the divergent perspectives of this group and one of the confounding factors for this evaluation.  The least preferred option (average of 3.3) was the development of another stand-alone comprehensive monitoring, research and evaluation framework covering a 10-year period. 54 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit  Regular reviews of KiwiSaver, including some research and the use of administrative data, had an average rating of 2.6, and was the most preferred option. This does suggest an appetite for more work but not on a large, extended timeframe. The issue is that without a framework the potential value of research and monitoring is reduced. Discrete pieces of work do not have the same overall usefulness over time. Respondents were also asked what they thought the key areas for evaluation/research should be moving forward. Again there was a range of responses reflecting their different policy areas, such as:  revisiting the key areas of research related to outcomes for members and the value for money at a later stage to compare against established baselines  comparisons with international models  exploring the full range of decumulation issues  confirming the additionality assumptions  the impact of housing incentives on the housing market  implications for social equity  analysis of membership from an affordability perspective  whether KiwiSaver targeting the right members  what affects changes in contributions. 11.3 Research ideas from the evaluation In completing this report a number of potential research areas were highlighted. Some of these have been listed here, grouped under thematic headings. 1. Membership  Why are individuals continuing to opt-in? What is driving their decision to actively join KiwiSaver? What has changed for them? 2. Employers  How are they funding their contributions to KiwiSaver, eg, salary sacrifice, increased charges to customers?  What does the remuneration package look like for their employees?  What are the costs/benefits to employers of KiwiSaver? Are there any other costs outside of compliance? Do they see any benefits? 3. Attitudes and behaviours  Are attitudes towards retirement savings changing over time? Repeat the knowledge, risk and engagement questions from the 2010 survey to enable a comparison?  To what extent do the views of employers impact on the decisions individuals make?  What impact has the increased marketing and information available had on the attitudes and behaviours of individuals? 4. Contribution rates  What determines how much an individual contributes?  Is there an “ideal” contribution rate? How does this differ across different demographics? What is considered “fair and affordable”?  What are the spending priorities of individuals and how do these change over time?  Why are some members not contributing? When do they intend to do so? Why did they join in the first place? 5. Longitudinal questions  Additionality and substitution  Meeting the target market  The cost to the Crown  Accumulation of net wealth  Impact on other superannuation and retirement schemes (the supply side)  Impact on retirement income, behaviour and experiences across different cohorts over time. 11.4 Discussion / recommendations This work has occurred across the first seven years of KiwiSaver. This is a very short time period for an initiative aimed at changing long-term behaviours and improving well-being in retirement. Further, the policy framework of KiwiSaver has undergone substantial changes over this period. As such all findings need to be treated with caution and viewed as early outcomes only. Other limitations, as indicated at the start of this report include the difficulty of defining the target market, the difficulty of ascribing causality in a complex environment and the difficulty of measuring additionality. These limitations notwithstanding, the evaluation provides a very detailed snapshot of the retirement attitudes, behaviours and expectations of individuals at this time. It also provides a rich data set regarding the 55 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit implementation of KiwiSaver, including trend data related to membership and contributions. The early outcomes analyses against the objectives of KiwiSaver are also of value in informing future policy decisions and as a benchmark for considering the future performance of KiwiSaver. Whether a further comprehensive evaluation is needed is a moot point. The evaluation has highlighted a number of potential research areas for the future (listed above). The findings from the Steering Group survey suggest there is an appetite to continue the work in some form. But evaluations cost money and this needs to be assessed against competing spending priorities. Should there be changes to the features of KiwiSaver (eg, contribution rates) there would be some value in considering the impact of these, using this body of work as a benchmark. There is also value in considering repeating the core pieces of work in five years time. These are the studies related to additionality, meeting the target market, accumulation of net wealth and cumulative cost-benefit. Changes in key behaviours and attitudes as well as the impact on retirement are also worth considering across different cohorts. This could be achieved through longitudinal research designs and very focused pieces of work. There would also be some value in developing an agreed framework for research in areas that can help inform both strategic and operational policy regarding the well- being of New Zealanders in retirement, the effectiveness of retirement policy and the attitudes and behaviours of New Zealanders. Such research need not be expensive if well managed and focused. If further research were considered a priority, the recommendation is that the Steering Group consider the development of a systematic research, evaluation and monitoring framework that includes discrete pieces of work building towards a second evaluation of the key policy objectives in approximately five years time. This should build on the current work and enable comparisons over time. KiwiSaver evaluation: Final summary report 56 Prepared by: National Research & Evaluation Unit Appendix 1: KiwiSaver features and glossary See also Appendix 3 for changes to KiwiSaverfeatures since its introduction in 2007. Features Work-based scheme KiwiSaver is a work-based initiative meaning that information is provided by employers, and employee’s contributions are deducted directly from their pay. Eligibility requirements To be eligible to join KiwiSaver, individuals must be a New Zealand citizen (or entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely), and personally present or normally personally present in New Zealand, and under the age of eligibility for NZ Super (currently 65). Default providers Those individuals who are automatically enrolled will be allocated to one of six government selected default schemes. These members have three months to choose their own scheme and if they do not they will be enrolled in the default scheme. Opt-in Individuals can elect to join KiwiSaver directly, either through their employer or by contacting a scheme provider. Automatic enrolment and opt- out Provided they are eligible for KiwiSaver, all new employees (ie, those starting a new job) will be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver unless they meet one of the conditions for exemption. Individuals may choose to opt-out within eight weeks (but not within the first two weeks) of starting the new job. Scheme and contributions choice Originally, KiwiSaver members could choose from a range of superannuation schemes and providers. They could also elect to contribute either 4% or 8% of their gross income (changed). Savings locked in Savings cannot be withdrawn until the age of eligibility for NZ Super or until they have been a member for five years, whichever is the later. Self- and non- employed Those who are self-employed or not-employed can opt-in to KiwiSaver and can determine their level of contributions. Employer tax credit An employer tax credit of up to a maximum of $20 per week for each employee to reimburse employers for their contributions to employees’ accounts (ceased). Incentives Kick-start payment Initial payment of $1,000 to an individual’s account upon joining. Member tax credit Members were entitled to a tax credit of up to $1,042.86 per year ($20 per week) from 1 July 2007. The tax credit is paid automatically to an individual's KiwiSaver account, based on the level of contribution made (changed). 57 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Employer contributions From 1 April 2008, employers were required to match individuals’ contributions up to 1% from 1 April 2008, rising 1% a year to 4% from 1 April 2011 (changed). Contributions holiday Members are able to take a contributions holiday of between three months and five years after contributing for an initial 12-month period. Individuals can apply for a holiday within the first 12 months for reasons of financial hardship. First home deposit subsidy After three years of contributions, an individual can access a conditional grant towards buying a home, equal to $1,000 per year of contribution up to $5,000. First home withdrawal After being a member for three years, individuals can withdraw all or part of their savings to contribute to a deposit on a first home. Mortgage diversion facility After being a member for 12 months an individual can split their contributions between their KiwiSaver account and their mortgage payments (ceased). Fee subsidy Members entitled to a $40 provider fee subsidy each year (ceased).

Steering Committee As part of this synthesis an online survey of the Steering Committee was undertaken. The purpose of this survey was to inform the final section of the report, which considered the effectiveness of the evaluation to date, and made recommendations for future activities. This appendix provides a summary of the data collected from this survey and is the basis for the comments made in the body of the report. A10.1 Survey respondents In total, 9 members of the Steering Committee responded to the survey. Table 26 summarises the number of respondents per agency. Seven agencies were represented. There were no respondents from Treasury or Statistics New Zealand. (Although one person from each of these agencies did access the survey they did not complete any of the questions beyond their name and agency identification.) Table 26: Respondents by agency Agency Number Inland Revenue 3 Financial Markets Authority 1 Commission for Financial Capability 1 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 2 Ministry of Social Development 1 Victoria University 1 Total 9 The Steering Committee membership has changed over time. Respondents were asked how long they had been on the committee to provide some context to their answers with respect to their involvement in the evaluation. Two of the respondents had been members for more than six years and as such involved in the initial development of the evaluation plan. The other seven had all been members for less than three years, with two being on the committee for less than a year. Respondents were also asked how they would rate their personal expertise and knowledge with regard to their ability to answer the survey questions. The scale used was from 1 = moderately poor through to 6 = extremely good. The average level of knowledge reported was 4, which equates to moderately good. Overall five respondents reported their knowledge was moderately good or higher, 3 reported it was slightly good and one commented that it was moderately poor. A10.1.1 The effectiveness of the evaluation Three questions asked respondents to rate the effectiveness of KiwiSaver. The scale used for these questions was: 1 = moderately poor; 2 = slightly poor; 3 = slightly good; 4 = moderately good; 5 = very good; 6 = extremely good. A positively packed scale was used based on the assumption that respondents were more likely to have a positive view of the evaluation and this enabled a wider range of responses. 74 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit Respondents were firstly asked how they would rate the effectiveness of the evaluation in meeting its objectives. Given that some key pieces of work were still to be completed there were two separate questions as shown in the following tables. The respondent who reported a moderately poor level of knowledge did not answer these questions. The range of means across both questions was from 3.1 (slightly good) through to 4.5 (moderately/very good). The highest level of effectiveness was reported for understanding the scale and uptake of KiwiSaver, the lowest for its impact on superannuation markets and the financial sector. Table 27: Mean levels of effectiveness of the evaluation Mean Informing the ongoing development and delivery of KiwiSaver 4.1 Understanding the scale and pattern of uptake of KiwiSaver 4.5 Assessing whether the KiwiSaver features are generating expected outcomes 3.9 Determining the impact of KiwiSaver on superannuation markets and the financial sector 3.1 Table 28: Mean levels of effectiveness of the evaluation to date Mean The impact of KiwiSaver on individual’s savings habits and asset accumulation 3.8 The impact of KiwiSaver on national savings 3.5 The value for money of KiwiSaver as a policy 3.4 Respondents were also asked to rate the evaluation in terms of a number of general criteria related to its implementation and usefulness based on the work undertaken to date (Table 29). The mean levels of effectiveness regarding the information provided are remarkably consistent and all equate to it being moderately good. The highest rating was given for the usefulness of the information (AxˉE A= 4.4); the lowest for the value for money of the information provided (AxˉE A= 3.7). The overall model had a mean level of effectiveness of 5.1, which equates to very good and suggests that people are, generally satisfied with how this works.

First, they were asked what they considered to be the most useful aspects of and/or findings from the evaluation to date. Their responses were as follows:  The true success of KiwiSaver policy will be measured over decades more than the initial few years. That said, the KiwiSaver evaluation has enabled very useful initial research and the establishment of baselines against which future research can be compared. Secondly, the KiwiSaver evaluation has driven excellent inter-agency engagement and communication for the initial life of KiwiSaver. While the focus of the Steering Committee has been on KiwiSaver evaluation, it has also driven better cross-agency understanding and alignment.  Excellent understanding of uptake, member demographics, response to the different features of KiwiSaver.  The most useful aspect from my perspective, which is a by-product, has been the inter-agency contact and being linked into the research that has and is being done.  I think the most useful thing has been bringing a range of government departments together to collaborate on a policy change that has a wide range of impacts.  Having a summary provided annually, which has assisted in identifying trends in the first few years of KiwiSaver. Providing a forum to ask the questions around the effectiveness of certain KiwiSaver features.  Continued review, and inter-agency collaboration.  I have been on the Steering Group panel for a relatively short period of time, approximately 8 months. As such, I cannot comment in detail on the pieces of work that were delivered and discussed prior to this time. However, I have found the findings from the qualitative research involving in- depth interviews with KiwiSaver members and non- members, employers and scheme providers interesting and insightful—painting a picture of the attitudes and behaviour of individuals and employers towards KiwiSaver. The discussions I have been involved in re: the scope for the value of money research was a useful cross-agency collaboration and I would expect this to produce some useful and relevant information.  The (lack of) additionality result, for its policy implications. For me the most important result will be value for money and that is not finished yet. They were also asked if they had any general comments to make. Four respondents made further comments to those above:  An excellent example of different parts of the sector coming together to work on a common purpose and achieving far more than any one agency could have achieved on its own.  I think it is difficult to quantify the value of the work done to date given KiwiSaver has only been in existence for just under 7 years and we had the GSC in 2008. However the work will be useful in my view from a benchmarking perspective.  It was a good exercise, but KiwiSaver has now become “Business as Usual” and except for completing the SoFIE work, there is probably no 76 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit longer a justification for a specific evaluation project.  Generally the evaluation has been a model for large and costly programmes. A10.2 Future evaluation activities The second part of the survey asked respondents to consider the future of the evaluation, beyond June 2014. Firstly, they were asked to rank five different options for the evaluation with a sixth option of “other”. The option with the lowest average, and therefore the most preferred overall, was for regular reviews of KiwiSaver. The least preferred was the development of a comprehensive framework to cover the next 10 years. Table 30: Average ranking for each option for the evaluation Mean Regular reviews of KiwiSaver including some research and the use of the administrative data 2.6 The development of another stand-alone, comprehensive monitoring, research and evaluation framework to cover the next five years 3.0 Regular monitoring of KiwiSaver through administrative data 3.0 Incorporating KiwiSaver into relevant agency monitoring and evaluation frameworks rather than a specific KiwiSaver evaluation 3.1 The development of another stand-alone, comprehensive monitoring, research and evaluation framework to cover the next 10 years 3.3 As the average scores show, the respondents all had very differing views on what is needed. For example, four different items were selected as the most preferred option by two people. Only one person ranked regular reviews of KiwiSaver above a 3. It was also the only item that was not ranked a 5 or 6 by any respondent. For both items suggesting comprehensive evaluation frameworks five respondents ranked them 4 or 5. Two respondents offered a different option to those listed in the survey. In both instances they ranked this 6P th P in order of preference. These options were for regular monitoring of KiwiSaver for the next five years before developing another comprehensive evaluation plan for the next five years. The other option was related to the decumulationP26F 27 P problem. Respondents were also asked which agency they believed should be the lead if an evaluation plan was to be developed. Of the eight respondents to this question, six suggested Inland Revenue while two suggested Treasury. Finally respondents were asked what they thought the key interests of any research and evaluation should be moving forward: 27 Decumulation is the “spending” of one’s assets to fund retirement  I think the key thing is to recognise that much of the research conducted to date has only been done at the initial stages of KiwiSaver. Areas of research such as impacts on scheme providers and employers, outcomes for members, value for money all need to be revisited to compare against the established baselines and to ensure that KiwiSaver is on targeted to achieve its intended outcomes. This further research would ensure that the Government’s ongoing significant investment in KiwiSaver is achieving the desired outcomes and it also helps to inform future policy development.  It would need to explore a full range of decumulation issues. Confirmation of additionality assumptions.  Non-contributors not on an s64 holiday. Member ethnicity. Contributory members’ analysis by Stats NZ industry classification. Analysis of membership from an affordability perspective.  My answer to 10 and 11 really depends on what the angle of the evaluation is. Either IR or Tsy would be interested from an overall financial/savings perspective. From an MBIE perspective we would really only focus on the housing market aspect of KS, which is quite small. But we would certainly be interested in understanding how the first home 77 Prepared by: National Research and Evaluation Unit package has affected the Housing market generally, especially in relation to house price inflation—and the interplay with the LVR restrictions.  Principal objectives continue to be impact of KS on personal savings; Impact of KS on national savings; Impact of KS on financial sector productivity  The extent to which KiwiSaver is used versus alternative saving options. What affects changes in contributions? Is KiwiSaver targeting the right people? Comparison with international models. Issues around employer contributions and firm size  Implications for social equity; the decumulation problem.
KiwiSaver T rademark Guidelines – Media August 2020 2 Contents page 1. Introduction2 2. Use of the word “KiwiSaver”2 3. Use of the KiwiSaver Logo4 4. Definitions6 3 1. Introduction 1.1 Inland Revenue wishes to protect the integrity of KiwiSaver and the KiwiSaver Trade Marks and therefore asks the media to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks according to these simple guidelines. 1.2 This will help Inland Revenue to: (a) maintain the integrity of KiwiSaver and stop the KiwiSaver Trade Marks being damaged or diluted; and (b) prevent use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks by third parties that confuses, misleads or deceives the public. 1.3 These guidelines describe how the KiwiSaver Trade Marks should be used by the media purely in editorial (non-commercial) articles and news coverage. 1.4 Any use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks for commercial purposes is reserved for Inland Revenue’s licensees, such as KiwiSaver scheme providers. No entities are permitted to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks (including the KiwiSaver Logo) for any commercial purposes unless they are authorised to do so by Inland Revenue. 1.5 Please contact Inland Revenue if you have any questions regarding use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks in a commercial context. 2. Use of the word “KiwiSaver” 2.1 The KiwiSaver savings initiative consists of various authorised scheme providers offering their own savings products and services. Care should be taken by the media to correctly identify scheme providers and their schemes and to distinguish them from the overall KiwiSaver savings initiative. For this reason there are certain guidelines that the media should follow when using the word “KiwiSaver”. 2.2 The word “KiwiSaver” should always be used in the following ways: (a) “KiwiSaver” should appear as one word and be spelt with a capital K and capital S. (b) Only use the word “KiwiSaver” on its own when referring to the KiwiSaver savings initiative, for example: “KiwiSaver involves employers, scheme providers and several government agencies.” 2.3 The word “KiwiSaver” should not be used in the following ways: (a) as part of the expression “KiwiSaver fund” as this is an inaccurate way to refer to a KiwiSaver scheme; (b) in conjunction with the name, trading name or trade mark of an organisation; (c) use of the word “KiwiSaver” in an abbreviated or shortened form of a KiwiSaver scheme name (for example, reference to the “XYZ KiwiSaver Scheme” as “XYZ KiwiSaver”); (d) use of any of the expressions “KiwiSavers”, “KiwiSaving” or any other word or term where the word “KiwiSaver” (or a variation of that word) is used as a verb or collective noun; or (e) use of the word “KiwiSaver” in any stylised form or as part of any logo other than as set out in section 3. 4 3. Use of the KiwiSaver Logo 3.1 The KiwiSaver Logo should be used and reproduced without any alterations. The media should use electronically sourced ar twork at all times and Inland Revenue has made appropriate artwork available for download at www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver. The TM symbol should appear with the KiwiSaver Logo as indicated in the examples below. 3.2 The smallest size that the KiwiSaver Logo should appear is 25mm wide for colour and greyscale versions, and 20mm wide for black versions. 3.3 Clear space should be included around the KiwiSaver Logo to ensure the logo isn’t crowded by other graphics. The minimum clear space is determined by the height of the ‘w’ above and below the logo, and the width of the ‘w’ on the sides of the logo. 3.4 The KiwiSaver Logo should be reproduced in the correct colours, or in black and white. If you are printing in full colour, you should reproduce the KiwiSaver Logo in a full colour option. Full-colour version (green and stone) The media should use this when printing in full colour, on a white or very pale background. Single-colour version (green only) The media should use this when printing in single colour, on a white or very pale background. Full-colour version (green and white) The media should use this when printing in full colour, on mid-tone backgrounds. 25mm25mm20mm 5 Full-colour version (stone and white) The media should use this when printing in full colour, on mid to dark-tone backgrounds. Greyscale version The media should use this when printing in black and white, on white backgrounds. This logo must never appear on grey backgrounds. Black version The media should use this when you would use the greyscale version, if it is not possible to use tones. White version The media should use this on black backgrounds. 3.5 Please do not incorporate the KiwiSaver Logo into any other company names, trade marks or logos. 3.6 If using the KiwiSaver Logo on a website: (a)the only link navigable from the KiwiSaver Logo should be to www.ird. govt.nz/kiwisaver and (b)the KiwiSaver Logo should not feature so prominently as to suggest the website is an official government website or has some official government sanction. 3.7 Two colours make up the KiwiSaver colour palette – KiwiSaver stone and KiwiSaver green. KiwiSaver stone Pantone 451 C C–32 M–27 Y–58 K–00 R–178 G–170 B–126 KiwiSaver green Pantone 5753 C C–64 M–42 Y–100 K–29 R–87 G–100 B–35 6 4.Definitions In these guidelines the following terms have the following meanings: “KiwiSaver” means the KiwiSaver savings initiative put in place under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. “KiwiSaver Logo” means the logo that is the subject of New Zealand Trade Mark No. 748366, as amended from time to time by Inland Revenue. “KiwiSaver Trade Marks” means the trade marks that are the subject of New Zealand Trade Mark Nos. 729804, 748366 and 812852, as amended from time to time by Inland Revenue. 7 These trade mark guidelines were updated in August 2020. Please note that they may be amended or updated from time to time. For more information on the KiwiSaver Logo and branding or these guidelines, please contact kiwisavercommunications@ird.govt.nz

Interpretation and definitions 11 3 1. Introduction 1.1 This document sets out certain requirements and standards which must be complied with by any Licensed User who is licensed to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks (“Requirements”). 1.2 These Requirements form part of the KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement between Inland Revenue and each Licensed User. 1.3 Capitalised terms used in this document are defined in section 10.2. 2. KiwiSaver 2.1 The KiwiSaver savings initiative was designed to afford higher levels of consumer protection than other superannuation schemes. It is a voluntary, work-based savings initiative to help New Zealanders with their long-term saving for retirement. 2.2 The KiwiSaver Trade Marks have become recognised and trusted since the KiwiSaver savings initiative was launched in 2007. It is important to ensure that this remains the case. 3. Protecting the KiwiSaver Trade Marks 3.1 Part of Inland Revenue’s role in administering the KiwiSaver savings initiative is to take steps to ensure the KiwiSaver Trade Marks are protected for the benefit of Scheme Providers and the public. 3.2 Inland Revenue has registered the KiwiSaver Trade Marks in various forms as a means of protecting against unauthorised use. 3.3 Inland Revenue also needs to ensure the KiwiSaver Trade Marks are used appropriately in the marketplace and that this use is authorised. This helps to: (a) ensure the public are not confused, misled or deceived; (b) ensure Scheme Providers are treated equally; and (c) maintain the integrity of KiwiSaver and stop the KiwiSaver Trade Marks being damaged or diluted. 3.4 In considering whether to authorise use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks, Inland Revenue will consider a range of factors including the context of the proposed use as well as the identity of the proposed users and the nature of their business. 3.5 Anyone wishing to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks must apply to Inland Revenue for a licence by contacting us at the following address: kiwisavercommunications@ird.govt.nz 3.6 If Inland Revenue agrees to grant a licence, all use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks will be governed by that KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement and these Requirements. 3.7 Although Inland Revenue may authorise use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks, it is the responsibility of all Licensed Users to make sure the information they supply under or in connection with the KiwiSaver Trade Marks is accurate and complies with all laws. 3.8 Any person who uses a KiwiSaver Trade Mark without entering into a KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement risks infringing Inland Revenue’s rights relating to the KiwiSaver Trade Marks including copyright in the KiwiSaver Logo. 4 3.9 Licensed Users are not permitted to sub-license their rights without Inland Revenue’s written approval. Therefore, a Licensed User’s related companies and Distributors will not be licensed to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks unless they also enter into a KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement with Inland Revenue. 4. Using the KiwiSaver Trade Marks 4.1 Licensed Users are entitled to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks as expressly authorised by the terms of their KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement and these Requirements. Licensed Users must not use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks in any other way or for any other purpose. To avoid doubt, this includes use on or in relation to Licensed Users’ marketing material and disclosure documents. 4.2 Unless otherwise specified in their KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement, Licensed Users are only authorised to use: (a) the KiwiSaver Trade Marks in relation to: (i) the marketing, promotion or sale of the Licensed User’s KiwiSaver Scheme where the Licensed User is a Scheme Provider; (ii) the marketing, promotion or sale of another Scheme Provider’s KiwiSaver Scheme in the case of a Distributor who is authorised to market, promote or sell that scheme or an Excluded Adviser; or (iii) education or advisory services relating to the KiwiSaver savings initiative; (b) the word “KiwiSaver” in accordance with section 5 of these Requirements; and (c) the KiwiSaver Logo in accordance with section 6 of these Requirements, and as otherwise authorised or directed by Inland Revenue from time to time in writing. 4.3 Without limiting Inland Revenue’s other rights and remedies, if a Licensed User other than a Scheme Provider: (a) fails to comply with the terms of its KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement or these Requirements, Inland Revenue may notify the Licensed User in writing specifying the failure and requiring it to be remedied; and (b) fails to remedy the failure within 14 days of receiving notice under clause 4.3(a), Inland Revenue may withdraw that Licensed User’s authorisation to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks by giving a further notice in writing in which case the KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement will be terminated and the Licensed User must immediately cease all use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks. Remedies relating to a Scheme Provider’s misuse of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks are set out in the Scheme Provider Agreement between Inland Revenue and the Scheme Provider. 5 5. Use of the word “KiwiSaver” 5.1 The word “KiwiSaver” must always appear as one word and be spelt with a capital K and capital S. 5.2 The word “KiwiSaver” may only be used on its own when referring to the KiwiSaver savings initiative. e.g., “KiwiSaver involves employers, scheme providers and several government agencies.” 5.3 Scheme Providers wanting to use the word “KiwiSaver” in relation to their own KiwiSaver Schemes must do so in accordance with one or more of the following examples: “\[provider name\]’s XYZ KiwiSaver \[scheme/plan\]” “the XYZ KiwiSaver \[scheme/plan\]” “XYZ KiwiSaver \[scheme/plan\]” 5.4 The following examples of use are expressly not permitted on any communication, material or collateral relating to the KiwiSaver savings initiative or a particular KiwiSaver Scheme or Scheme Provider: (a) use of the expression “KiwiSaver fund”; (b) use of the word “KiwiSaver” in conjunction with the name, trading name or trade mark of the Licensed User, except as part of the relevant KiwiSaver Scheme name; (c) use of the word “KiwiSaver” in an abbreviated or shortened form of a KiwiSaver Scheme name (for example, reference to the “XYZ KiwiSaver Scheme” as “XYZ KiwiSaver”); (d) use of any of the expressions “KiwiSavers”, “KiwiSaving” or any other word or term where the word “KiwiSaver” (or a variation of that word) is used as a verb or collective noun; (e) use of the word “KiwiSaver” in any stylised form or as part of any logo other than as set out in section 6; or (f) the use of small or fine print in documentation to define use of the word “KiwiSaver” that does not comply with these Requirements by reference to use that does, unless Inland Revenue expressly authorises the particular use in writing and at its absolute discretion. 5.5 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this clause 5, Scheme Providers are permitted to use the word “KiwiSaver” on its own or in the abbreviated forms described in clause 5.4(c) in domain names, internet/email addresses or 0800 telephone numbers provided that use is not misleading or deceptive and otherwise complies with the terms of their KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement and these Requirements. 5.6 Licensed Users who are not Scheme Providers are not permitted to use the word “KiwiSaver”, or any word that is confusingly similar to the word “KiwiSaver”, in domain names or internet/email addresses unless Inland Revenue expressly authorises the particular use in writing and at its absolute discretion. 5.7 Licensed Users may use the word “KiwiSaver” in their registered company or KiwiSaver Scheme names provided that use complies with the terms of their KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement and these Requirements. 6 6. Use of the KiwiSaver Logo 6.1 Licensed Users must use and reproduce the KiwiSaver Logo without any alterations and must use electronically sourced artwork at all times. The ™ symbol must appear with the KiwiSaver Logo as indicated in the examples below. 6.2 The smallest size that the KiwiSaver Logo can appear is 25mm wide for colour and greyscale versions, and 20mm wide for black versions. 25mm 25mm 20mm 6.3 Clear space must be included around the KiwiSaver Logo to ensure the logo isn’t crowded by other graphics. The minimum clear space is determined by the height of the ‘w’ above and below the logo, and the width of the ‘w’ on the sides of the logo. 6.4 The KiwiSaver Logo must be reproduced in the correct colours, or in black and white. If Licensed Users are printing in full colour, they must reproduce the KiwiSaver Logo in a full colour option. Full-colour version (green and stone) Licensed Users must use this when printing in full colour, on a white or very pale background. Single-colour version (green only) Licensed Users must use this when printing in single colour, on a white or very pale background. Full-colour version (green and white) Licensed Users must use this when printing in full colour, on mid- tone backgrounds. 7 Full-colour version (stone and white) Licensed Users must use this when printing in full colour, on mid to dark-tone backgrounds. Greyscale version Licensed Users must use this when printing in black and white, on white backgrounds. This logo must never appear on grey backgrounds. Black version Licensed Users must use this when you would use the greyscale version, if it is not possible to use tones. White version Licensed Users must use this on black backgrounds. 6.5 The KiwiSaver Logo must not be incorporated into any of the Licensed User’s company names, trade marks or logos. 6.6 Subject to clause 6.7, the KiwiSaver Logo must not be used on the Licensed User’s stationery such as letterhead or business cards. The main reasons for this include: (a) correspondence on or in connection with the stationery may not always relate to KiwiSaver and the use of the KiwiSaver Logo may mislead recipients into believing it is related; and (b) use on letterhead, business cards and other stationery can mislead the public about the authority of the person using that stationery. For example, the public may be misled that the person has some official government status or is in fact a Scheme Provider when they are not. 8 6.7 Scheme Providers may use the KiwiSaver Logo on member statements and correspondence to members of its KiwiSaver Scheme provided that the logo is used together with: (a) the full name of the relevant Scheme Provider’s KiwiSaver Scheme; and (b) the relevant Scheme Provider’s logo. 6.8 The KiwiSaver Logo can be used on websites, as long as the Licensed User ensures that: (a) the only link navigable from the KiwiSaver Logo is to www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver ; (b) the KiwiSaver Logo does not feature so prominently as to suggest the website is an official government website or has some official government sanction; and (c) in the case of Licensed Users who are not also Scheme Providers, the website prominently features the following disclaimer: “This website is operated by XYZ and is not endorsed by, or affiliated with, the New Zealand government or Inland Revenue. XYZ is using the KiwiSaver trade mark and logo under licence from Inland Revenue. To view the official New Zealand government KiwiSaver website, please click here.” \[link to www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver \]. 6.9 Two colours make up the KiwiSaver colour palette – KiwiSaver stone and KiwiSaver green.

Use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks by Distributors 7.1 When promoting, marketing, distributing, supplying or selling another person’s KiwiSaver Scheme product, Licensed Users who are Distributors or Excluded Advisers must: (a) ensure it is clear in all correspondence, promotional material and dealings that they are promoting, marketing, distributing, supplying or selling another person’s KiwiSaver Scheme product and not their own; (b) clearly identify the Scheme Provider and the Scheme Provider’s KiwiSaver Scheme (by reference to the official name of the registered KiwiSaver Scheme as registered with the Financial Markets Authority) that is being promoted, marketed, distributed, supplied or sold; (c) not re-brand another person’s KiwiSaver Scheme or KiwiSaver Scheme product as their own or under their own trade mark or trading name; and (d) only co-brand another person’s KiwiSaver Scheme or KiwiSaver Scheme product if it is clear in all communications and throughout all written materials (together, the ‘material’): (i) who the Scheme Provider is; and (ii) what the KiwiSaver Scheme’s official name is (as registered with the Financial Markets Authority). All Licensed Users, including Scheme Providers, must ensure this information features prominently throughout the material so that it is explicitly clear to the public, from first impressions, who the Scheme Provider is and what the official name of the KiwiSaver Scheme is. 7.2 Where Licensed Users engage employees, agents or contractors to help them to promote, market, distribute, supply or sell another person’s KiwiSaver Scheme product, they must ensure the employees, agents and contractors are reputable, trustworthy and have sufficient skills, experience and qualifications to promote, market, distribute, supply or sell the KiwiSaver Scheme product in a manner that is accurate, ethical, legal and not misleading. 7.3 Licensed Users must only promote KiwiSaver Schemes registered by the Financial Markets Authority as KiwiSaver Schemes. 8. General requirements 8.1 The KiwiSaver Trade Marks must not be used in a way which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. Without limitation, Licensed Users must ensure: (a) it is clear what goods or services they are offering in connection with their use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks; and (b) they do not make any false representations or suggestions as to their status or as to any authority or accreditation they or their goods and services have obtained. 8.2 Without limiting section 8.1, Licensed Users must not use the word “accredited”, or any similar words, in connection with the KiwiSaver Trade Marks if that use gives any suggestion that the Licensed User has obtained any official government accreditation or sanction in relation to the KiwiSaver savings initiative. 8.3 The KiwiSaver Trade Marks must only be used for legal purposes and must not be used in connection with any illegal activity. 10 8.4 Licensed Users must ensure: (a) the goods and services they supply under or in connection with the KiwiSaver Trade Marks: (i) are of a consistently high standard and quality; and (ii) comply with all laws and regulations; (b) the information and documentation they provide to third parties, including external reporting houses, complies with the Requirements; and (c) the methods they and their Distributors employ to promote, market, distribute, supply and sell KiwiSaver Scheme products comply with all laws and regulations including, without limitation, all laws and regulations relating to the marketing and sale of financial products and securities. 8.5 Each Licensed User agrees: (a) not to use the KiwiSaver Trade Marks in any way that would tend to allow them to become generic, lose their distinctiveness, become liable to mislead the public, or be detrimental to or inconsistent with the good name, goodwill, reputation and image of Inland Revenue or the KiwiSaver savings initiative; (b) not to misrepresent any aspect of the KiwiSaver savings initiative or any KiwiSaver Scheme or give any false or misleading information about either of them; (c) not to engage in any misleading, deceptive, unethical or illegal practices in relation to the KiwiSaver savings initiative or any KiwiSaver Scheme or Scheme Provider; (d) not to do anything to harm the reputation of the KiwiSaver savings initiative; (e) to immediately cease any behaviour or activity that is in breach of these Requirements; and (f) to report to Inland Revenue in writing if they become aware of any third party making use of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks other than in accordance with the Requirements or in any way that prejudices the distinctiveness and value of the KiwiSaver Trade Marks; and (g) to ensure its employees, agents and contractors comply with these Requirements. 8.6 Without limiting section 7, each Licensed User who is a Scheme Provider agrees: (a) not to re-brand it’s KiwiSaver Scheme or KiwiSaver Scheme product, or allow it to be re-branded, under another person’s trade mark or trading name or under a name that is different from its KiwiSaver Scheme’s official name as registered with the Financial Markets Authority; and (b) to only co-brand it’s KiwiSaver Scheme or KiwiSaver Scheme product if it is clear in all communications and throughout all written materials (together, ‘the material’): (i) who the Scheme Provider is; and (ii) what the KiwiSaver Scheme’s official name is (as registered with the Financial Markets Authority). All Licensed Users, including Distributors and Excluded Advisers, must ensure this information features prominently throughout the material so that it is explicitly clear to the public, from first impressions, who the Scheme Provider is and what the official name of the KiwiSaver Scheme is. 11 9. Changes to these Requirements 9.1 These Requirements may be changed from time to time by Inland Revenue including where Inland Revenue considers it necessary or desirable to change them as a result of legislative or regulatory change, the introduction of new legislation or regulation, developments in the industry, or changes to Inland Revenue’s branding or brand management strategy. 9.2 Inland Revenue intends to consult with Licensed Users who are Scheme Providers on all changes to these Requirements unless Inland Revenue considers consultation to be unnecessary or inappropriate in the circumstances. Inland Revenue will notify Scheme Providers of the timing and nature of any consultation at the time it is undertaken. 9.3 Subject to clause 9.2, any revised final version of the Requirements will become effective 30 days after it is made available to the public and to all Licensed Users. 9.4 Although the amended version of the Requirements will be effective after the 30 day period referred to in clause 9.3, certain changes may not have to be implemented immediately. For example, Inland Revenue may allow a phase out period for any outdated branding. 9.5 Licensed Users may terminate their KiwiSaver Trade Mark Licence Agreement by giving notice in writing to Inland Revenue if they do not accept any changes made to these Requirements. 9.6 Where a Licensed User is licensed under a Scheme Provider Agreement, the change management process set out in clause 11 of the Scheme Provider Agreement will not apply to changes to these Requirements.

[Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-kiwisaver-homestart-and-remedial-matters-act-2015 "Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015")

KiwiSaver withdrawals for first home buyers
===========================================

2015 amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 means a first home withdrawal amount can be used for payments before the purchase agreement goes unconditional.

_Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, clause 8(7)(c)_

The KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended so a KiwiSaver first home withdrawal amount can be used to make payments before the purchase agreement on a new home goes unconditional (to pay a deposit, for example).

### Background

Under the previous rules, eligible KiwiSaver members who wanted to withdraw their savings to purchase their first home were unable to do so until the agreement for sale and purchase became unconditional. Consequently, whenever the agreement for sale and purchase was still subject to conditions at the time a deposit was to be paid, a first home buyer was unable to use their KiwiSaver savings to pay that deposit.

### Key features

The KiwiSaver Scheme Rules in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 have been amended to allow KiwiSaver members to withdraw their savings to purchase their first home before the agreement is unconditional, provided any payment is made to "a stakeholder". That person is usually the vendor's solicitor, who can only release the funds in appropriate circumstances. Thus, first home buyers whose purchase agreements are conditional will be able to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings to pay a deposit.

Wherever possible, the objective is for KiwiSaver savings that are withdrawn under this rule to be used to purchase a home or returned to the KiwiSaver funds manager.

When the purchase agreement is unconditional, the original rules continue to apply, except that a solicitor's undertaking is now compulsory. Before the KiwiSaver savings can be withdrawn, the purchaser's solicitor must provide an undertaking to the funds manager that the withdrawal will either be paid to the vendors as part of the purchase price or will be repaid to the funds manager on behalf of the member if settlement of the agreement is not completed in accordance with the agreement.

When the agreement is conditional, before the KiwiSaver savings can be withdrawn, the purchaser's solicitor must provide an undertaking to the funds manager that:

*   payment of any amount of the withdrawal will be held by a stakeholder;
*   the stakeholder is obliged to hold the amount while the agreement is conditional;
*   the stakeholder is obliged to repay the amount to the purchaser's solicitor if settlement of the agreement is not completed in accordance with the agreement, except when non-completion is due to the purchaser's default; and
*   when settlement does not occur, the purchaser's solicitor will repay the amount they receive from the vendor's solicitor to the funds manager on behalf of the member.

### Application date

The amendment came into force on 1 June 2015.

### Detailed analysis

An agreement is conditional if it describes actions or events that must take place before the purchase can be settled.

### _Form of solicitor's undertaking_

When the purchase agreement is unconditional, the forms of undertaking currently used by the industry can continue to be used.

When the purchase agreement is conditional, the Government interprets the Act to require the solicitor to undertake no more than what the solicitor can control:

*   The solicitor is being asked to undertake that the stakeholder is under an obligation to hold the payment while the agreement is conditional, not that the stakeholder will actually do so in practice.
*   If the agreement fails to settle other than by reason of the purchaser's default, the solicitor is being asked to undertake that the stakeholder is under an obligation to repay the amount owed, not that the stakeholder will actually repay that amount.

Consequently, the following form of undertaking is considered to satisfy the Act:

"We undertake to you that:

1.  as at the date of this undertaking, the purchase agreement is conditional;
2.  payment of any funds that we receive on behalf of the Member (Funds) will be held by a stakeholder who is obliged -
    1.  to hold the Funds while the agreement is conditional; and
    2.  to repay the Funds to us if settlement of the agreement is not completed in accordance with the agreement by the due date or any extended due date, except where settlement is not completed due to the Member's default; and
3.  we will repay to you as soon as practicable on account of the Member any Funds that the stakeholder repays to us.

The relevant undertakings above are restricted to confirming that the stakeholder is under an obligation to hold the funds while the agreement is conditional and to confirming that the stakeholder is under an obligation to repay funds to us in the event that settlement of the agreement is not completed. We make no undertaking that the stakeholder will actually do so in either case and accept no liability in the event that the stakeholder acts in breach of their obligations."
\[UNCLASSIFIED\] Resurgence Support Payment for the August 2021 Alert Level Changes Who can get the payment The Resurgence Support Payment is for businesses and organisations, including sole traders, with a drop in revenue due to the current Alert Level Change. It is in addition to the Wage Subsidy and other COVID payments. They must have actually experienced at least a 30%drop in revenue over a 7-day period of raised Alert Levels, and the reduced revenue must be due to the raised Alert Level. This decrease in revenue is compared with a typical 7-day revenue period in the 6 weeks prior to 17 August 21.

Executive Summary This report presents the findings from the KPMG Independent Quality Assurance Review 12 (IQA12) and Technical Quality Assurance Review 11 (TQA11) of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation Programme (BT Programme). The objective of this review is to provide independent assurance to the Programme Sponsor, considering the perspectives of relevant stakeholders, and external monitoring agencies. 1.1 Background to our review Inland Revenue (IR) has been working to meet the Government’s expectations of a public sector that delivers smarter, modern services for less., and where applicable, is aligned to the Government’s Strategy and Action Plan and to meet IR’s own strategic ambition of being a Government organisation that delivers world-class services to its customers and stakeholders. During 2011, IR began a journey to reduce the risk of its aging revenue system, by making the case for substantial re-investment in the organisation and its ICT systems; this became the Business Transformation Programme (BT). Following the presentation of the Programme Business Case to Treasury and the Minister and Cabinet, the Transformation Programme entered the Mobilisation phase in December 2013. The Programme Business Case was approved by Ministers in the first quarter of 2014, and a Cabinet paper that sought drawdown of funding was approved in April 2014 for the Programme through to the beginning of January 2015, the Pre-Design phase. During the Mobilisation and Pre-Design Preparation phases of the Programme, Accenture were selected as the Programme partner for the High Level and Detailed Design phases, and a procurement process selected a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) solution to provide core tax processing capability. FAST Enterprises (FAST) were selected as the vendor and have been working with IR since August 2015 to develop the requisite systems’ functionality. Prior releases of BT went live in accordance with the Programme’s Stage and Release plans, and the now final stage of the BT Programme, Stage 4, is scheduled to go live in October 2021. Stage 4 includes a final major START release, (Release 4.2) which will complete the core tax and social policy solution (START). The key Core Tax and Social Policy changes implemented in Stage 4 includes transitioning child support, paid parental leave, unclaimed monies, duties and foreign trusts into START. When all core tax and social policy products and services are enabled in START, the Programme will commence the decommissioning of FIRST. There will be no further co- existence. In addition to the final major START release (Release 4.2), the final stage of the BT Programme includes: — Decommissioning all non–enduring (heritage) services, systems and applications including FIRST, and all satellite processes and functions, Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and SAP which is used for HR processes including payroll. — A Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO) Programme, which aims to ensure that IR’s technical environments are simplified, enduring, suitable for IR, and sustainable for technology operations to operate once IR concludes the BT Programme. — Conclusion of the ‘Intelligence-Led’ and ‘Ātea’ programmes, having progressively transitioned new capabilities to IR, and with the implementation of the new operating model, is focused on ensuring that IR is embedding the capabilities delivered by transformation, into the way IR will work post BT. In some cases, capability has already started to transition to BAU such as Information, Knowledge and Management (IKM), Data and Intelligence practices (DIP) and Cloud Services. 5 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. — The BT Programme will continue to progressively transition capability to IR and at the completion of Early Life Support for START Release 4.2 (including the Pou Whirinaki process), the finalisation of the TLO Programme and conclusion of the decommission and archiving activity, the Programme will formally close. 1.2 Summary terms of reference To support the delivery of the Programme, IR has engaged KPMG to provide Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) across the Programme. This review follows prior KPMG reviews through the earlier Programme stages, and documents the twelfth IQA cycle, and the eleventh TQA. The detailed approach and scope are set out at Appendices 5.1 and 5.2, and the terms of reference for this review were confirmed in the Consultancy Services Order agreed between IR and KPMG in June 2021. Our terms of reference address both IQA and TQA, in order to provide stakeholders with a broad assessment of the status of the Programme, and our review was performed in July 2021, when we reviewed documents and artefacts that were current at that time. 1.3 Overview of our assessment Since our prior review (IQA 11/TQA 10, July 2020), the Programme has gone live with START Release 4.1 and IR, and the BT Programme, have also experienced considerable disruption related to COVID-19. IR’s business response to COVID-19 has included tax changes to free up cashflow, a loss carry-back scheme and a small business loan scheme, demonstrating that it now has the capability to deliver new products and services within weeks rather than years. This business agility, along with the resilience in sustaining the delivery cadence for the remainder of the BT Programme, is testament to the benefits being realised from the investment in BT, the leadership across the enterprise and within the BT Programme. In this review we noted that, by constituting ‘Workstream five’, the BT Programme continues to address the issue of how best to transition the residual BT capability into the broader organisation after the next, final customer-facing release. In this review we have also noted that: — Across the stakeholders and IRD customers that we interviewed during our fieldwork, the feedback was generally positive in recognising the successful implementation and ‘bedding down’ of prior releases, and the responsiveness of the BT Programme to customer feedback for continuous improvement. Stakeholders are also aware of the general customer experience benefits that will be delivered in the next release, with the upgrade to ‘Version 12’ of the Gentax platform. — The Programme continues to balance the tension between pace of delivery, risk, and resource capacity/capability. This is now acute, with the requirement to sustain delivery capability through this final release being managed alongside heightened competition for skilled staff across the broader Government sector, and business environment. — The continuing effectiveness of the Programme governance and management processes is apparent, demonstrating that the Programme remains well-managed. With respect to the schedule for Release 4.2, the Programme is generally progressing in line with expectations. Although the end date for Business System Testing (BST) has slipped, the overall status is broadly comparable to the equivalent stage in prior releases (when, in similar circumstances, BST has come to overlap Scaled Business- Simulation (SBS) testing). Concurrent with our review, IRD have had to vacate their Wellington head office (Asteron House) for reasons of building resilience. Mitigation is currently underway with some targeted co-location offices having been secured, alongside remote working models, to mitigate the impact on BT (which has been resilient in the face of prior COVID-related disruption). 6 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. Otherwise, with respect to the Programme status, we noted in particular: — The Programme leadership team continues to push the teams for further/continuous improvement, challenge any tendency to complacency, and drive appropriate focus on management of risk and contingency. — While comparisons with prior releases provide good ‘leading indicators’, the risk-profile in this release is different, due to the significant complexity of the Child Support product involved, the relative scarcity of SMEs, and some significant related residual risks with a vulnerable and high-profile client base. It is apparent that IR is aware of this complexity, and the reputational risk associated with the vulnerable customer base for child-support. IR acknowledge some significant associated risks and challenges that remain. These are, in part, being mitigated by initiatives to bolster the contact centre’s capacity and focus on effective triage of any customer issues through the early-life support processes. — Leveraging lessons from prior releases, the data cleansing and validation activity commenced relatively early in this release, and this has paid dividends in the early identification and mitigation of data-related issues (particularly instances of poor quality in the pre-existing customer data). That said, some related risks remain and will need to be monitored carefully though the upcoming Mock Go-Live (MG) and SBS activity. — The prior approach to system testing has been modified in this release and has included a greater reliance on early ‘verification’ from the supplier, to allow IR’s SMEs to focus effort towards risk-based testing. This initiative, alongside the effective use of automated testing in validating the Child Support assessment engine, has succeeded in substantially reducing the overall effort expended in BST. We have, though, raised some associated concerns, relating primarily to comprehensiveness and adequacy of the resulting test coverage (particularly in SBS), visibility of test status, and how that will provide the necessary confidence in the quality of the Child Support functionality that is being rolled-out. — Release 4.2 will end FAST’s co-existence with legacy systems and represents a significant milestone for IR, in the optimisation of the systems’ architecture. The associated Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO) initiative has been a highly complex undertaking, which continues to run in parallel with Release 4.2. It also requires that any necessary residual capability is established in the target-state organisational design, to ensure that the BT Programme itself may be safely decommissioned. In our experience, organisations often find this final step challenging, and we are pleased to see that the TLO Programme continues to demonstrate strong leadership and effective delivery and is on-schedule to conclude mid-2022. — IR remains very focused on benefits realisation from BT, and that the department’s ongoing part in the COVID-19 response, including the implementation of the resurgence support payment, demonstrates in part the organisational agility which has been enabled through the BT Programme. Given that the upcoming release is the final customer-facing delivery from the BT Programme, and the residual tasks (including BAU transition and demobilisation of the Programme) are scheduled to be complete by June 2022, IR are now in the final, acute stage of managing the associated change and human resource challenges. It is apparent that this continues to be generally effective in managing the tension between sustaining the business change through the medium-term, while demobilising the BT Programme. As for prior releases, IR’s leadership appear generally well-informed and engaged in the run-up to go-live, and are also managing succession plans for key staff who have been deployed in the Programme and who will be in strong demand in the current business climate. In the short-term, we recommend that they continue to carefully monitor: — Progress, status, and coverage of the ongoing testing and MGL processes to ensure that they provide the necessary validation of the quality of the delivered solution, and that outcomes are in accordance with IR’s risk appetite. — Establishment and capacity of the early-life support, triage and contact centre capacity, so they are ready to deal with the inevitable post-go-live ‘teething troubles’, particularly for Child Support. — Progress of the communications rollout, noting the complexities of this customer group, and the need to process any feedback that might be received in addition to that revealed through CIT testing. 7 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. It is also apparent that the sector is increasingly recognising the importance of leveraging the learning from IRD’s BT experience. In our view this would ideally be managed in a structured way (as the opportunity will be reduced once the core BT team has been disestablished). This includes potential for: — Publication/provision of knowledge-management and other BT assets, for use cross-sector. — People, skills, and capability sharing (including transitioning staff in a managed and targeted fashion). — Structured coaching and mentoring on a peer-to-peer basis, to build specific skills and capabilities cross-sector. — Propagation of methodology, techniques and lessons learned across a sector-wide network. — Encourage IR/BT staff to participate in Gateway review teams. This would ideally be directed and coordinated across the sector, while IRD sustain the Programme delivery focus, and remain responsive to these broader needs.

The objective of this review is to provide independent assurance to the Programme Sponsor, considering the perspectives of relevant stakeholders, and external monitoring agencies. 1.1 Background to our review Inland Revenue (IR) has been working to meet the Government’s expectations of a Public Sector that delivers smarter, modern services for less, and where applicable, is aligned to the Government’s Strategy and Action Plan and to meet IR’s own strategic ambition of being a Government organisation that delivers world class services to its customers and stakeholders.

Following the presentation of the Programme Business Case to Treasury, the Minister and Cabinet, the Transformation Programme entered the Mobilisation Phase in December 2013. The Programme Business Case was approved by Ministers in the first quarter of 2014, and a Cabinet paper that sought drawdown of funding was approved in April 2014 for the Programme through to the beginning of January 2015, the Pre-Design phase.

Prior releases of BT went live in accordance with the planned deployment approach, and START Release 4.0 is scheduled to go live in April 2020. The key changes implemented through Release 4.0 include: — Moving administration of KiwiSaver and student loans to the START systems platform. — Enhancements to Working for Families Tax Credits. — Further changes for employers including moving the end-to-end processing of employer obligations into START, bringing PAYE, student loans, Child Support, KiwiSaver (KSE and KSR) and tax withheld on KiwiSaver contributions (ESCT) into a single consolidated employer online account. — More frequent reporting of investment income information becomes mandatory. — Implementing the Government’s new R&D tax incentives and write-off rules. — Changes to payment options, to allow cheque payments by exception only. © 2020 KPMG, a New Zealand partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

Although START Release 4.0 has a smaller user community than Release 3.0, it has other, technical challenges (including a scale and complexity in the data-migration) that will put increased pressure on the cutover window, with a consequent elevated level of risk through the transition period. 1.2 Summary terms of reference To support the delivery of the Programme, IR has engaged KPMG to provide Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) across the Programme. This review follows prior KPMG reviews through the earlier Programme stages, and the detailed approach and scope are set out at Appendices 5.1 and 5.2. The terms of reference for this review were confirmed in the Consultancy Services Order agreed between IR and KPMG, dated 23rd December 2019. Our terms of reference address both IQA and TQA, in order to provide stakeholders with a broad assessment of the status of the Programme, and our review was performed in January and February 2020, when we reviewed documents and artefacts that were current at that time. Consequently, a number of these artefacts were in draft and work-in-progress (our agreement with the Programme is that we review draft artefacts for context, and not critique them in detail), and may have been amended since. Our approach has been to perform a risk-based assessment considering the stage of the Programme lifecycle, and in this report: — The IQA 11 review has focussed on readiness for START Release 4.0 ‘go live’ primarily from a solution, change-management and stakeholder engagement perspective. We have also considered the Programme’s governance, and decision-making frameworks, to verify that they remain robust. — The TQA 10 review has considered data migration and custom software as well as production readiness, preparation for the FAST V12 upgrade and TLO. We have also reviewed business continuity and disaster-recovery planning. The review includes findings and recommendations relevant to the current stage of the Programme lifecycle, and the detailed terms of reference are included in this document as Appendix 1. We have also considered the Programme’s progress on recommendations made under prior reviews. © 2020 KPMG, a New Zealand partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

The Programme has also maintained its focus on quality of delivery and continuous improvement, and in particular we were pleased in this review to note: — The continuing effectiveness of the Programme governance and management processes, which ensures that the Programme remains well-controlled. — The effectiveness of the Programme readiness and business-readiness processes, that afford a transparent and granular view of status, and allow executive and governance stakeholders to understand how readiness for Release 4.0 has matured over time, and where remediation is necessary. — Ongoing focus on communications and stakeholder engagement, which is reflected in the positive feedback we received from third-party interviewees. It is apparent, also, that the state of readiness for the START Release 4.0 solution (primarily as reflected in the progress of the test activity, and related metrics) is generally in-line with expectations, and broadly comparable with Release 3.0 at a comparable point in the schedule. However, Release 4.0 is significantly different from prior releases, in that the non-tax products (student loans and KiwiSaver) present different challenges to those faced before, and at the time of our review there are substantive issues apparent in readiness of some specific areas, which relate to: — The data migration, which is experiencing issues related to the volume and complexity of the data-set being migrated in support of student loans and KiwiSaver products, resulting in some critical-path pressure and some ‘ringfenced’ crown reconciliation issues which we understand will be carried forward for resolution after the release 4.0 go-live. Consequently, the status of the ‘Mock Go-Live’ (‘MGL’) process is significantly behind expectations; both the MGL 1 and MGL 2 checkpoints have revealed some issues which indicate ‘knock-on’ risks to the cutover activity. — The overall business readiness for Release 4.0 which is less apparent than of prior releases, with the evident pressure of the cumulative impact of change from prior BT releases, and the imminent reorganisation competing for attention and resourcing across the organisation. Our assessment at this point is that BT Programme management and IR’s leadership are generally doing all that they reasonably can to mitigate the known risks and secure the Release 4.0 go-live, as planned. There is also a contingency plan, in the event that the risks to the planned go-live data prove to be unsustainable. While management attention is understandably focussed on the Release 4.0 go-live, our review has also considered a ‘look ahead’ into Release 5.0, where we have noted: — With respect to the cutover of child-support into START in Release 5.0, our experience is that implementations of child-support systems with a vulnerable and high- profile client-base are generally highly-complex. It is apparent that IR understands this complexity, and FAST are also building capability in this area, and have committed to this in their core product. At this early stage the associated design activity is on schedule. — Release 5.0 will end FAST’s co-existence with legacy systems, de-commission those legacy systems and optimise the target systems landscape. This will be a complex undertaking, and progress in the associated Technology Landscape Optimisation (‘TLO’) initiative is broadly in line with expectations. — As de-commissioning of the BT Programme will run in parallel with delivery of START Release 5.0, the end-state organisational design for IR will require that any necessary residual capability is established concurrently (through the Future Change Capability, ‘FCC’), In this review, we noted that the He Kotuitui initiative is © 2020 KPMG, a New Zealand partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

We have recommended that this focus needs to broaden, to ensure that the wider He Kotuitui / FCC objectives can be met, and to secure realisation of the intended benefits from BT. Going forward, IRD must continue to sustain the Programme delivery focus, while being responsive to these broader business requirements. This is an ongoing theme in our reviews and, in our view, the Programme has managed this tension effectively to-date. The inherent resource-constraints mean, however, that IR must constantly balance demands for a limited pool of human resources and expertise (including IRD’s leadership team), with the need to both stabilise and optimise prior releases, as well as deliver the next release at pace. The PGC should continue to monitor this tension carefully, particularly now with respect to START Release 5.0, establishment of the ‘Future Change Capability’ and the de-commissioning of the BT Programme.

Executive Summary This report presents the findings from the KPMG Technical Quality Assurance Review 12 (TQA12) of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation Programme (BT Programme). The objective of this review is to provide independent assurance to the Programme Sponsor on decommissioning activities of heritage services, systems and applications, considering the perspectives of relevant stakeholders, and external monitoring agencies 1.1 Background to our review Inland Revenue (IR) has been working to meet the Government’s expectations of a Public Sector that delivers smarter, modern services for less, and where applicable, is aligned to the Government’s Strategy and Action Plan and to meet IR’s own strategic ambition of being a government organisation that delivers world class services to its customers and stakeholders. During 2011, IR began a journey to reduce the risk of its aging revenue system through the Business Transformation Programme (‘BT’). Prior releases of BT went live in accordance with the planned deployment approach. The final major release of the START functionality, which successfully went live in 2021 resulted in all of BT’s customer-facing changes having now been completed. The business functionality for all core tax and social policy products and services are now in START, and the successful completion of this major milestone in turn enabled the final decommissioning of the legacy FIRST system. In addition to transitioning the business functionality from FIRST, the Technology Landscape Optimisation Programme (‘TLO’) has been conducted in parallel, in order to ensure that IR’s technical environments are simplified, enduring, suitable for IR, and sustainable for Technology Operations to operate when the BT Programme is closed in June. The associated work includes decommissioning all non–enduring (‘heritage’) services, systems and applications (including FIRST) and all satellite processes and functions. This, in turn, has enabled IR to rationalise and optimise the I.T. infrastructure, including IR’s ultimate exit from the Unisys data-centre. 1.2 Summary terms of reference To support the delivery of the Programme, IR has engaged KPMG to provide Independent Quality Assurance (IQA) and Technical Quality Assurance (TQA) across the Programme. This review follows prior KPMG reviews through the earlier Programme stages, and documents the results of the twelfth TQA cycle. The detailed approach and scope are set out at Appendices 5.1 and 5.2, and the terms of reference for this review were confirmed in the Consultancy Services Order agreed between IR and KPMG in March 2022. Our terms of reference focus on the TQA, and specifically the work-in-progress on decommissioning activities prior to the final BT programme closure. 4 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. 1.3 Overview of our assessment We have been asked to report on the decommissioning of heritage systems, and specifically: — whether IR has executed the Stage 4 decommissioning and archiving plan or is well placed to do so, and — to confirm that any commercial contracts for heritage systems has, or will be discontinued, in line with the decommissioning plan. With respect to the decommissioning and archiving plan, we are pleased to report that the prior high standard of the associated project management processes and controls has continued to be applied through these activities. The Governance has been well-integrated and informed, the associated change management activity has been effective, and IR stakeholders are well-informed with respect to any hand-offs from the TLO Programme. At the time of our fieldwork we noted that the final systems decommissioning has concluded, and this enables the handover to Unisys to take place as planned on 18th April. The responsibility then vests with Unisys to decommission the data-centre. At this time there is still some small, residual risk of an unknown emerging dependency; however, given the systematic and rigorous planning that has been carried out this risk is, in our view, very low and well-managed. With respect to the commercial contracts for heritage systems, it is apparent that these activities have been planned and managed diligently, in order to optimise IR’s commercial position while preparing to exit the Unisys data-centre. This has required significant management and stakeholder-engagement (both within and outside IR) to ensure that the requisite data-retention and disposal conditions have been met, and that the associated disposal is conducted in a way that is secure, ethical and sustainable. Our review of these activities confirms that they have been conducted and documented to a high standard, and we are comfortable that the commercial arrangements have been, or will be, discontinued or transitioned as appropriate, and in line with the decommissioning plan. Taking a broader perspective (as this is our final review of the TLO workstreams in the context of IR’s BT Programme) we should also note the scale and significance of this achievement. Having conducted multiple reviews of the TLO Programme since its inception in 2017, we have consistently reported on the high quality of the Programme’s planning and execution. Furthermore, given the highly technical and complex nature of the work being undertaken ‘behind the scenes’, it would be easy to underestimate the significance of the TLO Programme’s contribution to the broader BT objectives and benefits. In our experience, technical debt is often overlooked as a significant factor in ‘Transformation’ initiatives, and can easily erode benefits unless actively managed. This Programme has, in our view, done an exemplary job of enabling IR to exit the Unisys data-centre, while also aggressively reducing technical debt, in order to deliver a sustainable and cost-effective technology architecture to support IR in the future. We commend IR’s management of the TLO Programme for this successful milestone in preparation for exiting the Unisys data-centre. Given also the broader Government strategy to migrate towards outsourced cloud-services, many other agencies are, or will be, facing into similar challenges, and we consider that many could benefit from the approaches and experience of the TLO Programme. We would recommend that IR (and the Central Agencies) should take every opportunity to ensure that this knowledge is captured and leveraged across the sector. 5 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Technical Quality Assurance Review 12 (TQA12) 2.1 Status of the Stage 4 decommissioning and archiving plan Assessment Recommendations Rating Conclusion: The BT Stage 4 decommissioning and archiving plan is likely to conclude on schedule Since our prior review (IQA12 / TQA11, December 2021). The Decommissioning and Archiving (‘D&A’) activities (as a part of the TLO Programme) have continued with activities to decommission the heritage systems, archive any data that is to be retained, and then remove the systems, databases and underlying infrastructure for appropriate, secure and ethical disposal. To understand the current status of the Stage 4 decommissioning and archiving plan, we have reviewed the following controls: Schedule management and reporting We noted that the recent D&A activity has generally continued in accordance with the overall schedule. The Programme did encounter a substantive issue, however with the planned go live of Tranche 1 of the intended Identity Governance and Access (IGA) solution (OneIdentity Manager) late in 2021. This was significant,as it posed a risk to the critical-path, and prompted a detailed retrospective review of the delivery process and associated lessons-learned. This resulted in a pivot to a re-prioritised implementation into two waves (‘Implementation 1’ and ‘Implementation 2’), where the first focussed solely on decommissioning of heritage Identity Management services in Unisys, in order to support the data-centre exit, and sustain the intended decommissioning date. This had the effect of increasing the D&A risk-profile through recent months; however, concurrent with our review we were pleased to note that ‘Implementation 1’ had successfully gone live, so that risk is now mitigated. There have also been a number of other ‘unplanned dependencies’ uncovered as work has progressed, including discovery of a recent issue with an undocumented application (Password Manager pro). These are, in our assessment, inevitable given the nature of the work being conducted, and the team have demonstrated agility in responding with effective mitigations (in this case, by rapidly migrating the application to an alternate ‘Cloud’ platform). Otherwise we noted that progress had continued largely on-schedule since our prior review, including 33 applications being decommissioned as planned in March (including a major milestone with the decommissioning of the legacy Enterprise Data Warehouse (‘EDW’). Recommendation TQA12/1 IR (and the Central Agencies) should take every opportunity to ensure that this knowledge gained (methodology, experience and lessons learned) from the TLO Programme, are captured and leveraged across the sector.

The substantive residual work included replacement of IR’s — Print Services solution, which migrates from legacy technology and introduces a new supplier and services to provides IR with greater flexibility. There had been some COVID-related delays to this workstream. — Remote Access solution, allowing the contact centre to work remotely, and also FAST to provide offshore support, by introducing a new managed service. At the time of our review, e were pleased to note that these had been concluded and therefore that all customer-facing legacy functionality had now been decommissioned. This leaves the final removal of back-end systems currently in-hand, in order that the network connections and supporting services can be shut down, and the process of dismantling and disposing of the infrastructure is intended to start. The BT programme has also transferred responsibility for management of the non-production environments to Technology Services. Governance The Decommissioning and Archiving (‘D&A’) activities have continued to operate within the TLO Programme and the established BT Governance structure. Given the technical nature of the Programme, the TLO Governance group has supported the PGC, and stakeholders that we spoke with continued to express a high level of satisfaction with the quality, reliability and transparency of the information on the D&A work, and the interaction with the Governance groups, and consequently confidence that the D&A objectives would be achieved. Given that the BT programme will close down by 30th June, we understand that ongoing governance of any subsequent activities will be progressed under the post-BT governance model including technology delivery. Consequently, the TLO team is currently working with technology services to transition oversight of any ongoing work, including work assigned to Enterprise Services PD&D to progress. Risk Management Now that the final major release of START has been handed over to BAU operations on 31 January 2022 as planned, successfully ending the period of core systems’ co-existence, IR’s transition-related residual risk is relatively low. That said, the over-arching BT risk-management processes have continued to be applied in the Decommissioning & Archiving activity, and it is evident that the TLO Programme Management team have continued to exercise diligent risk-management in closing out the residual activity. This is prudent as, in our experience, failing to manage risk adequately in the close-out Programme stage is a common cause of benefits erosion. In particular, failure to secure the target end-date often leads to cost overruns. Furthermore, the risk of carrying forward technical debt is often overlooked as a significant factor in ‘Transformation’ initiatives, and can easily erode benefits unless actively managed. 7 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. Our assessment is that the TLO Programme has done an exemplary job of managing these risks by focussing on securing the intended outcomes, to allow IR to exit the UDC on the target date, and deliver a sustainable and cost-effective technology architecture support IR in the future. Stakeholder Management Our review of D&A documentation indicates that IR’s executive management, and other stakeholders, have been well-informed, and the associated change-management and transition activity has been highly effective. Furthermore, IR stakeholders whom we interviewed all confirmed that that they are well-informed about the Programme, and commended the openness and transparency regarding D&A activities. They also commented that they had confidence with respect to any internal hand-offs from the TLO Programme at the point where it is disestablished. We have also commented further on third-party stakeholder-management (section 2.2 ‘Status of the commercial contracts for heritage systems’, below) Budget Management In this review it has been apparent that the robust financial management disciplines we have previously reported continue to be applied, and the budget is being tightly-managed. We noted also that the Programme is currently tracking to be within budget, and forecasting a spend of $22.2million for the 21/22 financial year. We also saw a sustained focus on the decommissioning objectives and target end-date. This focus, and the use of good financial-management to secure the target benefits, is highly commendable. More broadly, it would be easy to underestimate the significance of the TLO Programme’s contribution to the overall BT objectives and benefits; in our experience, technical debt is often overlooked as a significant factor in ‘Transformation’ initiatives, and can easily erode benefits unless actively managed. The TLO Programme has, in our view, done an exemplary job of delivering a sustainable and cost-effective technology architecture to support IR in the future, and the strong focus on budget and benefits management has been a key factor in securing that. In summary, then, the TLO Programme has encountered some issues, and resulting challenges to the schedule and critical-path since our prior review, which had reduced the available timescale contingency to the point that there was no time available for the final ‘scream test’ (which ideally would have run for two weeks to provide additional comfort). However, our assessment is that the Programme has responded effectively in mitigating any schedule impact, in order to sustain the target-date for decommissioning, and the residual risk at the date of our review is now very low. Through this period, the prior high standard of the associated BT project-management controls has continued to be applied to the D&A activities. This under-pins, and provides confidence in, the robustness and sustainability of the outcomes that have been achieved. 8 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. At the time of our fieldwork, the decommissioning of the final systems has concluded, and this enables the handover to Unisys to take place on 18th April, as planned. There is still some small, residual risk in the short- term of an unknown emerging dependency; however, given the systematic and rigorous planning that has been carried out, and the continuing high standard of Project Management controls that have been applied, our assessment is that this risk is very low. 9 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. 2.2 Status of the commercial contracts for heritage systems Assessment Recommendations Rating Conclusion: The commercial handover for heritage systems is well-managed, and likely to be concluded in line with the decommissioning plan. The broad objectives of the TLO Programme have been to ensure that IR’s technical environments are simplified, enduring, suitable for IR, and sustainable for Technology Operations to operate when the BT Programme is closed in June. This has enabled IR to rationalise and optimise their I.T. infrastructure, including IR’s ultimate exit from the Unisys data-centre. The associated work requires decommissioning of all non– enduring (heritage) services, systems and applications (including FIRST) and all satellite processes and functions, (including the Enterprise Data Warehouse and SAP systems). When the BT Programme closes down on 30th June 2022, all staff will have left IR as planned, or transitioned to post-BT BAU. As such, this also implies the transition of responsibility for any in-house management of suppliers, systems environment and applications, and the TLO team have been working with IR’s Technology Services and Enterprise Services PD&D to support this transition. In the course of our fieldwork, we have reviewed the ‘Master Decommissioning and Archiving Register’, which serves as the cornerstone documentation for all systems that have been identified as running in the Unisys data-centre. We understand that this originated when the D&A workstream began in 2017 and set out to document every system in the data-centre. The Programme has also subsequently collated a set of ‘unplanned dependencies’, being essentially issues arising from unknown or undocumented systems that have been uncovered as the team has progressed and have had to be resolved. These are necessarily ‘living’ evolving documents, as the understanding of the applications landscape has improved over time, and they have formed the cornerstone of the D&A team’s work since. In our assessment, they represent a high-quality and comprehensive baseline, from which the team has been able to plan and manage the activities necessary to close down the systems that were hosted in the Unisys data-centre, and either: — Exit the commercial relationships with suppliers whose applications would no longer be required, or — Migrate applications that IR still required onto alternate enduring platforms, and transition associated processes and relationships to IR’s BAU management. With respect to the systems that are no longer required, and where contracts have been, or will be discontinued in line with the decommissioning plan, we have reviewed the ‘master commercial list’ and associated documentation, which builds on the ‘Master Decommissioning and Archiving Register’ (above), and We have no recommendations with regard to the commercial handover of heritage systems other than (per TQA12/1, above) to reflect that this would serve as an exemplary case-study, and the methodology, experience and lessons learned should be captured and leveraged across the sector.

We understand that this has been used by the D&A team to monitor the progress of the BT and TLO teams, to confirm when systems would no longer be in service, in order that the supporting contracts would be terminated or renewed as required. At a more granular level, we noted that the team has prepared individual ‘Disposal Memos’, which relate specifically to each item for decommissioning, and set out the appropriate staged process of authorisation and disposal, where this authorisation requires both the Business Owner(s) approval for the disposal action (confirming that the necessary retention and disposal conditions have been met), and the Executive Sponsor’s authorisation for carrying out the disposal actions (destruction, transfer, retention for extended period with a new review date set), as appropriate. These reflect specific ‘Disposal Authorities’, which set mandatory legal minimum retention periods and disposal actions for the information and records they describe. They also incorporate documentation of the process to ensure that hardware is ‘sanitised’ and subsequently disposed of in a secure, ethical and sustainable fashion (whether for re-deployment or destroyed). We have reviewed a sample of the relevant Disposal Memos, and have found them to be of a high standard, comprehensive and diligent in managing the detailed planning for the disposal activities, in addition to the mechanisms through which IR demonstrates compliance with the relevant Disposal Authorities, With respect to the current status of D&A activities, and the detailed execution of the disposals workplan we noted that it is generally on schedule, and well-advanced. This is the case, also, for the commercial activities; as reflected in our review of the ‘Master Commercial List’, which the team is using to control and track commercial engagement with the suppliers (and liaise with IR’s Commercial Team). At the time of our fieldwork, there were a few outstanding issues that are pending resolution with vendors, including: — An issue with an application, where the supplier has also informed IR that they do not want the associated hardware, and will not dispose of it themselves. IR also have a related issue where the supplier hasn’t billed IR for over usage consumed by application users. In order not to jeopardise the critical-path for Data Centre exit, IR have chosen to engage Unisys to decommission this hardware, and have made provision for the possibility that the vendor may subsequently bill for the excess application usage. — An issue with another supplier where (despite their obligations in contract to do so), the vendor has not been responsive to commercial discussions, which are ongoing. Notwithstanding these issues (which are relatively minor, well-understood and mitigated to the extent possible), our overall assessment is that the commercial management of the suppliers involved in the decommissioning is well-communicated and controlled, and issues are being resolved in a timely fashion. The issues are also being handed over appropriately to BAU staff and processes. In the course of our fieldwork, we have noted also that there are some pre-existing contracts that IR requires to continue beyond 30 June, and after the Unisys data-centre has been decommissioned. These include: 11 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. — DIA lead agency fees for Vodafone — Microsoft Server Maintenance — Vodafone contact centre (TSOA) — APEX support — SAP FMIS For these enduring services, we understand that the Programme team have been working with the relevant Service Integration Delivery Managers (‘SIDM’) in the BAU organisation, to ensure the managed transition of these contracts, the supplier relationships and the budgetary provisions. We have reviewed the heritage Budget and Commercial Update (March 2022), and note that this records the detailed view the budget line- items, and identifies the items where BAU budgets will take over. We have also reviewed samples of the handover documentation, and discussed the handover with relevant stakeholders through our fieldwork interviews. This has provided confirmation that the handover of the contracts for the enduring systems is well- documented and well-understood. The anecdotal feedback has also been very positive, in particular with respect to the commitment and working relationships between the D&A and Heritage teams in support of the transition, and the openness, accuracy and transparency of the reporting provided by the D&A workstreams. All of the stakeholders we interviewed, expressed a very high level of confidence in the processes under- pinning the Unisys data-centre exit, and IR’s ability to transition the management of the commercial relationships and operations, going forward. In summary, then, with respect to the termination of commercial contracts for heritage systems, and also the transition of enduring services and relationships to BAU processes, our assessment is that these activities have been planned and managed diligently, in order to optimise IR’s commercial position, and we are not aware of any issues that would compromise IR’s ability to exit the Unisys data-centre on-schedule. 12 © 2022 KPMG, a New Zealand Partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Use this factsheet to answer any questions you may have if you’re self-employed and a member of KiwiSaver or you’re thinking about joining KiwiSaver. KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings initiative designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for retirement. If you choose to join, you’ll invest money in a KiwiSaver scheme of your choice. You’ll be able to withdraw your savings when you’re eligible for New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super). Benefits to joining When you join KiwiSaver you’ll have access to the following benefits. Government contribution If you’re 18 or over, the government will contribute 50c to every dollar you put in up to a maximum of $521.43 each year to your KiwiSaver account until you reach the age of eligibility to withdraw your funds. Your scheme provider will claim the Government contribution on your behalf. Buying a first home After being a member of KiwiSaver for three years you may be able to withdraw part of your savings to put towards your first home. If you’ve previously owned a home you may still be eligible for the first home withdrawal if Kāinga Ora determines you’re in the same financial position as a first- time buyer. For more information go to the Kāinga Ora website kaingaora.govt.nz Who can join To be eligible to join KiwiSaver, you must live, or normally live, in New Zealand, and be a New Zealand citizen or entitled to stay in New Zealand indefinitely. How to join You’ll need to choose a scheme provider and apply direct to them. The scheme provider will notify us that you’ve joined KiwiSaver. For a full list of scheme providers go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Making contributions You and your scheme provider will need to agree on the amount and frequency of your contributions to your KiwiSaver scheme. Your contributions can be paid direct to your scheme provider or through us. If you choose to pay through us, you can find out the ways to make a payment by going to ird.govt.nz/pay Investing your savings in a KiwiSaver scheme There’s a wide range of schemes and investment funds to choose from. Before you choose a scheme you should research the ones you’re interested in to find out how they’ll invest your money. Each scheme provider’s product disclosure statement explains how they’ll invest your savings, the specific rules, fees, terms and conditions of the scheme. The product disclosure statement is an important document so make sure you read it carefully. KiwiSaver isn’t guaranteed by the government. This means you invest in a KiwiSaver scheme at your own risk. However, all KiwiSaver schemes are regulated by the Financial Markets Authority.

Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Changing KiwiSaver schemes You can change schemes at any time by applying to the scheme provider you want to change to. You can only belong to one KiwiSaver scheme at a time. Withdrawing your savings Your KiwiSaver savings are “locked in” and can’t be withdrawn until you’re eligible. You can qualify to withdraw your savings early if: • after three years you want to buy your first home • you experience significant financial hardship • you suffer serious illness • you move overseas permanently (to a country other than Australia). If you move to Australia permanently you can either: • keep your savings in your current KiwiSaver scheme, or • transfer your savings to an Australian complying superannuation scheme. Reaching the age of eligibility You’re eligible to withdraw your savings when you qualify for NZ Super (currently 65). If you joined KiwiSaver before 1 July 2019, you must have been in KiwiSaver for five years before you are eligible to withdraw your savings, even if you reach 65 within this time. If you want to withdraw your savings, contact your scheme provider. Changing from self-employed to an employee If you start working as an employee, you’ll need to tell your employer that you’re in KiwiSaver so contributions can be deducted from your pay. You can choose whether you contribute 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% from your earnings. If you’re eligible you’ll also be entitled to receive employer contributions. Receiving paid parental leave payments KiwiSaver contributions are optional from paid parental leave (PPL) payments. You can choose to have your contributions deducted while on PPL when you complete your application. If you choose to have contributions deducted and you are eligible, you will also be entitled to receive employer contributions.

Self-employed or not working You can join KiwiSaver by contacting your chosen scheme provider directly. They’ll send you a product disclosure  statement and enrolment form. Joining KiwiSaver if you’re under 18 If you’re under 18 you can only join KiwiSaver by contacting  your chosen scheme provider directly. You cannot join  through your employer. Opting out If you have been automatically enrolled you can choose to  opt out of KiwiSaver at ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver-individuals This form must be completed within eight weeks of starting  your new job. We’ll refund any contributions you’ve made. If  you’ve chosen to  join  KiwiSaver you  can’t  opt  out.  However,  after  12  months you  could  take  a  savings suspension. KiwiSaver benefits If  you’re over  18  you  may be entitled to: •  an annual contribution paid by the government of up to  $521.43 •  employer contributions that match 3% of your gross  earnings. Three years after your first KiwiSaver contribution you may  be able to use your savings to buy your first home.  Choosing a scheme provider You  don’t  have  to  choose a  scheme when you  join  KiwiSaver. When you join through your employer or are automatically  enrolled, you will either: •  be allocated to your employer’s chosen scheme, (if they  have one) or •  be allocated to a default scheme. You can actively choose your own scheme provider, by contacting them directly. Making contributions Making contributions is easy, whether you’re working, not  working or self-employed. If you’re working Your employer deducts contributions from your before-tax  pay at your chosen rate of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%. If you  don’t choose a rate the default rate of 3% will be applied.  Your employer passes this money to us and we pass it on to your scheme provider. You can change your contribution rate by using myIR or  contacting your scheme provider, as well as directly through your employer(s). You can only change your  contribution rate once every 3  months, unless your employer agrees to a shorter timeframe. Self-employed or not working You and your KiwiSaver scheme provider agree how much you want to contribute and you make payments directly to them. How your contributions are processed When you are first enrolled into KiwiSaver we hold your  contributions for two months. Any future contributions  received are normally transferred to your scheme provider  within a few days. We will also pay any interest earned to  your scheme provider once a month. Employer contributions If you’re a KiwiSaver member making contributions from  your pay, employer must also make a contribution. This will  equal 3% of your pay before tax. Your introduction to KiwiSaver – employee information KS3 | June 2024 ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. All employer contributions paid to a superannuation fund for  the benefit of an employee are liable for ESCT (employer  superannuation contribution tax). The exception to this is if  the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contributions as salary or wages under the  PAYE rules. Your employer doesn’t have to make compulsory employer  contributions if: •  they’re already paying sufficient contributions into  another approved superannuation scheme for you •  you’re under 18 •  you’re over 65 •  you’re not required to have deductions made from your  pay (eg, if you’re on a savings suspension, or on leave  without pay). Savings suspension After you’ve been contributing to KiwiSaver for 12 months  you can apply to take a break from contributing for three to  12 months. There’s no limit on how many times you can do  this. However, when you’re on a savings suspension, your  employer doesn’t have to make contributions either. If you’re experiencing financial hardship you may get  approval to stop making contributions. Existing superannuation schemes If you’re in a complying superannuation scheme, you may  be entitled to some of the KiwiSaver benefits through that  scheme, including the Government contribution and having your employer pay compulsory employer contributions. Your employer only has to pay a total 3% compulsory  employer contribution regardless of whether you’re a member  of  both KiwiSaver and a complying superannuation scheme. You can still join KiwiSaver if you’re a member of a  complying superannuation scheme, but the benefits will only  apply to one of your schemes. Withdrawing your savings In most cases, your KiwiSaver savings will be locked in until: •  you’re eligible for NZ Super (currently 65), or •  you’ve been in KiwiSaver for at least five years (if you  joined prior to 1 July 2019) - whichever date is later. KiwiSaver won’t affect your eligibility for NZ Super or reduce  the amount of NZ Super you’re eligible for. Exceptions You may be able to withdraw part (or all) of your savings  if you’re: •  buying your first home •  moving overseas permanently (to a country other than  Australia) •  suffering significant financial hardship • seriously ill •  suffering from a life-shortening congenital condition. Your  KiwiSaver will be paid to your estate if you  die. If you move to Australia permanently, you can’t withdraw  your KiwiSaver savings. You can either: •  keep your savings in your current KiwiSaver scheme, or •  transfer your savings to an Australian complying  superannuation scheme. Future responsibilities After you’ve enrolled in KiwiSaver, check your deductions  and contributions at ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver or with your scheme provider. When you change jobs, it’s your responsibility to give new  employers a KiwiSaver deduction - KS2 form. Getting advice Neither your employer nor Inland Revenue can give you  financial advice about whether KiwiSaver is the right choice  for you or which scheme you should join. KiwiSaver isn’t guaranteed by the government. This means  you make your investment choices in a KiwiSaver scheme  at your own risk. However, all KiwiSaver schemes are  regulated by the Financial Markets Authority in a similar way  to other registered superannuation schemes.

ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Use this factsheet to answer any questions you may have if you're thinking about signing your child up for KiwiSaver. Or if you're under 18 and would like to join. KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings plan designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for retirement. Joining KiwiSaver is a big financial decision - once you've joined you can't opt out. If you join KiwiSaver you make contributions (payments) to your KiwiSaver scheme (account) and you can take this money out when you reach the age of eligibility for NZ Super. There are benefits to joining When you join KiwiSaver you have access to the following benefits, however some of these won't apply until you've turned 18. Government contribution When you turn 18, the government will contribute up to $521.43 each year to your KiwiSaver. Employer contributions If you're working your employer may make payments into your KiwiSaver when you turn 18. These payments are in addition to the contributions you make from your pay and are called compulsory employer contributions. Let your employer know when you turn 18 so they can start making these payments. Buying a first home After being a member of KiwiSaver for three years you may be able to withdraw part of your savings to help you buy your first home. If you’ve previously owned a home you may still be eligible for the first home withdrawal if Kāinga Ora determines you’re in the same financial position as a first- time buyer. For more information go to the Kāinga Ora website kaingaora.govt.nz Who can join KiwiSaver To be eligible to join KiwiSaver, you must: • live, or normally live in New Zealand, and • be a New Zealand citizen or entitled to stay in New Zealand indefinitely. How to join KiwiSaver If you're under 18 you'll need to choose a scheme provider and apply direct to them. For a full list of scheme providers go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Note: If you’re 16 or 17 and you’d like to join KiwiSaver, talk to the scheme provider you’ve chosen. They’ll tell you if you can apply by yourself or if you need a parent or guardian to apply on your behalf. If you are under 16 your parents or guardians will need to complete the enrolment on your behalf.

Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Making contributions If you’re a KiwiSaver member and working for salary or wages (even if it’s a part-time job) your KiwiSaver contributions will be taken out of your pay before you receive it. You can decide if you contribute 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of your pay. You can change your contribution rate by using myIR or contacting your scheme provider, as well as directly through your employer(s). You can only change your contribution rate once every 3 months, unless your employer agrees to a shorter timeframe. You can find out more by reading our factsheet Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3. You need to provide any new employers with a KiwiSaver deduction - KS2 form. This lets your employer know that you’re a member and your contribution rate. If you aren't working for salary or wages, you and your scheme provider will work out the amount you contribute and the frequency of your contributions. Your contributions can be paid directly to your scheme provider or through us. Taking a savings suspension If you're having deductions made from your salary or wages, as an employee, you can take a break from making contributions. This is called savings suspension and can be taken once you've been a member for 12 months. The savings suspension can last from 3 months to 12 months. You can take a savings suspension in the first 12 months of being a member of KiwiSaver if you're experiencing financial hardship. Investing your savings in a KiwiSaver scheme There's a wide range of schemes and investment funds to choose from. Before you choose a scheme you should research the ones you're interested in to find out how they'll invest your money. The scheme provider's product disclosure statement explains how they'll invest your savings, the specific rules, fees, terms and conditions of the scheme. The product disclosure statement is an important document so make sure you read it carefully. KiwiSaver isn't guaranteed by the government. This means you invest in a KiwiSaver scheme at your own risk. KiwiSaver schemes are regulated by the Financial Markets Authority. Changing KiwiSaver schemes You can change schemes at any time by applying to the scheme provider you want to change to. You can only belong to one KiwiSaver scheme at a time. Withdrawing your savings Your KiwiSaver savings are "locked in" and normally can't be withdrawn until you reach the age of retirement (currently 65). You may be able to withdraw part (or all) of your savings if you're: • buying your first home • moving overseas permanently • suffering significant financial hardship • seriously ill. Find out more about KiwiSaver Inland Revenue can't give you advice about whether you should join KiwiSaver or which scheme provider you should choose. For help in making your decision, you can go to sorted.org.nz this is the Commission for Financial Capability's website and it provides free, independent information about money matters, including KiwiSaver.

The KiwiSaver Act 2006 covers employers who are New Zealand residents or who carry on business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Employers who are not New Zealand residents or do not carry on business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand, may choose whether they offer KiwiSaver in their workplace. A non-resident employer may choose to make KiwiSaver deductions and contributions for their eligible employees. Non-resident employers who are intending to participate in KiwiSaver and who are not registered for PAYE should contact Inland Revenue for more information. For more information about employer obligations for complying funds 1 go to ird.govt.nz The KiwiSaver employee information pack has more general information (page 15). 1 A complying superannuation fund (complying fund) is a section of registered superannuation schemes that have been approved by the Financial Markets Authority as having met certain criteria similar to KiwiSaver (eg KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability). 2KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE How KiwiSaver works Inland Revenue administers KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings initiative designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for their future. For most people, KiwiSaver is work based. This means they receive information about KiwiSaver from you as their employer, and their KiwiSaver contributions come straight out of their pay. You are also required to contribute to your employee’s savings in KiwiSaver schemes or complying funds. There are a number of membership benefits to encourage employees to save. These are set out in the KiwiSaver employee information pack. Enrolment Eligibility KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand citizens and people entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely. A person needs to be living (or normally living) in New Zealand to join. New employees You must automatically enrol eligible new employees who are not already KiwiSaver members. See page 8 to check if your new employee is eligible for automatic enrolment. Temporary and casual workers may be exempt from KiwiSaver automatic enrolment (page 4). Make KiwiSaver deductions from the employee’s first pay and continue unless they opt out. New employees who have been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver can opt out any time on or after day 14 and on or before day 56 after starting their employment. Their contributions will be refunded. If your employee opts out, your employer contributions will be refunded. Existing employees Existing employees are not subject to automatic enrolment but, if eligible, they can choose to join KiwiSaver. They either sign up direct with the KiwiSaver scheme provider of their choice, or tell you they want to opt in. They will usually do this by giving you a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2, which is in the KiwiSaver information pack. If you receive one of these, you need to determine if they are eligible to opt in (page 4), and send the information to Inland Revenue. You can then start making member and compulsory employer contributions, if applicable. Note: If an existing employee opts in to KiwiSaver they can’t opt out. Contributions Member contributions Employees can choose a contribution rate of either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages. Employer contributions The compulsory employer contribution rate is 3% of your employee’s gross salary or wages. Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes may reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/contributions-and-deductions All employer superannuation cash contributions (employer contributions) to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contributions as salary or wages under the PAYE rules (page 12). KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE3 How contributions are collected You deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your employee’s salary or wages and pay them to Inland Revenue with your PAYE payments. Keep making deductions and employer contributions until your employee gives you an Opt-out request - KS10 form, savings suspension notice, or Inland Revenue tells you to stop deducting contributions (page 14). KiwiSaver member deductions and employer contributions are paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. Inland Revenue forwards contributions to the member’s chosen KiwiSaver scheme provider. If you pay compulsory employer contributions to an employees complying funds, you pay these direct to the complying fund. Your options as an employer There are several options available if you would like to be more involved in encouraging retirement savings among your employees. These include making additional voluntary employer contributions and/or providing your own employer-based KiwiSaver scheme. You can also nominate a KiwiSaver scheme for your employees to join if they make no choice of their own. This is called an employer-chosen scheme (page 19). A note about providing financial advice You should not provide financial advice to employees. Instead, refer them to the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income’s website sorted.org.nz or encourage them to talk to an independent financial advisor. You do not have any liability if you only provide general savings or KiwiSaver information or select an employer-chosen scheme. How KiwiSaver contributions are invested Employer Saver (Salary and wage earners) Savings Retirement benefit paid to saver Savings Scheme provider (Savers can choose) 4KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Enrolment This section sets out your responsibilities as an employer for enrolling employees in KiwiSave What’s important You are required to: • check whether a new or existing employee is eligible to be a KiwiSaver member (see below) • check whether the new employee should be automatically enrolled (page 6) • distribute the KiwiSaver information pack to new employees who are subject to automatic enrolment, and to existing employees who are considering opting in or who ask for a KiwiSaver information pack. This includes our factsheet Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3, KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 and the Opt-out request - KS10 form • provide new employees with a product disclosure statement if you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19) • automatically enrol all new employees who are subject to automatic enrolment • send us the details of new employees who are enrolled automatically in KiwiSaver using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. Who can join KiwiSaver? KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand citizens and people entitled to live here permanently. Citizenship and residency To join KiwiSaver, a person must be living (or normally living) in New Zealand and be a New Zealand citizen or entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely. This means New Zealand citizens, Australian citizens and people who hold either a New Zealand or Australian residence permit can join KiwiSaver. State Services employees serving outside New Zealand can also join, subject to certain conditions being met (see below). People who hold temporary, visitor, student or work permits can’t join KiwiSaver. Neither can people who are New Zealand citizens or who are entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely, but are just visiting or on a holiday in New Zealand, eg a New Zealand citizen who normally lives in Australia who returns to New Zealand for a holiday. State Services employees State Services employees who are serving overseas can join KiwiSaver if they remain employed on New Zealand terms and conditions and are serving in a jurisdiction where offers of KiwiSaver scheme membership are lawful and meet other eligibility requirements. Employees under age 18 New and existing employees under 18 can join KiwiSaver but only by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Once an employee under 18 is accepted by the scheme provider, we’ll write to you and ask you to start deducting their contributions. We’ll provide you with the contribution rate for that employee and their name and IRD number. You aren’t required to make compulsory employer contributions on behalf of employees under 18. Employees 65 and over New and existing employees 65 and over can join KiwiSaver, either by opting in through you or by contracting with a scheme provider. They aren’t subject to automatic enrolment, and you aren’t required to make compulsory employer contributions for a newly enrolled employee 65 and over. Temporary and casual employees Temporary employees employed for 28 continuous days or less are not enrolled automatically but can opt in to KiwiSaver. They can join either through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE5 A temporary employee is employed to work ‘as and when required’ without a specific end. Their period of employment starts each time they are engaged to work and stops each time that engagement ends. If an employee is engaged for future work before the last engagement has ended, the combined engagements are considered as one period of employment. As long as each period of employment remains 28 continuous days or less, these employees are not subject to automatic enrolment. The 28 continuous days refers to the period of employment, not the days or hours worked. For example, if an employee has a two-week contract but only works Tuesdays and Thursdays, this counts as 14 days’ employment not four days. The automatic enrolment rules apply to temporary employees if their employment is extended beyond 28 continuous days. Automatic enrolment applies on the 29th day of employment. You must then give them a KiwiSaver information pack and start member and employer contributions from their next pay. The normal opt-out rules apply. Casual employees engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis and who receive holiday pay with their wages are not subject to automatic enrolment. They can join either through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Casual agricultural workers Casual agricultural workers who are employed on a day-to-day basis for no more than three months aren’t enrolled automatically, but can opt in. They can either join through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. The automatic enrolment rules apply to casual agricultural workers if their employment is extended beyond three months. You must then give them a KiwiSaver information pack and start member and employer contributions from their next pay. The normal opt-out rules apply. Private domestic workers and other IR56 taxpayers The automatic enrolment rules don’t apply to IR56 taxpayers who pay their own PAYE. They can opt in to KiwiSaver only by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider, but they may deduct contributions from their salary or wages and pay them to Inland Revenue in the same way as PAYE. Private domestic workers may also choose to make compulsory or voluntary employer contributions. Election day workers The automatic rules don’t apply to election day workers. However, these employees may already be members of KiwiSaver. If they give you a completed KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 start deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their pay. Changing jobs but not changing payroll Situations where an employee changes jobs but remains on the same payroll don’t count as new employment, so the automatic enrolment rules do not apply. This includes company amalgamations and the purchase and subsequent operation of a going concern. Examples include an employee who transfers between two company branches where the company has a single centralised payroll, or a business bought as a going concern which retains existing staff but uses a different company IRD number. State and state integrated schools are treated as a single employer. You don’t need to consider automatic enrolment for staff transferring between these schools. The automatic enrolment rules do apply if the employee’s new workplace has a separate payroll. Contractors and the self-employed Contractors aren’t employees and are treated as self-employed people for KiwiSaver purposes. This means they aren’t automatically enrolled and can only join by contracting directly with a scheme provider. Don’t make KiwiSaver deductions. Shareholder-employees may be considered employees for KiwiSaver purposes if PAYE is required to be deducted from their salary or wage. If PAYE isn’t required to be deducted, the shareholder-employee may join KiwiSaver as a self-employed person, by contracting directly with a scheme provider. If they join KiwiSaver as an employee, they’ll have contributions deducted from their pay. Shareholder-employees should get advice to determine whether their remuneration is subject to PAYE. Working partners of a partnership that pays them a salary or wage for services provided under a written contract of service will be considered employees for KiwiSaver purposes but won’t be subject to the automatic enrolment rules. They can either join as an employee or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Seconded employees Employees who are seconded to a new employer and are paid on the new employer’s payroll aren’t subject to automatic enrolment. They may join KiwiSaver as an existing employee by opting in. Returning to their original job at the end of the secondment isn’t considered new employment. 6KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE New employees What’s important Your responsibilities (except if you’re an employer exempt from the automatic enrolment rules - see page 20) are to check whether a new employee: • is eligible to be a KiwiSaver member, and • should be automatically enrolled. If they meet the conditions above: • give your new employee a KiwiSaver information pack. If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme, give them the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19) • deduct member contributions from their first pay • make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies) • pay ESCT on any employer contributions made • give us the employee’s details using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. Send this information through your online account (see below) • pay the member and employer contributions to us with your next PAYE payment • if the employee chooses to opt out of KiwiSaver, send their Opt-out request - KS10 form to us. Employees can opt out between day 14 and day 56 of starting their new employment. New employees who meet the criteria for automatic enrolment Start the automatic enrolment process by giving the new employee a KiwiSaver information pack. You must do this within seven days of the employee starting work. The information pack includes a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2, which the employee can use to let you know whether they want member contributions to be deducted at 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% of their gross salary or wages. If they don’t advise you of their preferred rate, deduct member contributions at the default rate of 3%. Keep the KS2 for your records, do not send it to Inland Revenue. If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme, give your new employee the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19). They can choose to move to another KiwiSaver scheme at a later date. Deduct member contributions from the new employee’s pay. Make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies). Give Inland Revenue the full names and IRD numbers of new employees using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. You can also supply this information online. You’re only required to give us the information the employee gives you. You are not responsible if an employee chooses not to provide information for privacy or other reasons. You must provide enrolment information supplied no later than the date your next employment information is due. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE7 New employees who are existing members You don’t need to send Inland Revenue a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form for new employees who are already KiwiSaver members. Unless you are given or shown a valid savings suspension notice, you must deduct member contributions from their first pay. Start deducting member contributions at the default rate of 3% if they don’t elect a rate. You must also make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies). A new employee who is an existing KiwiSaver member must: • tell you their full name and IRD number • let you know whether they want member contributions deducted at the rate of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% or give you a valid savings suspension notice (page 16). If your new employee is an existing member of KiwiSaver they should give you a completed KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2. Keep the KS2 for your records, do not send it to Inland Revenue. 8KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Are they eligible? Use this chart to help work out whether a new employee should be automatically enrolled (unless you are an employer exempt from automatic enrolment - see page 20). Eligibility rules for KiwiSaver - and rules around automatic enrolment - are covered in detail on pages 4 - 6. Not required to be automatically enrolled. Not eligible to join KiwiSaver. Are they already a KiwiSaver member? Not required to be automatically enrolled. They need to give you a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 or a valid savings suspension notice (page 16). YES NO NO NO NO NO YES YES YES YES Are they 18 and over? Are they under 65? Are they a New Zealand resident? Information on citizenship and residency - page 4. Are they normally living in New Zealand? They cannot be automatically enrolled. Information about employees under 18 - page 4. Are they a State Services employee working overseas? (page 4). Not eligible to join KiwiSaver. Employee should be automatically enrolled. YES NO Not required to be automatically enrolled. YES NO Do any of the following apply? The new employee is: • employed on a temporary employment contract of 28 continuous days or less (page 4) • a casual employee engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis who receives holiday pay with their wages (page 4) • a working partner of a partnership that pays them a salary or wage for services (page 5) • receiving weekly compensation (from ACC) • a secondee who is paid by the employer the person is seconded to • absent from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government • a casual agricultural worker employed for less than 3 months (page 5) • an election day worker or private domestic worker (page 5) • on paid parental leave paid by Inland Revenue (page 16) • staying on the same payroll (conditions apply - page 5) • only receiving payments subject to withholding tax (page 5) • not required to have PAYE deductions made from their salary or wages. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE9 Existing employees What’s important For existing employees who are considering joining KiwiSaver, you must: • check they’re eligible to join KiwiSaver • give them a KiwiSaver information pack within seven days. If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme give them the product disclosure statement for that scheme (page 19). If an existing employee has told you they’d like to join, you need to check if they’re eligible and: • start making member contributions, at the rate they’ve chosen, from their next pay • make compulsory employer contributions • give us their details using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. Existing employees aren’t enrolled automatically but they can join KiwiSaver as long as they meet the eligibility criteria (page 4). There are two ways an existing employee can join KiwiSaver, by: • contracting directly with their chosen KiwiSaver scheme provider or, • joining through you as their employer if they are 18 or over. If the employee decides to join KiwiSaver the information pack includes a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2, which the employee can use to select a member contribution rate, 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages. If they don’t nominate a contribution rate, make deductions at the default rate of 3%. Keep the KS2 as part of your records - don’t send it to us. You’ll need to: • deduct member contributions • make compulsory employer contributions • give us your employee’s details using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. You’re only required to give us the information the employee gives you. You’re not responsible if an employee chooses not to provide information for privacy or other reasons. You must provide the enrolment information supplied no later than the date your next employment information is due. If your employee is under 18 years old and wants to join KiwiSaver advise them they need to contract directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (page 4). 10KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Member contributions What’s important You need to: • make sure a new employee’s member contributions start from their first pay • make deductions at the rate they choose (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages), or at the default rate of 3%. These are the only rates they can choose • send deductions to us together with PAYE payments. You can complete your employment information in the payroll returns account in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz.myIR You’re also required to make compulsory employer contributions to your employees’ KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. Compulsory employer contributions are explained on page 12. Contribution rates Employees can choose a contribution rate of either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages. The employee can make additional voluntary contributions direct to their scheme provider or to Inland Revenue. Make deductions at the default rate of 3% if an employee elects or doesn’t select a rate. An amendment to an employee’s chosen rate can’t be changed at intervals that are less than three months apart, unless you (the employer) agree. You don’t need to notify us about this. Definition of gross salary or wages KiwiSaver schemes For contributions to KiwiSaver schemes, gross salary or wages generally means total salary, wages or allowances, including bonuses, commission, extra salary, gratuity, overtime and other remuneration of any kind before tax. It does not include: • redundancy payments • payments under a voluntary bonding scheme funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education • the value of overseas accommodation and cost of living allowances • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme • the value of providing board or lodging, or use of a house or part of a house, or the payment of an allowance instead of the provision of this benefit. These are the main inclusions and exclusions from the definition of gross salary or wages. See glossary (page 21). Complying superannuation funds For contributions to complying funds, gross base salary or wages has the same meaning as for a KiwiSaver scheme but excludes bonuses, commissions and other amounts that aren’t included in the employee’s gross base salary or wages by the relevant complying fund. Note: If the employee is a member of both a KiwiSaver scheme and complying fund then deductions should be made to both. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE11 Calculating deductions You can use the online calculator at ird.govt.nz/calculators to work out member contributions at the same time as your employees PAYE. Member contribution calculation tables are also included in the PAYE deductions tables - IR340 and IR341. Here’s an example: An employee earns $600.00 a week and contributes 3% to KiwiSaver. Gross pay$600.00 Less PAYE$ 96.35 Less KiwiSaver contribution$ 18.00(3% of $600.00) Net pay$485.65 Tailored tax code or deduction rate certificate - IR23 Any KiwiSaver contributions are in addition to their tailored tax code or deduction rate. For example, if an employee is on a deduction rate of 30% and they are making KiwiSaver contributions at 4%, total deductions from their salary or wages will be 34%. Employees under age 18 You’ll need to deduct member contributions for KiwiSaver members under 18 if they’re an existing KiwiSaver member or have joined KiwiSaver while employed with you. You’re not required to make compulsory employer contributions on behalf of employees under 18. Starting and stopping deductions You must make KiwiSaver deductions from all payments of salary or wages if: • the employee is subject to automatic enrolment • the employee gives you a KS2 • we notify you and ask you to start deductions. You must stop making KiwiSaver deductions from all payments of salary or wages if: • an opt-out notice takes effect (page 16) • a savings suspension is granted (page 16) • we notify you and ask you to stop deductions • the employee has reached eligibility to withdraw and gives you a Non-deduction notice - KS51. Forwarding member contributions Forward your employee’s KiwiSaver contributions to us along with your PAYE payments using the employment information. These include fields for member net employer contributions and ESCT for each employee. Every field must be completed. Pay complying fund contributions direct to the scheme provider. Don’t pay these through Inland Revenue. Additional contributions If an employee wants to contribute more than the maximum allowed to their KiwiSaver scheme, pay the additional contributions direct to Inland Revenue or the scheme provider instead of using the PAYE system. Scheme providers may offer extra services for members (eg group life insurance). Pay the scheme provider direct for these services. Inland Revenue payments to scheme providers Inland Revenue is required to pass on member contributions received (or which should be received from an employer) to the employee’s scheme provider. We’ll make the payment even if we have not received the contributions. If we do not receive the contributions, we’ll seek to recover the arrears from you in the same way we would recover unpaid PAYE tax debts. 12KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Employer contributions What’s important • You’re required to contribute 3% of your employees’ gross salary or wages to their KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, excluding defined benefit scheme members (see Glossary for definition). This 3% is in addition to their gross salary or wages. • Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes may reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers • Employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. • KiwiSaver employer contributions are paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. You can complete your employment information in the payroll returns account in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers • If you don’t make compulsory employer contributions, you may have penalties imposed. You’re required to contribute to your employees’ savings in KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. Compulsory employer contributions can be made to either scheme but must total the minimum rate Compulsory employer contributions may be backdated effective from the date: • the employee should have been automatically enrolled, or • the employee’s savings suspension expired, or • the employee turned 18, and • deductions and compulsory employer contributions should have occurred. Starting and stopping contributions For new employees, you start paying contributions from their first pay. For existing employees, you pay contributions from their first pay after Inland Revenue or the employee notifies you they are a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund member. You can stop contributions if the employee elects to take a savings suspension and shows you their savings suspension notice, opts out (new employees only) or when Inland Revenue advises you to stop making contributions. Don’t cease employer contributions until you receive a letter from Inland Revenue advising that an employee has reached their withdrawal date. If you haven’t received a letter and you or your employee think you should have, instruct your employee to check the withdrawal date with their scheme provider. Calculating contributions Use this formula to calculate your contribution to your employee’s superannuation: Payment of gross salary or wages × compulsory rate = minimum employer contribution An employee earns $2,600.00 a month and belongs to a KiwiSaver scheme. From the first full pay period, the gross compulsory employer contribution will be: $2,600 × 3% = $78 You only need to pay the compulsory employer contribution if your employee is contributing to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund through their salary or wages. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE13 Employer contributions and tax All employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. ESCT must be paid to us along with PAYE deductions. Using the figures from the above example the employee earns $2,600.00 a month and has an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The net compulsory employer contribution will be: $2,600 × 3% = $78 $78 × 17.5% = $13.65 (ESCT) $78 − $13.65 = $64.35 (net compulsory employer contribution) You’ll need to ensure that you list the net employer contribution on the employment information and that ESCT is a separate figure for each employee. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers or read our Employer’s guide - IR335. Forwarding contributions KiwiSaver contributions As with employee KiwiSaver deductions, you pay KiwiSaver employer contributions to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. Employment information includes a field for KiwiSaver employer contributions and ESCT. You need to ensure the net amount of KiwiSaver employer contributions is listed, excluding the ESCT. There is a separate field for the ESCT amount. Record compulsory and voluntary contributions as a single total. Inland Revenue will split contributions into compulsory and voluntary amounts. You can complete these online. We pass your employer contributions on to the scheme provider. If a new employee opts out of KiwiSaver, we’ll refund any employer contributions to you. Other contributions Pay contributions other than retirement benefits (eg life insurance premiums) direct to the scheme provider. Complying fund contributions Pay complying fund contributions direct to the scheme provider. Don’t pay these through Inland Revenue. 14KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE General administration What’s important Opt-outs and savings suspension • If a new employee you have automatically enrolled gives you the Opt-out request - KS10 form within 2 to 8 weeks of starting work. You must: - send us the KS10 and the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form if you haven’t already - stop deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their next pay and refund any contributions you hold. • If an employee gives you an opt-out form after 8 weeks, send it to us and continue to deduct member contributions and to make compulsory employer contributions until we advise you otherwise. • Employees can opt out online at ird.govt.nz or by sending us the Opt-out request - KS10 form. We’ll let you know when you can stop contributions. • KiwiSaver members can take a break from saving after they have been a member for 12 months. This is called a savings suspension. General • You need to keep a record of employees who are KiwiSaver members, their contribution rate, the amounts you’ve deducted, employer contributions you’ve made and any notification of savings suspensions or opt-outs. • Penalties may apply if you don’t comply with KiwiSaver processes (page 18).

Most members will build up their savings through regular contributions from their pay, making saving simple and easy. To join KiwiSaver you must: • live, or normally live in New Zealand, and • be a New Z ealand citizen or be entitled to stay in New Zealand indefinitely. Already in work You  can choose whether you  join KiwiSaver. If you  decide to,   you can join with a scheme provider directly or through your employer. Starting a new job If you’re between the ages of 18 and 65 you’ll be  automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver if you’re eligible. Your  emplo yer  will give you  some information about KiwiSaver. Self-employed or not working You can join KiwiSaver by contacting your chosen scheme provider directly. They’ll send you  a product disclosure  statement and enrolment form. Opting out If you  have  been automatically enrolled you  can choose to  opt out of KiwiSaver at  ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver-individuals This form must be completed within eight weeks of starting  your new job. We’ll refund any  contributions you’ve made. If  you’ve  chosen  to  join  KiwiSa ver  you  can’t  opt  out.  Howev er,   after  12  months  you  could  take  a  savings  suspension. KiwiSaver benefits If  you’re  over  18  you  may be  entitled  to: •  an annual contribution paid by  the government of up to  $521.43 •  emplo yer  contributions that match 3% of your gross  earnings. Three years after your first KiwiSaver  contribution you  may   be able to use your savings to buy your  first home. You  may   also be eligible for the First Home Grant from Kāinga Ora. Choosing a scheme provider You  don’t  have to  choose  a  scheme  when  you  join  KiwiSa ver. When you   join through your employer  or are automatically  enrolled, y ou will either: •  be allocated  to your employer’s chosen scheme, (if they  have one) or •  be allocated  to a default scheme. You can actively choose your own scheme provider, by contacting them directly. Making contributions Making contributions is easy, whether you’re working, not  working or self-employed. If you’re working Your employer deducts contributions from your before-tax  pay at your  chosen rate of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%. If you   don’t choose a rate the default rate of 3% will be applied.  Your employer passes this money to us and we pass it on to your scheme provider. Once you’ve  chosen a  contribution rate you  must continue  using this rate for three months before you’re able to  change it. Self-employed or not working You and your KiwiSaver scheme provider agree how much you want  to  contribute  and  you  make  payments  directly  to  them. How your contributions are processed It takes about two months for any  KiwiSaver contributions  deducted from your pay  to reach your  account. We  transfer  your contributions to your scheme provider, including any interest earned, once we’ve made sure your  employer’s  payroll information is correct. Employer contributions If you’re a KiwiSaver member making contributions from  your pay,  employer must also make a contribution. This will  equal 3% of your pay  before tax. All employer contributions paid to a superannuation fund for  the benefit of an employee are liable for ESCT (employer  superannuation contribution tax). The exception to this is if  the emplo yee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contributions  as salary or wages under the  PAYE  rules. Your introduction to KiwiSaver – employee information KS3 | April 2020 16KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Requests to opt out If a new employee who’s subject to automatic enrolment gives you an Opt-out request - KS10 form you need to: • make sure they’re within the two to eight week opt-out period (on or after day 14 and on or before day 56 of starting employment) • stop deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their next pay • refund any member contributions you’ve made but not yet sent to us, or you can send them with your PAYE payment and we’ll refund the employee direct. If you refund the member’s contributions direct, they’ll benefit by receiving the refund immediately • send both the opt-out and the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K forms to us so we know that the new employee was automatically enrolled and has opted out. You can complete these forms online. We’ll refund to you the employer contributions you’ve made and any ESCT made on these. The refund will be paid with interest. Savings suspensions KiwiSaver members can take a break from saving 12 months after they made their first contribution to their KiwiSaver. This is called a savings suspension. It can be for a minimum of three months, up to a maximum of one year. An employee can apply for a savings suspension in myIR or by calling us. If we approve the request, either your employee will show you a valid savings suspension notice from Inland Revenue or we will notify you if your employee has asked us to. You can stop deducting member contributions and making employer contributions once you’ve seen a valid savings suspension notice. An employee can give you notice to restart their deductions but they cannot ask you to start and stop deductions too often. The minimum period before requesting a change, unless you agree otherwise, is three months. When an employee shows you a current savings suspension notice, you may refund any contributions you’ve deducted that you haven’t passed to Inland Revenue, otherwise the employee should contact us to request their refund. We’ll write again asking you to restart deductions when the savings suspension finishes. You aren’t required to pay compulsory employer contributions if an employee is taking a savings suspension. If you choose, you can continue to make employer contributions. Any contributions you make to employees on a savings suspension are voluntary and will be liable for ESCT (page 13). Deductions from accident compensation payments If you take part in ACC’s partnership programme or have an ACC employer reimbursement agreement where you pay your employee’s ACC payments, your employee’s KiwiSaver member contributions must continue to be made. You aren’t required to pay employer contributions, but you can on a voluntary basis if you wish. If your employee wants to stop their member contributions they must apply for a savings suspension. When ACC pays the employee weekly compensation you don’t need to make the employee deductions or employer contributions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Parental leave payments If you continue to pay your employee a salary or wage while they are on parental leave, keep deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions unless they take a savings suspension. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE17 Contributions made in error If you make an error relating to KiwiSaver in your employment information you can amend this. If you file online, you can amend your employment information in myIR. We’ll refund any contributions made in error. If these include employer contributions and ESCT, these will be repaid to you. This process will take longer if we have to request the refund from the member’s scheme. Record keeping You need to record which employees are KiwiSaver members, their contribution rate, and any notification of savings suspensions or opt-outs. Your PAYE records should show the member contributions, net employer contributions and any ESCT you’ve deducted and passed on to us. You must keep records for seven years after the person leaves employment with you. In particular, employers must keep information about the total employer contributions made and gaps in employees’ employment. Obligations and compliance Your obligations • Determine if your new employees are eligible to be automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver. The automatic enrolment rules don’t apply if you’re an exempt employer. • Determine whether any new employees or existing employees who wish to have KiwiSaver deductions from their salary or wages are eligible to be KiwiSaver members (pages 4 - 6). • Determine whether any new employees or existing employees who wish to have KiwiSaver deductions from their salary or wages under the age of 18 are existing KiwiSaver members and provide you with a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 (page 4). Note: Employees under the age of 18 cannot join KiwiSaver through their employer. They must opt in through their chosen scheme provider. • Provide a KiwiSaver information pack within seven days to: - a new employee who’s eligible for automatic enrolment - an existing employee considering opting in - an existing employee who requests one. • Provide an IRD number and name to Inland Revenue for each new employee who’s eligible for automatic enrolment and each employee who opts into KiwiSaver. • If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme give the new employees the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme. • Deduct member contributions. You’re required to make compulsory employer contributions and pay them to Inland Revenue by the due date (page 11). • Make deductions and contributions at the correct rate (page 12). • Calculate ESCT (page 13). 18KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Compliance There are KiwiSaver penalties for: • failure to provide information - where you do not provide KiwiSaver information to your employees or to Inland Revenue • failure to enrol a new employee eligible for automatic enrolment. The penalties are: • $50 a month for employers who file monthly • $250 a month for employers who file twice monthly (page 22). Note: • You won’t be penalised if an employee refuses to supply information or supplies false information to you. • You won’t be penalised for failure to provide a KiwiSaver information pack when required if Inland Revenue does not provide employee information packs to you on time. You must notify us that further packs are required immediately after realising you don’t have enough. In addition, standard tax penalties and knowledge offences apply where either a KiwiSaver employee deduction or compulsory employer contribution is not paid to Inland Revenue or is paid late. This is exactly the same as PAYE deductions where you’re subject to late payment penalties, late filing penalties and use-of-money interest. For more information see the Employer’s guide - IR335. Penalties and interest Compulsory employer contributions will be subject to late payment penalties and shortfall penalties, including any backdated compulsory employer contributions entitlement, short or unpaid. If an overdue amount isn’t paid or an instalment arrangement agreed to, a 10% non-payment penalty (NPP) will be charged. Each month that an amount remains outstanding, a further 10% NPP will be charged. If, after we’ve imposed the penalty, you pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the last NPP will reduce to 5%. Total NPPs imposed are capped at 150% of the unpaid tax per period. Interest won’t be charged on any outstanding compulsory employer contributions. Interest and/or penalties won’t be applied to short or non-payment of voluntary employer contributions. Right of review Within 20 working days of Inland Revenue giving you notice of a decision that affects your KiwiSaver obligations, you can ask for it to be reconsidered. You may have to provide further information to Inland Revenue. Disputes resolution process Not all decisions discussed in right of review above can be reconsidered under the KiwiSaver review process. Some of these other decisions can be disputed under Inland Revenue’s disputes resolution process. For more information about these processes and which one relates to a particular decision go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE19 Your options as an employer What’s important As an employer, KiwiSaver gives you a number of options to offer in your workplace: • You can make voluntary contributions to employees’ KiwiSaver accounts on top of the required compulsory employer contributions. • You can choose the KiwiSaver scheme for your workplace. • If you already offer a superannuation scheme, your options include establishing a KiwiSaver scheme as part of your existing scheme or continuing to operate independently of KiwiSaver. The Government contribution applies if you add a KiwiSaver section to an existing scheme. • You can choose to do none of the above. Employer-chosen schemes You can nominate a KiwiSaver scheme that your employees will join unless they choose their own scheme. This is called an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme. If you don’t have an employer-chosen scheme and your employee does not choose a scheme of their own, Inland Revenue will allocate the employee to a default scheme. Employers who select a KiwiSaver scheme for their employees will not have any financial obligation if the scheme fails. You need to reach an agreement with the scheme provider and arrange for them to give you a supply of product disclosure statements to distribute to your employees. When you give your employee a KiwiSaver information pack, you must also give them a: • copy of the product disclosure statement for your chosen scheme, and a • statement advising them they will be allocated to that scheme unless they choose their own scheme. You need to let us know if you choose another scheme or decide not to offer a chosen scheme any more. Existing workplace schemes KiwiSaver is intended to complement, rather than replace, existing registered superannuation schemes. It creates a number of options for existing registered superannuation schemes, including: • establishing a KiwiSaver scheme as part of your existing scheme • continuing to operate independently of KiwiSaver. Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay. Contributions to existing superannuation schemes count towards compulsory employer contributions, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/contributions-and-deductions A registered superannuation scheme may have been granted an exemption from the automatic enrolment rules, but may not be a complying fund. You should consult the superannuation scheme provider which administers the scheme to find out whether a specific scheme is a complying fund. Find out more For more information about the options for existing schemes, talk to: • your scheme trustees • scheme provider or industry advisor, or • visit the Financial Markets Authority website fma.govt.nz 20KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Glossary Automatic enrolmentIf a new employee is aged 18 or over and under 65, they’ll be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver unless: • they don’t meet the criteria • their employer is exempt. Complying fund A complying fund is a superannuation fund within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Financial Markets Authority as having rules similar to those for KiwiSaver (eg KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability). Compulsory employer contribution The contribution employers are required to make to their employee’s savings in KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. The compulsory employer contribution rate is 3% of your employee’s gross salary or wages. Savings suspensionAfter 12 months a member can apply to Inland Revenue to take a break from making contributions to KiwiSaver. A savings suspension can be from three months to one year, and can be applied for more than once. Default schemesIf someone joins KiwiSaver without selecting a scheme provider, or if their employer doesn’t have a preferred scheme. For a list of default scheme providers go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers Defined contribution schemeA scheme where the benefit is based on contributions plus investment earnings. Most schemes in New Zealand are defined contribution schemes. All KiwiSaver schemes must be a defined contribution scheme. Defined benefit schemeA scheme where the benefit does not relate to the investments of the scheme but is based on a formula that takes into account factors such as a member’s length of service and final salary. ESCTEmployer superannuation contribution tax is a tax on any monetary contribution to a superannuation fund that is paid by an employer for their employee’s benefit. All employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable to have tax withheld. Employer-chosen schemeAn employer can choose the scheme their employee will become a member of if their employee does not select their own scheme when they join KiwiSaver. Exempt employerAn employer approved as exempt from the automatic enrolment rules by the Financial Markets Authority. Financial advisorA financial advisor provides advice to assist financial planning and decisions. This doesn’t include an employer who only gives their employees information about KiwiSaver or selects an employer-chosen scheme. Financial hardship savings suspension If a member is suffering or likely to suffer from financial hardship during the first 12 months of Inland Revenue receiving a contribution, they may be granted a financial hardship savings suspension. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE21 Financial Markets AuthorityThe Financial Markets Authority: • is responsible for registering and regulating KiwiSaver schemes • supervises the management of registered KiwiSaver schemes and other superannuation schemes • monitors and encourages compliance with the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Government contributionsKiwiSaver members and complying fund members, if eligible, will receive a Government contribution tax credit of up to $521.43 a year (equivalent to $10 a week). Gross salary or wagesFor contributions to KiwiSaver schemes, gross salary or wages generally means salary, wages or allowances including: • bonuses • commission • extra salary • gratuity • overtime pay • other remuneration of any kind except: • redundancy payments • the value of overseas accommodation and cost of living allowance • the value of providing board or lodging, or use of a house or quarters, or the payment of an allowance instead of the provision of this benefit • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme • payments under a Voluntary Bonding Scheme funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education. • an overpayment of an amount of an employer’s superannuation cash contribution that an employee chooses to have treated as salary or wages. • honoraria payments made under the Fire and Emergency Act 2017 paid by Fire and Emergency New Zealand to a volunteer. For contributions to complying funds, gross salary or wages has the same meaning as for a KiwiSaver scheme, but excludes bonuses, commissions and other amounts that are not included in the employee’s gross base salary or wages by the relevant complying fund.

The KiwiSaver Act 2006 covers employers who are New Zealand residents or who carry on business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Employers who are not New Zealand residents or do not carry on business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand, may choose whether they offer KiwiSaver in their workplace. A non-resident employer may choose to make KiwiSaver deductions and contributions for their eligible employees. Non-resident employers who are intending to participate in KiwiSaver and who are not registered for PAYE should contact Inland Revenue for more information. For more information about employer obligations for complying funds 1 go to ird.govt.nz The KiwiSaver employee information pack has more general information (page 15). 1 A complying superannuation fund (complying fund) is a section of registered superannuation schemes that have been approved by the Financial Markets Authority as having met certain criteria similar to KiwiSaver (eg KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability). 2KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE How KiwiSaver works Inland Revenue administers KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is a voluntary savings initiative designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for their future. For most people, KiwiSaver is work based. This means they receive information about KiwiSaver from you as their employer, and their KiwiSaver contributions come straight out of their pay. You are also required to contribute to your employee’s savings in KiwiSaver schemes or complying funds. There are a number of membership benefits to encourage employees to save. These are set out in the KiwiSaver employee information pack. Enrolment Eligibility KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand citizens and people entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely. A person needs to be living (or normally living) in New Zealand to join. New employees You must automatically enrol eligible new employees who are not already KiwiSaver members. See page 8 to check if your new employee is eligible for automatic enrolment. Temporary and casual workers may be exempt from KiwiSaver automatic enrolment (page 4). Make KiwiSaver deductions from the employee’s first pay and continue unless they opt out. New employees who have been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver can opt out any time on or after day 14 and on or before day 56 after starting their employment. Their contributions will be refunded. If your employee opts out, your employer contributions will be refunded if you have no amounts owing. Existing employees Existing employees are not subject to automatic enrolment but, if eligible, they can choose to join KiwiSaver. They either sign up direct with the KiwiSaver scheme provider of their choice, or tell you they want to opt in. They will usually do this by giving you a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2, which is in the KiwiSaver information pack. If you receive one of these, you need to determine if they are eligible to opt in (page 4), and send the information to Inland Revenue. You can then start making member and compulsory employer contributions, if applicable. Note: If an existing employee opts in to KiwiSaver they can’t opt out. Employees who return to work after an absence If an employee was automatically ceased you may need to confirm their KiwiSaver status. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/stop-employing-staff Contributions Member contributions Employees can choose a contribution rate of either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages. Employer contributions The compulsory employer contribution rate is 3% of your employee’s gross salary or wages. Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes may reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/contributions-and-deductions KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE3 All employer superannuation cash contributions (employer contributions) to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contributions as salary or wages under the PAYE rules (page 12). How contributions are collected You deduct KiwiSaver contributions from your employee’s salary or wages and pay them to Inland Revenue with your PAYE payments. Keep making deductions and employer contributions until your employee gives you an Opt-out request - KS10 form, savings suspension notice, or Inland Revenue tells you to stop deducting contributions (page 14). KiwiSaver member deductions and employer contributions are paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. Inland Revenue forwards contributions to the member’s chosen KiwiSaver scheme provider. If you pay compulsory employer contributions to an employees complying funds, you pay these direct to the complying fund. Your options as an employer There are several options available if you would like to be more involved in encouraging retirement savings among your employees. These include making additional voluntary employer contributions and/or providing your own employer-based KiwiSaver scheme. You can also nominate a KiwiSaver scheme for your employees to join if they make no choice of their own. This is called an employer-chosen scheme (page 19). A note about providing financial advice You should not provide financial advice to employees. Instead, refer them to the Commission for Financial Literacy and Retirement Income’s website sorted.org.nz or encourage them to talk to an independent financial advisor. You do not have any liability if you only provide general savings or KiwiSaver information or select an employer-chosen scheme. How KiwiSaver contributions are invested Employer Saver (Salary and wage earners) Savings Retirement benefit paid to saver Savings Scheme provider (Savers can choose) 4KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Enrolment This section sets out your responsibilities as an employer for enrolling employees in KiwiSaver. What’s important You are required to: • check whether a new or existing employee is eligible to be a KiwiSaver member (see below) • check whether the new employee should be automatically enrolled (page 6) • distribute the KiwiSaver information pack to new employees who are subject to automatic enrolment, and to existing employees who are considering opting in or who ask for a KiwiSaver information pack. This includes our factsheet Your introduction to KiwiSaver - employee information - KS3, KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 and the Opt-out request - KS10 form • provide new employees with a product disclosure statement if you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19) • automatically enrol all new employees who are subject to automatic enrolment • send us the details of new employees who are enrolled automatically in KiwiSaver using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. Who can join KiwiSaver? KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealand citizens and people entitled to live here permanently. Citizenship and residency To join KiwiSaver, a person must be living (or normally living) in New Zealand and be a New Zealand citizen or entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely. This means New Zealand citizens, Australian citizens and people who hold either a New Zealand or Australian residence permit can join KiwiSaver. State Services employees serving outside New Zealand can also join, subject to certain conditions being met (see below). People who hold temporary, visitor, student or work permits can’t join KiwiSaver. Neither can people who are New Zealand citizens or who are entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely, but are just visiting or on a holiday in New Zealand, eg a New Zealand citizen who normally lives in Australia who returns to New Zealand for a holiday. State Services employees State Services employees who are serving overseas can join KiwiSaver if they remain employed on New Zealand terms and conditions and are serving in a jurisdiction where offers of KiwiSaver scheme membership are lawful and meet other eligibility requirements. Employees under age 18 New and existing employees under 18 can join KiwiSaver but only by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Once an employee under 18 is accepted by the scheme provider, we’ll write to you and ask you to start deducting their contributions. We’ll provide you with the contribution rate for that employee and their name and IRD number. You aren’t required to make compulsory employer contributions on behalf of employees under 18. Employees 65 and over New and existing employees 65 and over can join KiwiSaver, either by opting in through you or by contracting with a scheme provider. They aren’t subject to automatic enrolment, and you aren’t required to make compulsory employer contributions for a newly enrolled employee 65 and over. Temporary and casual employees Temporary employees employed for 28 continuous days or less are not enrolled automatically but can opt in to KiwiSaver. They can join either through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE5 A temporary employee is employed to work ‘as and when required’ without a specific end. Their period of employment starts each time they are engaged to work and stops each time that engagement ends. If an employee is engaged for future work before the last engagement has ended, the combined engagements are considered as one period of employment. As long as each period of employment remains 28 continuous days or less, these employees are not subject to automatic enrolment. The 28 continuous days refers to the period of employment, not the days or hours worked. For example, if an employee has a two-week contract but only works Tuesdays and Thursdays, this counts as 14 days’ employment not four days. The automatic enrolment rules apply to temporary employees if their employment is extended beyond 28 continuous days. Automatic enrolment applies on the 29th day of employment. You must then give them a KiwiSaver information pack and start member and employer contributions from their next pay. The normal opt-out rules apply. Casual employees engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis and who receive holiday pay with their wages are not subject to automatic enrolment. They can join either through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Casual agricultural workers Casual agricultural workers who are employed on a day-to-day basis for no more than three months aren’t enrolled automatically, but can opt in. They can either join through you or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. The automatic enrolment rules apply to casual agricultural workers if their employment is extended beyond three months. You must then give them a KiwiSaver information pack and start member and employer contributions from their next pay. The normal opt-out rules apply. Private domestic workers and other IR56 taxpayers The automatic enrolment rules don’t apply to IR56 taxpayers who pay their own PAYE. They can opt in to KiwiSaver only by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider, but they may deduct contributions from their salary or wages and pay them to Inland Revenue in the same way as PAYE. Private domestic workers may also choose to make compulsory or voluntary employer contributions. Election day workers The automatic rules don’t apply to election day workers. However, these employees may already be members of KiwiSaver. If they give you a completed KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 start deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their pay. Changing jobs but not changing payroll Situations where an employee changes jobs but remains on the same payroll don’t count as new employment, so the automatic enrolment rules do not apply. This includes company amalgamations and the purchase and subsequent operation of a going concern. Examples include an employee who transfers between two company branches where the company has a single centralised payroll, or a business bought as a going concern which retains existing staff but uses a different company IRD number. State and state integrated schools are treated as a single employer. You don’t need to consider automatic enrolment for staff transferring between these schools. Contractors and the self-employed Contractors aren’t employees and are treated as self-employed people for KiwiSaver purposes. This means they aren’t automatically enrolled and can only join by contracting directly with a scheme provider. Don’t make KiwiSaver deductions. Shareholder-employees may be considered employees for KiwiSaver purposes if PAYE is required to be deducted from their salary or wage. If PAYE isn’t required to be deducted, the shareholder-employee may join KiwiSaver as a self-employed person, by contracting directly with a scheme provider. If they join KiwiSaver as an employee, they’ll have contributions deducted from their pay. Shareholder-employees should get advice to determine whether their remuneration is subject to PAYE. Working partners of a partnership that pays them a salary or wage for services provided under a written contract of service will be considered employees for KiwiSaver purposes but won’t be subject to the automatic enrolment rules. They can either join as an employee or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. Seconded employees Employees who are seconded to a new employer and are paid on the new employer’s payroll aren’t subject to automatic enrolment. They may join KiwiSaver as an existing employee by opting in. Returning to their original job at the end of the secondment isn’t considered new employment. 6KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE New employees What’s important Your responsibilities (except if you’re an employer exempt from the automatic enrolment rules - see page 20) are to check whether a new employee: • is eligible to be a KiwiSaver member, and • should be automatically enrolled. If they meet the conditions above: • give your new employee a KiwiSaver information pack. If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme, give them the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19) • deduct member contributions from their first pay • make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies) • pay ESCT on any employer contributions made • give us the employee’s details using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. Send this information through your online account (see below) • pay the member and employer contributions to us with your next PAYE payment • if the employee chooses to opt out of KiwiSaver, send their Opt-out request - KS10 form to us. Employees can opt out between day 14 and day 56 of starting their new employment. New employees who meet the criteria for automatic enrolment Start the automatic enrolment process by giving the new employee a KiwiSaver information pack. You must do this within seven days of the employee starting work. The information pack includes a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2, which the employee can use to let you know whether they want member contributions to be deducted at 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% of their gross salary or wages. If they don’t advise you of their preferred rate, deduct member contributions at the default rate of 3%. Keep the KS2 for your records, do not send it to Inland Revenue. If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme, give your new employee the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise them they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme (page 19). They can choose to move to another KiwiSaver scheme at a later date. Deduct member contributions from the new employee’s pay. Make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies). Give Inland Revenue the full names and IRD numbers of new employees using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. You can also supply this information online. You’re only required to give us the information the employee gives you. You are not responsible if an employee chooses not to provide information for privacy or other reasons. You must provide enrolment information supplied no later than the date your next employment information is due. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE7 New employees who are existing members You need to send Inland Revenue a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form for new employees who are already KiwiSaver members. Unless you are given or shown a valid savings suspension notice, you must deduct member contributions from their first pay. Start deducting member contributions at the default rate of 3% if they don’t elect a rate. You must also make compulsory employer contributions (unless an exception applies). A new employee who is an existing KiwiSaver member must: • tell you their full name and IRD number • let you know whether they want member contributions deducted at the rate of 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% or give you a valid savings suspension notice (page 16). If your new employee is an existing member of KiwiSaver they should give you a completed KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2. Keep the KS2 for your records, do not send it to Inland Revenue. 8KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Are they eligible?

You’ll need to: • deduct member contributions • make compulsory employer contributions • give us your employee’s details using the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form. You’re only required to give us the information the employee gives you. You’re not responsible if an employee chooses not to provide information for privacy or other reasons. You must provide the enrolment information supplied no later than the date your next employment information is due. If your employee is under 18 years old and wants to join KiwiSaver advise them they need to contract directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider (page 4). 10KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Member contributions What’s important You need to: • make sure a new employee’s member contributions start from their first pay • make deductions at the rate they choose (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages), or at the default rate of 3%. These are the only rates they can choose • send deductions to us together with PAYE payments. You can complete your employment information in the payroll returns account in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR You’re also required to make compulsory employer contributions to your employees’ KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. Compulsory employer contributions are explained on page 12. Contribution rates Employees can choose a contribution rate of either 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10% of their gross salary or wages. The employee can make additional voluntary contributions direct to their scheme provider or to Inland Revenue. Make deductions at the default rate of 3% if an employee elects or doesn’t select a rate. Employees can change their contribution rate by providing you a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 or contacting their KiwiSaver scheme provider or by submitting a contribution rate change using myIR. We will send you a letter with a list of contribution rate changes requested through scheme providers and myIR on a weekly basis. Once you receive the KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 or letter from Inland Revenue, you’ll need to: • change the contribution rate from their next pay • keep the KS2 or letter as part of your records. An amendment to an employee’s chosen rate can’t be changed at intervals that are less than three months apart, unless you (the employer) agree. You don’t need to notify us about this. Definition of gross salary or wages KiwiSaver schemes For contributions to KiwiSaver schemes, gross salary or wages generally means total salary, wages or allowances, including bonuses, commission, extra salary, gratuity, overtime and other remuneration of any kind before tax. It does not include: • redundancy payments • payments under a voluntary bonding scheme funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education • the value of overseas accommodation and cost of living allowances • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme • the value of providing board or lodging, or use of a house or part of a house, or the payment of an allowance instead of the provision of this benefit. These are the main inclusions and exclusions from the definition of gross salary or wages. See glossary (page 21). Complying superannuation funds For contributions to complying funds, gross base salary or wages has the same meaning as for a KiwiSaver scheme but excludes bonuses, commissions and other amounts that aren’t included in the employee’s gross base salary or wages by the relevant complying fund. Note: If the employee is a member of both a KiwiSaver scheme and complying fund then deductions should be made to both. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE11 Calculating deductions You can use the online calculator at ird.govt.nz/calculators to work out member contributions at the same time as your employees PAYE. Member contribution calculation tables are also included in the PAYE deductions tables - IR340 and IR341. Here’s an example: An employee earns $600.00 a week and contributes 3% to KiwiSaver. Gross pay$600.00 Less PAYE$ 96.35 Less KiwiSaver contribution$ 18.00(3% of $600.00) Net pay$485.65 Tailored tax code or deduction rate certificate - IR23 Any KiwiSaver contributions are in addition to their tailored tax code or deduction rate. For example, if an employee is on a deduction rate of 30% and they are making KiwiSaver contributions at 4%, total deductions from their salary or wages will be 34%. Employees under age 18 You’ll need to deduct member contributions for KiwiSaver members under 18 if they’re an existing KiwiSaver member or have joined KiwiSaver while employed with you. You’re not required to make compulsory employer contributions on behalf of employees under 18. Starting and stopping deductions You must make KiwiSaver deductions from all payments of salary or wages if: • the employee is subject to automatic enrolment • the employee gives you a KS2 • we notify you and ask you to start deductions. You must stop making KiwiSaver deductions from all payments of salary or wages if: • an opt-out notice takes effect (page 16) • a savings suspension is granted (page 16) • we notify you and ask you to stop deductions • the employee has reached eligibility to withdraw and gives you a Non-deduction notice - KS51. Forwarding member contributions Forward your employee’s KiwiSaver contributions to us along with your PAYE payments using the employment information. These include fields for member net employer contributions and ESCT for each employee. Every field must be completed. Pay complying fund contributions direct to the scheme provider. Don’t pay these through Inland Revenue. Additional contributions If an employee wants to contribute more than the maximum allowed to their KiwiSaver scheme, pay the additional contributions direct to Inland Revenue or the scheme provider instead of using the PAYE system. Scheme providers may offer extra services for members (eg group life insurance). Pay the scheme provider direct for these services. Inland Revenue payments to scheme providers Inland Revenue is required to pass on member contributions received (or which should be received from an employer) to the employee’s scheme provider. We’ll make the payment even if we have not received the contributions. If we do not receive the contributions, we’ll seek to recover the arrears from you in the same way we would recover unpaid PAYE tax debts. 12KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Employer contributions What’s important • You’re required to contribute 3% of your employees’ gross salary or wages to their KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds, excluding defined benefit scheme members (see Glossary for definition). This 3% is in addition to their gross salary or wages. • Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes may reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers • Employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. • KiwiSaver employer contributions are paid to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. You can complete your employment information in the payroll returns account in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers • If you don’t make compulsory employer contributions, you may have penalties imposed. You’re required to contribute to your employees’ savings in KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. Compulsory employer contributions can be made to either scheme but must total the minimum rate Compulsory employer contributions may be backdated effective from the date: • the employee should have been automatically enrolled, or • the employee’s savings suspension expired, or • the employee turned 18, and • deductions and compulsory employer contributions should have occurred. Starting and stopping contributions For new employees, you start paying contributions from their first pay. For existing employees, you pay contributions from their first pay after Inland Revenue or the employee notifies you they are a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund member. You can stop contributions if the employee elects to take a savings suspension and shows you their savings suspension notice, opts out (new employees only) or when Inland Revenue advises you to stop making contributions. Don’t cease employer contributions until you receive a letter from Inland Revenue advising that an employee has reached their withdrawal date. If you haven’t received a letter and you or your employee think you should have, instruct your employee to check the withdrawal date with their scheme provider. Calculating contributions Use this formula to calculate your contribution to your employee’s superannuation: Payment of gross salary or wages × compulsory rate = minimum employer contribution An employee earns $2,600.00 a month and belongs to a KiwiSaver scheme. From the first full pay period, the gross compulsory employer contribution will be: $2,600 × 3% = $78 You only need to pay the compulsory employer contribution if your employee is contributing to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund through their salary or wages. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE13 Employer contributions and tax All employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable for employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). The exception to this is if the employee and employer have agreed to treat some or all of the employer contribution as salary or wages under the PAYE rules. ESCT must be paid to us along with PAYE deductions. Using the figures from the above example the employee earns $2,600.00 a month and has an ESCT rate of 17.5%. The net compulsory employer contribution will be: $2,600 × 3% = $78 $78 × 17.5% = $13.65 (ESCT) $78 − $13.65 = $64.35 (net compulsory employer contribution) You’ll need to ensure that you list the net employer contribution on the employment information and that ESCT is a separate figure for each employee. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers or read our Employer’s guide - IR335. Forwarding contributions KiwiSaver contributions As with employee KiwiSaver deductions, you pay KiwiSaver employer contributions to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. Employment information includes a field for KiwiSaver employer contributions and ESCT. You need to ensure the net amount of KiwiSaver employer contributions is listed, excluding the ESCT. There is a separate field for the ESCT amount. Record compulsory and voluntary contributions as a single total. Inland Revenue will split contributions into compulsory and voluntary amounts. You can complete these online. We pass your employer contributions on to the scheme provider. If a new employee opts out of KiwiSaver, we’ll refund any employer contributions to you if you have no amounts owing. Other contributions Pay contributions other than retirement benefits (eg life insurance premiums) direct to the scheme provider. Complying fund contributions Pay complying fund contributions direct to the scheme provider. Don’t pay these through Inland Revenue. 14KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE General administration What’s important Opt-outs and savings suspension • If a new employee you have automatically enrolled gives you the Opt-out request - KS10 form within 2 to 8 weeks of starting work. You must: - send us the KS10 and the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form if you haven’t already - stop deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their next pay and refund any contributions you hold. • If an employee gives you an opt-out form after 8 weeks, send it to us and continue to deduct member contributions and to make compulsory employer contributions until we advise you otherwise. • Employees can opt out online at ird.govt.nz or by sending us the Opt-out request - KS10 form.

Your introduction to KiwiSaver – employee information KS3 | April 2022 16KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Requests to opt out If a new employee who’s subject to automatic enrolment gives you an Opt-out request - KS10 form you need to: • make sure they’re within the two to eight week opt-out period (on or after day 14 and on or before day 56 of starting employment) • stop deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions from their next pay • refund any member contributions you’ve made but not yet sent to us, or you can send them with your PAYE payment and we’ll refund the employee direct. If you refund the member’s contributions direct, they’ll benefit by receiving the refund immediately • send both the opt-out and the New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K forms to us so we know that the new employee was automatically enrolled and has opted out. You can complete these forms online. We’ll refund to you the employer contributions you’ve made and any ESCT made on these if you have no amounts owing. The refund will be paid with interest. Savings suspensions KiwiSaver members can take a break from saving 12 months after they made their first contribution to their KiwiSaver. This is called a savings suspension. It can be for a minimum of three months, up to a maximum of one year. An employee can apply for a savings suspension in myIR or by calling us. If we approve the request, either your employee will show you a valid savings suspension notice from Inland Revenue or we will notify you if your employee has asked us to. You can stop deducting member contributions and making employer contributions once you’ve seen a valid savings suspension notice. An employee can give you notice to restart their deductions but they cannot ask you to start and stop deductions too often. The minimum period before requesting a change, unless you agree otherwise, is three months. When an employee shows you a current savings suspension notice, you may refund any contributions you’ve deducted that you haven’t passed to Inland Revenue, otherwise the employee should contact us to request their refund. We’ll write again asking you to restart deductions when the savings suspension finishes. You aren’t required to pay compulsory employer contributions if an employee is taking a savings suspension. If you choose, you can continue to make employer contributions. Any contributions you make to employees on a savings suspension are voluntary and will be liable for ESCT (page 13). Deductions from accident compensation payments If you take part in ACC’s partnership programme or have an ACC employer reimbursement agreement where you pay your employee’s ACC payments, your employee’s KiwiSaver member contributions must continue to be made. You aren’t required to pay employer contributions, but you can on a voluntary basis if you wish. If your employee wants to stop their member contributions they must apply for a savings suspension. When ACC pays the employee weekly compensation you don’t need to make the employee deductions or employer contributions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver Parental leave payments If you continue to pay your employee a salary or wage while they are on parental leave, keep deducting member contributions and making compulsory employer contributions unless they take a savings suspension. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE17 Contributions made in error If you make an error relating to KiwiSaver in your employment information you can amend this. If you file online, you can amend your employment information in myIR. We’ll refund any contributions made in error. If these include employer contributions and ESCT, these will be repaid to you. This process will take longer if we have to request the refund from the member’s scheme. Note: You have 4 years from the date you originally send an Employment information – IR348 to make any changes. After 4 years, your assessment becomes final and changes can only be made to student loan or child support deductions. Record keeping You need to record which employees are KiwiSaver members, their contribution rate, and any notification of savings suspensions or opt-outs. Your PAYE records should show the member contributions, net employer contributions and any ESCT you’ve deducted and passed on to us. You must keep records for seven years after the person leaves employment with you. In particular, employers must keep information about the total employer contributions made and gaps in employees’ employment. Obligations and compliance Your obligations • Determine if your new employees are eligible to be automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver. The automatic enrolment rules don’t apply if you’re an exempt employer. • Determine whether any new employees or existing employees who wish to have KiwiSaver deductions from their salary or wages are eligible to be KiwiSaver members (pages 4 - 6). • Determine whether any new employees or existing employees who wish to have KiwiSaver deductions from their salary or wages under the age of 18 are existing KiwiSaver members and provide you with a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2 (page 4). Note: Employees under the age of 18 cannot join KiwiSaver through their employer. They must opt in through their chosen scheme provider. • Provide a KiwiSaver information pack within seven days to: - a new employee who’s eligible for automatic enrolment - an existing employee considering opting in - an existing employee who requests one. • Provide an IRD number and name to Inland Revenue for each new employee who’s eligible for automatic enrolment and each employee who opts into KiwiSaver. • If you have an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme give the new employees the product disclosure statement for that scheme and advise they’ll be allocated to this scheme unless they choose their own KiwiSaver scheme. • Deduct member contributions. You’re required to make compulsory employer contributions and pay them to Inland Revenue by the due date (page 11). • Make deductions and contributions at the correct rate (page 12). • Calculate ESCT (page 13). 18KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Compliance There are KiwiSaver penalties for: • failure to provide information - where you do not provide KiwiSaver information to your employees or to Inland Revenue • failure to enrol a new employee eligible for automatic enrolment. The penalties are: • $50 a month for employers who file monthly • $250 a month for employers who file twice monthly (page 22). Note: • You won’t be penalised if an employee refuses to supply information or supplies false information to you. • You won’t be penalised for failure to provide a KiwiSaver information pack when required if Inland Revenue does not provide employee information packs to you on time. You must notify us that further packs are required immediately after realising you don’t have enough. In addition, standard tax penalties and knowledge offences apply where either a KiwiSaver employee deduction or compulsory employer contribution is not paid to Inland Revenue or is paid late. This is exactly the same as PAYE deductions where you’re subject to late payment penalties, late filing penalties and use-of-money interest. For more information see the Employer’s guide - IR335. Penalties and interest Compulsory employer contributions will be subject to late payment penalties and shortfall penalties, including any backdated compulsory employer contributions entitlement, short or unpaid. If an overdue amount isn’t paid or an instalment arrangement agreed to, a 10% non-payment penalty (NPP) will be charged. Each month that an amount remains outstanding, a further 10% NPP will be charged. If, after we’ve imposed the penalty, you pay in full or enter into an instalment arrangement, the last NPP will reduce to 5%. Total NPPs imposed are capped at 150% of the unpaid tax per period. Interest won’t be charged on any outstanding compulsory employer contributions. Interest and/or penalties won’t be applied to short or non-payment of voluntary employer contributions. Right of review Within 20 working days of Inland Revenue giving you notice of a decision that affects your KiwiSaver obligations, you can ask for it to be reconsidered. You may have to provide further information to Inland Revenue. Disputes resolution process Not all decisions discussed in right of review above can be reconsidered under the KiwiSaver review process. Some of these other decisions can be disputed under Inland Revenue’s disputes resolution process. For more information about these processes and which one relates to a particular decision go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE19 Your options as an employer What’s important As an employer, KiwiSaver gives you a number of options to offer in your workplace: • You can make voluntary contributions to employees’ KiwiSaver accounts on top of the required compulsory employer contributions. • You can choose the KiwiSaver scheme for your workplace. • If you already offer a superannuation scheme, your options include establishing a KiwiSaver scheme as part of your existing scheme or continuing to operate independently of KiwiSaver. The Government contribution applies if you add a KiwiSaver section to an existing scheme. • You can choose to do none of the above. Employer-chosen schemes You can nominate a KiwiSaver scheme that your employees will join unless they choose their own scheme. This is called an employer-chosen KiwiSaver scheme. If you don’t have an employer-chosen scheme and your employee does not choose a scheme of their own, Inland Revenue will allocate the employee to a default scheme. Employers who select a KiwiSaver scheme for their employees will not have any financial obligation if the scheme fails. You need to reach an agreement with the scheme provider and arrange for them to give you a supply of product disclosure statements to distribute to your employees. When you give your employee a KiwiSaver information pack, you must also give them a: • copy of the product disclosure statement for your chosen scheme, and a • statement advising them they will be allocated to that scheme unless they choose their own scheme. You need to let us know if you choose another scheme or decide not to offer a chosen scheme any more. Existing workplace schemes KiwiSaver is intended to complement, rather than replace, existing registered superannuation schemes. It creates a number of options for existing registered superannuation schemes, including: • establishing a KiwiSaver scheme as part of your existing scheme • continuing to operate independently of KiwiSaver. Your contributions to existing superannuation schemes reduce the amount of compulsory employer contributions you’re required to pay. Contributions to existing superannuation schemes count towards compulsory employer contributions, if they meet certain conditions. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/contributions-and-deductions A registered superannuation scheme may have been granted an exemption from the automatic enrolment rules, but may not be a complying fund. You should consult the superannuation scheme provider which administers the scheme to find out whether a specific scheme is a complying fund. Find out more For more information about the options for existing schemes, talk to: • your scheme trustees • scheme provider or industry advisor, or • visit the Financial Markets Authority website fma.govt.nz 20KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE Glossary Automatic enrolmentIf a new employee is aged 18 or over and under 65, they’ll be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver unless: • they don’t meet the criteria • their employer is exempt. Complying fund A complying fund is a superannuation fund within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Financial Markets Authority as having rules similar to those for KiwiSaver (eg KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability). Compulsory employer contribution The contribution employers are required to make to their employee’s savings in KiwiSaver schemes and complying funds. The compulsory employer contribution rate is 3% of your employee’s gross salary or wages. Savings suspensionAfter 12 months a member can apply to Inland Revenue to take a break from making contributions to KiwiSaver. A savings suspension can be from three months to one year, and can be applied for more than once. Default schemesIf someone joins KiwiSaver without selecting a scheme provider, or if their employer doesn’t have a preferred scheme. For a list of default scheme providers go to ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/joining-kiwisaver/kiwisaver-providers Defined contribution schemeA scheme where the benefit is based on contributions plus investment earnings. Most schemes in New Zealand are defined contribution schemes. All KiwiSaver schemes must be a defined contribution scheme. Defined benefit schemeA scheme where the benefit does not relate to the investments of the scheme but is based on a formula that takes into account factors such as a member’s length of service and final salary. ESCTEmployer superannuation contribution tax is a tax on any monetary contribution to a superannuation fund that is paid by an employer for their employee’s benefit. All employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying funds are liable to have tax withheld. Employer-chosen schemeAn employer can choose the scheme their employee will become a member of if their employee does not select their own scheme when they join KiwiSaver. Exempt employerAn employer approved as exempt from the automatic enrolment rules by the Financial Markets Authority. Financial advisorA financial advisor provides advice to assist financial planning and decisions. This doesn’t include an employer who only gives their employees information about KiwiSaver or selects an employer-chosen scheme. Financial hardship savings suspension If a member is suffering or likely to suffer from financial hardship during the first 12 months of Inland Revenue receiving a contribution, they may be granted a financial hardship savings suspension. KIWISAVER EMPLOYER GUIDE21 Financial Markets AuthorityThe Financial Markets Authority: • is responsible for registering and regulating KiwiSaver schemes • supervises the management of registered KiwiSaver schemes and other superannuation schemes • monitors and encourages compliance with the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Government contributionsKiwiSaver members and complying fund members, if eligible, will receive a Government contribution tax credit of up to $521.43 a year (equivalent to $10 a week). Gross salary or wagesFor contributions to KiwiSaver schemes, gross salary or wages generally means salary, wages or allowances including: • bonuses • commission • extra salary • gratuity • overtime pay • other remuneration of any kind except: • redundancy payments • the value of overseas accommodation and cost of living allowance • the value of providing board or lodging, or use of a house or quarters, or the payment of an allowance instead of the provision of this benefit • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme • payments under a Voluntary Bonding Scheme funded by the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education. • an overpayment of an amount of an employer’s superannuation cash contribution that an employee chooses to have treated as salary or wages. • honoraria payments made under the Fire and Emergency Act 2017 paid by Fire and Emergency New Zealand to a volunteer.

Land and Income Amendment Act 1965 (farm equalisation scheme)
=============================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Amendment Act 1965 (farm equalisation scheme) from PIB vol 21 Apr 1965.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 21, April 1965.

.

### More about the Farm Income Equalisation Scheme

The Minister of Finance, the Hon HR Lake has announced that Government has approved, in principle, a voluntary farm income equalisation scheme. The scheme was recommended by the Agricultural Development Conference. Confirming legislation will be introduced during the next session of Parliament.

#### **What the scheme can do**

The scheme will-

*   enable farmers to iron out rates of tax due to rises and falls in incomes,
*   encourage farmers to put aside part of their incomes in good years and to use this money for farm development in years when farm incomes fall,
*   help to remove a cause of inflation and therefore help to maintain a more steady rate of economic growth.

#### Scope of the scheme

The scheme will apply to the income of any farming or agricultural business carried out on land in New Zealand. It will include such businesses as-

*   market gardeners,
*   orchardists,
*   apiarists, and
*   nurserymen.

#### Deposits accepted now

In anticipation of the legislation, deposits will be accepted immediately for the income year ended 31 March 1965 or equivalent balance date. Special provisions will be built into the legislation for deposits to be accepted from farmers whose financial year ended before 31 March 1965.

#### Main features of scheme

These are considered in the following paragraphs.

#### Deposits

_How much a farmer can deposit_

Voluntary deposits of amounts up to 25 per cent of assessable farm income may be made with the local tax office. The smallest deposit that can be made is £100 unless 25 per cent of the assessable farm income is less than £100. A series of deposits may be made for an income year limited in total to 25 per cent of assessable farm income.

_When can deposits be made_

Deposits for an income year may be made either,

1.  during that year,
2.  up to one month after the due date for filing a tax return or within 6 months after balance date, whichever is the earlier. The Commissioner may extend this time to meet special cases.

_No deposits in year of voluntary withdrawal_

Deposits may not be made during the same income year in which a voluntary withdrawal has been made. However, arbitrary refunds made after the 5 year maximum period of deposit will not stop farmers from making deposits in that year.

#### Where to lodge deposits

Deposits should be made at the local tax office which will in turn pay them into a special account at the Reserve Bank.

_No interest will be paid_

No interest will be paid on deposits. They will be frozen by the Reserve Bank. This is in line with Wool Proceeds Retention Deposits and Snow Loss Reserves.

_Deposits are deductible_

The deposit will be deductible from the income of the year for which deposit is made.

#### Refunds

_How much can be withdrawn_

In general, the smallest amount which will be refunded is £100. An exception would be when the balance of a farmer's account is less than £100. There are special rules for refunds in event of the farmer's death or his retirement from farming. These are mentioned later.

_When can deposits be withdrawn_

Normally a farmer may withdraw his deposit after 12 Months. However, the Commissioner may allow him to withdraw sooner if, for instance, holding the deposit caused hardship.

#### General rules for withdrawal

Withdrawals for an income year may be made either,

1.  During that year;
2.  Up to one month after the due date for filing a tax return or within 6 months after balance date, whichever is the earlier. The Commissioner may extend this time to meet special cases.

Refunds will be made on the "first in first out" basis.

_Withdrawals are assessable income_

A refund is treated as assessable income in the year for which it is made.

_Refunds on retirement before farming_

When a farmer retires from farming any deposits remaining in his reserve account will be refunded. These will be assessed in the year of retirement unless he elects to have them assessed wholly or partly in the year or years for which they were made.

_Refunds on farmer's death_

These will be made to the trustees on the same basis as refunds on retirement from farming.

_Refunds after amounts deposited for 5 years_

Any deposit remaining 5 years after the end of the year for which it was made will be refunded. The amount will be treated as assessable income in the income year in which the refund is made.

#### Queries answered

The local tax office will answer any inquiries about this subject.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1964 - Know-how payments and royalties from New Zealand
=========================================================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1964 - Know-how payments and royalties from New Zealand from PIB vol 20 Mar 1965.

This commentary item was published in Public Information Bulletin Volume 20, March 1965.

[More information about Public Information Bulletins.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Know-how payments and royalties from New Zealand

#### How they are taxed

Some sections of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1964 have wide application to dividends, interest, royalties and know-how payments flowing from New Zealand to overseas residents.

#### Know-how defined for first time

For many years there has been legislation dealing with dividends, interest royalties in our tax, law, but this is the first time the Tax Act has defined know-how payments and when they will be assessable to New Zealand tax. This new legislation follows the growing trend overseas to tax know-how payments in the country from which made.

#### In this article

The purpose of this article is to-

*   set out the duty of persons in New Zealand making royalty or know-how payments to deduct non-resident withholding tax;
*   **and**
*   give advice on claiming expenses against such payments.

#### Four points

In considering this subject, four basic points should be kept in mind.

*   The legislation which deems royalties and know-how payments to be assessable income in certain circumstances. Section 88(e) and 88(ee) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 are relevant.
*   The circumstances when royalties and know-how payments have a source in New Zealand. Section 167(11) covers this point which is important because under section 165(2) a non-resident is liable for New Zealand tax only on income which has a source in this country.
*   Non-resident withholding tax at a flat rate of 15 percent is payable on gross payments to non-resident for both royalty and know-how. However, when a payment tot know-how alone wholly covered by deductible expenditure of the payee applicable to the payment, the know-how is not assessable income and there is no liability for withholding tax.
*   The 15 percent on the gross is final for "cultural" royalties. Additional tax will be payable on "industrial" royalties and know-how payments if tax assessed in an annual assessment on the net amount after deducting expenses exceeds the withholding tax. Any other income is also included in the annual assessment.

There are more details on these points in the following paragraphs and in the charts on pages 7 and 8

#### When royalties and know-how payments are assessable

These are defined in the Tax Act as follows-

**Royalty payment**s - All royalties or other like payments dependant upon production from or the use of any real or personal property,whether or not they are instalments of the purchase price of any property. Section 88(e).

**Cultural royalties** - A payment of the type mentioned in section 88(e) which is for the use, production or reproduction of, or for the privilege of using, producing or reproducing a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work in which copy right subsists. Section 203Z.

**Know-how payments** - All payments for the supply, in connection with the carrying on of a business, of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge, information or assistance, not being payments which are wholly reimbursement of deductible expenditure of the payee Section 88(ee).

The definition of know-how includes payments whether paid in a lump sum or periodically, in the wide field of commercial knowledge, information or assistance. It applies to payment made to New Zealand residents and to non-residents as from 1 April 1964. The definition would embrace for instance payments for-

*   the supply or use of
    *   a formula, secret process, or design;
    *   publicity, instructional or marketing material;
*   research, administration and accountancy services;
*   instruction on how to install, operate, and maintain machinery;
*   information on sales promotion.
*   but not payments for-
*   brokerage or insurance commission for work done overseas;
*   personal services performed overseas by an agent or employee;
*   internal transfer or credit given by a branch in New Zealand to its head office overseas. However, the deduction allowable against the branch profits liable to New Zealand tax will be limited to the branch proportion of expenses actually incurred.

#### When royalties and know-how payments have a source in New Zealand

Royalty and know-how payments have a source in New Zealand when-

*   paid by a resident in New Zealand unless paid in respect of a business carried on outside New Zealand.
*   paid by a person not resident in New Zealand and are deductible in working out his New Zealand income.

The new source in New Zealand rules apply as from 1st April 1964.

From 26 June 1964 royalty and know-how payments having a source in New Zealand and paid or credited to non-resident companies are liable for non-resident withholding tax. Special circumstances apply when royalties are paid or credited to British companies during the period 26 June 1964 to 31 March 1965. These are explained in another article in this Bulletin

To individual non-resident taxpayers the non-resident withholding tax will first apply to payments made or credited to them after 31 March 1965.

### When withholding tax should be deducted

#### Apportionment

Payments may be for combination of industrial royalties and know-how. If so, it is important to note the effect of section 88A - inserted by section 12 of the 1964 Amendment Act. Under this section the Commissioner may apportion a payment when it is partly for know-how and partly for any other purpose for instance, to cover a royalty. The section does not permit a payment made exclusively for know-how to be apportioned between the amount reimbursing expenses and the profit or income content of the payment.

#### Payment exclusively for know-how

*   If the non-resident recipient is able to certify that the deductible outgoings incurred in supplying the know-how are equal to or in excess of the gross payment, the payment is not income and not liable to withholding tax.
*   If the non-resident recipient is unable to certify that the payment is wholly a reimbursement of expenditure the 15 percent withholding tax is levied on the gross payment without a deduction for expenses.
*   When a non-resident claims that a payment for know-how is wholly covered by deductible expenses, the local Tax Office will require, in the first instance, a certificate to that effect from an overseas auditor or chartered accountant. The certificate will, in clear cut cases, be accepted for several subsequent years provided the circumstances are unchanged

#### Payment exclusively a royalty

The gross payment is liable to withholding tax at 15 percent. The provision which exempts a know-how payment that is wholly reimbursing does not extend to a payment for royalty. Although revenue outgoings applicable to the royalty may in an extreme case exceed the gross payment, it is still liable to withholding tax.

#### Payment partly for know-how and partly for royalty

If necessary, an apportionment can be made under section 88A. This will be unnecessary when revenue expenses incurred in supplying the know - how are less than the know-how part of the payment. In these circumstances the 15 percent withholding tax is payable on the total gross payment because the know-how part is not wholly reimbursing. If the know-how part is wholly covered by deductible expenses, the 15 percent withholding tax is only payable on the royalty part of the gross payment.

#### Minimum tax or annual assessment

The 15 percent withholding tax on the gross payments of industrial royalties and know-how is, generally, a minimum tax. Additional tax wilt be payable after the end of the financial year in which the royalties and payments were derived if tax assessed at annual rates on the net income after allowing deductible expenses exceeds the 15 percent withholding tax.

Here is an example-

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross payment | £4,000 |
| less expenses | £1,000 |
| Net income | £3,000 |
| Withholding tax on gross payments | £ 600 |
| Annual tax on net income | £1,012.10.0 |
| less credit for withholding tax | £   600.  0.0 |
| Payable in annual assessment | £   412.10.0 |

#### Issue of assessments: responsibility of agents

The records of non-residents and the issue of assessments will be handled by the Absentee Assessment Centre in the Department's Dunedin office.

The initial responsibility of the payer is to deduct and account for withholding tax. Payment of any further tax assessed after the end of the year is primarily the responsibility of the non-resident recipient. He may appoint an agent to act for him or the payer, as a subsidiary of a non-resident company, may act as agent. The Commissioner may give notice to any payer that he will thereafter be responsible as agent for filing returns and paying the tax assessed.

Assessments may therefore be issued in New Zealand to the appointed agent, the New Zealand subsidiary company or the payer once he has been notified by the Commissioner. It is desirable for practical reasons that the payer establish his position with both the non-resident and the tax office so that he may make arrangements if necessary for payment of any further tax due.

#### Arbitrary allowances for expenses

It is recognised that overseas recipients may find it difficult to give full details of the expenses applicable to royalties, know-how and similar payments from New Zealand. To help these people the Commissioner will allow, as a minimum deduction in an annual assessment, the following percentages for expenses without supporting claims-

| Nature of payments | Percentage allowable |
| --- | --- |
| 1\. Trade mark | 25% |
| 2\. Patent | 35% |
| 3\. Know-how | 50% |
| 4\. Any combination of 1 or 2 above with 3 | 40% |

#### Claims for actual expenses

If it is considered that actual expenses exceed the arbitrary allowance, a tax return, giving details to support the claim for the higher deduction, should be sent in on behalf of the overseas recipient. In the first instance it would be desirable for the claim to be supported by a certificate from an overseas auditor or chartered accountant setting out the amount and how it is arrived at.

The expenses of a non-resident in the production of industrial royalties and know-how from New Zealand may include in addition to actual expenses in New Zealand, the New Zealand proportion of-

*   the expenses incurred in developing or acquiring the trade mark, patent, or know-how  
    **and**
*   administration and other overhead expenses.

The amount for development or acquisition will generally follow the treatment of such expenditure in the books of the non-resident recipient.

If expenditure on new or continuing research is charged direct to revenue accounts each year the New Zealand proportion may be claimed, even though the patent or knowledge used in New Zealand may have been developed some time in the past.

On the other hand if the original expenses were capitalised, the amount allowable would be the New Zealand proportion of the amount written off during the year.

### Expenses relating to know-how payments

**When payment is reimbursing**

When it is established that the payment for know-how is wholly reimbursing to the payee there is no liability to deduct withholding tax. This will arise, for example, when the payment represents no more than reimbursement of-

*   administration and head office overhead expenses for management and technical assistance to a subsidiary company trading in New Zealand;
*   the actual salary of a technician supplied under an agreement and paid by the non-resident, plus an agreed and reasonable percentage to cover overheads.

#### When expenses exceed the payment

The expenses may exceed the payment or that part of a lump sum payment relating to know-how.

*   If the payment is for know-how alone, consideration will be given to carry forward the excess. It will be included with the expenses of the following year to determine whether the payment for that year is wholly reimbursing and therefore, not liable for withholding tax.
*   If the payment is a mixture of royalty and know-how, the excess may be allowed against the royalty part in the annual assessment, provided the payments for royalty and know-how are closely related, for instance, associated with the one agreement.

#### Variation in the deduction or payment of withholding tax

Public Information Bulletin 17 notified that the Commissioner would consider requests that payments of non-resident withholding income be made without deduction of withholding tax when-

*   tax has already been paid in annual assessments on the non-resident in past years,
*   **and**
*   the tax in an annual assessment exceeds the withholding tax which would normally be deducted.

This variation will apply only to payments of industrial royalties, know-how and interest. Payments of dividends and cultural royalties are not included in an annual assessment and the deductions of withholding tax are final.

The Commissioner will also consider variations to provide for centralised accounting in one sum when numerous small payments of royalties. particularly cultural royalties, are made during the year.

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1964

**Section 1** - Short title.

Application Of Act

**Section 2** Except where otherwise provided, this Act relates to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1964.

### Part I \[Taxation of non-residents\]

Part I of the Act consists of Sections 3 to 19.

#### Main features

There are three main features -

**Firstly:**  
it increases the basic rate of ordinary income tax for non-resident companies.

**Secondly:**  
it introduces a new tax - "non-resident withholding tax" - on income derived from New Zealand by non- residents.

**Thirdly:**  
it strengthens the tax law relating to the taxing of interest, royalties and other income arising in New Zealand.

#### Additional definitions

**Section 3** gives definitions which are necessary to save repetition in later sections. The important definition is "**Fixed establishment**" which sets out the conditions in which a taxpayer is deemed to carry on business in New Zealand, other than in a temporary manner.

#### Fixed establishment defined

A "fixed establishment" means a fixed place of business in which substantial business is carried on by that person.

It includes -

*   a branch, factory, shop or workshop where substantial business is carried on;
*   a mine, quarry, oil well, or other place where natural resources are or can be exploited;
*   an agricultural, pastoral or forestry property.

It excludes -

*   the use of facilities solely for storing, displaying or delivering goods or merchandise belonging to the business;
*   a fixed place of business maintained solely for purchasing goods or merchandise;
*   a fixed place of business maintained solely for collecting information or advertising for the business.

#### Company rates of ordinary income tax

**Section 4** fixes the rates of tax payable by companies from the 1 April 1964. The basic rates for resident companies remain unchanged. The basic rates for companies not resident in New Zealand are increased by 5% in the £1. For non-resident companies the rate will commence at 3s6d in the £1, increasing by 1/100th of 1d on every £1 of income to £3,600 to reach the maximum rate of 9s6d on every £1 of income in excess of £3,600.

#### Rebates for non-resident companies

**Section 5** allows companies rebates from either

*   the new 5% non-resident company tax,
*   **or**
    
*   the withholding tax, in appropriate cases.

It inserts new sections 78C, 78D and 78E into the principal Act.

**Sections 78C and 78D** provide rebates from the 5% for -

*   non-resident investment companies on income derived from development assets,
*   **and**
    
*   life insurance companies carrying on business in New Zealand.

These classes of taxpayer are subject to special methods of assessment which are preserved by allowing the rebates.

**Section 78E** provides for a rebate of the 15% dividend withholding tax or the 5% non-resident tax when the non-resident company in any year pays dividends to shareholders resident in New Zealand.

The following notes will assist in understanding the purpose and calculation of the rebate.

**Five Points** -

*   The rebates apply only to Non-resident companies;
*   The basic principle is that the full sum requited for dividends paid to New Zealand resident shareholders is deemed to be met in the following order -
    1.  out of New Zealand dividends derived;
    2.  any excess over New Zealand dividends, out of other New Zealand income; so far as that income extends.
*   In working out the rebates the 15% withholding tax on interest, royalties and "know-how" payments is deemed to include the 5% additional tax in all cases when the withholding tax is final.
*   The rebate provisions cover cases when:
    1.  the company's only New Zealand income is dividends.
    2.  the company's New Zealand income is dividends plus other income.
    3.  the company's New Zealand income is other than dividends.
*   The purpose of the rebate is-  
      
    Firstly:  
    to rebate the 15% withholding tax deducted from New Zealand dividends on an amount equal to the dividends paid to New Zealand resident shareholders;  
      
    **and**  
      
    Secondly:  
    when there is any excess paid, to rebate an amount equal to 5% of the pre-taxed profits required to provide that excess.

#### "Grossing up" procedure

A "grossing- up" procedure is provided to arrive at the amount of pre-tax profits necessary to meet the dividend actually paid to the New Zealand resident shareholder.

When more that 50% of the non-resident company's share capital is held by New Zealand resident shareholders an alternative rebate procedure is available based on New Zealand held capital in relation to total capital.

**Example of "grossing up"**

Non-resident company derives £10,000 business income from New Zealand and pays £4,000 dividends to New Zealand resident shareholders.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income before tax | \=  |     | £10,000 |
| Tax-paid residue |     |     |     |
| Ordinary income tax on £20,000 at resident company basic rate (instead of non-resident company basic rate) | \=  | £3,720 |     |
| Social security income tax @ 1s 6d in £ on £10,000 | \=  | £750 | £4,460 |
| Tax paid residue |     |     | £5,540 |

  
Grossing-up the £4,000 to its pre-tax figure.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £4,000 | x   | 10,000 | \=  | £7,220 |
| 1   | 5,540 |

#### Consequential amendments

**Section 6** makes amendments consequential to section 5. The effect of the amendments is to maintain the present tax position on -

*   income derived by non-resident investment companies from investment in approved development projects
*   reversionary bonuses paid to New Zealand policy holders by life insurance companies assessable under section 149.

The section also covers the special position of non-resident life insurance companies deriving income from New Zealand but not assessed under Section 149.

#### Special exemptions for absentees

**Section 7** withdraws the personal exemption of £468 at present allowed to non resident individual taxpayers.

It will apply from 1 April 1965.

From that date, individual non-resident taxpayers will not be entitled to special exemptions, except against income earned from personal services performed on a visit to New Zealand.

Against this income they will be entitled to the proportion of all exemptions, except life insurance exemptions, based on the number of weeks for which pay was received during the income year.

A similar proportion of the £104 social security income tax exemption is also allowed.

#### Income exempt from tax

**Section 8** ensures that tax will not be levied on interest from loans floated under an agreement or arrangement with the Government of New Zealand when exemption of the interest from New Zealand tax is one of the terms of the loan. It also continues the exemption of interest derived on Government Loans by non-residents when the interest is paid outside New Zealand.

#### Absentees pay no social security income tax in some cases

**Section 9** provides that an absentee will not be liable to pay social security income tax on income from New Zealand, except income from personal services, unless he is personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the year.

Previously an absentee could be liable on all income if he came to New Zealand and earned any income from personal services.

This section applies from 1 April 1965.

#### Dividends exempt from income tax

**Section 10** withdraws from 25 June 1964 the exemption from tax on dividends derived from New Zealand at present allowed to non-resident companies.

The following exemptions from the general liability are provided -

*   when the dividend is declared before but derived after 26 June 1964 but is paid within a reasonable time,
*   when the dividend is derived from the winding up of a company which commenced before 26 June 1964,
*   when the dividend which is paid, before 31 March 1969, is from income derived up to 31 March 1964, e.g. is satisfied by a bonus issue of shares or by a credit for uncalled capital on existing shares, and the capital is to be used in the continuing interests of the business in New Zealand. This exemption may be reviewed where necessary in certain circumstances.

#### Items included in assessable income

**Section 11** inserts a new paragraph (ee) into section 88 of the principal Act to include as assessable income "know-how" payments. It will apply to all payments made from 1 April 1964 for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or assistance in the carrying on of a business. Any payment which is wholly a reimbursement of expenses incurred by the recipient is excluded from the scope of the section.

#### Commissioner may determine amount paid for "know-how"

**Section 12** inserts a new section 88A into the principal Act to provide that when any payment is made partly for "know-how" and partly for any other purpose, the Commissioner may determine what part of the payment is assessable income. Many payments of the type mentioned in the previous section are included with payments which reimburse expenditure incurred by the recipient.

#### Rebate in proprietary assessments

**Section 13** provides a rebate to ensure that the 5% non-resident tax is not charged on proprietary income derived by a non-resident company from a New Zealand company. Any dividend from the proprietary company will now be subject to withholding tax and the purpose of this rebate is to avoid double taxing.

#### Assessment of life insurance companies

**Section 14** preserves the special method of assessment applied by section 149 of the principal Act to life insurance companies carrying on business in New Zealand, by continuing to allow the deduction of dividends derived against assessable income.

Without this section these dividends would have become liable for tax.

#### Income deemed to be derived in New Zealand

**Section 15** amends section 167 of the principal Act so that interest on money lent outside New Zealand will have a source in New Zealand when lent to a non-resident of New Zealand provided the money is to be used in a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand and when lent to a resident except when used in a fixed establishment outside New Zealand.

Exceptions are made in the case of money lent in a banking business or in a business comprising borrowing and lending money. That profit is taxable in New Zealand as business income.

Royalties and "know-how" payments are given a source in New Zealand when paid by a resident of New Zealand except in respect of a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside New Zealand, or by a non-resident if deducted in arriving at his income which is assessable for New Zealand tax.

#### Assessment Of Insurance Underwriters

**Section 16** preserves the rates of tax at present applicable to insurance underwriters.

### Part VII C - non-resident withholding tax

**Section 17** inserts a new Part VII C in the principal Act. This part deals exclusively with the new non-resident withholding tax and consists of new sections 203R to 203ZK.

#### Definitions

**Section 203R** contains definitions

#### Application section

**Section 203S** is the application section for Part VIIC and uses the new term non-resident withholding income in describing dividends, interest and royalties derived by non residents and subject to withholding tax.

#### Non-resident companies

Dividends, interest and royalties derived by a non-resident company after 26 June 1964 are subject to withholding tax.

#### Non-resident individuals

In the case of a non-resident, other than a company, these types of income derived before 1 April 1965 are not subject to withholding tax.

#### Annual assessment in some cases

When interest is derived by either a company or an individual who carries on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, the withholding provisions will not apply and the income will be subject to annual assessment.

#### More exemptions

Further exemptions from withholding provisions are also provided for

*   exempt income
*   income from hiring films
*   income derived by life insurance companies to which Section 149 applies
*   income derived by certain mining companies
*   income derived by "non-resident investment companies" from "development projects"

#### Non-resident withholding tax

**Section 203T** makes non-residents liable to withholding tax of 15% on the gross amount of non-resident withholding income.

#### Deduction of non-resident withholding tax

**Section 203U** sets out the responsibility to deduct withholding tax when the income is paid in cash.

#### Who makes the deduction

Any person in New Zealand who makes the payment to a non-resident is required to withhold tax,

**or**

an agent or other person in New Zealand who receives a payment without deduction of tax or with a part deduction is required to withhold the tax or the balance of tax.

Provisions is also made for an agent or other person in New Zealand of the non-resident to be advised in writing when receiving the income, that withholding tax has been deducted.

#### Withholding tax on dividends not paid in cash

**Section 203V** sets out the requirements when a dividend is not paid in cash.

The company paying the dividend or an agent in New Zealand may not pay the dividend to, or in the interests of the non-resident, until the withholding tax has been paid to the Commissioner.

The Commissioner is to give written notice of payment of the tax if required by the person who has paid the tax.

#### Commissioner may grant relief from or vary deductions

**Section 203W** allows the Commissioner to grant relief from or to vary the amount of deduction required. It does not affect the ultimate liability for tax.

#### Non-resident withholding tax to be paid to Commissioner

**Section 203X** requires that withholding tax is to be accounted for by 20th of month following the month in which the deduction is made. Power is given to extend the time for accounting to meet special circumstances.

#### Annual reconciliation statements

**Section 203Y** provides for an end of year procedure.

A reconciliation statement and supporting withholding tax certificates will in general be required not later than 20th June following the year which ends on 31 March. The Department will be happy to discuss alternative procedures.

#### Non-resident withholding tax a final tax in some cases

**Section 203Z** stipulates that the withholding tax is to be a final tax on dividends and "culture" royalties.

This means that the liability of the non-resident will be finally and exclusively determined by the 15% withholding tax.

#### Non-resident withholding tax a minimum tax in some cases

**Section 203ZA** provides that the 15% withholding tax on interest, industrial royalties and "know-how" payments will also be a final tax when

*   the gross amount of interest and such royalties plus other taxable income derived by a company during the year does not exceed £500,
    
    **or**
    
*   in the case of other companies and individual taxpayers the withholding income would not attract a greater tax liability when included in an end of year assessment.

#### Credit Allowed

When the withholding tax is not final, credit will be allowed for the withholding tax against further tax payable.

#### Person getting non-resident withholding income to pay withholding tax

**Section 203ZB** states that if for any reason withholding tax is not deducted, provision is made for the non-resident to account for the tax by the 20th of month following payment.

The Commissioner may extend the due date for payment in special circumstances.

#### Failure to deduct

**Section 203ZC** deals with failure to deduct withholding tax.

When income is paid in cash without deduction of tax, the amount of this tax becomes a debt due by the payer to the Commissioner.

When a dividend not paid in cash is dealt with in favour of the non-resident recipient, the tax payable on the dividend becomes a debt due to the Commissioner by either the New Zealand company or agent who has not met his obligations.

The Commissioner is given dual powers to recover the tax either from the non-resident who receives the income or from the New Zealand resident mentioned above.

#### Issue of assessments for withholding tax

**Section 203ZD** gives authority to issue an assessment of withholding tax either to the person who receives the income or to the person who is liable to account for the tax to the Commissioner.

#### Late payment penalty

**Section 203ZE** provides for the imposition of a 10% penalty against any person who knowingly fails to deduct withholding tax or who knowingly fails to account for this tax, or who fails to do so by the due date.

This 10% penalty is chargeable on the withholding tax not deducted or accounted for and is distinct and separate from any other penalties which might be imposed.

#### Penal tax

**Section 203ZF** provides for the imposition of penal tax up to three times the amount of the withholding tax not deducted or accounted for.

This penal tax ties in with the penal provisions in Section 231 of the principal Act. No penalty will be imposed when the circumstances are beyond the control of the taxpayer.

#### Offences

**Section 203ZG** provides that offences are committed against the non-resident withholding provisions, when -

*   there is deliberate failure to deduct withholding tax;  
    **or**
*   withholding tax is knowingly applied for any purpose other than payment to the Commissioner.

#### Shares sold to associated company

**Section 203ZH** ensures that a non-resident will not be able to avoid the dividend withholding tax by interposing a new New Zealand company between himself and an existing company, both of which are controlled by him.

#### Income deemed to be received

**Section 203ZI** makes it clear that the person receiving the balance of income after deduction of withholding tax is deemed to have received the gross amount at the time the balance is paid to him.

#### Application to PAYE legislation

**Section 203ZJ** apples to non-resident withholding tax with the necessary modifications, the provisions of the PAYE legislation relating to -

*   recovery of tax;
*   unpaid tax becoming a charge on property;
*   agreements not to make deduction to be void.

#### Application of other parts of principal act

**Section 203ZK** is a machinery section which links the non-resident withholding tax provisions with the provisions for income tax levied under Section 77 of the principal Act.

#### Transitional provisions for British subsisting companies

**Section 18** is a transitional provision relating to income derived by British "subsisting" companies from New Zealand in the 1965 income year.

The New Zealand/United Kingdom double tax agreement has been terminated with effect from the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1965.

Because of the terms of the agreement dividends, royalties, and interest derived between 26 June 1964 and 31 March 1965 by such companies will not be subject to withholding tax. This income is, however, correctly taxable in New Zealand. It will be assessed after 31 March 1965 either at the equivalent of withholding tax or tax levied under Section 203ZA.

While interest is not included in the terminated agreement it has been made subject to this assessment procedure to avoid confusion.

The following general notes should help you to understand the taxing of dividends, royalties and interest derived from New Zealand by United Kingdom residents during the year ended 31 March 1965.

#### Subsisting company resident in United Kingdom

Dividends derived after 25 June 1964 became subject to assessment of the equivalent withholding tax. The assessment will be issued after 1 April 1965.

The "source in New Zealand" rule (see Section 15) for royalties and interest is widened from 1 April 1964. They will be subject to assessment after 1 April 1965 but the taxing of royalties and interest derived after 25 June 1964 will be subject to the rules for withholding tax set out in Section 203ZA.

#### PAYE companies and individuals resident in United Kingdom

The termination of the United Kingdom Double Tax Agreement becomes effective in respect of income deriving in the income year commencing on 1 April 1965. The Agreement therefore exempts dividends and royalties derived to 31 March 1965.

Interest received is not covered by the terminating agreement and is subject to tax as in past years. Individual taxpayers will be entitled to personal exemption of £468 against income derived to 31 March 1965.

The withholding provisions apply to dividends, royalties and interest derived by these taxpayers after 1 April 1965 and from that date the personal exemption is cancelled.

#### Payments made before act passed

**Section 19** Provides that the withholding tax provisions will have no legal application to payments of non-resident withholding income between 26 June 1964 and the time when this Act became law.

The Commissioner is given full powers of recovery from the recipient of the income.

In practice the agency provisions in the principal Act may be used to issue assessments and recover dividend withholding tax from the payer in New Zealand.

Any person who has withheld tax is required to account for it by the 20th of the month after this Act became law.

### Part II miscellaneous amendments to principal act

#### Superannuation funds - farm workers include sharemilkers

**Section 20** deems sharefarmers more commonly known as sharemilkers to be "employees" for the purposes of approved superannuation funds such as the superannuation scheme for farm workers. An employer is also defined as the person engaging the share milker.

The "employee" can claim a special exemption for his contributions and the employer can deduct his subsidising contributions.

#### Tax free distributions from companies

**Section 21** clarifies the original intention of Section 4(3) of the principal Act relating to tax free distributions from companies,

This amendment provides that -

*   Only a realised capital profit, or capital gain, may be distributed in cash and qualify as tax free.
*   A cash tax free distribution cannot be made from a mere writing up of assets. To qualify, the distribution may only be made as bonus shares or by giving credit for unpaid capital.
*   Goodwill is not an asset which may be written up for the purpose of a tax free distribution.

The Section also provides that a tax free distribution may be made only once from the writing up of the value of any capital asset. In any subsequent transaction which includes the same asset the cost is deemed to include the previous write up to the extent it has been previously distributed tax free. A further tax free distribution will be permitted only to the extent of a write up in excess of this national cost.

#### Donations and school fees

**Section 22** At present a special exemption of up to £50 is allowed for school fees and donations paid to special schools for afflicted and handicapped children and to registered private schools. To qualify, the school must not be run for private profit.

Section 22 extends the exemption to include tuition fees (but not donations) paid to these schools where they are run for private profit of individuals.

A further amendment includes the Volunteer Service Abroad Incorporated, in the organisations whose funds are spent overseas and which qualify as donations limited to £25 lot special exemptions.

#### Increased life insurance exemption

**Section 23** provides that the maximum special exemption allowable for life insurance and superannuation contributions is increased from £250 to £325 for any person who is not a contributor to the Government Superannuation Fund, or a member of a subsidised superannuation fund.

The exemption may not exceed the lesser of the premium paid or 20% of the taxpayers assessable income.

#### Superannuation benefits payable to certain residents of Cook Islands and Samoa

Benefits from the superannuation funds maintained by the Cook Islands and Western Samoan Public Service are paid from sources in New Zealand.

**Section 24** provides that the Benefits, paid either to the retired public servant or his dependants, will not be liable to New Zealand tax while the recipient continues to reside in those territories.

#### Allowances to members of local or statutory boards exempted from tax

The allowances paid to chairmen or members of committees or other bodies constituted by statutory authority invariably include reimbursement for expenses which relate directly to the remuneration.

**Section 25** provides that the Commissioner may fix the respective proportions of income, and the expenditure to be exempted from tax in the same manner as he fixes allowances received by other employees.

#### Spreading of income on retirement from farming

**Section 26** provides that when a farmer sells his livestock on retirement from farming and the price exceeds the standard values he has adopted he may elect to spread the excess income over the year of sale and the three succeeding years.

The manner in which to spread the excess is at the taxpayer's option. Power is given to the Commissioner to cancel this election in exceptional circumstances. For instance, if a taxpayer dies before the income spread is completed.

These provisions are an alternative to the present Section 103 which allows taxpayers to spread excess income to preceding years.

#### Forced sales of livestock

**Section 27** rewrites Section 103 A of the principal Act relating to forced sales of livestock.

#### Principal changes

The changes made to the original section are -

*   The "assessable Excess" is now defined as the difference between sale price or other disposal price and the standard value last in use.
*   The word "disaster" is replaced by the phrase "adverse event".
*   Notice in the Gazette is no longer necessary and a simpler procedure of declaration by the Minister of Finance is provided.
*   Replacement of livestock may be made either by purchase or from progeny bred by the taxpayer.

The section will apply to cases when stock is sold in the normal course of business but cannot be replaced at the normal time because of an adverse event.

#### Special depreciation

**Section 28** extends the 20% special depreciation allowance on plant and machinery and on buildings for employee accommodation by a further year to 31 March 1966.

Special depreciation is allowable as an alternative to initial depreciation on all new farm buildings, including new additions, extensions or capital alterations to existing buildings.

Residences are specifically excluded and will not qualify for special depreciation.

To qualify the buildings must be erected or altered before 1 April 1966.

#### Additional depreciation on capital improvements to export slaughter houses

Certain overseas countries have now insisted on higher standards of hygiene and inspection in meat export slaughter houses and meat packing houses.

**Section 29** provides for an allowance of accelerated depreciation at the rate of 30% on the cost of bringing buildings to the necessary standard.

This will normally be deducted by the taxpayer at the rate of 20% in the year of expenditure and 10% in the following year, but the Commissioner may vary this write off to meet special circumstances.

#### Initial depreciation

**Section 30** extends the allowance of the 20% initial depreciation in exactly the same manner as for special depreciation in Section 28.

#### Investment allowance on new manufacturing plant or machinery

**Section 31** extends the 10% investment allowance on new manufacturing plant and machinery by a further year to the 31 March 1966.

#### Investment allowance new farming and agricultural plant and machinery

**Section 32** The 10% investment allowance on new farming, plant and machinery is also extended to 31 March 1966.

Vehicles used exclusively for spreading lime and fertiliser on land now qualify, although road vehicles generally do not.

#### 20% West Coast investment allowance

Special conditions apply in the re-development area of the West Coast of the South Island.

**Section 33** extends the 20% investment allowance to secondhand plant, machinery, buildings, or extensions to buildings provided the asset is acquired or erected between 1 April 1964 and 31 March 1967.

This special West Coast allowance may be allowed once only on a particular asset.

#### Additional deduction for fertiliser and lime

**Section 34** extends the incentive allowance of 150% of the cost of fertiliser and lime by a further year to 1965 income year. March 1965.

When a farm is purchased during one of the five preceding years the average cost of fertiliser and lime applied in the number of complete years during which the land was farmed by the taxpayer is used for comparison purposes.

Alternatively when the land was acquired by the particular taxpayer in the current year or in the preceding year, the actual total cost of the fertiliser and lime applied by any person in the preceding year will be the base average.

A further amendment permits the Commissioner to make adjustments in unusual circumstances.

#### Export market development and tourist promotion expenditure

**Section 35** extends the period of incentive allowance of the export-market development and tourist promotion of 150% of cost by a further year, to the 31 March 1966.

#### Increased exports incentive

**Section 35A** makes it clear that the "assessable income" on which the calculation of the incentive deduction for increased exports is based is the assessable income from a business of businesses in which goods are sold and not necessarily the whole assessable income of the taxpayer.

#### Losses carried forward by companies

Losses may normally be carried forward for a period of six years.

In the case of companies the carry forward applied provided there was a common share-holding of at least two thirds at the end of the years of loss and subsequent profit.

**Section 36** reduces the requirement to a common shareholding of at least 40%.

#### Excessive remuneration paid by proprietary company

**Section 37** gives legislative effect to an administrative practice. It removes the irritations arising from restrictions placed for taxation purposes on remuneration to shareholders or directors of private companies.

The section will not apply when the remuneration is paid to an adult who is employed substantially full time and participates in management, and his remuneration is not influenced by the fact of his being a relative of a shareholder or director.

#### Interest on convertible notes

**Section 37A** provides an alternative to the existing provisions that a company which is listed on the stock exchange may deduct interest paid on convertible notes.

The deduction will be permitted in future to any company which, although not officially listed on the stock exchange, has 250 or more shareholders holding ordinary shares.

#### Repeal of section 144

**Section 38** repeals an obsolete section which has never been used.

#### Bonus issues from pre-1958 profits

**Section 39** removes the requirement that bonus shares arising from pre-1958 profits and issued tax free must be separately classified in the company accounts.

**Section 40** is related to the previous section and removes the provision that such bonus issues would attract tax if the capital they represent is distributed within ten years of the bonus issue.

#### Assessment of shareholders in co-op dairy or co-op milk marketing companies

**Section 41.** When any excess over paid up capital is received by a shareholder in a co-operative dairy company or a co-operative milk marketing company, on realisation of his shares and is treated as income it will be treated as ordinary assessable income and not as a dividend.

#### Companies mining for specified minerals

**Section 42** includes the minerals "Asbestos", "Halloysite" and "Kaolin" in section 152 of the principal Act.

The special code for assessment under that section is to be applied to companies mining for these minerals.

#### Exemption of certain mining companies from excess retention tax

**Section 43** clarifies the practice that excess retention tax cannot apply to certain mining companies.

#### Exemption from excess retention tax

At present exemption from excess retention tax may be granted to a private company which satisfies the Commissioner that retention of more than 60% of tax paid profit was necessary to purchase productive assets.

This was found to be too restrictive.

**Section 44** provides for exemption when retention beyond 60% is shown to be necessary for the purchase of any fixed asset.

This section applies to excess retention tax currently being assessed on income derived during the year ending 31 March 1963.

#### Relief from excess retention tax

**Section 45** deals with excess retention tax and details many of the factors which have given rise to anomalies.

They are removed by giving the Commissioner power to release the company from or defer liability arising from such factors.

This application is the same as the previous section.

#### Assessments with small balances

Many assessments for very small amounts of tax, either debit or credit, arise every year.

**Section 46** gives power for assessments not to be issued where tax is underpaid by £1 or less or overpaid by 5 s. or less.

#### Amendments to Income Tax Assessment Act 1957 application section

**Section 47** is the application section for Part III and relates to provisional tax on income for the year commencing on 1 April 1964 and subsequent years.

#### Definition of pay period ptaxpayer

**Section 48** makes pay period taxpayers those who derive income principally from salary and wages, not exceeding £1,300 instead of £1,040 as previously.

Their tax is paid by deduction at source and they are not required to furnish returns of income, except to obtain refunds of tax overpaid or when because of wrong tax codes the Commissioner is required to collect under-deductions of tax.

Taxpayers retain their present right to apply for an adjustment of tax if so desired.

#### Non-resident withholding income not provisional income

**Section 49** ensures that non-resident withholding income, will not be liable to provisional tax.

#### Payment of provisional tax

**Section 50** provides that provisional tax which previously was payable by instalments of 1/2 of the tax by 7 September and 1/2 by 7 March, will become payable by instalments of 1/3 and 2/3 on the same dates.

In addition a taxpayer who -

*   gets more than half of his assessable income from primary production,  
    **and**
*   has a balance date later than 31 March,  
    **and**
*   can show that at least half of his gross cash income is regularly received after 7 February,

may elect to postpone payment of one half of the second instalment (1/3 of the tax) to 7 May.

#### Interim returns

**Section 51** is a consequential amendment arising from the previous section and fixes similar provisional tax payments for taxpayers who have furnished interim returns.

#### Estimation of provisional tax

**Section 52** allows taxpayers to estimate or re-estimate provisional income up to the last date for payment of any instalment of provisional tax.

#### Under estimation penalties

Provision for a penalty for under estimation of provisional income, was related to tax payable and was found unnecessarily complicated.

**Section 53** now links the penalty to income, not tax, and gives a much wider tolerance for estimation without penalty.

Before a penalty can arise the estimate must be -

*   Less than the income of the preceding year,  
    **and**
*   Less than 80% of the actual income for the year.

The penalty will be calculated at 10% of the difference between -

*   Tax on 80% of the actual income for the year,  
    **and**
*   Tax on the estimated income.

Adjustments will be made for source deduction income received in each case.

The penalty will not be imposed when the estimate or re-estimate was genuinely made and circumstances change later.

### 1965 Budget Proposals

The Minister of Finance Hon HR Lake announced several tax proposals in his 1965 Budget statement. They will require validating legislation to have the force of law.

Here are brief details of the Budget proposals:

### Income Tax

### Incentives Extended

The following incentive deductions will continue for another year to 31 March 1967. This will bring them into line with the 20% West Coast, South Island, investment allowance and the incentive deduction for increased export sales:

*   The 150% deduction for export market and tourist promotion expenditure.
*   The 10% investment allowances on manufacturing and agricultural plant and machinery.
*   Special depreciation of 20% on plant, machinery and accommodation for employees.
*   Initial depreciation of 20% on accommodation for employees and farm buildings.
*   The deduction in full of "Class B" farm development expenditure previously limited to £400.

The incentive deduction for the increased use of fertiliser and lime ended on 31 March 1965 or equivalent balance date. This is being replaced by a subsidy on the transport of fertiliser. In appropriate cases the increased fertiliser and lime incentive deduction will be allowed in the 1966 income year. The circumstances were stated on page 11 of Public Information Bulletin No. 21.

### Farm Income Equalisation Scheme

Legislation will be introduced to confirm the scheme which began shortly before 31 March 1965. Details of this scheme were given in Public Information Bulletin No. 21.

### Farm Development Incentives

#### Incentive Allowances for Other Industries

##### Fishing

The 10% investment allowance can be claimed on plant and machinery used in catching fish for sale, and purchased after 1.4.1964. This will include cost of fishing vessels, structural alterations to fishing vessels and also conversion costs of a vessel for fishing. The cost of second hand fishing vessels will qualify in certain circumstances. Refrigerated trucks used to carry fish will also qualify.

##### Forestry

Forestry companies will be able to claim the cost of development against current assessable income from any source.

##### Mining

The special provisions for assessing companies which mine certain specified minerals will be extended to include those companies mining all minerals which are shown to be important to the development of New Zealand.

Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct from their assessable income 1/3 of calls paid on shares in any such mining company.

### Donation to Universities for Research Purposes

Companies making such donations will be allowed a deduction of the smaller of 5% of assessable income or £500.

### Housekeeper Exemption

This special exemption will be allowed when

*   married persons employ a housekeeper because of the incapacity of either spouse;
*   separated or deserted spouses employ a housekeeper to care for children so the spouse can earn a living;
*   when an incapacitated single person, widow or widower employs a housekeeper to tend the house and care for the person.

### Bonus Shares

Companies making an assessable bonus issue after 10 June 1965 will pay 3/6 in the £1 on it. The shareholder will have no further tax to pay on the shares. Some safeguards will be introduced.

### Streamlining Procedures

From 1.4.1966 salary and wage earners with provisional income of under £50 from interest rent or dividends will not be asked to pay provisional tax. Tax will be assessed in an end of year assessment.

### Ordinary Income Tax Rebates

The 10% rebate, maximum £100 will apply for the year ending 31 March 1966.

### Amusement Tax

This will be abolished and the Amusement Tax Act 1960 repealed.

### Duties Paid By Racing Clubs

#### Totalisator Tax

The rebate will be increased from 2 1/2% of the first £20,000 of gross investment on the totalisator to 2 1/2% on the first £50,000.

#### Stake Duty

This will be abolished from 1 August 1965.

### Estate Duty

The increased exemptions announced in the budget will apply to the estates of all persons who die on or after 10 June 1965.

The value of the succession of a widow for which on exemption is given will be increased from £12,000 to £15,000 and that of a widower from £5,000 to £7,000.>The effect of the increased exemptions is shown in the following charts.

### Whole Estate To Widow

| Value of estate | Duty before budget | Duty after budget | Saving |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £   | £   | £   | £   |
| 15000 | 286 | Nil | 286 |

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1965
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1965 from PIB vol 26 Sep 1965.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 26, September 1965.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1965

**SECTION 1** - Short title

Application of Act

**SECTION 2** - Except when otherwise provided, this Act applies to tax on income for the year that commenced on 1 April 1965.

### PART I (Taxation of bonus issues from income sources)

Part 1 of the Act consists of sections 3 to 9 inclusive

### Main features

Bonus issues from income sources will not be a dividend and will not be taxable in the shareholders hands.

Such bonus issues will be subject to a bonus issue tax at the rate of 3s 6d in £1. This tax is paid by the company making the issue.

**SECTION 3** - Inserts a new Part VI B into the principal Act sections 172 0 to 172 U inclusive.

**_Section 172O_** - Applies the bonus tax to all resident companies except petroleum mining companies. The latter companies are subject to a special method of assessment which has its own treatment of bonus issues.

**_Section 172P_** - Imposes bonus issue tax for the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1965 and for later years.

_**Section 172Q**_ - Imposes the tax liability on the company making the bonus issue.

_**Section 172R**_ - Provides that the tax will be payable for the year of assessment following the year in which the bonus issue is made. This rule applies whether the company is a PAYE or subsisting company.

_**Section 172S**_ - The due date for tax is set at 7 February in the year for which the tax is payable.

_**Section 172T**_ \- Gives the Commissioner power to charge further bonus issue tax if a company distributes the capital of the bonus issue within three years from the time of the original capitalisation.

_**Section 172U**_ - Generally applies other parts of the principal Act to bonus issue tax, that is, the making of assessments, objections, refunds, and so on.

**SECTION 4** - "Bonus issue", is defined as a capitalisation from income sources made on or after 11 June 1965 by the issue of shares or by crediting unpaid capital on shares.

The following bonus issues are to remain exempt from dividend and bonus issues tax when they:

*   Restore lost capital.
*   Are from capital sources.
*   Are from writing up assets, except goodwill.
*   Are from share premium reserves.

**SECTION 5** - Amends the term "dividend" as a result of the bonus issue tax provisions.

**SECTION 6** - Repeals section 144B of the Tax Act. The section expired on 31 March 1965.

**SECTION 7** \- Ensures that for excess retention tax purposes a privately controlled company will not be at any disadvantage because of the introduction of the bonus issue tax.

A bonus issue made will be regarded as a distribution made by the company for excess retention tax purposes. A bonus issue received will not have to be distributed to avoid the payment of excess retention tax.

**SECTION 8** - Adds to the first schedule to the principal Act the basic rate of bonus issue tax of 3/6 for each £1 of issue.

**SECTION 9** - Preserves for non-resident companies the exemption from tax previously allowed for certain capitalisations from pre-1965 profits. However should any subsequent assessment be necessary it will be made under the new bonus issue tax provisions.

### PART II (Amendments to the principal Act)

Part II of the Act consists of sections 10 to 32 inclusive.

**SECTION 10** - Removes the need to get the approval of the Minister of Finance to a tax free dividend distribution from a share premium reserve.

**SECTION 11** - Is linked with **section 36.** Returns of income for the 1966 income year are to be filed by 7 June 1966 by salary and wage-earners who also derive not more than £50 of investment income. These taxpayers will not be required to pay provisional tax on their investment income.

**SECTION 12** - Abolishes a special committee which considered objections to arbitrary assessments of income tax. In future such objections will be heard by the Board of Review or the Supreme Court.

**SECTION 13** - Widens the circumstances in which a taxpayer may claim a special exemption for a housekeeper. The exemption is allowed when:

*   A widowed, divorced or unmarried taxpayer employs a housekeeper to have the care and control of children.
*   Married persons employ a housekeeper because of the infirmity or disability of either spouse.
*   Separated or deserted spouses employ a housekeeper to care for children so the spouse can earn a living.
*   When an incapacitated single person, widow or widower employs a housekeeper to tend the house and care for the person.

The maximum exemption remains at £156.

**SECTION 14** - Continues to exempt racing stakes from income tax. Previously this exemption was included in the Stamp Duties Act.

**SECTION 15** - Provides tax incentives for the Forestry Industry. At present the cost of planting and developing forests is capitalised under the cost of bush method. This cost is deductible from income when the forests are cut.

The section allows a company to deduct the planting and development costs against any assessable income in the year incurred. The old and new provisions are alternative and a company may choose to combine both methods. Expenditure may, of course, be deducted only once and not under both methods. **Section 15** is also alternative to the provisions of the Farm Forestry Act 1962.

**SECTIONS 16, 17, 20, 22**, and **25** — Extend the incentive deductions for special depreciation, initial depreciation, investment allowances, farm development expenditure and export market development expenditure for a further year, to 31 March 1967.

**SECTION 18** - Provides incentives for the fishing industry. The 10% investment allowance is applied, from 1 April 1964, to plant and machinery used in freezing, curing or processing fish, including shellfish and crustaceans. The allowance is also extended to refrigerated vehicles designed and used exclusively for the transport and delivery of fish.

**SECTION 19** - Provides incentives for the mining and forestry industries. The 10% investment allowance is extended from 1 August 1963 to include plant and machinery used in forests, in mining, or in quarrying. The extension also includes plant used to process the material mined or quarried for later use or sale.

Plant and machinery used by mining companies assessed under **sections 152 or 153** of the Tax Act are excluded from the allowance, because these companies are subject to a special method of assessment.

**SECTION 21** - Sets out further incentives for the fishing industry.

The 10% investment allowance will apply from 1 April 1964 to plant and machinery acquired for exclusive use in a fishing business carried on in New Zealand. This will include fishing beyond New Zealand territorial waters provided the fish are landed in New Zealand.

New and secondhand fishing vessels and gear are included, and also the cost of structural alterations to fishing vessels. Items of equipment which are essentially consumable are excluded from the allowance. The allowance will apply once only to a secondhand vessel.

**SECTION 22** - Extends the incentive deduction for farm development expenditure to 31 March 1967.

The section also:

*   Includes as farm development expenditure the cost of power and telephone lines incurred after 1 April 1965, and
*   Extends the period for spreading forward farm development expenditure from four to five years.

**SECTION 23** - At present a taxpayer may only claim special and initial depreciation on farming assets and farm development expenditure if he is personally engaged in the farming business.

The section allows a deduction of depreciation or development expenditure when the owner of freehold land or of a leasehold interest in land, leases the land but still incurs qualifying expenditure. A condition of the section is that the land continue to be used by the lessee in a farming business. If the lessee does not, the owner will not qualify for the incentive deductions.

**SECTION 24** - Allows a company to deduct from assessable income donations of money made to a university for research which is important to the general economy of New Zealand.

The deduction in any year will be limited to the smaller of £500 or 5% of the company's assessable income.

Gifts made on or after 11 June 1965 will qualify.

**SECTION 26** - Offers an incentive to the mining industry to stimulate capital investment.

From 1 April 1965 a taxpayer who makes a payment towards any amount unpaid on his shares in certain mining companies will be allowed to deduct 1/3 of the amount from his assessable income.

The mining companies concerned are those whose sole or principal source of business is mining in New Zealand for any of the minerals listed in **section 30** of this Act or for petroleum. The company must also be assessable under either **section 152 or section 153** of the Tax Act.

**SECTION 27** - Extends the incentives allowed to forestry companies.

The section will allow a forestry company to deposit income from thinning the forest in a reserve account without payment of tax in the year the income is earned. The deposit will be assessable income in the year of withdrawal. The withdrawal can be tax free if spent on deductible expenditure.

For convenience, the appropriate parts of the income equalisation scheme will be used to implement deposits and withdrawals under this scheme.

**SECTION 28** - Deposits under the snow loss reserve scheme will not be accepted after 17 September 1965. Refunds of existing deposits may still be applied for under the original conditions of the scheme.

**SECTION 29** - Introduces the farm income equalisation scheme as **sections 136B to 136K** of the principal Act. Details have been announced in the Public Information Bulletin No. 21 and deposits have been accepted for the year ended 31 March 1965.

**Section 136B** - Sets out the definitions. The important definitions are:

##### Maximum Deposit

Is 25% of the assessable income of a farming or agricultural business before taking into account any income spreading under special tax legislation, including the equalisation provisions.

There is power to increase this percentage in particular years by Order In Council.

##### Specified Period

Applies to both deposits and refunds. It is the shorter of a period ending six months after balance date, or from balance date to a date one month after a taxpayer is required to file his tax return.

In practice the longest period after balance date will be six months and the shortest, three months.

**Section 136C**\- Sets out the conditions for making deposits:

*   Deposits may be made by a taxpayer who carries on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand.
*   Deposits are, in general, made for the income year in which the deposit occurs.
*   Deposits made during the "specified period" for any year may, by written election, be related to the year before the year of deposit.
*   Deposits will not be accepted by the Commissioner for any year for which a withdrawal has been made.
*   Deposits are to be made to the tax office for lodgment at the Reserve Bank. No interest is paid on the deposit.
*   Deposits are to be in minimum amounts of £100 or an amount which will bring total deposits for the year to 25% of assessable income.
*   Deposits or the excess of a deposit which exceed the 25% limit will be automatically refunded.
*   Deposits are protected against assignment or charge except in the case of bankruptcy or a company winding up.

**Section 136D** - Gives authority for a taxpayer to deduct his deposits, up to a 25% maximum, against his assessable income in the year for which the deposit has been made.

**Section 136E** - Deals with refunds of deposits made:

*   Refunds may be made on written application.
*   Refund of any deposit is generally not allowed until 12 months after the date of that deposit.
*   Refunds may be authorised by the Commissioner at an earlier date in special circumstances.
*   Refunds become income in the year of application except when the specified period applies and election is made to have the income assessed in the preceding year.

**Section 136F** - Sets out special provisions for refunds of deposits when a taxpayer retires from farming or an agricultural business:

*   The tax office will refund any deposits automatically.
*   The refund will be assessable income in the year of retirement.
*   As an alternative the taxpayer may elect to have all or part of the refund treated as income in an earlier year, or years, to the extent that the deposit was made in the earlier year.
*   This election may be made at any time within the period allowed for furnishing the return of income for the year of retirement.

**Section 136G** - Provides for refunds of deposits on the taxpayer's death:

*   In general the provisions are the same as those on the retirement of the taxpayer.
*   The trustees have a further right of election to spread the deposit or part of it forward into any of the three years after death, but limited to the balance of the original 5 year period of maximum deposit.
*   Under this further election the amount spread forward will remain deposited under the scheme.

**Section 136H** - Provides that if a taxpayer becomes bankrupt the tax office will refund any deposits to the Official Assignee. These refunds will be income prior to the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.

**Section 136I** - Provides that on the winding up of a company the tax office will refund deposits as soon as notice of winding up is received. Refunds will be income prior to the commencement of the winding up.

**Section 136J** - The maximum period of deposit, is five years after the deposit is made. The tax office will then automatically refund any remaining deposits.

This refund will be income in the year the refund is made. The general rule that a taxpayer may not make a subsequent deposit for a year for which a refund is made, does not apply in these circumstances. The taxpayer may re-deposit the refund or make other deposits for the same year.

**Section 136K** - This section states that refunds are made in the same order as the original deposit. It also provides that refunds are to be in minimum amounts of £100.

**SECTION 30** - This section rewrites **section 152** of the principal Act which provides a special method of assessment for companies whose business is the mining for any of the minerals listed in the section. Amendments in the rewritten section are:

*   Additions to the list of qualifying minerals.
*   Provision for further minerals, shown to be important to the economy of New Zealand, to be added by notice in the Gazette.
*   Capital paid up in moneys worth, such as property, will qualify for the special purposes of the section. Previously, only capital paid up in cash qualified.

**SECTION 31** - Is a further extension of the forestry incentives and is closely allied to **section 15** of this act. There will be special circumstances which prevent a company from carrying on a forestry business in its own name and make it necessary to do so through a subsidiary company which it controls. This section allows the parent company to deduct development expenditure incurred by the subsidiary to the extent that it is reimbursed by the parent company.

This provision will give the parent company the same incentive allowance as if it had been able to develop the forest in its own name.

**SECTION 32** - Is a routine amendment following an alteration to the classification of pay period taxpayer made last year. Qualifying income is increased from £1,040 to £1,300.

### PART III (Amendments to Income Tax Assessment Act 1957)

Part III of the Act consists of **sections 33 to 36** inclusive.

**SECTION 33** - Extends the circumstances when a housekeeper may be claimed as a dependant for tax code purposes. This extension follows **section 13** of this Act.

**SECTION 34** - Extends dependency of a relative for tax code purposes from 1 April 1966. From that time a relative may be claimed as a dependant provided the income of the relative does not exceed £300 and the other necessary qualifications apply.

**SECTION 35** - Corrects an anomaly in PAYE procedures which occurs when an employee whose income exceeds £1,300 has an extra pay period in an income year.

A rebate is to be allowed in the annual assessments for the tax worth of the special exemptions allowed in working out the tax deduction for the extra pay period.

**SECTION 36** - From the year commencing l April 1966 any employed taxpayer who also derives assessable investment income up to £50 will not be required to pay provisional tax on his investment income. The tax will be payable in an end of year assessment made after the tax return has been filed.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1966 (budget proposals)
=========================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1966 (budget proposals) from PIB vol 23 Jun 1965.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 23, June 1965.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1966 (budget proposals)

The Minister of Finance, Hon. HR Lake, included some tax proposals in his 1966 Budget. They will not have the force of law until validating legislation is passed.

Here are brief details.

#### Incentives Extended

The following incentives which would otherwise expire at 31 March 1967 are to be extended to 31 March 1968.

*   The 150 per cent deduction for export market and tourist promotion expenditure.
*   The special and initial depreciation allowances of 20 per cent.
*   The deduction of "class B" farm development expenditure beyond the usual £400 limit.

#### Incentives Suspended

The 10 per cent investment allowances on plant and machinery have been held to be partly responsible for the present upsurge in imports. The Minister announced the suspension of the allowance but said that the Government will re-examine the position next year in the light of the balance of payments situation at that time.

There are two exceptions -

*   The allowance will apply where a firm contract to purchase plant and machinery was entered into before 17 June 1966.
*   The West Coast allowance which is to continue but at the reduced rate of 10 per cent.

#### Livestock Incentive

The Government and the Agricultural Production Council have collaborated on a scheme intended to provide a direct tax incentive related to increases in livestock. The scheme is expected to materially assist in meeting the long range targets set by the Agricultural Development Conference.

Briefly the main provisions of the scheme are

*   Entry is optional.
*   On entry a livestock base will be established. This will be the greater of the livestock numbers carried at the end of either of the two preceding accounting years.
*   Subsequent increases over this base will be shown at a NIL standard value for tax purposes. Taxable income will be deferred to the extent of the difference between the NIL and the usual standard values of the increased livestock.
*   When the farmer sells or otherwise disposes of the whole of his livestock, for instance on retirement or death, the full market value will become taxable income, subject to the usual spreading provisions.
*   The scheme will first apply to livestock increases in the 1967 accounting year.

#### Export Incentive

Amendments are to be made to the scheme which allows a deduction for the value of increased export sales. These are designed to eliminate certain existing anomalies.

*   A uniform 15 per cent deduction from income will be allowed to exporters for all qualifying increases in export sales.
*   The base for calculating export sales is to be the first three of the five years immediately preceding the income year.

The changes are to apply to 1966/67 exports.

#### New Zealand/United Kingdom Double Tax Agreement

The Minister announced that the new Agreement was signed on 13 June. It will have legal effect in the near future when Orders In Council are promulgated in both countries. The application of the Agreement will in general be from 1 April 1965.

#### Other tax adjustments

*   The 10 per cent rebate is to be continued for a further year.
*   A widening of the law relating to deductible expenditure is proposed for the current year which will permit a deduction for subscriptions, fees and levies directly related to a taxpayer's employment, but limited to £10 per annum.
*   Some changes to the special exemption for life insurance premiums paid are also proposed.
    *   The limitation of payments to 20 per cent of assessable income is to be removed.
    *   The range of qualifying policies is to be widened. The extension will include eligible policies on the lives of a taxpayer's wife and children.
    *   The overall limits of either £250 or £325 per year remain unchanged.
*   Separated and divorced persons are to be brought in line with widows and widowers for the special allowance of £78 where there are dependent children and tax payment in full would cause hardship.
*   Companies may at present deduct donations made to Universities for research within certain limits. The range of qualifying donations is to be widened to include those made to bodies approved by the National Research Advisory Council. This change applies immediately and only requires approval of a body by the council.
*   a further basis for valuing trading stock is to be written into the law to cover cases where special factors such as obsolescence have reduced values below cost.
*   It is hoped that legislation will be introduced this year to liberalise and simplify the existing provisions for charging excess retention tax.

#### Taxation Review

Mr Lake also announced that a committee of independent experts is to be set up to review the whole field of central Government taxation, both direct and indirect. The committee will be assisted by a full time secretariat drawn from Inland Revenue and Customs Departments and the Treasury.

The review is to commence as soon as possible and the Minister will announce further details later.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1966
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1966 from PIB vol 23 Jun 1965.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 23, June 1965.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Application of Act

**SECTION 2.** Except when otherwise stated, this Act applies to tax on income for the year that started on 1 April 1966.

### PART 1

#### Amendments to the main tax act

#### Housekeeper Exemption

**SECTION 3.** Allows a special exemption for a housekeeper employed for part of a month. In future the exemption will be allowed in part for each month or part month of employment.

The annual exemption of £156, or total paid in wages and allowances if lower, is unchanged.

#### Life Insurance Exemption

**SECTION 4.** Restates the type of life insurance policies on which the premiums paid are allowable as a special exemption for tax purposes.

Premiums on policies will now qualify if the policy is on the life of the taxpayer's spouse, his dependent children or foster children, or on the joint lives of husband and wife.

At the same time the SECTION makes it clear that a policy issued after 26 August 1966 will need to be for a period of time, defined in the SECTION, to qualify. Other conditions are-

1.  That a substantial part of the total benefits is to be payable in the event of death at any time during the term of the policy.

*   AND

2.  That benefits other than for death are not to be paid in the early stages of the policy.

Those conditions are set out in detail in the SECTION. Special provisions allow premiums on children's deferred policies and on sub-standard lives.

The exemption limit of 20 percent of a taxpayer's assessable income has been removed.

#### No tax on servicemen's deferred pay

**SECTION 5.** Provides that deferred pay of the three services earned in an active service area for service on or after 15 July 1965, is to be exempt from income tax.

#### Life insurance companies

**SECTION 6.** Makes it clear that the exemption from social security income tax at present allowed to companies actively engaged in life insurance business in New Zealand is limited to the income actually derived from that business.

#### Increases in livestock

**SECTION 7.** Provides that certain increases in livestock be excluded from taxable income. The important features of the scheme are-

1.  It is optional and commences for any year after 1 April 1966.
2.  Itapplies to sheep, cattle and pigs in a farming business.
3.  Livestock dealers are excluded.
4.  The basic herd or flock is the greater of the numbers of each class on hand at either of the two years preceding the year of election.
5.  The whole or any part of subsequent increases over this base may be given a nil value for tax purposes.
6.  To provide for changes in the type of livestock carried from year to year equivalents based on 6 sheep or 4 pigs to 1 head of cattle are provided.

If the livestock are disposed of at death or by gifting, they are to brought in at normal standard values or, if desired, at market values. If the livestock are sold, relief is given by spreading excess income over the year of sale and, depending on circumstances the 3 preceding or 3 succeeding years.

#### Valuation of trading stock

**SECTION 8.** Allows an extra option in the valuation of trading stock, other than livestock. With the Commissioner's approval a taxpayer can use a special basis to value stock because of factors such as obsolescence.

#### Interest in trading stock

**SECTION 9.** Provides that the sale or disposition of an interest in trading stock is a sale of trading stock for tax purposes.

#### Consequential amendments

**SECTIONs 10, 11** and **12.** These are consequential amendments arising from SECTIONs 7 and 9.

#### Livestock disposals due to adverse event

**SECTION 13.** Extends the relief provisions which apply when livestock, disposed of because of adverse events affecting a farm, cannot be replaced because of a later similar event. The present two year period for spreading income forward is extended to three years.

A farmer may now qualify for relief when the adverse event is sickness or disease among his livestock, even though the disease has not had general effect over an area.

#### Advertising on "Pirate" radio or TV

**SECTION 14.** States that the cost of advertising over a so called "pirate" radio or TV station will not be deductible for tax purposes. The provisions cover transmission from any vessel whether inside or outside New Zealand territorial waters.

#### Incentive deductions

**SECTIONs 15, 16** and **24.** Extend the incentive deductions for special depreciation, initial depreciation and export market development expenditure to 31 March 1968.

#### Investment allowances

**SECTIONs 17, 18** and **19.** Suspend the investment allowances because of the need to restrict imports of plant and machinery.

Plant and machinery including such assets for the fishing industry, will still qualify for an allowance if bought or installed before 17 June 1966, or if a binding contract to buy the assets was entered into before that date in which case it must be completed in reasonable time.

Special features of the West Coast allowance are that in the absence of a contract before 17 June 1966 the allowance for plant and machinery is to continue at 10 percent until 31 March 1968. The 20 percent rate on buildings is to continue to that date.

#### Expenditure on fertiliser and lime

Previously a farmer who wanted to spread expenditure on fertiliser and lime over the 4 years following the year of expenditure, had to make a written election stating in advance how the expenditure was to be spread.

**SECTION 20** now gives him the right to elect in each of the years concerned how much of the total expenditure is to be deducted in that year.

#### Farm development expenditure

**SECTION 21.** Amends the law which allows claims for farm development expenditure. The changes are -

1.  The unlimited deduction of certain classes of expenditure previously restricted to £400 a year is extended for a further year to 31 March 1968.
2.  Expenditure after 1 April 1966 on building feeding platforms, plunge sheep dips and self-feeding ensilage pits will be allowed as a farm expense.
3.  Expenditure may be spread over the year of expenditure and the 5 succeeding years. Now the taxpayer is to decide when he puts in his annual tax return for each year what part of the expenditure he will take away from that year's income.

#### Donations for research

**SECTION 22**. Widens the law which allows companies to deduct, within certain limits, a donation to a University for research.

Donations within those limits made after 16 June 1966 to -

1.  The medical Research Council,

*   OR

2.  A research institution recommended by either the Medical Research Council or the National Research Advisory Council,

will qualify for the deduction.

#### Pensions to former employees

**SECTION 23.** Allows employers to deduct voluntary pension payments made to former employees. There are certain conditions detailed in the SECTION which merely state a long standing administrative practice and so give employers a legal right to the deduction in the appropriate circumstances.

#### Increased export sales

**SECTION 25.** Alters the way in which the incentive deduction for increased export sales is worked out. The calculation of base sales is now to be the average of the first 3 of the 5 years preceding the income year instead of the 4 preceding years.

The incentive deduction will now be 15 percent of increased sales instead of as worked out at present on a formula based on profit ratios.

Special provisions for the 1967 income year make sure that every qualifying exporter will get a deduction which is at least equal to the amount worked out on the previous formula.

#### Subscriptions and union fees

**SECTION 26.** Allows salary and wage earners a deduction for subscriptions, fees and levies incurred in connection with their employment. Payments to trade unions and professional bodies qualify and include trade and professional journals.

The annual limit is £10 for each taxpayer.

#### Farm income equalisation

**SECTION 27, 28** and **29.** Make changes to the Farm Income Equalisation scheme. These are -

1.  A later deposit will be allowed for a year when there has been an earlier refund from the scheme, provided the refund is spent in developing or expanding the farming business.
2.  The Commissioner may extend the time during which a farmer may elect to have a withdrawal from the fund assessed in the preceding year.
3.  The tax payable on withdrawal of a deposit may not now exceed the tax which would have been paid had the deposit not been made.

#### Taxing insurance Cicompanies

**SECTIONs 30, 31, 32, 33** and **35**. Change the special code for taxing insurance companies. The main change is that dividends received by life companies which previously were deducted from reversionary bonuses before tax was charged are no longer deductible. This change will be phased in over 3 years, starting with the year ending 31 March 1967.

#### Income of non resident shipowners

**SECTION 34**. Provides that the income of non resident shipowners deemed to arise in New Zealand from shipping freight and passage money shall be 5 percent of the gross outward freight and fares. Further New Zealand may reciprocate in the case of nationals of another country which exempts New Zealand nationals from tax in similar circumstances.

#### SECTIONs Repealed

**SECTIONs 36** and **39**. Repeal SECTIONs 171, 188 and 189 of the Tax Act.

#### Excess Retention Tax

**SECTIONs 37** and 38. Simplify and liberalise the excess retention tax provisions.

Excess retention tax applies only to privately controlled companies. Such companies are now included in the definition of "proprietary company".

Relief may be granted at present when tax paid profits are kept to buy fixed assets. In future relief may be granted when such profits are also kept to buy current assets such as trading stock, book debts and consumable aids.

#### Non Resident Traders

**SECTION 40**. Rewrites SECTION 201 of the Tax Act to combine the present SECTIONs 171 and 201.

When reciprocal exemption from New Zealand tax is granted to a non resident principal or class of principals, an Order-in-Council will no longer be necessary. The SECTION now falls in line with the law in most overseas countries by providing reciprocal exemption from tax.

#### Automatic Refunds

**SECTION 41**. Makes it clear it will no longer be necessary for a taxpayer to write in for a refund of overpaid tax. A refund will now be made automatically when a tax return is sent in. The 6 year statutory limit is still to apply.

#### Relief For Serious Hardship

**SECTION 42**. Extends the relief provision which allows a special exemption of £78 to widows or widowers with dependent children to include divorced and separated persons with dependent children.

#### PART 2

### Amendments to the Assessment Act

#### Dependants For Tax Code Purposes/

**SECTION 43**. Extends dependency of a relative for a tax code. purposes from 1 April 1967. From then on a relative may be claimed as a dependant, provided the relative's income does not exceed £325 a year.

#### Automatic refunds of PAYE

**SECTIONs 44, 45** and **46**. Make similar amendments to those in SECTION 41 but these sections relate to over-payments of PAYE deductions and provisional tax.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1968
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1968 from PIB vol 47 Nov 1968.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 47, November 1968

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1968

This Act sets out some of the amendments arising from the Budget proposals.

#### Amendments to the Main Tax Act

#### Application Of Act

**Section 2.** Except when otherwise stated this Act applies to tax on income for the income year that began on 1 April 1968.

#### Definitions

1.  #### New Definition of Relative
    
    **Section 3** brings in a new definition of "relative" which will apply whenever it is used in the principal Act, except when a particular section has its own definition of the term. Broadly, "relative" will mean any person connected by blood to the fourth degree of relationship, marriage, or adoption, and includes a trustee for a relative.
2.  #### Dividends - Some Non-Deductible Expenditure Now Included
    
    **Section 4** provides that non-deductible expenditure (other than donations) which is incurred by a proprietary company and benefits a shareholder, his wife or a trust in which either are beneficiaries, will be treated as a dividend in the hands of the shareholder.  
      
    In broad terms, a proprietary company is one controlled by not more than four persons.

#### Time Limit For Amending Assessments Removed

**Section 5** removes the ten year limit on -

1.  the altering of assessments made on or after 1 April 1958, when it is found the tax returns are fraudulent of wilfully misleading.
2.  the assessment or reassessment of penal tax relating to deficient tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after 1 April 1958.

The difference in the application provisions means, for instance, that although an income tax assessment for the 1956 year can be increased now, provided the original assessment was made on or after 1 April 1958, a penal tax assessment lot that year could not be made or altered.

#### Wider Objection Rights For Taxpayers

**Section 6** gives taxpayers the right to object to assessments which involve the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under sections 181,187 and 194 of the Tax Act. These sections all relate to assessments in special cases of agent and principal.

#### Bigger Land Tax Exemption

**Section 7** increases the ordinary land tax exemption to $60,000. This reduces $1 for every $1 when the unimproved value exceeds $60,000 so as to cut out when the unimproved value is $120,000 or more. The increased exemption first applies to land held at noon on 31 March 1968.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Unimproved value of land | $80,000 |
| _Less_ exemption ($60,000-$20,000) | $40,000 |
| Taxable amount | $40,000 |

The existing mortgage exemption has been repealed as the new ordinary exemption will always exceed it.

#### Charitable Donations

**Section 8** merely corrects a reference in section 84B(4)(a) of the main Act.

#### New Rules For Taxing Retiring Allowances

Taxing of retiring allowances is dealt with in two new sections -

**Section 9** deals with how the employee is taxed, and

**Section 22** with what the employer can deduct.

**How employee is taxed**

**Section 9** brings in new rules for assessing retiring allowances paid after 19 July 1968.

Generally only 5 percent of a lump sum bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance paid in respect of an employee's full-time "employment or service" (see below) when he retires will be assessed, provided that -

1.  the payment does not exceed the "specified sum" (defined below). If it does the excess is fully assessable.
2.  the employee has reached the "appropriate retiring age" (also defined below).

#### Employment or Service

This is a widely drawn definition and means, for instance, that -

1.  Full time service in associated companies can be taken into account - for example, executives transferred from one company in a group to another.
2.  Continuing service to an employer, perhaps in several different businesses, is recognised.
3.  An employee who stays with a business which changes hands is not prejudiced.

#### Specified Sum Defined

The specified sum depends on the employee's length of service.

| Period of Service | Specified Sum |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 years or more | 1/3rd of total remuneration for last 3 years of service |     |
| Less than 10 years | Complete years | x 1/3rd of total remuneration for last 3 years of service |
| 10  |     |

#### Appropriate Retiring Age Defined

This will generally be-

1.  For males - not less than 60 years.
2.  For females - not less than 55 years.

Provision has been made for earlier retirement because of-

1.  the arduous nature of the employment
2.  the general terms of employment (for example retirement alter 40 years' service)
3.  disability or serious illness
4.  redundancy.

On past experience, most retiring allowances paid should fall within the specified sum, but here are some examples where the payment is in excess-

**Example 1**

Employee retires on 31 December 1968 after 35 years' service. Aggregate remuneration in 3 years ending 31.12. 68, $12,750. Actual _retiring_ allowance paid $6,000.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Actual retiring allowance | $6,000 |
| Less specified sum (1/3rd x $12,750) | $4,250 |
| Excess | $1,750 |
| Employee will be assessable on | $1,750 |
| plus 5% x $4,250 | $   212.50 |
| \*Taxable amount | $1,962.50 |

**Example 2**

Employee retires on 28 February 1968 after 8 years' service. Aggregate remuneration in 3 years ended 28.2.68, $7,200. Actual retiring allowance paid $2,400.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Actual retiring allowance | $2,400 |
| Less specified sum (8/10 x 1/3 x $7,200) | $1,920 |
| Excess | $ 480 |
| Employee will be assessable on | $   480 |
| plus 5% x $1,920 | 96  |
| \*Taxable amount | 576 |

Retiring allowances are subject to PAYE tax as extra emoluments. The rate is 21 cents in each $ of the taxable amount.

The 5 percent basis does not apply to -

1.  armed forces gratuities, or
2.  payment to a company director under the company's Articles of Association.

There are also special provisions covering payments -

1.  between related parties.
2.  by a proprietary company to a shareholder or relative.

#### What the Employer can Deduct

**Section 22** brings in new rules under which employers can deduct retiring allowances paid to employees on or after 19 July 1968.

In general all retiring allowances and lump sum redundancy payments will be deductible.

The exceptions are -

1.  Payments made to the husband or wife of the employer.
2.  Payments by an employer to any relative other than the husband wife.
3.  Payments by a proprietary company to any shareholder or any relative of any shareholder.

However, deductions may be allowed under (2) and (3) above up to the amount the Commissioner considers reasonable if the employee were not a relative or a shareholder. Any excess is not deductible.

If the employer is a proprietary company under (3) above, the excess is assessable as a dividend whether or not the recipient is a shareholder in the company. In other cases the excess is not assessable to the employee.

#### Standard Value May Be Used For Maturing Stocks Of Wine, Brandy And Whisky

**Section 10** allows wine, brandy and whisky manufacturers to adopt a standard value for reserve stocks held for maturing. The wine, brandy or whisky must be manufactured in New Zealand.

Under certain conditions the standard value may be retained on the death of the taxpayer, as is the case with livestock.

#### Aggregation Of Income

**Section 11** corrects a reference in section 104 of the main Act.

#### More Liberal Provisions For Expenditure Claims Or Losses

**Section 12** substitutes new and more liberal provisions for the deduction of expenditure or loss incurred in producing income. Briefly, there are now two separate standards covering-

1.  Business expenditure or loss - needs only to be necessarily incurred in carrying on a business to gain or produce assessable income for any income year, not exclusively incurred as in the past.
2.  Other expenditure or loss - needs to be incurred by any taxpayer in gaining or producing assessable income for any income year and must not be private or capital expenditure.

#### Writing Off Depreciation In Accounts

**Section 13** removes the requirement that sufficient depreciation must be provided for in the taxpayer's accounts. This means that business taxpayers will be able to provide in their accounts for whatever depreciation they consider necessary for the business but depreciation at scale rates will be allowable for tax purposes.

However, while the tax claim need no longer coincide with the provision in the accounts "full and satisfactory accounts" will still be required.

#### Incentive Allowances Extended

**Sections 14, 17, 18, 23 and 24** extend the following incentive allowances

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Special depreciation allowance | to 31 March 1970 |
| West Coast Investment Allowance |
| Farm capital development expenditure |
| Export market development expenditure | to 31 March 1972 |
| Tourist promotion expenditure |
| Increased exports incentive |

#### New Allowance On Frozen Meat Storage

**Section 15** provides for a 20 percent special depreciation allowance on new buildings or extensions to existing buildings to provide storage for frozen meat or meat products. The allowance is for companies engaged in killing and processing stock for export. It is additional to ordinary depreciation and applies to new buildings or extensions erected before 1 April 1972.

The building must be wholly or principally for storage of frozen meat or meat products. Therefore, an occasional use for other purposes will not mean that the company cannot claim the allowance.

#### Initial And Special Depreciation Merged

**Section 16** simplifies existing depreciation provisions by amalgamating the special and initial depreciation allowances under one section. The allowance will be called Special Depreciation.

#### Rock Oyster Farmers Can Claim Some Capital Expenditure

**Section 19** allows licensed rock oyster farmers to deduct certain items of capital expenditure. The deduction is similar to that for farm development expenditure.

#### Deduction For Goodwill Paid On Lease

**Section 20** allows a deduction for goodwill paid on the grant or renewal of a lease. In effect. a lessee of land used for business purposes can claim the premium paid by spreading it equally over the term of the lease. If the land is not used for business purposes for the full year the claim for that year is reduced proportionately.

**For example**

"A" is granted a lease of premises on 1 October 1968. Premium paid $10,000, term of lease 10 years. Premises not used for business until 1 January 1968. Balance date 31 March.

| Income year | Deduction |
| --- | --- |
| 1969 | $   250 |
| 1970 | $1,000 |
| 1971 | $1,000 |
| 1972 | $1,000 |
| 1973 | $1,000 |
| 1974 | $1,000 |
| 1975 | $1,000 |
| 1976 | $1,000 |
| 1977 | $1,000 |
| 1978 | $1,000 |
| 1979 | $   500 |
|     | $9,750 |

The deduction for 1969 is reduced as the premises were used for business purposes for only three months.

Special provision is made for a lessee who is not the original lessee but has paid a premium on acquiring a lease by purchase, transfer or assignment. His claim each year will be limited to the amount the original lessee would have been able to deduct.

For instance, if in the previous example the lease was sold by "A" to "B" on 31 March 1975 for $7,000, the lease has 3 1/2 years to run and the position would be -

| Income year | "A's" unexpired deduction | "B's" proportionate premium |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1976 | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| 1977 | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| 1978 | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| 1979 | $   500 | $1,000 |

"B's" deduction is, of course, limited to "A's" unexpired portion.

#### Deduction For Chatham Islands Dues

**Section 21** allows business taxpayers to deduct dues on business goods (whether capital or revenue) paid to the Chatham Island County Council.

#### No Time Limit On Losses Carried Forward

**Section 25 -**

1.  removes the 6 year time limit on carrying forward losses against assessable income.
2.  introduces new provisions for reducing the loss to the extent that it includes debts that have been remitted or cancelled, for example in bankruptcy.

The section applies to losses incurred in the year which began on 1 April 1962 and to later years to the extent that those losses have not been set off up to 31 March 1968.

#### New Rules For Taxing Co-operatives

**Section 26** changes the basis for taxing cooperatives. The main change is that the deduction for rebates will be limited to the proportion of rebates attributable on a pro ram basis to the profits on members' transactions, for instance,

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total of members' transactions |     | $300,000 |     |
| Total of non members' transactions |     | $ 60,000 |     |
| Net profit before rebates |     | $ 30,000 |     |
| Rebates to members |     | $ 26,000 |     |
|     | $300,000 | x   | $30,000 |
| Deductible rebates | $360,000 |     | 1   |
|     | \=  | $25,000 |     |
| Assessable income ($30,000-$25,000) | \=  | $ 5,000 |     |

#### Some Rebates Taxed as Dividends

Cooperative dairy, milk marketing and pig marketing companies are not affected in respect of their principal activities.

**Exemption From Payment Of Provisional Tax Increased**

**Section 27** provides that a taxpayer whose income was from salary, wages, superannuation (not Universal) with no other income or not more than $200 in total from dividends, rent, interest (after the $60 exemption) does not now have to pay provisional tax. Previously the limit was $100.

The change first applies to provisional tax payable this year.

**Section 28** merely corrects a reference in the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1961.

**Section 29** makes certain repeals and consequent amendments to the main Act on amalgamation of Initial and Special depreciation.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1969
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1969 from PIB vol 42 Sep/Oct 1967.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 42, September/October 1967

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

Public Information Bulletin No. 53 — November 1969 (PIB No 53)

### Land And Income Tax Amendment Act 1969

#### Application of Act

**Section 2.** Except where otherwise stated the amendments apply to tax on income derived during the income year that began on 1 April 1969.

### Depreciation on Certain "Temporary" Buildings

**Section 3** amends the definition of "temporary building" to include buildings built around plant or machines when the removal or replacement of the plant or machine would involve the demolition of the building.

### Dates for Filing Certain Annual Returns

**Section 4** alters the date some tax returns are to be furnished. Persons with investment income between $100 and $200 who were relieved from provisional tax last year will now furnish their return of income on or before 7 June in each year. This amendment applies for the first time to returns of income for the year ending on 31 March 1970.

**Grouping of Companies for Land Tax**

**Section 5** inserts new subsections (2) and (3) in section 62 of the Tax Act defining when two or more companies are deemed to "consist substantially of the same shareholders" for land tax purposes. The effect is to adopt the same general rules for land tax purposes as already apply for income tax under section 141 as discussed in PIB No. 48. The tests are applied at a specific point of time noon on 31 March preceding the year of assessment. The section first applies to land tax on land held as at noon on 31 March 1969.

### Special Development Projects Carried Out by Non-Resident Companies

**Section 6** is a complete rewrite of section 78F which provides tax rate concessions for non-resident companies carrying on special industrial undertakings processing minerals through branches in New Zealand.

### Universal Superannuation Rebate

**Section 7** removes the limit of $48 on this rebate. The rebate is now $4 for event four-weekly pay period for which the benefit is received, subject to the rebate not exceeding the tax payable by the superannuitant. In a normal year of 13 four-weekly pay periods the maximum rebate will be $52.

### Special exemption for Gifts and School Fees

**Section 8** removes the distinction, for special exemption purposes, between gifts to charities, and donations and school fees paid to private schools. The limit for all gifts including school fees paid to private schools will, in future, be either

*   (a) the amount actually paid, or
*   (b) $100,

whichever is the lesser.

### Special exemption for Life Insurance Premiums and Superannuation Contributions

**Section 9** amends section 85 to increase the special exemption for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions. The exemption is -

*   member of employer-subsidised scheme - the aggregate amount of life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions paid in the year or $500, whichever is the lesser.
*   other taxpayers - the aggregate of the life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions paid in the year or $650, whichever is the lesser.

The new exemption applies for the whole of the income year ending 31 March 1970.

### Interest Exemption Increases

**Section 10** increases from $60 to $100 the exemption for interest and investment society dividends received by individuals resident in New Zealand. Interest on Post Office National Development Bonds is excluded from this exemption.

### Post Office National Development Bonds — Interest Exemption

**Sections 11 and 15** relate to the new Post Office National Development Bonds.

**Section 11** provides an exemption of up to $500 in any one year for income from interest on these bonds.

**Section 15** provides that interest on these bonds is income in the income year the bond matures, or is surrendered.

### Post Office Bonus Bonds — Prizes Exempt from Tax

**Section 12** exempts from income tax prizes won in ballots by holders of Post Office Bonus Bonds.

### Treasury Bills

**Section 13** provides that the discount on Treasury Bills is assessable income for tax purposes.

### Retiring Allowances for Members of regular Forces

**Section 14** takes into account the particular circumstances of the Regular Forces by defining the "Appropriate retiring age" in section 88B of the principal Act as the age at which the member was discharged or transferred from regular service on completion of the term for which appointed or enlisted. The amended definition relates expressly to "any bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance" payable to the member of the forces. The effect is that the tax concessions for retiring allowances apply to these gratuities.

### Special Depreciation Allowances Extended

**Section 16** extends the Special Depreciation allowance on -

*   Plant and machinery (Section 114A (1)(a)).
*   Employee Accommodation (Section 114A (1)(b)).
*   New farm buildings (Section 114A (1A)).
*   Certain facilities in hotels (Section 114A (1B)) now to expire on 31 March 1971.
*   Frozen Export Meat Storage buildings (Section 114A (1BB)) now to expire on 31 March 1973.

Each of these is an extension of one further year. The other conditions of the allowance remain unaltered.

### Additional Depreciation Allowance to Meat Exporters Extended

**Section 17** extends the allowance of additional depreciation on capital expenditure to meet hygiene standards for buildings used as meat export slaughterhouses or meat packing houses (Section 114B) for two years — now to expire on 31 March 1972.

### Special Depreciation on Tourist Accommodation Extended

**Section 18** extends for a further year until 31 March 1973 the Special Depreciation Allowance granted to new approved hotels or motels, or extensions of either, erected to provide tourist accommodation.

### West Coast Investment Allowance Rate Increased for Plant and Machinery

**Section 19** relates to the West Coast Investment Allowance.

*   The qualifying period is extended for a further year — until 31 March 1971.
*   The qualifying plant and machinery acquired or installed after June 1969 will attract the allowance at the increased rate of 20%.

### Farm Development Expenditure — Incentive Extended

**Section 20** amends section 119D of the principal Act which relates to development expenditure by a farmer.

*   The allowance for development expenditure is extended for a further year — until 31 March 1971.
*   The period of five years previously allowed lot spreading the deduction has now been increased to nine years.

### Remission of Additional Tax

**Sections 21 and 22** relate to the restrictions on the amounts of additional tax (penalty), or relief from Land or Income Tax that the Commissioner may remit without obtaining the approval of the Minister of Finance. They are purely administrative amendments.

Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1971
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1971 from PIB vol 65 Feb 1972.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 65, February 1972

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

#### Application of the Act

**Sections 2 and 5** provide that except where otherwise stated the Act will apply to the 1971/72 year. This means -

*   **Part I** which relates to land tax, applies to assessments of land tax on land held at 31 March 1971 and subsequent years.
*   **Part II** applies to income tax on income derived during the year that commenced on 1 April 1971.

### Land Tax

**Section 3.** The effect of this section is to "freeze" the unimproved value of land as at 31 March 1970 as the basis on which land tax on land held as at 31 March 1971 and subsequent years is to be assessed. The need for this amendment arose from the change in the land valuation system which came into force last year. Under the new system "land values" instead of unimproved values are shown on District Land Valuation Rolls.

**Section 4** provides for objections to special valuations made for land tax to be referred by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the Valuer-General.

### Income Tax

**Section 6** extends the following incentives -

| Export market and tourist promotion. | 1975 |
| Value of time spent by principal in export market development. | 1975 |
| **Increased Export Incentive**\- | 1977 |

### Businesses Controlled by Non-Residents

**Section 7** defines the term "business" for the purposes of section 20 of the tax Act as including any profession, trade, manufacture or undertaking carried on in New Zealand irrespective of whether or not it is carried on for pecuniary profit. This definitions to be used when enterprises operating in New Zealand are controlled from abroad.

### Assessment of Superannuation Funds

**Section 8** amends **section 77** of the principal Act. It makes it clear that any superannuation fund which becomes liable for income tax is taxed in the same manner as a subsisting company.

### Universal Superannuation Rebates

**Section 9** increases the rebate from income tax for superannuitants to

*   $58 for a full year, or
*   $4.45 per pay period where payment is received for more or less than 13 pay periods.

The rebate is limited to the amount of tax payable.

### Rebates to Minority Shareholders in a Group of Companies

**Section 10** introduces a tax credit or rebate for minority shareholders in companies which have been assessed at higher rates of income tax under the grouping provisions of section 141 of the principal Act. The main features of the new rebate are -

*   It is allowable only on application.
*   The minority shareholder's proportion of the company's increased tax liability is calculated by the Department.
*   This amount is then
    *   included in the shareholder's assessment as a dividend. AND
    *   allowed in full as a credit against income tax payable by the shareholders.

### Housekeeper Exemption

**Section 11** amends section 83 of the principal Act to make it clear that the exemption is not allowable to an absentee.

### Donations

**Section 12** extends section 84B of the principal Act to enable individuals to claim, within the overall limit of $100, an exemption for cash donations made to the Food Bank of New Zealand.

### Life Insurance Exemption

**Section 13** amends the exemption for life insurance and superannuation contributions in four ways -

*   When a policy on the life of a taxpayer or his spouse has been assigned for the benefit of a child, a special exemption is not allowable unless the child is a dependant. This brings these policies into line with those on the life of a child.
*   An instalment or part payment of a premium qualifies for a special exemption.
*   An exemption is not allowable for premiums on policies assigned or mortgaged as security for borrowing money to be invested in or loaned to property syndicates made up of more than 10 persons.
*   When a person is a member of the Government Superannuation Fund or of an employer-subsidised fund for part only of an income year the basic maximum exemption he can claim is $700 increased by $21 for each complete month the taxpayer was not a member. This is subject to the following two conditions -
    
    *   The maximum overall exemption for life insurance premiums and superannuation is $950.
    
    *   The exemption allowable for contributions to the Government Superannuation Fund or an employer-subsidised fund is not to exceed $700.

### Building Society Dividends

**Section 14** makes a technical amendment to ensure that Building Society dividends derived by companies continue to be treated as assessable income.

### Incorrect Accounting Practices

**Section 15** prescribes the adjustments to be made where profits derived from a business in previous years have been understated or overstated because of incorrect accounting practices.

### Interest on Estate Duty

**Section 16** specifies that interest on Estate Duty is not an allowable deduction. This confirms existing practice.

### Special Depreciation

**Section 17** amends the definition of "plant or machinery" in section 114A of the principal Act. An effect of the amendment is that leased cars will no longer qualify for the special depreciation allowance. Rental service vehicles, taxi cabs or buses will continue to qualify.

### Gifts by Companies

**Section 18** relates to gifts made to approved educational and research institutes. The change made is that a deduction of up to $1,000 is allowable in any year regardless of the assessable income derived by the donor company.

### Misappropriation of Funds

**Section 19** inserts a new section 129CE in the principal Act. The section allows a deduction of a payment made by an innocent partner to a third person whose funds have been misappropriated by another partner, where there was a legal liability to make good the loss.

A new section 129CF is inserted by section 20. Previously losses due to embezzlement or misappropriation by ordinary employees were generally deductible but such losses were not deductible where the employee had a substantial degree of control or management of the taxpayer's business. The new section 129CF authorises a deduction for the latter losses.

### Offsetting of Company Losses Against Subsequent Profits

**Section 21** extends **section 137** of the principal Act to include -

*   Companies with no paid-up capital, and
*   Organisations, such as incorporated societies,

which are defined as companies for income tax purposes and which do not have share capital.

The section also contains provisions designed to combat "trafficking" in loss companies.

### Grouping of Companies

**Section 22** amends **section 141** to -

*   Exclude from the grouping provisions any company which is declared by the Minister of Finance not to be a proprietary company,
*   Extend the existing provisions relating to losses to include circumstances where all or some of the companies in a group do not have paid-up capital or do not have share capital.

### Convertible Notes

**Section 23** extends the deduction allowable for interest on convertible notes to all New Zealand companies. The amendment applies to note issues made on or after 11 June 1971 provided the notes are required to be converted within 5 years.

### Assessment of Life Insurance Companies

**Section 24** provides that the special basis of assessment of life insurance companies only applies to those companies that distribute the greater portion of their surplus funds to policy holders by way of reversionary bonuses.

### Property Syndicates

**Section 25** inserts a new section 153BB into the principal Act. It makes special provision for associations engaged in acquiring, holding or dealing in real property.

The main features of the new section are -

*   It applies to unincorporated associations with more than 10 members formed for the main purpose of holding real property for investment or re-sale,
*   These associations are treated as companies for income tax purposes,
*   Interest paid to members will not be deductible and together with any other distributions to members will be treated as a dividend,
*   Associations formed before 3 September 1971 will generally not be affected. Certain other specified associations are also excluded from the section.

### Mining Companies

**Section 26** contains new provisions relating to companies engaged in mining for specified minerals or for petroleum. The main changes introduced by the new provisions are -

*   In future the assessable income of mining companies will be calculated on a factual income basis.
*   Exploration and development costs up to a defined stage in production will be deductible as and when they are incurred.
*   Income from mining will be assessed at a concessional rate which is 1/3 less than the rate applicable to ordinary companies.

### Dependent Relative Exemption

**Section 30** increases from $700 to $850 the amount a dependent relative may earn before the taxpayer's right to claim an exemption in his PAYE tax code is affected.

This section applies from 1 April 1972.

### Amendments and Repeals

**Sections 28, 31 and 32** provide for consequential amendments and repeal spent provisions.

### Farm Income Stabilisation Scheme

Here is the press statement issued by the Hon. CJ Moyle on the 22 February 1973.

The Government is introducing an extended voluntary scheme to encourage meat and wool farmers to spread their current high incomes over at least two seasons with the twin objectives of reducing pressure on the economy and allowing farmers to make the best use of their increased spending power.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr Moyle, said today that the Government wanted meat and wool farmers to voluntarily withdraw from circulation some $85 million of their current income, which represents no more than a quarter of the estimated increase. If the voluntary scheme was not successful, the Government would have no alternative but to introduce a compulsory withdrawal scheme.

"We are concerned equally about the disturbance to the stability of the country's economy from this injection of additional spending power and the situation of farmers who will have extraordinarily high incomes this year compared with previous ones.

"For several seasons many farmers have had to defer maintenance and development on their farms, and already because of the heavy spending on these things this year they are coming up against shortages of materials and the farm servicing industries cannot cope with the pressure. To use this money to the best advantage, expenditure on maintenance and development should be planned and spread over several seasons, not forced into one."

Mr Moyle said that the existing Farm Income Equalisation Scheme was limited to a maximum deposit of 40 percent of net income. The Government proposed to remove this limit.

"Briefly, a farmer will be able to deposit whatever he can from this year's income; refunds will become assessable for tax when they are claimed, but there is a guarantee that the tax payable will not be higher than it would have been in the 1972-73 income year; the deposits must remain for 12 months, but there is provision for earlier withdrawal in emergencies.

"We have had extensive and very helpful consultations with Federated Farmers and we are all agreed that it would be in everyone's best interests if we could attain our objective through an extension of the existing voluntary Farm Income Equalisation Scheme.

"Farmers will need to enter into a commitment by April 30 to make a deposit under the voluntary scheme by July 31. These deposits will be deducted from the amount required to be made under a compulsory scheme if one is implemented.

"If the necessary commitments to attain the target are not received by April 30, the compulsory scheme will have to be invoked.

"While the Government is extremely reluctant to introduce a compulsory scheme, and would do so only as a last resort, we consider it fair to give farmers the details of the compulsory scheme that could be introduced.

"In this scheme 12 1/2 percent of the gross proceeds from meat, wool, and stock sales, less purchases, would be compulsorily withdrawn. The first $5,000 of such income would be exempted.

"The amount to be deposited would be in respect of the 1972-73 income year for tax purposes and would relate to the individual farmer's balance date. The sum deposited would be deducted from the assessable income for tax purposes in the same way as are deposits under the existing Farm Income Equalisation Scheme. Any money deposited under this compulsory scheme could only be withdrawn at a maximum annual rate of 20% over the next 5 years and would be assessable for income tax at the rates pertaining at the time of withdrawal."

The Minister emphasised that local appeal committees would be set up to deal speedily with any cases of hardship. Farmers with genuine needs would be fully accommodated.

Deposits under the scheme would be held in the individual farmer's name and the money frozen with the Reserve Bank.

"The Government expects that farmers will recognise that it is their own and the national interest to make full use of the existing voluntary scheme and make any further measures unnecessary," Mr Moyle said.

### 20 Questions and Answers

In response to the many enquiries that have been received the following questions and answers are provided to assist farmers and their advisers.

### Question 1:

Why is an Income Stabilisation Scheme being introduced?

### Answer:

An Income Stabilisation Scheme is being introduced for two reasons. The first reason is that this scheme is essential for the maintenance of stability within the national economy. The second is to assist with the levelling out of fluctuations in farm expenditure between years.

### Question 2:

What are the main features of the Stabilisation Scheme?

### Answer:

The Government has set a target of $85 million to be deposited voluntarily by farmers to the Farm Income Equalisation Scheme by July 31. Farmers should complete a "letter of intent" stating the amount they intend to deposit and forward this to their nearest tax office by April 30.

If the target of $85 million is not reached under the voluntary scheme, the Government intends to introduce a compulsory scheme.

### Question 3:

Which farmers would be affected by the introduction of a compulsory scheme?

### Answer:

Any farmer who has received more than $5,000 gross income in the 1972-73 financial year from the sale of:

*   wool and skins,
*   sheep and cattle less purchases, and
*   sheep and cattle for slaughter (including bobby calves)
*   would be required to deposit 12 1/2% of that excess.

Note that income from milk products, pigs and poultry is excluded.

### Question 4:

If a person is engaged in an agricultural business (e.g. an orchardist) and does not meet the requirements stated above, is he still able to use the existing Income Equalisation Scheme?

### Answer:

Yes. He may continue to make deposits or withdrawals from the scheme. However, there will be no limit on the amount of the deposit that any farmer can make for 1972-73, nor will the fact that he has already received a refund for that year preclude him from making a subsequent deposit for that year.

### Question 5:

What conditions will apply to deposits made under the voluntary scheme as compared with deposits under the compulsory scheme?

### Answer:

| Voluntary Scheme | Compulsory Scheme |
| --- | --- |
| The entire deposit may be withdrawn at the end of 12 months. | Withdrawals may be made at a maximum rate of 20% per annum over 5 years. |
| Tax payable on the amount withdrawn will be at no greater rate than that applying in the year of deposit. | Tax payable on the amount withdrawn will be at the rate applying in the year of withdrawal. |

### Question 6:

How does a farmer calculate the amount he would be required to deposit if a compulsory scheme is introduced?

### Answer:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Gross income from wool and skins | $22,337 |
| Plus gross income from sale of sheep and cattle for slaughter | $21,263 |
| Plus gross income from other sales of sheep and cattle | $ 4,639 |
|     | $48,239 |
| Less purchases of sheep and cattle | $ 1,570 |
|     | $46,669 |
| Less exemption | $ 5,000 |
| Balance | $41,669 |
| 12 1/2% (1/8) of balance = Deposit that would be required | $ 5,208 |

**Note:**All gross income figures should be those relating to the accounting year corresponding with the 1972-73 financial year. If a deposit or deposits in respect of the 1972-73 accounting year have already been made, then these amounts count toward the minimum deposit required.

**\[CCH Note:** The figures in italics in the above table are taken from the simulated hand-written figures in the published PIB.\]

### Question 7:

Are there any payments made to farmers which are excluded from the above calculations?

### Answer:

Payments made under last year's Stock Retention Scheme and compensation payments for stock slaughtered under the Tb and brucellosis schemes are to be excluded from the income calculations together with any other payments made on a similar basis.

### Question 8:

Would forced sales of livestock due to drought or other adverse events be excluded from the provisions of the compulsory scheme?

### Answer:

All sheep and cattle sales are to be included but the appeal committees will have wide discretionary powers to deal with any cases of hardship.

### Question 9:

How is a deposit for the 1972-73 year treated for taxation purposes?

### Answer:

The amount deposited is deductible from the assessable income for the 1972-73 year.

### Question 10:

When may a farmer withdraw his deposit?

### Answer:

Under the voluntary scheme a farmer may withdraw his deposit after 12 months. Withdrawals for an accounting year may be made-

*   during that year, or
*   up to one month after the due date for filing a tax return or within six months after balance date, whichever is the earlier.

Under the voluntary scheme a farmer may withdraw his deposit after 12 months. Withdrawals for an accounting year may be made-

*   during that year, or
*   up to one month after the due date for filing a tax return or within six months after balance date, whichever is the earlier.

### Question 11:

How is the refund of the deposit treated for taxation purposes?

### Answer:

Refunds will generally be treated as assessable income in the accounting year in which the application is received. The refund can be related back to the farmer's previous accounting year if an application is made up to one month after the due date for filing a tax return or within six months after balance date, whichever is the earlier.

### Question 12:

Under what circumstances can a withdrawal be made earlier than 12 months?

### Answer:

Under the voluntary scheme the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will allow an early withdrawal in cases of hardship or where the money is required for urgent development work.

If the compulsory scheme is introduced, Appeal Committees will be set up and they will have the power to authorise earlier refunds in appropriate cases.

### Question 13:

How can a farmer with a balance date later than March make a commitment by April 30?

### Answer:

At the date of commitment he will need to estimate the amount of his gross income still to be received for the remainder of his accounting year and to add this to his known gross income for the part of the accounting year already gone. It would be to his disadvantage to under-estimate his proposed commitment, as any additional deposit would be subject to the provisions of the compulsory scheme.

### Question 14:

What happens if a farmer has already committed his 1973 income to development work?

### Answer:

If a compulsory scheme is introduced Appeal Committees will consider cases of hardship where farmers had already committed their 1972-73 incomes prior to February 22 when the scheme was announced. The Committees will take account of expenditure on deferred maintenance, capital development, reasonable increases in personal expenditure, and reduction in short and medium term debt.

### Question 15:

Would a partnership itself or would the individual partners make deposits to the compulsory scheme and who would receive the $5,000 exemption under that scheme?

### Answer:

The deposit would be made on behalf of the farm owning enterprise, i.e. whether it be an individual, partnership, estate, trust, company or livestock syndicate. Should a compulsory scheme be introduced, only one $5,000 exemption will be allowed in respect of each farm owning enterprise regardless of how many farms the enterprise owns.

### Question 16:

If a compulsory scheme is introduced, would changes in the value of stock on hand be included in gross income?

### Answer:

Livestock and wool on hand at the end of the year would not be taken into account under a compulsory scheme.

### Question 17:

Would farmers who retire during the 1972-73 year be affected by the compulsory scheme?

### Answer:

In the case of retiring farmers, all gross income from wool and the sale of sheep and cattle will be subject to the provisions of the scheme with an adjustment to exclude proceeds from the realisation of the basic herd or flock. The Farm Income Equalisation Scheme which previously has not been available to retiring farmers will be open to them for the 1972-73 year if they wish to take advantage of the voluntary scheme.

In the case of the death of a farmer and the realisation of the basic herd or flock during the 1972-73 year, gross income derived by the estate will be treated in a similar way.

### Question 18:

What happens to deposits already made under the existing income equalisation scheme in respect of the 1972-73 year?.

### Answer:

They count as deposits or partial deposits towards the commitment under the voluntary scheme and would also count towards the amount required under a compulsory scheme if one is necessary. Farmers should record previous deposits in respect of the 1972-73 year in the space provided on the "letter of intent"

### Question 19:

What is the position if a voluntary deposit is less than the amount of the deposit required should the compulsory scheme be introduced?

### Answer:

If the compulsory scheme is introduced, the farmer will be required to deposit a further amount to make up any deficiency. This additional deposit will be subject to the conditions of the compulsory scheme.

### Question 20

Who can advise the farmer when making a decision as to how much he is required to deposit under the scheme?

### Answer:

If the farmer should be in doubt then he should consult his financial adviser.

### Employee Share Purchase Scheme

### Introduction

The 1973 Budget announced a scheme to encourage a greater identity of interest between employer and employee through the issue of shares. The object of the scheme is to encourage companies to make interest free loans to their employees to enable them to take up shares in their employing company.

The Land and Income Tax Amendment Act recently passed by Parliament, incorporates the scheme in a new section 129CH of the Tax Act.

### Main Features Of Scheme

The principal features of the scheme are -

*   All shares offered must be fully paid ordinary shares ranking equally in all respects with other ordinary shares of the company.
*   A restrictive period during which shares issued may not be dealt with by the employee. The period is a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years. Subject to this restriction any benefit to the employee arising through preferential buying terms will not be subject to tax.
*   During the restrictive period employees are entitled to receive any dividends payable on the shares. Dividends cannot be applied to meet outstanding debts owing to the company.
*   Loans to enable employees to purchase shares must be interest free.
*   Eligibility to participate must be equal and not, for example, confined to executives or long serving employees.
*   The employer company is given a concessional deduction from taxable income for 10 percent notional interest calculated at monthly rests on loans made available to employees to finance the purchase of shares. This is additional to any deduction that may be allowable for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance employee share purchases.

### Approval Of Schemes

To qualify for the notional deduction of interest, schemes must be approved by the Commissioner. Approval of schemes will be dealt with by our Wellington district office.

Here are the requirements which schemes must satisfy in order to obtain approval.

*   The cost to employees of shares made available for purchase or subscription must not exceed market price at the date of purchase or subscription.
*   The aggregate amount of loans which may be made to any employee within a 3 year period is not to exceed $1560.
*   Every full-time permanent employee must be eligible to participate in the scheme on an equal basis with every other full-time permanent employee. Where the scheme is available to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, they must also be eligible to participate on an equal basis with every other part-time employee, or every seasonal employee.
*   Any minimum period of service which may be required before a full-time permanent employee becomes eligible to participate in the scheme is not to exceed 3 years. In the case of other employees any minimum period of service is not to exceed an accumulative period that is the equivalent of 3 years full-time service.
*   Loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges.
*   Where it is a requirement that loans made under the scheme to any employee shall be of a minimum amount, the minimum amount is not to exceed $624.
*   The repayment of loans by employees is to be by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than 1 month over a period of not less than 3 years and not more than 5 years from the date of the loan.
*   Any employee may however elect to repay all or any part of his loan prior to the due date for repayment, but the shares may not be released until after the end of the restrictive period.

The following conditions must apply during the restrictive period -

*   The shares are to be held in trust for the employee.
*   Any employee, for whom shares are held on trust, is to be precluded from assigning, charging, alienating, or otherwise disposing of all or any of his rights in respect of the shares.
*   The trustee must pay to the employee all dividends received in respect of any shares. Dividends are not to be appropriated towards repayment of any loans owing under the scheme or towards any other debts owing to the company.

At the end of the restrictive period the following provisions apply -

*   _On repayment of loans and at the expiry of 3 years or other restrictive period._ The shares are to be transferred to the employee by the trustee or at the employee's option the shares are to be purchased by the trustee from the employee at the market price (but not exceeding cost price to the employee at the date of purchase).
*   _On death of employee._ The shares must be transferred to the trustee of the deceased employee's estate or, at the option of the trustee of the estate, are to be purchased by the trustee of the scheme at market price (but not exceeding the original cost price to the employee). This is subject to repayment of any loans outstanding in respect of the shares.
*   _On accident, sickness or redundancy of employee._ Any shares are to be transferred to the former employee, or at the former employee's option are to be purchased by the trustee at market price (but not exceeding the original cost price to the employee). This is subject again to repayment of any loans outstanding in respect of the shares.
*   _On termination of employment._ The trustee is not to transfer to the former employee any shares held on trust, but is to purchase the shares from the former employee at market price (but not exceeding the original cost price to the employee) subject to the repayment of all loans outstanding in respect of the shares.
*   _Early withdrawal._Any employee is to be entitled to withdraw from the scheme after the expiry of 3 months prior notice to the trustees of the scheme. In these circumstances the conditions of withdrawal will be on the same terms as on termination of employment.
*   _Hardship._ Where the trustee is satisfied that any employee in the scheme has suffered loss or there are circumstances where the employee's continued participation in the scheme entails or would entail serious hardship, the trustee with the consent of the employee, is to have a discretion to -
    *   Vary the terms of the repayment of any loan made to the employee under the scheme.
    *   Allow the employee an immediate withdrawal from the scheme on the same terms as if he had terminated employment.

### Miscellaneous Amendments

These involve amendments to other statutes. The main features are -

*   Trusts under the scheme will not be regarded as unit trusts.
*   The rule against perpetuities will not apply to these trusts.
*   Transfers within the scheme will be exempt from stamp duty and gift duty.

### Application

The scheme first applies to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1973.

### How To Obtain Approval

Send a copy of the rules and/or trust deed to -

**District Commissioner,** Inland Revenue Department, Private Bag, WELLINGTON.

### Are You Interested In A Business On The West Coast

This article outlines the main provisions of recent legislation providing for an investment allowance in respect of certain capital expenditure incurred in re-development activities in the West Coast region.

#### Main Theme

The legislation aims at assisting the re-development of the West Coast region by providing for an additional deduction from assessable income of 20 percent of the capital expenditure incurred in acquiring certain plant or machinery or in erecting or extending certain buildings for use in re-development projects in the region. The 20 percent allowance compares favourable with the 10 percent allowance available for the rest of New Zealand and it means that over the life of a particular asset the taxpayer can write off up to 120 percent of the cost.

#### Re-Development Region

This comprises the following counties and boroughs:-

| Counties | Boroughs |
| --- | --- |
| Buller | Brunner |
| Grey | Greymouth |
| Inangahua | Hokitika |
| Westland | Kumara |
| Ross |
| Runanga |
| Westport |

#### Re-Development Project

This is defined as any undertaking, scheme or work which in the opinion of the Minister of Finance has as its sole or principal purpose the re-development of the region comprised in the foregoing counties and boroughs or is or will be of importance in the re-development of that region and which has been approved by the Minister as a re-development project.

Actual residence in the region is not a pre-requisite. Persons from outside the West Coast who engage in approved activities in the region may qualify for the allowance.

#### Expenditure which qualifies

Expenditure on new capital assets will generally qualify for the 20 percent allowance. The assets fall into two broad categories and these are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs.

#### Plant and Machinery

##### (i) Non-Qualifying

Certain items are specifically excluded from qualifying for the investment allowance. These are:-

*   motor cars or station wagons except those which are passenger service vehicles as defined in Section 2(1) of the Transport Act 1962;
*   blocks, bolsters, core boxes, dies, driers, flasks, gauges, jigs, lasts, matrixes, moulds, patterns, saggars, stereotypes, templets and tooling (including workholding fixtures, working heads, and tool holders), and articles of a description, or having a use similar to that of any of those articles, except where such items are, by arrangement with the Department, subject to an allowance by way of depreciation and cost more than £30;
*   hand tools and loose tools;
*   any unit costing less than £30.

Broadly therefore, motor cars and station wagons are excluded from the allowance unless they are taxis or service cars or rental vehicles and the particular business activities are approved as re-development projects. Other vehicles such as trucks, vans, tractors etc. can qualify if the other conditions are satisfied.

The other non-qualifying items listed above may be broadly classified as non-depreciable items.

##### (ii) Qualifying

Assets which are not excluded under (i) above and which are

*   new, as distinct from used or second-hand;
*   owned by the taxpayer;
*   acquired or installed on or after 12 July 1963 and on or before 31 March 1967;
*   for use by the taxpayer in the re-development region;
*   for use primarily and principally and directly in and for the purposes of any re-development project carried on by the taxpayer or in performing services in relation to any re-development project.

Plant or machinery which can qualify therefore is not restricted to manufacturing equipment alone but includes all plant and machinery used in or in relation to any re-development project.

Where the new plant or machinery was acquired before 12 July 1963 but was not installed until after that date the allowance may be claimed if the project is approved and the other requirements are met.

#### Buildings

In contrast to the ordinary investment allowance available elsewhere in New Zealand the West Coast allowance may be gained in respect of capital expenditure on new buildings or extensions to existing buildings. The particular conditions applying to the allowance on capital expenditure on buildings are:-

*   the building must be owned by the taxpayer;
*   it must be erected (or extended) on or after 12 July 1963 and on or before 31 March 1967;
*   it must be situated in the re-development region;
*   it must be for use primarily and principally and directly in and for the purposes of a re-development project carried on by the taxpayer or for use in performing services in relation to any re-development project.

As is the case with the allowance in respect of plant or machinery, the concession is not restricted to manufacturing and agricultural buildings or extensions to such buildings. If the activity is approved by the Minister of Finance and the other conditions are satisfied the allowance may be gained in respect of activities other than manufacture and agriculture.

#### Apportionment

Provision for apportionment of the investment allowance is made so as to meet cases where the plant, machinery, buildings or extensions have been used:-

(i) outside the re-development region and for purposes other than the re-development project, or

(ii) partly in producing non-assessable or exempt income.

#### Recoupment of Expenditure

Where an owner has incurred capital expenditure on new plant machinery or new buildings or extensions to existing buildings and he has been recouped or is entitled to be recouped for that expenditure, the investment allowance is calculated on the net capital cost to the owner after taking into account the sum recouped.

#### Dual Allowances Prohibited

If the 20 percent West Coast Investment allowance has been granted in respect of plant or machinery used in agricultural or manufacturing activities, the other more restricted ten percent investment allowance available generally throughout New Zealand cannot be claimed on those same assets. Conversely, if the 10 percent allowance has been claimed the West Coast allowance cannot be gained.

#### Specific Approved Projects

The Minister of Finance has announced that all **manufacturing** and **agricultural activities** in the defined West Coast re-development region are approved as re-development projects for the purposes of the investment allowance in respect of capital expenditure on **new plant or machinery**.

This means that any person engaged in these activities in the region will automatically qualify for the twenty percent investment allowance on capital expenditure incurred in the acquisition of new plant or machinery. For the farmer or agricultural contractor it means that the allowance is immediately available on a new tractor or truck, for example. For the manufacturer it means that new plant or machinery - purchased for factory or office will generally attract the allowance.

#### Other activities and Buildings

Specific approval of the activity as a 're-development project' is required in every other case not falling within the terms of the Minister's announcement as outlined in the paragraph above. In brief this means that:-

(i) all non-manufacturing or non-agricultural activities require specific approval as re-development projects before the investment allowance can be gained on both plant or machinery and buildings or extensions, and

(ii) manufacturing and agricultural activities require specific approval where the investment allowance is sought on buildings and extensions.

#### How to Apply

##### (i) Approved Activities

The allowance in respect of capital expenditure on new manufacturing or agricultural plant or machinery may be claimed in the appropriate tax return without prior reference to the Department. Form IR39A is available from local tax offices and should be completed and attached to the return in support of the investment allowance claimed.

##### (ii) Other Activities and Buildings

In these cases prior application is necessary before the investment allowance may be granted. The initial application for approval should be made to the local office of the Department. Information in support of the application should generally include:-

(a) nature of the activity carried on or proposed to be carried on;

(b) particulars of the capital expenditure involved;

(c) purpose for which the asset (plant or machinery or building) is to be used;

(d) extent of similar activities carried on in the region;

(e) manner in which activity or project will contribute to re-development of the region e.g. additional employment, cheaper products and so on;

(f) any other relevant information.

Such applications will then be submitted by the Department to the Minister of Finance for his consideration.

#### When Allowance may be Claimed

In all cases, whether the allowance is granted under the general approval given by the Minister for manufacturing and agricultural plant or machinery, or under specific approvals in the case of other activities and buildings, the allowance is to be claimed in the return of income for the year in which the asset is first used. This may not coincide with the year in which the capital expenditure is actually incurred or when the asset is actually acquired.

#### Enquiries

Taxpayers wishing to discuss any points more fully are invited to contact the local office of the Department where as much assistance and information as possible will be given.
