DRAFT, 29 April 2018 1 Taxation of Global Digital Matchmakers: A Tentative Step Forward? Abstract Using the example of Google, this article discusses the problem of the ‘fiscal absence’ (or limited fiscal presence) of global digital matchmakers selling Internet advertising and digital intermediation services in New Zealand remotely over the Internet. The article evaluates the response to this problem found in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, which was introduced on 6 December 2017, and the OECD’s Interim Digitisation Report of 16 March 2018 on the implications of digitalisation for taxation. Building on this analysis, the article suggests New Zealand should introduce an excise tax, as discussed in the OECD’s Interim report, to protect its national tax base from erosion, while waiting for a suitable international solution to be developed to the division of the gains generated in the today’s integrated and digitalised global economy. 1 INTRODUCTION On 6 December 2017, the New Zealand Government introduced the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill (the Bill) 1 to put an end to some of the practices eroding New Zealand corporate tax base. The Bill does not specifically target tax base eroding activities of global matchmakers – foreign firms 2 that operate a global multisided platform business supplying Internet advertising and digital intermediation services 3 to customers in New Zealand (e.g. Uber, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Booking.com, Trivago, Amazon Marketplace, Taobao, Apple iTunes, e-Bay). 4 However, a New Zealand subsidiary of one of the largest global matchmakers (Google) has responded to the New Zealand Government’s 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill 2017 (3-1). 2 In this article, a ‘foreign firm’ is a unit of organisation for productive activities, incorporated in one country and conducting business in another country through a branch, subsidiary or permanent establishment. See “firm” in John Black, Nigar Hashimzade and Gareth Myles (eds), A Dictionary of Economics (4th edn, Oxford University Press 2012, online version 2013). 3 “Digital intermediation services (also referred to as platforms) are websites and mobile applications that facilitate the exchange of goods or services between third parties”: see OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[443\] at 186. 4 A ‘matchmaker’ is a firm with a multisided platform business. This firm produces multiple products simultaneously and organises its business activities in such a way that the customers of one product will attract customers for another product produced by the same firm. When this firm is multinational and operates as a global unitary business, its multisided platform will also likely to be global and, therefore, the firm will be a ‘global matchmaker’. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 2 initiative in cooperative way. In his submission of 8 February 2018 on the Bill, the Senior Manager for Public Policy and Government Affairs of Google New Zealand Mr Young stated that “\[w\]e intend to shift our business model from \[our\] past approach, such that customers will enter into contracts with our New Zealand entity, which will generate revenue from NZ advertising customers, and pay taxes in line with its role in the transaction”. 5 Nationally 6 and internationally 7 this statement was seen as a success story of a global campaign run by the OECD and the G20 in the framework of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. 8 At the first glance, the Google’s statement sounds promising for New Zealand. If Google entered into sales contracts in New Zealand, it would pay tax on income from these sales in New Zealand and not somewhere else. However, as sections 4 and 5 of this article conclude, the corporate income tax paid by Google in New Zealand will be likely to remain modest compared to the firm’s large and growing economic presence in the country. The reason for this is the general mechanism and model the international tax regime 9 applies to divide gains from cross-border business activities among countries. 10 New Zealand cannot change these mechanism and model unilaterally. However, there are some actions New Zealand, as a 5 Letter of Senior Manager Public Policy and Government Affairs of Google New Zealand Ross Young of 8 February 2018 <http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4384129-Google-Letter-to-F-amp-E-select- committee.html# document/p3/a405840> accessed 16 March 2018.

DRAFT, 29 April 2018 3 market state into which services are sold, can take as interim measures to protect its tax base from erosion through the actions of Google and other global matchmakers. This article does not address the broad problem of tax base erosion in market states arising out of cross-border direct sales. 11 It also does not have the objective of evaluating the overall anti-BEPS effect of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill. The current discussion focuses on the effects of this Bill on the taxation of global matchmakers supplying Internet advertising and digital intermediation services to customers in New Zealand. According to the OECD, the taxation of this type of activities is very challenging for a country where customers of these services are located and may require the introduction of specific tax measures. 12 The article is structured as follows. The challenges of taxing global matchmakers are illustrated through a look at the example of Google’s economic presence in New Zealand (section 2) and the fiscal outcome of this presence (section 3). Section 4 analyses tax implications of the Google’s promise to change a structure of its business operations in New Zealand. Section 5 examines the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill and non-tax alternatives available to New Zealand. Section 6 concludes that New Zealand should introduce an excise tax on foreign suppliers of Internet advertising and digital intermediation services. 2 ECONOMIC PRESENCE OF GOOGLE IN NEW ZEALAND 13 11 From a tax perspective, the concept of ‘cross-border direct sales’ are business activities conducted by foreign suppliers through direct interaction with customers in the “market” country. As a result of this interaction customers in the market country make mail, phone or online orders for products and services and receive these products and services directly from a form located abroad. In general terms, ‘direct sales’, ‘direct selling’ or ‘direct marketing’ is the “selling by means of dealing directly with consumers rather than through retailers. Traditional methods include mail order \[...\], cold calling, telephone selling, and door-to-door calling, \[...\] telemarketing, direct radio selling, magazine and TV advertising, and online computer shopping \[...\]”: ‘direct marketing’ in Jonathan Law, A Dictionary of Business and Management (5th edn, Oxford University Press 2009). 12 See Chapter 6 in OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018). See also section 5 in this article. 13 The analysis is based on data that has been publicly available. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 4 Google was created with the incorporation of Google Inc in California in September 1998. 14 It subsequently became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc in October 2015. 15 Its principal business is selling Internet advertising services and other digital products and intermediation services worldwide. The “Google segment” is the largest part of Alphabet’s business. The Google entities produce and supply worldwide many different types of digital services (e.g. Internet search), products (e.g. virtual reality headsets) and technical infrastructure (e.g. cloud infrastructure). In 2016, the Google segment generated 99.1 per cent of the consolidated income of Alphabet; 88.7 per cent of which came from Internet advertising. 16 The Google segment includes two New Zealand subsidiaries: Google New Zealand Ltd 17 and Google Payment New Zealand Ltd. 18 The single shareholder of both subsidiaries is Google International LLC, which is incorporated in the United States. Google New Zealand Ltd and Google Payment New Zealand Ltd support the operations of the Google segment in New Zealand. Neither of the New Zealand Google subsidiaries are engaged in transactions with local customers; they earn income only through intra-group transactions with other entities of the Google segment, primarily Google Inc, Google Ireland Ltd and Google Asia Pte Ltd. It follows from the Financial statements filled with the Company’s Office in New Zealand Google New Zealand Ltd provides sales and marketing (S&M) services for Google Ireland Ltd and Google Asia Pte Ltd, as well as research and development (R&D) services for Google Inc. 14 For the history of Google see <www.google.com/about/company/history/>.

DRAFT, 29 April 2018 5 Google Payment New Zealand Ltd collects payments for digital products sold to customers in New Zealand through the Google Play web platform. Based on the corporate business structure of the Google segment, it appears that customers of Internet advertising services in New Zealand pay for advertising services directly to Irish or Singaporean subsidiaries of Google Inc (Google Ireland Ltd and Google Asia Pte Ltd). 19 As a result, advertising revenues collected from customers in New Zealand do not pass through the subsidiaries of Google that are incorporated in New Zealand. 3 FISCAL OUTCOME OF GOOGLE’S ECONOMIC PRESENCE IN NEW ZEALAND Tables 3.1 and 3.2 set out selected financial and fiscal results of the Google segment of Alphabet Inc (and Google Inc prior to October 2015) in New Zealand for the period 2010- 2016 20 based on the Financial Statements of Google New Zealand Ltd 21 and Google Payment New Zealand Ltd filed with the Company’s Office. 22 Google New Zealand Ltd (in NZD) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 19 However, it is possible that all payments from local customers are collected by or paid directly to a Singaporean subsidiary of Google (Google Asia Pte Ltd). The Singaporean subsidiary manages operations of the Google segment in the Asia-Pacific mega-region, which includes New Zealand. 20 As of the date this article was submitted for publication, Google New Zealand Ltd has not filed its Financial Statements for 2017 year.

Accordingly, it appears the national tax base of New Zealand, as the market state for services and products sold by Google to customers in New Zealand, was eroded by Google’s decision for its overseas subsidiaries 26 to invoice for sales of Internet advertising services, digital intermediation services and digitals products to customers in New Zealand. It is not possible to measure the size of this erosion because none of the Google subsidiaries in New Zealand have been reporting income the group earns from sales it makes to customers in New Zealand. The author has not found any public data that would provide a basis for an accurate estimate of the business profits of Google from sales of digital intermediation services and digital products to customers in New Zealand.

In 2016, the total interactive advertising 27 spend in New Zealand was NZD 890.86 million. 28 According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC): \[...\] the annual value of New Zealand's internet advertising market will grow to $1.58 billion by 2020 from $828 million in 2015. More than half of that revenue is generated by paid searches, of which Google is responsible for 90 percent. The accounting firm estimates paid search ad revenue will be worth $897 million by 2020. 29 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Google has earned about $ 400-500 million per year from sales of Internet advertising to customers in New Zealand in 2015-2016 30 and this amount will likely double by 2020. Google spends about fifth of its income from Internet advertising on the acquisition of user traffic. 31 Google also pays its New Zealand subsidiaries for research and development and sales and marketing activities conducted in New Zealand. Therefore, the size of the real ‘erosion’ of the corporate tax base in New Zealand as a result of manner in which Google has structured its business is less than the firm’s income generated from sales of Internet 27 Interactive advertising is advertising viewed on any screen via an internet connection, 3G, 4G or WIFI.

However, even taking into account all costs Google likely incurs to produce and sell Internet advertising services in New Zealand, the ‘erosive’ effect of the firm’s economic presence for the New Zealand tax base is substantial. 4.0 GOOGLE’S PROMISE The way Google generates its profits is challenging for tax policymakers. Google is an example of a firm that is economically present in almost every state, but at the same time, for the purpose of corporate income tax, Google is fiscally absent 32 in most of states where its customers 33 or targeted Internet users 34 are located. When it comes to the taxation of Google’s business profits derived from cross-border direct sales of digital services and products, 35 in virtually all of the states that are the economic source of these profits, Google, rather than the states, effectively decides whether or not it will have a ‘tax presence’ and the degree of that presence. Google’s decision to be ‘fiscally present’ in some states and ‘fiscally absent’ in others is perfectly legal in most cases, because its practices are designed around the general mechanism and models of the international tax regime and comply with the legislation and treaties of the states participating in this regime. The main elements of the model that the international tax regime applies for the allocation of business profits are the separate entity approach and a physical presence standard for the tax nexus with business profits. Under the separate entity approach, when a firm operates in more than one state, the states where the individual legal or tax entities of the firm are located apply their own laws to these entities and treat them for tax purposes as if they are separate and independent enterprises. 36 The 32 The problem of ‘avoiding a taxable presence’ was identified as a key issue in the framework of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. See OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2014 Deliverable, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (16 September 2014) at 102 \[5.2.1.1\] and 124-129 \[7.2-7.3\]. 33 In the context of this discussion the concept ‘customers’ embodies both individuals and businesses. 34 ‘Targeted Internet user’ is a recipient of an Internet advertisement. 35 Digital products have characteristics of both services and goods. The article does not focus on differences between digital services and so-called ‘digital products’ (apps, electronic books, magazines, films and videos). The discussion in this article concerns digital services. However, most of findings of this discussion are relevant to digital products as well. 36 OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version (9th edn, Paris, 15 July 2014), arts 7 (2) and 9 (1). See also Reuven S Avi-Yonah, “National Regulation of Multinational Enterprises: An Essay on DRAFT, 29 April 2018 9 separate entity approach, in particular, underlies transfer pricing rules of states. 37 A physical presence standard for the tax nexus between a state and business income is applied to identify the source of business income in national tax legislation or as a part of the concept of a permanent establishment concept (PE) in national statutory and treaty rules. Both the separate entity approach and the physical presence standard are at odds with the integrated nature of the global economic environment today, the structure of multinational business operations and the production process of many multinational firms. Many people and governments see fiscal absence of the global matchmakers as immoral and on this basis claim that Google ‘does evil’ 38 to both states and people by eroding the national tax bases of many states and thereby forcing ordinary people to pay more tax. Almost by definition, the actions of firms are not driven by moral concerns. Profit maximisation, according to Milton Friedman, 39 is the duty of a firm to its shareholders. “Arranging one's affairs to reduce the amounts of tax that has to be paid” or avoiding tax is therefore, apparently, the natural behaviour of rational, profit-maximising economic actors. Google does its duty well. In 2017 Google’s total revenue was USD 24,750 billion and its net income was USD 5,426 billion. 40 To some extent, Google has no choice but to use every possible Comity, Extraterritoriality, and Harmonization (The Regulation of Foreign Direct Investment)” (2003) 42 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 5 at 8. 37 “In the area of international taxation, transfer pricing under the “arm’s length”- standard serves the role of allocating profits to the different units of a multinational enterprise and of allocating taxing rights to the involved jurisdictions”: Wolfgang Scho ̈ n, “Transfer Pricing – Business Incentives, International Taxation and Corporate Law” in Wolfgang Schön and Kai A Konrad (eds) Fundamentals of International Transfer Pricing in Law and Economics (Springer 2012) at 47.

DRAFT, 29 April 2018 10 means to reduce the amount of tax it pays, because, from the firm’s perspective, corporate income tax is a cost that affects both the size of a firm’s net profits and the dividends received by the firm’s shareholders. Google, like any other firm, does what it should and can do within existing legal rules to maximise its profits. The changes of Google business structure promised in the firm’s submission of 8 February 2018 41 and their tax implications for New Zealand should be evaluated from this perspective.There are a number of reasons for New Zealand not to be overly optimistic in this regard. First, it is unclear from Google’s submission whether all New Zealand customers of Google or only some of them will in the future enter into contracts with a New Zealand subsidiary of Google. The full details about how Google does business in New Zealand have not been made public. 42 Mr Young’s letter is a first public statement of Google about some of its business activities relating to the sale of Internet advertising in New Zealand. The statement itself is vague. In this regard, Google’s submission before the United Kingdom’s House of Commons may be of assistance in understanding how Google is likely to do business in New Zealand. 43 According to Google, ninety-nine per cent of its customers purchasing Internet advertising services in the United Kingdom deal with Google online through an automatic auction and enter in contracts with an overseas legal entity. The only one per cent of its customers sign contracts with Google with the assistance of Google’s local sales professionals. This one per cent, however, generates sixty to seventy per cent of the advertising revenue for Google in the United Kingdom. 44 The government’s investigation of Google’s business activity in the United Kingdom suggests that local Google entities undertake activities in relation to the sales 41 The letter of Senior Manager of Google New Zealand Ross Young of 8 February 2018 <http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4384129-Google-Letter-to-F-amp-E-select-committee.html# document/p3/a405840> accessed 16 March 2018.

In the United Kingdom, a foreign firm is liable for corporate income tax only if it carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment (PE) there. 46 The PE concept includes situations when a person (who is a dependent agent of a foreign firm) 47 is acting in the state on behalf of the foreign firm and, in doing so, habitually exercises authority to do business (or ‘to conclude contracts’ as provided in many of the United Kingdom’s double tax agreements (DTAs)) 48 on behalf of the foreign firm. In most of New Zealand’s DTAs, including its DTA with the United States, 49 a PE arises when a dependent agent of a foreign firm habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts. 50 If Google’s business in New Zealand is similar to that in the United Kingdom, it is reasonable to assume that one per cent of Google’s customers in New Zealand also sign their contracts with the assistance of sales professionals. Therefore, if Google would change its business operations as it has said, New Zealand may then be able to tax Google’s profits generated from the sales made to that one per cent of local customers purchasing Internet advertising services from Google with the 45 Ibid at 8 \[8\].

Therefore, thirty to forty per cent of the business profits generated by Google in New Zealand from Internet advertising would still escape taxation, unless Google will start allocate income to its subsidiary in New Zealand even if customers in New Zealand enter into online contracts with Google. It seems, however, overly optimistic to expect Google to abandon tax advantages it receives from a use of both online contracts and own subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions that enter into these online contracts on the firm’s behalf. Moreover, Internet advertising services may target New Zealand audience but supplied to customers that are not located in New Zealand. Profits from these sales cannot be exposed to taxation in New Zealand. Secondly, Google submission refers only to Internet advertising and do not mention the digital products (e.g. games, music and web apps) that Google sells through its Google Play web platform. The digital products can be produced in New Zealand and sold through Google Play web platform in New Zealand or overseas. The digital products can also be produced overseas and sold through Google Play to customers in New Zealand. Therefore, in New Zealand Google may receive two types of payments: a fee for digital intermediation services Google provides to developers of digital products in New Zealand and a payment for digital products bought by customers in New Zealand. As with the ninety-nine per cent of the sales of Google’s Internet advertising services, both types of payments are made online. Developers of digital products and customers of digital products enter into online contracts with Google (via filling in a form on the Google Play web platform). These contracts cannot be seen as having been “completed or concluded in New Zealand by Google or its agent”, because the process of entering into contract is automated. It may also be impossible to prove that digital products Google sells through the Google Play web platform are ‘offered for sale in New Zealand’. Like the Google advertising network and advertising exchange web platforms, 51 the Google Play web platform is physically located on and maintained through a myriad of web servers in many countries. Therefore, even if New Zealand customers access this platform or any of its 51 For detail on Google Search network and Google Display network see <https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1752334>.

A tax nexus with business profits is traditionally premised on a physical presence standard. When sales are direct cross-border and the process of sales is automated, it is almost impossible for New Zealand to tax the profits from these sales under existing nexus rules. Even if some of the web servers Google uses as a part of its Google Play web platform operation are located in New Zealand, the degree of ‘physical presence’ in New Zealand is likely to be insufficient to require Google to attribute its profits from cross-border direct automated sales to entities in New Zealand. 52 In New Zealand, a foreign firm is liable for all of the income that has a New Zealand source, which includes income derived from a business that is wholly or partly carried on in New Zealand and from contracts made or performed in New Zealand. 53 If the business income of a foreign firm is not derived from a business wholly or partially carried on in New Zealand, this income is treated as foreign-sourced and, therefore, not subject to income taxation in New Zealand. 54 Google would generally have business income sourced in New Zealand in relation to the production of services and products and their sale to local customers only if these services and products were produced by Google in New Zealand, or were offered for sale in New Zealand by Google or its agent, or if sales contracts were completed or concluded in New Zealand by Google or its agent, or, possibly, if Google’s services and products were stored in New Zealand. 55 52 See also paragraphs 122 – 131 of commentaries on Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Treaty Convention made in relation to e-commerce: Commentaries on the Articles of the Model Tax Convention in the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. Full Version (Paris, 21 November 2017). 53 Income Tax Act 2007, s YD 4 (2) provides that business income has a source in New Zealand if “the business is wholly carried on in New Zealand”, or if the business is partly carried on in New Zealand “to the extent to which the income is apportioned to a New Zealand source under section YD 5”. 54 Income Tax Act 2007, s BD 1 (4). 55 See generally Craig Elliffe, International and Cross-Border Taxation in New Zealand (Thomson Reuters 2015) at 315-316. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 14 Most services are produced and consumed at the same moment. Therefore, the storage of digital services in New Zealand, as an activity separate from production and distribution, is generally impossible. The process of production of digital services, such as Internet advertising and digital intermediation services, takes place on the global infrastructure of the Internet. Only a small part of this infrastructure is located within the New Zealand’s territory. Google does not have data centres in New Zealand. Most (if not all) of Google’s contracts with New Zealand customers are concluded online on Google’s websites, where forms are submitted electronically and online payments are made. Most (if not all) of these websites are located on web servers outside New Zealand. As a result, the business profits of Google from sales of digital products to customers in New Zealand may escape taxation in New Zealand in cases when sales are automated. Thirdly, Google is a multinational firm. New Zealand taxes the business profits of foreign multinationals in accordance with the separate entity approach. In practice, the use of this approach means that even if Google would sell some of its Internet advertising services through its subsidiary in New Zealand, Google will still be able to allocate most of its profits from these sales to one of its subsidiaries incorporated in a low or no tax jurisdiction that holds the intellectual property (IP) assets of Google. 56 Today, it is the firm’s Irish/Bermudian subsidiary Google Ireland Holdings that holds these assets for Google. 57 After 1 January 2020, the ‘Irish ingredient’ in the ‘Double Irish’ scheme that Google and many other global matchmakers use to minimise tax will likely to be replaced with another one. 58 Even if Google 56 See OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[275 - 276\] at 97. 57 For an overview of the Google tax planning scheme, see OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 171-175.

Since 1 January 2015 all new firms incorporated in Ireland are considered to be tax residents of Ireland with the single exception being firms that are regarded as tax residents of another state under a double taxation treaty with Ireland. The amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 have effect from 1 January 2015 for new firms and those firms that did not use the ‘Double Irish’ scheme. For other firms the scheme remains valid until 31 December 2020. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 15 abandon the entire scheme that it uses for cross-border profit shifting, it is unlikely that the firm will ‘return’ its IP assets back to a parent company or allocate these assets proportionally among all its foreign subsidiaries. Transfer pricing rules allow Google to distinguish its sales activities from production activities and thereby claim that the process of production takes place overseas and that production involves the use of IP assets held by various foreign subsidiaries of Google. As a result, only a tiny fraction (and likely only a fraction related to one per cent of sales of Internet advertising in New Zealand) will be allocated to a New Zealand Google subsidiary (if this subsidiary entered into contracts with customers in New Zealand). Finally, the ability of Google to avoid paying tax on income in many countries where its customers are located is connected to the very structure of the Google’s business. The Google segment is a multisided platform business with money and subsidy sides. 59 The Google multisided platform operates in many countries and, therefore, can be appropriately referred as ‘global’. When a multisided platform has both money and subsidy sides, customers on one side may provide resources (e.g. attention) for the production of products for customers on another side of the platform (e.g. advertisers), while the second group of customers may subsidise the production of economic products for customers on the first side (e.g. in exchange for their attention to advertisements placed on a search web platform Internet users can use certain services provided by the platform for free). 60 The value produced through a multisided platform is the result of co-participation of the firm’s customers and the firm in a single value-generation process. However, this co-participation is not considered relevant for tax purposes. Google generates significant income on the money side of its global multisided platform from Internet advertising, but receives no income from many of the digital services (e.g. search and maps) that the firm provides to its customers ‘for free’ as an integral part of its global See Ireland, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, s 23A (as amended by Ireland Finance Act 2014 No. 37 of 23 December 2014, s 43 (1)); see also Jesse Drucker, “Double Irish’s Slow Death Leaves Google Executives Calm” (The Bloomberg 15 October 2014) available at <http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10- 14/double-irish-s-slow-death-leaves-google-executives-calm>. 59 For more detail see sections 3.2-3.3 in Victoria Plekhanova, Global Matchmakers: Tax Challenges and Responses in the Digital Economy, Doctoral Thesis (University of Auckland 2017). 60 Ibid.

Expenses related to the production of these ‘free’ digital services are usually not specified in the firm’s annual reports and usually are attributed to research and development, sales and marketing or ‘platform maintenance’ activities of the firm and its subsidiaries. 61 The firm compensates its subsidiaries for the provision of research and development, sales and marketing and other services related to the operation of global multisided platform. This compensation is conducted through intra-group transactions between the firm’s subsidiaries and computed on the cost plus basis. 62 The ‘plus’ element of this compensation or “the cost plus mark up” 63 is supposed to be determined under the arm’s length principle. 64 However, the uniqueness of services provided and, as a result, the lack of comparable prices, make the size of this service fee almost impossible to justify under the arm’s length principle. 65 As a result, Google can legitimately avoid paying a substantial fee to its subsidiaries involved in research and development or sales and marketing activities. Many of these subsidiaries are located in high tax jurisdictions. 66 Google does not divide its global income among all of its entities (whether subsidiaries or PEs), despite the entities being integrated parts of a single business and participants in a single integrated production and sales process that is Google’s global multisided platform operation. The firm allocates almost all of the income from its profit-generating activities earned outside 61 For instance, see Alphabet Inc, Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (form 10-K) for the Fiscal Year Ended on December 31 (2016) <https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/ 20161231\_alphabet\_10K.pdf> accessed 10 February 2017; Alphabet Inc and Google Inc, Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (form 10-K) for the Fiscal Year Ended on December 31 (2015) <https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/20151231\_ alphabet\_10K.pdf> accessed 18 May 2016. 62 Cost plus method in OECD, Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (Paris, 10 July 2017) at 26, 11-115. 63 Cost plus mark-up is measured by reference to margins computed after all costs incurred by a supplier in a transaction, see OECD, Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (Paris, 10 July 2017) at 26, 11-115. 64 The arm’s length principle is premised on comparison of prices of intra-group transactions with market prices. See OECD, “Chapter 1: The Arm’s Length Principle” in OECD, Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (Paris, 10 July 2017). 65 For an overview of criticism of the arm’s length principle and transfer pricing rules, see Lorraine Eden, “The Arm’s Length Standard: Making It Work in a 21st-Century World of Multinationals and Nation States” in Thomas Pogge and Krishen Mehta (eds), Global Tax Fairness (Oxford University Press 2016) at 154-156. 66 Google subsidiaries conducting research and development and sales and marketing activities in the Asia- Pacific region are located in Auckland, Bangalore, Bangkok, Beijing, Changhua County, Guangzhou, Gurgaon, Hong Kong, Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Mumbai, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo <https://careers.google.com/locations/> accessed 6 March 2018. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 17 of its home country (the United States) to the firm’s foreign subsidiaries in Ireland (Google Ireland Ltd) and Singapore (Google Asia Pte Ltd). These foreign subsidiaries are located in well-known low tax jurisdictions. Therefore, the arrangements between entities that make up Alphabet’s Google segment, which participate in the production and sale of services to customers and businesses in New Zealand and other countries, are tax-driven. The international tax regime, however, has no rules specifically addressing production and value creation through the use of a multisided platform operating across many countries. The regime was designed when this form of business organisation did not exist, let alone operate on a worldwide scale. The lack of national and international rules addressing the special features of global multisided platforms allows Google to legitimately separate the subsidy side of its multisided platform from the money side. The profits derived from the money side can, therefore, be allocated to a few entities within the firm (Google Inc and its subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions 67 ), while costs generated on the subsidy side are left with other entities of the firm and compensated by Google Inc and its Irish and Singaporean subsidiaries on a cost basis from revenues generated. In sum, the tax challenges for New Zealand, as a market state for Internet advertising and digital intermediation services and digital products are two-fold. Firstly, the business profits of Google are not attributable to a local PE because the nexus required for this attribution is based on a physical presence standard. Internet advertising and digital intermediation services do not require production, marketing, shipping or storage activities related to these services to be conducted by people physically present within the market state’s territory. Sales of digital products also do not require physical presence of a sales person in a market state. Most of activities related to production and sales of digital services and products are conducted at many sites on the global Internet infrastructure. Many of these activities are automated. These activities are ‘physical’ but not in a sense of ‘physical presence’ required for the tax nexus purpose developed in the framework of the current international tax regime. Secondly, New Zealand, as a market state for Google services and digital products it sells via its web platforms, cannot effectively control the allocation of business profits to subsidiaries 67 Google Ireland Ltd is incorporated in Ireland. Google Asia Pte Ltd is incorporated in Singapore. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 18 of the firm in New Zealand. This is because the transfer pricing rules and the separate entity approach upon which these rules are based allow Google and other multinational firms to disconnect their income-generating activities from their cost-generating activities and locate mobile assets, such as IP, in low and no tax jurisdictions. This disconnection, in particular, has the consequence (and will continue to have the consequence) that New Zealand will have the ability to tax only a tiny fraction of Google’s business profits generated from New Zealand. 5.0 THE BILL New Zealand was a slow starter, but is now set to introduce some unilateral anti-BEPS measures with the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill. 68 As an OECD member, New Zealand tries to follow the OECD’s guidance on international tax policy. 69 The difficulty, however, is that the guidance that has been provided in the framework of the BEPS project does not solve (or even address) the tax challenges that New Zealand faces in dealing with Google and the other global matchmakers supplying Internet advertising and digital intermediation services to customers in New Zealand. This is because the underlying model that the international tax regime applies for the allocation of business profits to entities of a multinational firm remains unchanged. The dynamics of the BEPS project 70 means that the OECD is unlikely recommend the replacement of the separate entity approach with its only alternative - the unitary combination and formula apportionment method as a basis for international allocation of 68 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill 2017 (3-1). 69 See, for instance, New Zealand, The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, Explanatory Note <http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2017/0003/latest/whole.html#DLM7505936> accessed 2 January 2018. 70 OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2014 Deliverable, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (16 September 2014) at 143-148; OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 107-117, 147-148, 276-283; OECD, “Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status”, Action 7: Final Report 2015, OECD/G20 (5 October 2015) at 15-44; OECD, “Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties”, Action 15: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015); Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Paris, 7 June 2017); OECD, “Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting”, Action 13: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015); OECD, “Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation”, Actions 8-10: 2015 Final Reports, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015).

Whether or not the OECD would ever recommend the replacement of a physical presence standard for the tax nexus with an economic presence standard that would be applied to the business profits generated in the digital economy it is hard to say at this point. 72 This uncertainty, together with the concerns of market states about base eroding activities of multinationals and a lack of coordinated solution to the tax challenges in the digital economy, 73 has triggered a wave of unilateral responses to these challenges across the globe. 74 The United States has substantially contributed to the modesty of the OECD recommendations 75 and the resulting tax unilateralism in many countries. The United States is the headquarters of most of the largest global matchmakers. Twenty out of the top thirty 71 Under the unitary combination with formula apportionment method a firm with a group structure is treated as a single taxpayer. The business income of this taxpayer (and expenditures related to this income) are combined into a single tax base and divided among tax jurisdictions under a formula. The unitary combination with formula apportionment method is applied by some countries (e.g. the United States and Canada) at the sub-federal level.

DRAFT, 29 April 2018 22 the home country of Google and many other global matchmakers – the United States - has refused to sign the MLI, 89 and many countries that signed the MLI have elected not to apply its Article 12 to their own DTAs, the MLI is an instrument with a very limited scope. The MLI does not treat a multinational firm is a single tax entity. As a result, multinationals can avoid tax nexus implications of the MLI by operating through subsidiaries incorporated in countries that have not signed the MLI or chose not to apply Article 12 of the MLI to their DTAs. For instance, in New Zealand Google sells its services there through its Irish and Singaporean subsidiaries. Both Ireland 90 and Singapore 91 elected for Article 12 not to apply to DTAs of these countries covered by the MLI. Therefore, even if the United States would sign the MLI and made no reservations in relation to its Article 12, it would not result in a tax nexus under Article 12 of the MLI between New Zealand and the business profits of Irish and Singaporean subsidiaries of Google. A market country needs tax legislation that would establish a tax nexus with business profits when the MLI cannot be applied. It is also make sense to change a meaning of ‘presence’ required for the purpose of this nexus, if a market country wish to respond to the tax challenges of digitalisation of the global economy. The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill tries to overcome both difficulties by broadening the PE rules of the MLI and extending these broad rules to firms incorporated in countries that are not parties to the MLI or countries that elected not to apply Article 12 of the MLI to their own DTAs. The Bill contains a modified version of the PE concept. Under this provision, the concept of a PE is expanded so that a foreign supplier would be deemed to have a PE in New Zealand if there is a person acting in New Zealand on behalf of this foreign supplier and in doing so this person “habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise”. 92 89 See Signatories and Parties of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Paris, 7 June 2017) <http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/beps-mli- signatories-and-parties.pdf> accessed 1 September 2017. 90 Ireland, Status of List of Reservations and Notifications at the Time of Signature of the MLI at 30, available at < http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/beps-mli-position-ireland.pdf>. 91 Singapore, Status of List of Reservations and Notifications at the Time of Signature of the MLI at 20, available at <http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/beps-mli-position-singapore.pdf>. 92 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, schedule 23, para 8 (a). DRAFT, 29 April 2018 23 This modified PE concept would be in line with the amendments to paragraph 5 of Article 5 of the OECD Model Tax Convention and paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the MLI. Clause 34 of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, however, further broadens the meaning of physical presence required for the tax nexus purpose. This clause proposes the insertion of s GB 54 into the Income Tax Act 2007, which means that New Zealand would have a right to tax the business income of a foreign firm from the cross-border direct supply of goods and services to customers in New Zealand when this supply was facilitated in New Zealand. 93 93 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, clause 34: After section GB 53, insert: Arrangements involving establishments and non-resident businesses GB 54 Arrangements involving establishments When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) a non-resident makes, under an arrangement, a supply (the facilitated supply) that is of goods or services to— (i) a person in New Zealand (the recipient): (ii)a person in New Zealand (the intermediary), who makes under the arrangement a supply of the goods or services to another person in New Zealand (the recipient); and (b) a person (the facilitator), who is not an intermediary for the facilitated supply, carries out in New Zealand under the arrangement an activity for the purpose of bringing about the facilitated supply to the recipient; and (c) the facilitator— (i) is associated with the non-resident: (ii) derives 80% or more of the facilitator’s assessable income from services provided to the non- resident or to persons associated with the non-resident; and (d) the activity is more than preparatory or auxiliary to making the facilitated supply; and (e) income of the non-resident from the facilitated supply is not within the scope of a double tax agreement that— (i) incorporates article 12(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting: (ii) includes a provision having a scope equal to or greater than the scope of the article referred to in subparagraph (i) and being negotiated after 7 June 2017; and (f) section YD 4B(3) (Meaning of permanent establishment) does not determine whether the non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand; and (g) income of the non-resident from the supply is not attributable, other than under this section, to a permanent establishment in New Zealand of the non-resident; and (h) the arrangement has a purpose of affecting the imposition on the non-resident of income tax, or of income tax and the income tax of a country or territory other than New Zealand, by directly or indirectly— (i) altering the incidence of income tax: (ii) relieving a person from liability to pay income tax or from a potential or prospective liability to future income tax: DRAFT, 29 April 2018 24 The ability of states to deal effectively with the fiscal absence of global matchmakers is very limited, in particular because physical presence of these firms in a market state required for the tax nexus purpose can be avoided. 94 If a meaning of ‘physical presence’ remains substantially unchanged, tax implications of anti-BEPS measures of market states that force large multinationals to change their business arrangements and conduct sales in these states countries through own local subsidiaries may be fruitless, as the experience of Australia and the United Kingdom has demonstrated. The United Kingdom introduced the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) 95 and Australia introduced its Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) 96 and some form of the DPT. 97 The purpose of the DPT was a discouragement of large multinationals from selling goods and services to local customers through own foreign subsidiaries. 98 Australian media have found the fiscal outcome of anti-BEPS tax reforms on Google disappointing. 99 Similarly, the Government of the United Kingdom has not been impressed with the size of (iii) avoiding, postponing, or reducing a liability to income tax or a potential or prospective liability to future income tax; and (i) the purpose is more than merely incidental; and (j) the non-resident, or a group of persons that include the non-resident, is a large multinational group. Income and activities attributed to permanent establishment (2) The non-resident is treated as having a permanent establishment in New Zealand— (a) through which the non-resident makes the facilitated supply in the course of a business carried on in New Zealand; and (b) to which activities of the facilitator referred to in subsection (1) (b) are attributed. 94 For a summary, see OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[309\] at 107. 95 Finance Act 2015 (UK). See also HM Revenue and Customs, “Diverted Profits Tax: Guidance” (30 November 2015). In the United Kingdom the Diverted Profits Tax is applied since 1 April 2015. 96 The MAAL came into effect on 11 December 2015. It applies to certain schemes on or after 1 January 2016, irrespective of when the scheme commenced, see Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Act 2015 (No 170) (Australia). 97 Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Act 2017 (No 27, 2017) and Diverted Profits Tax Act 2017 (No 21, 2017) (Australia). 98 For an overview of this type of anti-BEPS unilateral measures see OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[363-365\] at 147 - 148. 99 For instance, “Google and Facebook have reported only a third of their estimated Australian revenue under the first year of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Legislation, while slashing payments they made to their local operations for services. The two tech giants, which account for more than three-quarters of all online advertising in the world, reported a combined $1.2 billion in ad revenue from Australian clients, but lifted their combined pre-tax profits by only $77 million.

DRAFT, 29 April 2018 25 Google’s increased tax payments. 100 Clause 34 of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill pursues the same goal as the DPT. At the same time, the Bill does not substantially change the meaning of ‘physical presence’ required for the tax nexus between New Zealand and business profits of foreign firms. Therefore, the Bill will unlikely result in substantial increase of tax revenue collected from global matchmakers. Finally, the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, if enacted, would require New Zealand to change, terminate or override its DTAs, because some of proposed rules are not in line with commitments New Zealand has made in its DTAs, including DTAs with the United States, 101 Ireland 102 and Singapore. 103 If New Zealand choose to terminate its DTAs, New Zealand and its nationals would be left without important treaty benefits. In particular, a size of overall income tax liability of New Zealand residents in relation to income earned from sources in foreign countries can increase because limitations in relation to tax rates, tax base and specific tax relief provisions of terminated DTAs would not apply. Clause 34 of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill suggests that New Zealand is prepared to override its DTAs, at least in certain circumstances. Articles 26 and 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties makes clear that states have an obligation to implement their treaties in good faith. 104 However, the New Zealand Parliament has the power to override a treaty as a matter of New Zealand law, but not international law. The DTAs do not determine the consequences of overriding the treaty. However, a breach of one 100 United Kingdom, House of Commons, Public Accounts Committee. Corporate Tax Settlements.

By ignoring its DTA commitments, New Zealand will undermine its reputation as a reliable treaty partner and could make the country less attractive for foreign investment. A decrease in foreign investment inflows would likely to have a negative impact on economic growth in New Zealand. Moreover, New Zealand and its residents may also be harmed if other states that are party to DTAs with New Zealand do not see themselves as bound by the commitments made in their DTAs. Finally, an override of own DTAs could trigger a reciprocal response from other states. This response could be very harmful to the New Zealand economy if it would involve key trade partners of New Zealand. At the same time, even if the MLI was signed by all countries, including the United States, Ireland and Singapore, the MLI would not assist solving the tax base erosion problem in New Zealand or any other market state arising from cross-border direct sales of Internet advertising and digital intermediation services. 105 Neither does the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill. Therefore, tax problems discussed in section 4 of this article will remain even if the Bill is enacted. If New Zealand wish to ease eroding effects of these problems on its own tax base, the country would be better off looking for solutions that would not violate international commitments of New Zealand. 6.0 APPROVED ALTERNATIVE There are at least two non-tax options for New Zealand to gain more control over the taxation of global matchmakers and protect its tax base from erosion. However, none of these options is good from a perspective of economic efficiency. First, New Zealand potentially could close its markets to Google and other global matchmakers. However, by closing its national market New Zealand may cause much greater harm to its national economy than it suffers as a result of the tax avoidance by global matchmakers. Many local firms and individuals use global web platforms such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Trivago, Amazon Marketplace, Taobao, e-Bay, Uber, Apple iTunes and Google Play to offer services and products to potential customers in many countries. Many small stand-alone firms all over the world got their opportunity to enter 105 Moreover, it is estimated that the changes recommended under Action 7 will only be implemented in a fairly limited number of bilateral treaty relationships: see OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[272\] at 94-95. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 27 foreign markets, because their businesses were advertised through Google’s advertising network or on Facebook. According to Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) New Zealand: \[...\] advertising in New Zealand was worth 2.4% of GDP, or $6 billion in 2015. This is a significant economic contribution, roughly equivalent to what tourists spend in New Zealand every six months. Furthermore, the advertising industry is a significant employer. Over 44,000 jobs are supported by advertising in New Zealand, including over 12,000 people directly employed in advertising. 106 Secondly, New Zealand may force global matchmakers to change their business organisation and operate only through local subsidiaries. Chapter 14 of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), 107 now incorporated into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for a Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), 108 contains anti-localisation provisions for the e-commerce. 109 However, the number of participants of the TPP and the CPTPP is limited. For instance, the United States has not signed either the TPP or the CPTPP, which means New Zealand has no obligations to avoid anti-localisation treatment of American firms. Changes to the business organisation and the localisation of business may be especially harmful for the global matchmakers, because these firms reduce their costs and generate extra profits as a result of their ability to operate on a global scale. For instance, the productive efficiency of Google would be reduced if its business model had to be replicated in miniature in every state where the firm operates. If global matchmakers were de- globalised, network effects and advantages of economies of scale and scope could not be exploited at the global level, which would have a negative impact on the profitability, and potentially the viability, of these firms. Moreover, these firms may not be able to provide services that are valuable to their customers. For instance, in the case of Google, the global scale and structure of its multisided platform helps the firm to create a unique product – personalised Internet advertising services, which are produced and delivered over the global 106 IAB New Zealand “Advertising Pays - The Economic, Employment and Business Value of Advertising” (Blog Post of 7 June 2017) <https://www.iab.org.nz/news/advertising-pays-economic-employment-business- value-advertising/> accessed 3 October 2017. 107 Trans-Pacific Partnership (Atlanta, 5 October 2015). 108 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (Santiago, 8 March 2018). 109 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (Santiago, 8 March 2018), arts 14.4, 14. 10, 14. 11, 14.13. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 28 infrastructure of the Internet. Today many Internet users are very mobile and, therefore, may ‘leave digital traces’ in parts of the Internet infrastructure that belong to many different states. Accordingly, the localisation of Google’s global multisided platform could make the entire production of personalised Internet advertisements less effective. To collect personal data about Internet users and maintain the Internet users’ advertising profiles that the firm uses for the production of Internet advertising, Google must operate at the global scale and have access to the Internet infrastructure of as many countries as possible. Without operating on a global scale and using the global infrastructure of the Internet Google would not be able to access data from across the world. The quality of search services Google provides to Internet users could also be limited. The localisation of its business might also reduce the pace of innovation, and prevent customers having access to as many free services that currently provided by Google. Economic efficiency requires that the tax rules to be structured in a way that does not encourage inefficient forms of business organisation. At the same time, the is a need for New Zealand to protect national tax base from erosion. To avoid economic inefficiencies and welfare losses nationally and globally, and at the same time, to be able to collect fair amount of tax revenue from global matchmakers, New Zealand could follow the implicit recommendations made by the OECD in its Interim report on the tax challenges arising from digitalisation (Interim Digitisation Report). 110 The Interim Digitisation Report, which is a part of the BEPS project, 111 reveals that a number of fundamental political shifts have occurred since the Final BEPS Report was issued in October 2015. 112 First, the Interim Digitisation Report recognises that the modifications to the definition of a PE and improvements of transfer pricing rules made in the framework of 110 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018). The final report on the implications of digitalisation for taxation due in 2020: see OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 13. 111 The final report on the implications of digitalisation for taxation is due in 2020: see OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 13. 112 OECD, Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015). DRAFT, 29 April 2018 29 the BEPS project 113 may not solve “broader tax challenges in the digital economy”. 114 Secondly, the ‘not ring-fencing the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes’ 115 and ‘fitting into existing rules’ objectives have become a call for ‘revaluation of existing rules’ and possible development of fundamentally new rules for both traditional and digital economies. 116 Thirdly, the Interim Digitisation Report reflects the view, shared by many states, that the digitalisation of economy has changed the division of gains among states under the international tax regime. 117 This outcome substantially defers from that which many states would have expected in the non-digitalised economy. A new consensus on how the gains in the digitalised economy should be divided is required. Finally, the OECD has tried to coordinate the unilateral responses of states to the tax challenges arising in the digitalised economy. 118 In this regard, the OECD has discussed the possibility of an excise tax that could be implemented by states as an interim measure. 119 Although no recommendations in relation to the implementation of such a tax have been made, the detailed analysis of how an excise tax could be used made in the Interim report provides significant guidance for those states looking to protect their national tax bases from erosion caused by global matchmakers like Google. The European Union may regard the implicit endorsement of an excise tax in the Interim Report as a political triumph. In September 2017, the European Commission stated if there 113 OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 148 \[383\] and 144-146 \[368-375\]. 114 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[255, 259\] at 90 - 91. “Broader tax challenges in the digital economy” are related to nexus, data, and characterisation of income for the purpose of direct tax: see OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 146-147 \[376-380\]. 115 OECD, “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy”, Action 1: 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (5 October 2015) at 11, 54 \[115\] and 142 \[364\]. 116 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[379 - 397\] at 160 -173. 117 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[312\] at 108.

In addition to that, New Zealand would be able to collect tax revenue from digital intermediation services that foreign global matchmakers provide to customers in New Zealand. For instance, the profit from commission paid by hotels, car drivers, web apps and content developers to foreign global matchmakers in New Zealand, would be subject to excise tax in New Zealand. With a careful tax design, services that global matchmakers provide to advertising agencies in New Zealand (i.e. access to advertising network and advertising exchange platforms) would also fall under the category of digital intermediation services. An excise tax is not a substitution to an income tax. If there was a tax nexus with the business profits of global matchmakers recognised under statutory or (when applied) treaty rules of New Zealand, New Zealand would be able to collect income tax revenue form these global matchmakers in addition to excise tax levied on the profits margin from these services. 7.0 CONCLUSION Using the example of Google, this article draws attention to a growing gap between the economic presence of foreign global matchmakers in New Zealand and the tax outcomes of this presence for New Zealand. The article analysed key anti-BEPS measures proposed in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, which would modify the required 136 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[462-463\] at 190. 137 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[412\] at 180- 181. 138 OECD, “Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation”, BEPS Interim Report (Paris, 16 March 2018) \[412, 432- 426\] at 180, 184 – 185. DRAFT, 29 April 2018 33 tax nexus with the business profits. It concluded these measures may not be effective, if the global matchmakers continued operating in New Zealand ‘remotely’ and did not allocate income from sales conducted with customers in New Zealand to subsidiaries incorporated in New Zealand. The article argues that, until a coordinated solution is developed in the framework of the BEPS project, New Zealand would benefit from introduction of an excise tax as an interim and additional measure that could protect the national tax base from erosion caused by global matchmakers.

Submission to Tax Working Group These are the tax changes that Id like to see: A Carbon Tax The climate disruption that is happening from global warming is the biggest and most urgent crisis facing us. We have done nothing about it as a country for over a decade and we now lag way behind many other countries, especially Europe, where the transition from fossil fuels to renewables has been moving fast. I understand that the Tax Reform Working Group may not address this as it may be addressed in the separate process of the establishment of the Climate Commission, but I just want to shout it out everywhere – GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE URGENT ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE! I support the 2017 election policy of the Green Party on a carbon tax – one that will effectively remove the incentives to produce or use fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and support the fast, innovative development of renewable sources of energy and more efficiency in our energy use. A progressive tax system I support reform of the tax system so that the wealthy pay more than they are paying now, and the poor don’t pay as much. The growing economic disparity between rich and poor in NZ over the past 35 years has resulted in a widening social, moral and psychological gap between people which is destructive on many levels. I support the type and degree of changes to the tax rates for different income levels that the Green Party proposed during the 2017 election campaign. I understand (though am not sure) that the Working Group is unable to recommend changes to levels of tax, but I think that moving to a strongly progressive tax rate system is a fundamental change to the system that is urgently needed. It would remove the need for a lot of tinkering with other policies, and would work to lessen socio-economic disparities. As a principle, I believe that targeted benefits and services are inefficient as well as demeaning and lending themselves to punitive implementation. It is more administratively efficient as well as less punitive towards disadvantaged people to have universal benefits complemented by strongly progressive taxation. National Superannuation is an example of a good universal benefit that is adjusted by taxation. A Capital Gains Tax I support a Capital gains Tax on property (excluding the family home). It seems obvious to a layperson that such a tax would remove the financial incentive for ordinary people to make extra money at the expense of those who can’t afford to do other than rent. Example – I worked with a woman in her 50s who, with her partner, was on a good wage (maybe $200,000 pa between them). They worked very hard for their wages but their kids had left home & they didn’t have much else to do with it so they invested in rentals, almost as a hobby. This is in Chch where houses have been scarce and rents astronomical post-quake and people in my suburb are living in cars and garages. But why would this couple not charge the going rent? If they didn’t, they would have less for their retirement savings, plus get more difficult tenants who couldn’t find places elsewhere. So an ordinary hardworking couple had a huge incentive to make megabucks at the expense of those unable to afford to buy a house. This is a vicious cycle that adds hugely to the growing gap between rich & poor. Even my more rightwing workmates could see the unfairness of this housing set-up and thought a capital gains tax would solve it! A Financial Transaction Tax (versus GST) I support a financial transaction tax. From what I have read/heard at workshops this sounds like a doable means of reducing speculation without overly affecting people on lower incomes. Maybe this could replace GST, which is a regressive tax in that it affects those on lower incomes more than those on higher incomes. A Sugary Drinks Tax As a retired health planner I think that any moves to reduce consumption of sugar will benefit the health of New Zealanders as we face the growing diabetes and obesity epidemic. Tax on alcohol and cigarettes is a proven effective way of reducing consumption of these products, so worth a go with sugar.

Tax Working Group submission Summary The current tax system – in combinaton ith eelare beneft abatement rates and the casuaeised eabour market – creates a poverty trap. Depending on the number of income hours worked, people can be financiallr worse of than on welfare parments alone, poteniallr experiencing oveer c0000 ‘ttaxaion’ on their oveerall income. This poveertr trap means a working person in casual minimum-wage emplorment, who is reliant on welfare parments for part of their income, needs to be ideaeey empeoyed bet een 4 to 12 hours a eek to be fnanciaeey beter oe, and mar otherwise havee their oveerall income reduced br a greater amount than ther earn, while also incurring emplorment expenses – such as traveel costs, uniform laundrr, clothing, shoes, equipment, make-up for presentaion. Ther iee not retain any increase in their overaee income unte they are nearey in luee-tme empeoyment – approximatelr 28-300 hours per week. This leveel of income is seveerelr restricivee for people who must run a household on part-ime income alone due to personal circumstances, and exacerbates negaivee outcomes for people in certain demographics. Changes to tax setngs could greatlr improvee liveing standards for those in lower income deciles, reduce inequalitr, and improvee social mobilitr. Main points This is because tax rates for low-income people are: •17% personae income tax + 12% student eoan + 3% Ki isaver = totalling 32 tax deducion – though with casual labour rates including holidar par could efeciveelr be 30.5% income tax. •With no weeklr income, a low-income person would be eligible for Temporarr Addiional upport (TA ), to coveer the high accommodaion costs which are now ‘tnormal’ in the urban areas where emplorment opportuniies are. There has been a stark rise in housing costs oveer the last decade, although the accommodaion supplement has remained staic, resuling in increased hardship and food poveertr (Treasurr reluctant to increase the accommodaion supplement due to perceiveed ‘tlandlord capture’). For example - $37 TA parment on $2400 per week rent. •If the person has eess than 4 hours empeoyment a eek they iee be orse oe fnanciaeey than on welfare alone, as ther will lose enitlement to the TA parment. For example – a single 3 hour shif, minimum wage casual contract, $c6.500×3 hours minus 300.5 income tax = $34.400 net, minus traveel costs $5.500, therefore $28.900. •Once the person works more than 5.75 hours minimum wage ($5,20000 annual income threshold, triggering deducions afer $96 per week), the overaee income deductons amount to over 60%. The main Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) parment is abated at 300 cents in the dollar, plus 300.5 income tax, and the person will also incur emplorment-related expenses such as traveel costs. •Once the person works more than 12.25 hours, the overaee deducton coued be more than 100%. Ther trigger the next WINZ income threshold ($c00,40000 annual, $20000 per week), resuling in 700 cents abatement in the dollar – while also paring 300 income tax, and incurring emplorment expenses. Tax Working Group Submission April 2018 | Page c •Working bet een 12-28 hours on minimum age, the person may not receive any fnanciae improvement in their circumstances and incur expenses greater than income earned – ther are efeciveelr working for WINZ parment ‘tclawback’. This high leveel of income reducion was confirmed in a quesion to parliament regarding abatement rates – that oveer a certain number of hours, someone mar efeciveelr earn onlr $c per hour, while also incurring emplorment-related expenses to meet those work commitments. The intersecion of goveernment economic policr setngs – paricularlr around tax, welfare, the labour market, educaion, and housing – contributes to poveertr and reduces social mobilitr for those alreadr negaiveelr impacted br structural inequalitr. For example: • ingle people mar need to relr on part-ime income to run a household – the poveertr rates for single-adult households are onlr marginallr beter than child poveertr rates. •Women mar need to work part-ime due to child or other care commitments. •People mar need to work part-ime onlr due to health reasons – the welfare srstem does not support people to not work just because ther havee health issues. •Mature workers mar need to retrain for emplorment, so onlr work part-ime while meeing studr commitments. •The WINZ income abatement srstem is not well suited to the characterisics of shif-work or the casual emplorment arrangements trpical for the ‘tworking poor’. For example, income must be declared each week BEFORE Fridar 6PM eveen though the income week includes aturdar and undar. It is veerr easr to incur an ‘toveerparment’ for undeclared income, automaicallr triggering debt reparments which are automaicallr recoveered at $c00.500 per week. If someone is unable to aford the weeklr debt reparment amounts – which most likelr will come out of moner needed for groceries within a restricted budget – there are obstacles, such as a two-week wait for an appointment and securitr guards restricing access. Weeklr debt reparment amounts can onlr be reduced in an appointment with a client ofcer in a WINZ ofce. •Increases in the minimum wage mar not necessarilr improvee the personal financial circumstances of a person in part-ime work. The WINZ income abatement thresholds remain unchanged and so anr extra income earned is captured br WINZ parment deducions. •Emplorers, in a casualised labour market, mar consider ther havee no obligaion to proveide emplorees with a sustainable standard of liveing – ther determine emplorment as a casual onlr “take it or leavee it’ contract arrangement. An emploree mar havee litle choice or control oveer the number of hours ther can work. Although it might seem ‘teconomicallr raional’ to not work if for no oveerall gain, it mar be imperaivee to work the hours ofered to retain good will with rour emplorer. •Emplorees who undertake educaion to improvee emplorment prospects mar sill be negaiveelr afected br underemplorment, discriminatorr emplorment pracices, and a globalised emplorment market which emplorers can easilr access for ‘tskills shortages’, rather than inveesing in internal staf training. Emplorees par the cost of retraining, poteniallr through student loan reparment tax, and there is no ‘tguaranteed’ professional emplorment upon graduaion. Graduate underemplorment is an increasing global trend, as is the ‘tgig economr’ where career progression is non-existent. For Tax Working Group Submission April 2018 | Page 2 example, being able to bur student textbooks online at a cheaper price was one of the few examples of the market srstem working in mr faveour when I was a student, and so closing this tax ‘tloop-hole’ is an economic decision that would havee socio-economic class impacts. •The housing market appears to be currentlr set to faveour middle-class propertr inveestors who want to increase their personal wealth base – but steep housing costs create food poveertr and hardship for those reliant on low-income wages and an insecure labour market. Recommendations c.Change income tax poeicy to create sociae mobieity out ol the poverty trap and minimum decent eiving standards lor aee Ne Zeaeanders. o, for example, that people in the lower income decile range are not negaiveelr penalised for working addiional hours. People should not be worse of financiallr when ther work – especiallr if ther are near the botom of the income distribuion. ocial mobilitr will allow people to movee upward into the middle income deciles where ther will par more income tax in the future. 2.Assist eo -income peopee ith a GST exempton on lood (preferablr fruit and veegetables, and healthr food howeveer that is defined br public health experts), and some services – for example, medical and dental serveices, optometrists. 3.Use the tax system to make housing more aeordabee lor Ne Zeaeanders – paricularlr for people who are long-term renters or first home burers. Consider a capital gains tax, or some other tax measure that could ameliorate the negaivee impacts of rising house prices from propertr speculaion and foreign inveestment. c.Dis-inceniveise, paricularlr where wealthr foreign inveestment companies are using the propertr and rental market as a war of moveing wealth around the global financial srstem. 2.Being a landlord is a business, proveiding an accommodaion serveice with the intent of earning a profit and increasing rour personal/familr wealth base. But this legiimate ‘tbusiness’ right should not oveer-ride the right of low-income people to afordable accommodaion or protecion from food poveertr, perhaps where low-income working people are forced to make a choice between becoming homeless or household heaing and an adequate weeklr grocerr bill. 4.If possible, make changes in the tax srstem that will protect Ne Zeaeanders lrom potentae luture negatve impacts ol a changing geobae eabour market.

To: Tax Working Group From: David Thorp Submission For a fair and comprehensive tax system The New Zealand tax system needs more than a tweak and it is therefore unfortunate that some specific necessary changes are proscribed by the working group’s terms of reference. My submission however assumes no constraints and posits a tax system that represents an ideal for which to aim. A more comprehensively fair tax system would see the following changes:  capital gains taxed as income;  estate transfers taxed (on death or gift);  the income tax scale made more progressive;  the regressive goods and services tax reduced to 12.5%, without exemptions; and  a wealth tax introduced, or at least a land tax. An ideal tax system An ideal tax system has three essential components: income tax, estate tax and wealth tax. These three taxes are all progressive and play distinct and complementary roles. Tax on income (that includes capital gains) I am proposing that the income tax be made more comprehensive by including all income flowing from the investment of capital assets, including capital gains. Recognising that capital gains are income and should be taxed accordingly reflects the reality and puts an end to the unjustifiable preference given to unearned income over earned income. Realised capital gains would be treated as income, after adjustment for inflation, with losses allowed, ring- fenced and capped. If the “family home” is to be exempt from taxing capital gains, the exemption should however be capped, at say $1.5 million. The income tax scale should be more progressive, with at least one higher rate added: say 50% on incomes over $150,000. A more steeply progressive income tax scale also has the effect of reducing the after-tax payments of New Zealand Superannuation to those on higher aggregate incomes. Corporate profits are (progressively) taxed as income in the hands of individuals and company tax therefore need not be made progressive. New Zealand should not join a destructive competition for low tax rates. Tax on inheritance A progressive tax should be introduced on the transfer of estates, on death or gift. There is a significant concentration of wealth that on transfer represents “unearned income”. Tax on wealth A wealth tax is required to stop the continuing and unlimited concentration of wealth and its potentially destabilising effects. The working group’s background paper shows a high concentration of wealth with the top quintile but pays no attention to redressing this. It states that: “Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid-1990s but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income.” No case is made for a wealth tax, although a land tax would address an element of wealth concentration. A wealth tax should at least be signalled for the future while interim measures should include a land tax, which it is noted can be easily implemented. While nearly every developed country taxes real estate, only local body rates are levied on real estate in New Zealand. Until a wealth tax can be introduced, New Zealand should at least implement a land tax and probably stamp duty on transactions to make best use of this finite resource and to help regulate real estate prices. Thomas Piketty in Capital in the 21 st Century insists that a wealth tax is an essential part of the ideal tax system and: “The primary purpose of a tax on capital is not to finance the social state but to regulate capitalism. The goal is first to stop the indefinite increase in the inequality of wealth and, second, to impose effective regulation on the financial and banking system to avoid crises.” Tax on wealth levied annually might be: 0% on aggregate capital assets up to $2 million in value; 1% on $2 to 10 million; and 2% above $10 to $20 million. Tax on goods and services The goods and services tax should be reduced to 12.5%. This would reduce the burden on those on lower incomes, reduce the case for exemptions from this tax, and reduce the revenue importance of this regressive tax. Progressive tax scales Progressive taxes were a major innovation of the 20 th century and played a key role in the reduction in inequality, until the 1980s. Progressive taxes are a crucial component of the social state and represent an ideal compromise between social justice and individual freedom. Unfortunately, today, the progressive tax is seriously threatened by international tax competition. But New Zealand should not join the race to the bottom. A more steeply progressive tax system is indispensable for making sure that everyone benefits from globalisation and to encourage support for the globalised economy. The globalised economy The globalised economy means that capital increasingly moves, and investments are made across national borders. Capital is held in tax havens to avoid tax and the transparency of capital movements is limited. Multinational corporations exploit tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions to channel their profits and they pay little or no tax. New Zealand should continue aggressively to seek international transparency of capital flows and the full taxing of corporates in the countries where they do business. David Thorp 29 April 2018

Introduction Firstly let me compliment those who compiled the documentation the accompanied the invitation for submission. In particular the identification of the challenges, risks, and opportunities. The documents identify the problem of the non-collection of a fair tax from multi-nationals and offshore companies carrying out business in NZ. I would draw attention to: 1.the competitive disadvantage this is to NZ businesses due to the greater tax burden they carry as a result; 2.the resulting increased burden on all taxpayers This submission presents a restructured approach to tax in NZ rather than applying issue specific “Band-Aids” to the current system Specifically, it: 1.Provides a comprehensive, internally and externally consistent tax system that addresses the current challenges with a future proof solution; 2.Builds on existing tax mechanisms; 3.Provides a simple, robust and cost effective approach. This submission is at a high level, intended only to outline the concepts. Should the Working Group be interested in exploring the proposal in any detail I will be happy to provide further material or discuss the submission. 3. Response to specific challenges - Don’t tinker The Government has directed the Tax Working Group to advise on a number of specific challenges: A capital gains tax. A progressive company tax. Environmental taxation. Assist low-income groups by introducing GST exemptions. Unfortunately the approach implicit in the above ‘specific challenges’ instruction is one of tinkering with the existing tax system rather than re- thinking it and making it truly fit for purpose and future proof. Addressing ‘specific challenges’ through one off tax tweaks produces: 1.A cumbersome, often internally inconsistent, difficult to manage system, benefitting only the tax advisors; 2.Distortions in the economy, usually with unpredicted (not necessarily unexpected) effects. 3.Latent problems which will require further patches to fix. The proposed tax system addresses all the considerations underlying the above specific challenges and does so with a composite, internally and externally consistent simple tax system; intended to stand the test of time. 4. Overview of proposed tax system It is proposed that a tax system be implemented with three primary tax vehicles, which all have their roots in the present tax system: 1.CGST, an extension of GST to a broader tax collected: i.As a fixed percentage from the payor on any and all payments. If money changes hands it pays CGST; ii.On a cumulative basis, not as net/value-added like GST. 2.Company income levies (CILs) collected as a percentage of income, not profit, specified by industry group and progressive with income levels. 3.Personal income levies (PILs) collected as a percentage based on progressive income levels for all payees (recipients). The proposed collection mechanism is simple. 1.All CGST and CIL/PIL levies are collected by the transacting banks. 2.Monies (including cash) payments out of the NZ banking system are not exempt from ‘income’ levies, except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. 3.Offshore, internet and multinational companies not registered in NZ for tax purposes are not exempt from revenue levies except these are collected from the payor together with CGST. Tax revenue is based on monies paid and received rather than the traditional ‘earnings’ or ‘profit’, devices which are being rendered unreliable in the changing business environment. 5. Relative share of tax revenue It is envisaged that the relative portion of tax revenue will shift as follows: 1.CGST will become the largest contributor estimated to rise to >50% of tax revenue. i.Estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and most likely below 4% ii.CGST. Although a lower percentage than GST it contributes a greater amount due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, financial transactions, FOREX, share & gig economy etc. b.Being cumulative rather than net/value-added. 2.Company Income Levies (CILs) are estimated to still contribute around 17.5% i.While total dollar amount is up, NZ registered business pay a lower tax rate 3.Personal Income Levies (PILs) are estimated to contribute around 25% i.Shift in emphasis to CGST ii.No levies on low income groups (subsidised via WINZ) 6. Primary benefit targets of proposed system The proposed system is modelled to target six specific areas: 1.Reduction in poverty, specifically child poverty, by reducing the tax burden thereby increasing the disposable income of low income families. 2.Eliminating the present system’s competitive bias against NZ based businesses. 3.Sharing the NZ tax burden with offshore entities by eliminating international e- businesses avoiding tax in NZ. 4.Improving the attractiveness of investment in NZ through low taxes, encouraging retention of money in NZ and fully taxing offshore entities. 5.Simplified and comprehensive tax gathering, avoiding “Band-Aid” taxes, with an all encompassing tax structure and tax collection by the banks. 6.A future proof system. The proposed system is cost effective for IRD and tax payers. The banks will whine but have the ability to deliver as they have can already levy charges on transactions. The cost to the government of bank collections should be nil. 7. Summary of response to extended list of challenges, risks, and opportunities Challenges, risks, and opportunitiesComment Reduces poverty, improves standard of livingIncreases lower income group disposable income Provides for demographic changes Personal levies for superannuation (Kiwisaver) health etc. and potential for means testing user pays services Competitive with falling international business tax rates Reduces tax for NZ tax registered business. Current bias against NZ based/owned businesses Increases tax take from multi-nationals & offshore, improves NZ business competitiveness Current excessive tax burden on NZ taxpayers Shares tax burden with multi-nationals & offshore entities Inherently 'future proof'Embraces internet, shared, gig etc. economies Fully compatible with technology trendsTrend is towards cashless, system is banking based Hypothecating tax revenueLevies largely hypothecated Better progressive capacity for personal tax Minimum wage threshold for levies, progressive subsidy reduction at higher incomes Puts Māori economy on equal footing Improved competitiveness and lower tax NZ together with progressive nature of company tax. Progressive capacity for company taxProgressive introduction of levies. Discourages migration to cash economy Value of applied CGST and levies to money leaving banking system less than present GST. Simpler and more equitable than alternative solutions Preferable to capital gains, BEPS and other tweaks to current framework Encourages investment in NZ Application of CGST and levies to money leaving banking system and low NZ tax rates encourages retention of funds in NZ Discourages market speculation All transactions taxed - housing, equities, other investments and assets Accommodates global business trends Equal treatment of all businesses irrespective of domicile jurisdiction Accommodates environmental challenges Industry levies (e.g. carbon, tourism infrastructure & conservation levy) target outcomes 8. The cornerstone; Comprehensive GST = CGST At the core of the proposed system is an extended GST regime, called Comprehensive GST or CGST: 1.CGST is applied cumulatively not as net/value-added as at present. 2.CGST is applied to all transactions between bank accounts. If money changes it pays CGST. 3.CGST is paid by the entity making the payment (payor) not the recipient (payee). 4.CGST is collected by the banks as a charge on all payments/transfers made from a payor’s accounts – if money changes hands it pays CGST. 5.CGST is also collected on cash withdrawals – payments out of the bank. 6.CGST is also collected on all payments to accounts outside the NZ banking system. 7.CGST will drive economic efficiencies by eliminating GST processing/returns and as businesses respond with fewer steps in transaction chains. 8.CGST estimated at an applied rate of between 1.75% and 4% 9.CGST. As a % lower than GST, CGST will still contribute more tax due to: a.A wider base. If money changes hands it pays CGST, e.g. share market, house sales, rent, dividends, financial markets, FOREX, Share economy etc b.Being cumulative rather than net. The CGST revenue is not hypothecated (i.e. tagged for a specific Vote) 9. Personal Tax – meeting the challenges Tax inroads into the disposable income of the poor has a greater impact on their quality of life and economic participation than on the wealthy. The current personal tax regime is not doing enough to significantly reduce poverty in NZ. The current tax regime does not provide an effective tax progression wedge. Multi-national and offshore company uncollected taxes place greater burden on all NZ taxpayers, impacting the poor most. Reducing the tax burden on lower income New Zealanders will increase disposable income: Reducing poverty – child poverty in particular; Improving participation in the social economy; Improving health outcomes; Improving education outcomes ... •... leading to improved productivity in future; •... leading to greater participation in the digital environment. Income tax based on earnings is not future proof and will become increasingly inequitable (rich – poor divide) as current trends away from traditional wage/salary based employment accelerate more in higher paid sectors. 10. A new approach to personal tax It is proposed to shift from a tax on earnings base to a participation in part funding state personal insurance. All up the proposed levy is expected to total around 17% of income at the upper end. Individuals will be liable for constant percentage of income (subject to government subsidies) for contributions to: ACC insurance (earner levy). Kiwisaver. Health (public system) insurance (from ambulance to GP to tertiary care) whether accessed or not. Unemployment insurance (unemployment, maternity leave etc) Welfare insurance. National education contribution. Collection is through the banks and applied as a percentage (all levies summed) to all payments (note exemptions) into personal accounts. 1.Individual taxpayers are banded into annual income bands by IRD and registered as such with their bank. The band is reviewed annually (?) 2.The levies are applied according to the taxpayer’s band and are progressive. 3.The progressive nature reflects a government subsidy linked to income. At the lowest income level, below the annualised minimum wage, the subsidy is 100%. 4.Individuals not registered for tax purposes pay the highest levy. 11. Company tax shifts from ‘profit’ to ‘income’ based as levies In lieu of company tax a regime of levies is proposed. These levies are applied to the income (money into company accounts) for all NZ tax registered companies. The levies are collected by the banks from the payee on gross revenue/income into registered NZ business taxpayer accounts. Companies not tax registered in NZ have the levy collected from the payor, from all payments leaving the NZ banking system: 1.Domestically as cash 2.Internationally to accounts on non-NZ tax registered entities. All levies are summed, rounded to fit IRD established bands and advised to collecting banks to be collected on all inflows (i.e. gross income) into company accounts. A default (higher) levy is applied to all accounts not registered as NZ business taxpayer accounts. This tax system treats NZ and foreign companies the same and thus meets international trade agreement requirements. 12. Company income levy types Company/industry based levies, rule based and within IRD determined classifications. 1.Industry based levies: i.Such as the. fishing industry levy, intended to contribute to the regulatory, research and support functions of the Ministry. ii.ACC (employer levy), industry linked. Not related to employee numbers or payments 2.“Insurance” type levies: i.Staff based such as KiwiSaver (employer contribution) ii.Staff independent to include contributions to national (personal) insurance for health, unemployment (provides for paid parental leave) and welfare. iii.Environmental levies, (not unlike ACC in concept) based on company carbon footprint and/or other such as water use etc. These avoid the need for complexities such as carbon taxes or trading (which are broad brush, open to speculation and often avoid the issue of improvement through trading). See section 22 Environmental Outcomes. 3.Generic levies can be progressive, selectively applied at income thresholds. i.Specific infrastructure hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the core infrastructure Ministries such as Defence, Transport, Law and Order. ii.Social support hypothecated levies, directed to part fund the big social ministries such as Health, Education & Social welfare. iii.National infrastructure levy, not hypothecated. 13. Levies on monies leaving the NZ banking system, simpler & better than BEPS CILS and CGST applies to all monies leaving the the NZ banking system. A company levy on payments to companies not registered for NZ tax purposes or operating outside of the NZ Banking system will be added to CGST and collected from the payor. 1.Levy is collected on all payments leaving the NZ Banking system – cash or payments to offshore entities. 2.The levy is applied equally within NZ and to offshore entities – complying with trade agreements. 3.A single default levy is applied, which will be at the highest level applied to registered companies. 4.These “non-registered” levies are added to CGST and collected at the same time from the payor by the transaction NZ bank. 5.This method of collection (collected from payor) is different from that for tax registered companies which is collected from payee revenue. This “non-registered” levy, together with CGST, will effectively tax offshore businesses and entities with a commercial interest in NZ. As the “non-registered” levy applies to all payments leaving the NZ Banking system it will apply to all offshore and cash payments, including: 1.Dividends, royalties, professional and other fees, loans etc – if money leaves the NZ banking system. 2.Investments offshore and general funds transfers offshore. 14. Exemptions to CGST and levies. The system is intended to have the minimum of exemptions 1.Transfers from the Government (e.g. national super or wellfare payments) are exempt CGST and recipients from PIL charges 2.Payments by the Government for goods, services etc are exempt CGST 3.Payments to registered charities are exempt CIL on receipt, but CGST when paid 4.Money entering the NZ banking system as cash or from offshore is exempt CGST (as payor is outside the system) but CIL/PIL is collected in the hands of the recipient (maybe exempt??) 5.Transfers of capital (not interest) between bank accounts of the same account holder (e.g. cheque to/from term investment) shall be exempt of both CGST and CIL/PIL otherwise in the current low interest rate environment any benefit from placing funds in higher interest accounts would be lost, distorting investment decisions. Interest is subject to CIL/PIL when received. 6.Transfers (gifts) between family members are exempt PIL on receipt, and CGST when paid. Requires registration with collecting bank (& IRD) of linked accounts.. 15.. Additional taxes and fees The system is intended to have the minimum of additional taxes. 1.Tourist infrastructure and conservation tax. Levied as a dollar amount per person per month of stay on arrival, by arrival authority. 2.Existing excise taxes on specific public harm products e.g. tobacco, alcohol. Collected as at present from company supplying products and incorporated into sell price by them. CGST applies. Yes CGST double dips on this. 3.Existing user pay type taxes such as RUC/fuel tax levied at point of sale (CGST applies) and paid by vendor. 4.User pays fees. Certain public services (e.g. in health and education) may be subject to means tested user part charges. 16. Tricky areas still exist Some areas present problems gathering tax under any system. Examples. 1.Expenditure in NZ from overseas bank accounts. Example, tourist with UK bank VISA card. CIL is applied, and CGST is collected on the NZ processed transaction by the NZ bank processing the transaction on behalf of the credit card company. 2.Offshore company purchases goods/services from its wholly owned NZ registered company, without the transaction entering the NZ banking system. CGST and CIL are avoided. Solution is complex and requires applying a nominal value to the transactions and a withholding CIL until payment is received. Considering that CIL and CGST relatively low there is reduced incentive for these scams. However, imposing withholding or other measures complicates a simple system but cannot be ruled out. 3.Staff of offshore entities in NZ are paid minimum wage and balance of salary held offshore; payments of NZ expenses (e.g. rent) directly from. Avoids CGST and some PIL. Can be policed, but not simple. 4.How to properly collect tax revenue when the whole transaction is offshore: e.g. tourist package sold offshore and delivered in NZ by offshore owned providers. All NZ gets is CGST for inputs at cost. 5.NZ residents/businesses shipping $ offshore and operating all expenditure from offshore accounts. Solution is for it to be an offence to have undisclosed offshore accounts & disclosed accounts require reporting and application of CGST to all monies leaving the account whether back into NZ or offshore. 17. Hypothecating tax revenue. Transparency in the tax system is considered a causal driver of efficiency in Government. The levy system in particular creates the impression that specific government services are being purchased – e.g. ACC insurance. In the long term some of the services may be fully funded by the levies leading to the government departments having to operate on a commercial and competitive basis. With levies such as ‘health insurance’ individual accounts (like KiwiSaver) should be run BUT the levy (except for income progression) should be maintained at a universal level. The universal nature of the levy is perhaps contradictory to the ideal of no demographic cross-subsidy (e.g. age linked health levy) but rather supports the concept of whanaungatanga. 18. Housing affordability Speculation is the housing market is a causal driver of overpricing. A market with unsatisfied demand is highly vulnerable. Not only is the NZ housing market overpriced. Base demand (the number of people who need houses to live in) is a supply and demand mismatch ... but tax structures can incentivise speculation driving churn and apparent demand. 1.Capital gains tax is often touted a the solution. i.It requires quite complex rules. ii.It is difficult to apply to all capital transactions (e.g. collectable wine) – why only housing if it’s such a good idea? 2.By taxing all expenditure and every transaction: i.Churn is discouraged, suppressing one source of demand. ii.Any ‘tax free’ status is eliminated further reducing demand. iii.All investment expenditure has equal tax appeal reducing ‘preferred’ market demand. It’s a bit late to turn the clock back on the current level of housing affordability, but this proposal is a future proof against it happening again. 19. Market performance The proposed tax regime will have a similar impact on the equities market as that on the housing market. 1.Reduce churn. 2.Reduce speculation. 3.Reduce ‘tax-free’ status of some investment vehicles and transactions. 4.Provide tax parity between all investments. 5.Improve market stability. 6.Provide better linkage between value, yield and price ... 7.... providing increased confidence to investors. The tax treatment of multi-nationals in NZ will encourage the greater retention of earning in NZ, leading to greater liquidity and available capital for the market. 20. Capital Gains & Land Tax Capital gains and land tax may appear to be thinking outside of the current tax system, but in effect are little more than applying “Band-Aids” to mask other economic problems. An integrated solution as proposed is preferred. A separate capital gains tax is outmoded and considered an ineffective and distorting tax. 1.There are always problems distinguishing between income from trading in assets (e.g. cars – collectors’ cars) or investing for gain. 2.The CGST approach eliminates the usually arbitrary nature of tests for capital gains or trade activity. The bright line test is so arbitrary that it keeps shifting. 3.Depending on the arbitrary line between trade profit and capital gain different tax rules (e.g.rate of taxation, deductibility of expenses) may apply. 4.Depending on the definitions the market may be skewed to favour certain investments or trades. (e.g. PIE). 5.CGST applies a single rate to all transactions irrespective of their nature avoiding a bias towards any activity or investment. It’s all just money. 6.Discouraging investment in housing through a capital gains tax is likely to flow on to a restricted supply of rental accommodation and further rent escalation. 7.Given the low rate of the proposed CGST there appears to be no material issue requiring the exempting of family homes. Land tax is considered unhelpful and unnecessary 1.Again this is adding complexity. Land on a cross-lease section? 2.This proposal effectively taxes land as part of transactions included in the CGST. 21. BEPS The BEPS solution to uncollected tax from multi-nationals operating in NZ or offshore companies trading in NZ is a tax advisors dream come true. The solution proposed here is simpler and more effective. 22. Environmental outcomes The dominant thinking on influencing business and personal decision making on environmental issues hinges on tradable rights (e.g. water) or taxes (e.g. carbon credits). Creating markets for tradable environmental factors takes the focus of the issues and directs it towards the market. Buying carbon credits (dodgy ones aside) does nothing to reduce carbon emissions in NZ. The causal driver of good environmental performance is businesses taking the right decisions for the environment leading to actually delivering improvements. Common sense dictates that the positive drivers of good environmental performance should be rewarded, and the negative drivers (or absence of positives) penalised. ACC sets it’s levies this way – and it works. Hence the recommendation of industry specific levies with an environmental component. To illustrate: Polluting or high carbon industries should face a higher levy, but one which can be reduced (at a company level) by demonstrating: i.A plan to mitigate – level 1 reduction in levy ii.Successful implementation of the plan – level 2 reduction of levy iii.Create environmental positives and/or innovation – level 3 reduction of levy A. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 2 Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges and opportunities for the tax system? Which of these are most important? See sections 3, 6 &7 How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? Specifically the tax system should not be subject to ad hoc changes to address current ‘hot buttons’. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Tikanga Māori are an integral part of NZ culture and business life and the concepts of tikanga Māori can and should be allowed to influence thinking on a new tax system. One should not be captured by the sometimes expressed view that tikanga Māori are by their nature old and therefore irrelevant to NZ commerce today. The challenge the Working Group faces is to enunciate the tikanga Māori and envisage the extent to which there are specifics that should become objectives of the tax system and work towards them. In this submission an attempt is made to at least acknowledge the values of: Manaakitanga are in part recognised in the tourist infrastructure and conservation levy which recognises NZ as being a special place to visit and share with the people of NZ and should be protected as such. Whanaungatanga are in a small way recognised in the free movement of capital between linked family accounts and in universal individual levies. Kaitiakitanga are expressed to some extent in the progressive nature of the environmental levies and the they way they are applied – been seen to do good – rather than the market focus of tradable rights/credits. B. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 3 Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Equity, efficiency (cost of assessment, collection and payment),positive economic causal drivers, future proof, transparent Defining ‘fairness' How would you define ‘fairness' in the context of the tax system? The tax burden should be shared evenly (universally) by all participants in every aspect of the NZ economy. Those with less should not subsidise those with more (business or individual). What would a fair tax system look like? This submission proposes a fair tax system. C. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 4 Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand's ‘broad-based, low-rate' system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? Broad-based and low rate yes. GST – not appropriate at present. Value-add based, too many exemptions. Income tax is ‘earnings’ (for individuals) and ‘profit’ (for companies) based. Both of these concepts are under threat with changes in the basis of internet and global commerce. If not, what approach should replace it? Simply put, the system proposed here. Specifically, if money changes hands it should be taxed (exemptions apply) and gross income should be levied to reflect the nature of the entity being taxed in their interest in government services. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? Yes If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Multinational/offshore entity responsibility in NZ market & retention of income in NZ as proposed. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? Yes If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? As proposed compulsory KiwiSaver as a levy. D. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 5 Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? No, speculation in assets is encouraged. If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? CGST as proposed. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No, the proposal eliminates returns (GST & income tax) and the calculation of tax provisions. Plus cost of IRD under present system flows onto business. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? The proposed system, by focusing on money changing hands (CGST) treats all businesses equally as it should. However the assumption at work is that all natural capital is charged for appropriately – e.g. water. The tax system is not appropriate for address problems in government and local government setting charges. At best the tax system can apply some notional value to the resource and attribute a notional payment that is taxed. E. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 6 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? 1.Undue burden on NZ companies (and individuals) from non-collected tax from offshore entities. 2.Distortions between earnings from capital and production. Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Only in the context of a fully integrated system; no bolt-on or tinkering please! Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? This submission demonstrates thinking outside the current system. While all the taxes proposed have their root in an existing tax the overall system is new. F. Appendix - Questions for submitters – Chapter 7 Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? - See proposal section 18 Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains No - See proposal section 20 Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax? No - See proposal section 20 Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? - See proposal section 22 Progressive company tax - See proposal section 11-12 Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? No - See proposal section 16 Addendum – GST applied to offshore vendors Regarding the recent government announcement regarding requesting offshore vendors to register for GST it is appropriate to contrast that approach with this submission. 1.The government approach will: i.Require willing compliance from offshore vendors ii.GST is paid by the payor (purchaser) via the price charged iii.GST is collected and submitted by the payee – in this case the vendor iv.Separate administration by both IRD and vendors v.Tax only the sale – i.e. realise GST 2.The proposal in this submission i.No co-operation is required from offshore companies ii.The CGST is paid by the payor as a charge on the purchase transaction iii.The CGST is collected and submitted by the NZ transacting bank iv.In addition the vendor is taxed as a company doing business in NZ via the CIL applied to monies leaving the NZ banking system. The proposal in this submission is cleaner and simpler than that proposed by government and more importantly: 1. Delivers an equitable treatment of NZ and offshore companies encompassing the equivalent of GST and company tax. 2.Is applied automatically as an integral, consistent, part of the tax system; not an add-on.

Greg Cole 4 May 2018 Tax Working Group PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP This is a personal submission to the Tax Working Group (TWG). I do not propose to address all the matters before the TWG. I apologise for the lateness of this. I have experience in tax in most areas; including as a tax investigator and tax policy advisor with IRD, tax partner at Deloitte, tax advisor to the Minister of Revenue (Wyatt Creech), secretary to the Valabh Committee and, most latterly, director of a multinational company operating in 37 different jurisdictions. OVERALL POLICY FRAMEWORK AND SETTINGS The TWG asks “is \[New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system\] still the best approach for New Zealand? The answer is an unequivocal “yes”. That is not to say there are not areas which could be improved, and qualitative terms like “broad-based” and “low-rate” are open to debate. It may be oversimplification to state “tax the things you want less of and subsidise the things you want more of”, but it is still mostly true. Taxes on work and investment, all other things being equal, result in less of both. These should be held as low as possible, commensurate with the government’s revenue objectives, for the health of the economy. While GST is slightly regressive, the benefits of the tax as part of the revenue mix and its relative simplicity to administer and collect make it an important component. GST is set at a relatively low rate compared with other nations’ VAT systems. Clearly it could be higher. Regressive effects of GST when it was introduced and through both rate increases were addressed at the time through the tax and welfare systems. The mismatch between company tax rates and the maximum marginal rate for individuals is clearly a tension in the system; ideally this would be solved by reducing the maximum marginal rate rather than increasing the corporate tax rate. New Zealand’s corporate rate is no longer low by global standards. \[1\] Page | 2 Specific recommendations 1. Serious consideration should be given to increasing the GST rate (with appropriate welfare and income tax adjustments). I realise this is outside the TWG’s terms so wont labour the point. 2. Extension of CGT should be limited to land sales. If CGT is extended to equities the holdings of non-residents and foreign participation holdings of residents should be exempted in accordance with international norms. 3. Existing flat corporate rates should be maintained (and ideally reduced). There should be no “small business” exemptions. 4. The existing scope of GST should not be reduced to address social concerns. These are best addressed through the welfare system. TAX AND BUSINESS I think there are a number of areas where the tax system as it applies to business could be simplified. I would urge government NOT to introduce a tax credit system for research and development. R&D credits may drive the recording of “R&D” but the evidence that it meaningfully incentivises it is thin, particularly against the cost. It’s a “feel good” complexity our tax system does not need. I think the tax rate for Maori authorities should be aligned with the corporate tax rate but the benefits of the imputation system extended to them to ensure no negative impact on their shareholders/beneficiaries. I believe the income equalisation schemes for farmers (other than adverse event and disaster relief) should be repealed. They are a needless holdover from prior eras of much higher marginal tax rates. The tax treatment of non-cash benefits for employees should be consolidated into the FBT regime. Specifically, the provision of food and accommodation to employees. The existing exemption for charities makes no sense (as the FBT is a proxy tax on the employee), unless the desire is to exempt or concessionally-tax the employees of charities (in which case this concession should be explicit). I think real consideration should be given to levying banks based on their deposits (possibly in conjunction with a lower corporate tax rate). This could be to fund a deposit guarantee scheme but may be worthwhile even if used for general revenue raising. Banks operate in a unique environment and benefit from an implicit government guarantee that should be charged for. CAPITAL GAINS TAX New Zealand already taxes many incidences of income which would be regarded as capital gains: • Gains on financial arrangements • Short term (<2 years, soon to be <5 years) gains on sale of housing • Land sales in certain other specified circumstances (e.g. windfall gains from zoning changes) • Certain FIF gains Page | 3 This makes the position of New Zealand as “the only country in the OECD without a CGT” a bit less unique. We already tax many capital gains, just not all of them. And of course other countries’ CGTs have many exemptions in them as well. So it’s more an issue of nomenclature than any fundamental difference in scope of different countries’ tax systems. Previous reviews of the desire or need for a CGT for New Zealand have not resulted in material change to the existing tax base. Land Simplification of the existing complex rules for real property could be one effect of extending the base to include all gains on the sale or disposition of real property (presumably with a family home exemption). Such rules would presumably need to extend to the sale of “land rich” companies as well. Inevitably associated anti-avoidance and compliance arrangements mean that even such a move won’t be “simple”. However, provided certain policy decisions were made (no inflation adjustment, same rate as income tax, repeal of existing land sale rules) this would probably be a simplification. There would still be 3 issues (at least) which would have complicating impacts (these also apply to any CGT introduced on more asset classes): • Introduction date. The simplest approach is to impose such a tax on land acquired after a specific (prospective) date. However, that will likely delay any positive revenue impact, although I would argue it is the “fairest” way to bring in such a tax. Applying a CGT to land held at a particular date will impose compliance costs associated with valuation, but these might be ameliorated by allowing an election to use existing land valuations (e.g. for rating). • Rollover relief. I would be particularly concerned if such a CGT extension impacted on the ability of family farms being passed on. There is a broader question as to whether testamentary dispositions should be treated as taxable (effectively a death duty or estate tax) or allowed for rollover relief. • Scope. Should such a rule extension apply to non-New Zealand land? Many foreign CGT regimes provide for participation exemptions for foreign holdings. Should the rules apply to non-residents? Most foreign CGT regimes exempt foreigners when it comes to equities but many would tax land. Equities I think the case for New Zealand extending the taxation of equities is much weaker than for land: • Almost all OECD CGT regimes exempt gains on share sales (other than land-rich companies) by non-residents. Given these comprise c50% of the listed share market holdings (and a significant portion of the non-listed market) this significantly reduces the potential scope of any such regime. • The bulk of the remaining interests in the listed share market are held by kiwisaver funds or other group investments (mostly focused on retirement savings). While the government could decide to increase the tax on retirement saving I don’t think this is the correct Page | 4 direction for a small country with a relatively low savings rate (when you tax something you tend to get less of it). • Almost all OECD regimes provide a participation exemption for the foreign holdings of domestic investors. There are good policy reasons for this. New Zealand also already has a comprehensive FIF/CFC regime for taxing foreign participations and shareholdings. Once these items are excluded from the base, one is left to tax the non-listed shareholdings of resident investors. This group, largely SMEs, is the entrepreneurial base of New Zealand. I submit that while there may be equity bases for seeking to tax this group, the potential damage through restriction of entrepreneurial activity (particularly for geographically mobile industries like technology) by the imposition of such taxes does not justify it. Other assets If shares remain outside any extension of the CGT there is really no point in looking to extend the existing tax base to include other assets (e.g. intellectual property). I submit the existing rules, particularly relating to royalties and financial arrangements adequately capture gains on other classes of asset. PROGRESSIVE COMPANY TAXATION The TWG asks “should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax.” This is a terrible idea. The tax system should not support small business; neither should it impede them. But concessions to “small” businesses (or penalties to “large” businesses) have pernicious effects. They create lock-in effects where businesses can’t afford to grow outside of the small business concession. I see this overseas where businesses grow to 50 employees and then stop because the cost of tipping over the “small business” threshold is too high. To the extent progressive tax rates make any sense it is only in respect of individuals. The best thing a tax system can do for small businesses is to be as unobtrusive as possible. This is less about rates of tax and more about the various imposts of government for compliance (and indeed it is the non-taxation compliance areas which elicit the most complaint, e.g. Statistics). If something is so bad it needs a concession for small businesses then it is just as bad for a large business (however defined). GST EXEMPTIONS FOR SPECIFIC GOODS The TWG seeks submissions on whether there should be exclusions from GST for certain goods and services. A key benefit of the GST is its relative ease of collection and administration. Overseas systems with multiple rates have ridiculous rule-sets for guidance, with courts and authorities needing to determine if a hot meat pattie between room-temperature buns is a warm or cold food. Those arguing about the regressive nature of GST conveniently forget the large adjustments made to benefits and tax rates to ameliorate those effects when the GST was introduced (and when the rates were increased). Page | 5 There may be some cases where the GST system might usefully apply to achieve non-tax outcomes (for example removing zero-rating on the export of unprocessed logs as a way of encouraging the domestic industry) but I do not consider this to be in the area of end consumers. I have kept these comments brief but would be happy to expand. Yours sincerely Greg Cole

Head Office PO Box 631 Wellington 205 Victoria Street www.forestandbird.org.nz 7 May 2018 Tax Working Group Te Awheawhe Take PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Dear Tax Working Group Submission to the Tax Working Group on environmental taxes and related matters Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission on the Future of Tax. The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand (Forest & Bird) is New Zealand’s largest independent conservation organisation. It is independently funded by private subscription, donations and bequests. Forest & Bird’s mission is to protect New Zealand’s unique flora and fauna and its habitat. Key matters of concern therefore relate to the protection our unique biodiversity and ecological values, and the sustainable management of New Zealand’s natural resources. The crisis that New Zealand faces from worsening climate change, loss of indigenous biodiversity and freshwater quality, soil erosion, marine habitat destruction and fish stock depletion, etc., is not only a serious issue for our environment, but is also a considerable threat to our primary industries, the wider economy and the future health of our society. Many of these environmental problems are being driven by long established, unsustainable economic practices that have put little value on recognising the fundamental importance of the natural environment. These practices often encourage the unsustainable use of natural resources for private gain while externalizing the environmental costs of that use. Forest & Bird is therefore encouraged that the Terms of Reference of the Tax Working Group (TWG) include the consideration of:  What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. The Treasury’s recently announced Living Standards Framework focuses on ‘investing for wellbeing’. This is based on the recognition that intergenerational wellbeing relies on the growth, distribution, and sustainability of the four capitals: natural, social, human and financial/physical capital. This is an important shift from a traditionally narrow view of our economy, with its focus on the management of financial and physical capital, to a wider view of how the country needs to manage and invest in its four capitals. It is very opportune that this tax review coincides with this shift as it provides an 2 opportunity to also widen our tax system to better invest in, manage and sustainably grow all four capitals – particularly natural capital on which the other three capitals are dependent. Forest & Bird supports the use of environmental taxation in combination with regulations. Such taxes have the potential to improve environmental and ecological outcomes while also diversifying the tax base. Environmental taxation and related measures can support a range of policy goals such as:  Internalising the environmental costs of resource use  Providing income from the exclusive use of common/public resources  Creating incentives to alter behavior in favour of environmentally sustainable practices  Raising revenue for environmental programmes  Making adjustments at the border  Diversifying the tax-base Environmental consumption tax In 2015 the Environmental Defence Society published a book on the biodiversity crisis facing New Zealand called “Vanishing Nature” 1 . One of the potential responses to the biodiversity crisis that was considered by the authors was the introduction of an environmental consumption tax. An environmental consumption tax could be an effective way to shift from taxing the production of private wealth, via income, company and capital gains taxes, towards taxing consumption of public wealth. It would push economic growth away from sectors that depend on the depletion of natural capital for commercial viability toward activities that use and grow intellectual and social capital to achieve commercial success. An environmental consumption tax system could most heavily tax unsustainable natural resource consumption such as intensive landuse, while areas of intact ecological function would entitle landowners to a rebate. The highest per-hectare tax rate would apply to land with impervious built surfaces, with lower tax rates for land retaining greater levels of ecological function. Rebates would be available for areas retaining their natural values through protection and management. In a similar way high tax rates could apply to activities that significantly reduce water quality. Environmental consumption tax rates should be substantial so that other taxes that are harmful to economic growth can be significantly reduced or eliminated. In this way the private interest in natural resource consumption can be brought towards alignment with the multiple but divergent public interests in economic growth, a fair and internationally competitive tax system and maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The strength of an environmental consumption tax is its potential to facilitate long-term economic growth while incentivizing the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services (natural capital), particularly on private land. This system could encourage economic growth by incentivizing investment in businesses that add value from natural, social and intellectual capital (because of lower environmental consumption taxes tied to lower income and company taxes) and by improving the international competitiveness of our tax system. 1 Brown, M; Stephens, T; Peart, R; Fedder, B; 2015 Vanishing Nature, facing New Zealand’s biodiversity crisis. Environmental Defence Society, 196pp. 3 Environmental consumption taxes could help diversify the economy and reduce our dependence on primary industries that rely on unsustainable intensive land and other natural resource use. It would also have the potential to provide for a more equitable sharing of the tax burden. As the Working Group’s background paper indicated, the present proportion of the tax burden carried by wage and salary earners is among the highest in the OECD, while the tax burden on landowners is amongst the lowest. Taxation and climate change. Environmental consumption taxes would have the indirect effect of putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions that would complement the Emissions Trading System. Not all economic activities that impact greenhouse gas production will be part of or easily responsive to the ETS. Greenhouse gas emissions are broadly correlated with land-use intensity while carbon storage and sequestration are associated with natural areas and their restoration. Tax rebates could be available to landowners providing carbon storage and sequestration services. Emissions Trading Scheme reform The Emissions Trading Scheme needs significant improvement. There is no rational reason for excluding sectors from the ETS as by definition it is a trading system – firms that cannot cost effectively reduce emissions should source cost effective emission reductions through the market. The ETS should operate with greater reliance on auctioning to provide financial flows to the private sector to address the regressive aspects of emissions pricing and to provide funds for investment in the transition to a low carbon future. Recommended ETS improvements that would increase revenue flows to the Crown and improve the efficiency of the scheme are: - Immediately increase the price cap (the ability for emitters to pay the Government a fee instead of surrendering carbon units) above $25. With prices for spot NZUs hovering between $21 and $22, we are very close to the point where the cap is suppressing prices. There is also an incentive for entities receiving units (owners of post-89 forests and EITEs - emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries) to arbitrage, by paying the fee and banking the units. This behavior will effectively transfer emissions liability to the Crown (ie the Crown will have to find emissions reductions to meet New Zealand’s international emissions reduction obligations). - If the price cap is to stay, it needs to be balanced with a price floor, so that the carbon price operates within a band, in much the same way inflation is kept within a band under the Reserve Bank Act. - Provide long-term certainty of prices by giving information about how that price band will be adjusted up over time. Logically, this would tie in with the carbon budgets to be set by the proposed Climate Change Commission. - Start phasing out the allocation of free credits to EITEs and make it a requirement that credits given to them under the Industrial Allocation provisions must be surrendered at the next emissions return, ie, close all potential for arbitrage at the expense of taxpayers. - Make the agricultural sector liable for its emissions, to encourage the most efficient forms of land use and investment. Balance this with the ability for landowners to opt-in to the 4 scheme as the point of obligation, providing a direct incentive for land-use practices that reduce emissions (e.g. retiring steep country from grazing and allowing carbon-sequestering native forest to regenerate). - Reviewing the rules about what constitutes a carbon forest to encourage and reward other types of planting that sequester carbon and provide other environment co-benefits (e.g., riparian planting, commercial crops like fruit etc.). - Review the rules to allow regeneration or vegetation management, such as pest control that sequester carbon and provide other environment co-benefits, to qualify for NZUs. - In pre-1990 native forests, recognise the additionality of pest control and other management practices that, by increasing plant biomass, increase the amount of carbon being sequestered. - In light of NIWA’s work indicating that native ecosystems might be storing some 50 per cent more carbon than previously thought, the factors used for calculating carbon storage in native forests should be reviewed and adjusted. - Because of the massive environmental co-benefits of native ecosystems, including improved water quality, reduce soil erosion, increased biodiversity and better resilience to the impacts of climate change, consideration should be given to making credits from native ecosystems of greater value than those from exotic forests. - Consideration could also be given to recognising emissions reductions through other forms of technologies, e.g. LanzaTech’s ability to remove carbon emissions from steel mill stacks, and CarbonScape’s Green Coke technology (using current-cycle carbon in the steel-making process instead of fossil carbon). While it could be argued that avoiding carbon costs is an incentive for industrial processors to adapt to this technology, issuing credits for avoided use of fossil carbon would help capital flow into the development of such technologies. Resource rentals Resource rentals are a useful way of encouraging efficient uses of public resources, particularly when there is exclusive commercial use of the resource. While theoretically resource rentals and resource trading should have a similar effect in encouraging people to properly value private use of a public resource, in practice trading is likely to increase income and wealth disparities whereas resource rentals will provide a financial flow from private use of the public resource back to the public. This financial flow can then be deployed to address regressive aspects of charging or to recycle revenue into reducing environmental harms. New Zealand does impose royalties on the extraction of natural resources such as minerals mining, however, it does not do this in any systematic way. The Background Paper notes that an alternative approach to using royalties that usually are set as a percentage of the revenue or profit generated by a miner, is to charge a resource rental which attempts to estimate the “rent” – the profit generated by the resource use over and above a reasonable economic return – and to directly apply a tax to that rent. Freshwater An obvious candidate for such a resource rental is the extraction and use of water for commercial gain. At the moment the only costs to those extracting and using water for commercial purposes 5 that is paid to public agencies is the cost of applying for a resource consent and in some circumstances the costs associated with monitoring the implementation of the consents. The costs of acquiring resource consents are relatively small and will vary little in respect to the amount of water use that is applied for. Marine fisheries Marine fisheries could be suitable for a resource rental, but this is complicated by the de-facto privatization of fisheries under the Quota Management System. Considering the use of a resource rental in marine fisheries would likely require a renegotiation of the Treaty of Waitangi fisheries settlement to ensure that Maori rights were protected in any transition. On the flip side, new technology in real-time fisheries monitoring will enable more sophisticated fisheries management including innovative use of incentives and levies. There is already a Conservation Services Levy where the industry contributes to the cost of managing its environmental impact through the provision of fisheries monitoring. Border conservation levy Managing tourism demand In 2008 New Zealand had approximately 2.5 million overseas visitors, and on present trends this number will have doubled to 5 million per year by 2023. This means that we will see another million visitors in just the next five years. There is every indication that the tourism industry is expecting this exponential growth to continue into the future. However, this rapid increase in demand has caused problems for local services and for the management of the conservation estate. The “volume not value” growth strategy of the tourism industry is threatening to destroy the very basis of the New Zealand ‘clean-green un-crowded and natural’ tourist product. To have a manageable impact on controlling international tourism numbers a tourist border levy would need to be reasonably high. Such a border levy could be used to not only control demand, but also to incentivise the tourism industry to provide a tourist product focussed on high-value rather than high-volume. A tourism border levy could be hypothecated to provide a source of revenue that would be invested in conservation outcomes and in providing regional tourism infrastructure. New Zealand’s tourism sector is highly seasonal. Demand peaks during late summer with a second winter spike in demand in ski resort areas such as Queenstown and Wanaka and the central North Island. One consequence of such seasonal demand is that capacity is stretched during peak periods (especially accommodation, but also in high-demand conservation areas). However, because capacity is very under-utilised in off-peak times, there is little incentive for private investment in more peak supply because of the cost of maintaining off-peak supply. This suggests that a tourism border levy could differ by season to encourage greater off-peak visitation. Funding Predator Free New Zealand. One of the conservation outcomes a tourism border levy could be directed to is the initial funding of New Zealand’s Predator Free goal which is this country’s largest long-term conservation program. 6 Hypothecating environmental taxes and levies Forest & Bird supports linking the spending of revenue from environmental taxes and levies with fixing the problem for which it has been created. This has two benefits. Firstly, the tax or levy can be adjusted to the scale of the problem it is intended to address and secondly such linking is likely to generate greater public buy-in. One key risk associated with cost recovery and levies that should be avoided is the possibility that the industry under regulation might end up holding intellectual property in the information required to regulate the industry’s activities. This clearly has the potential to distort the information that is made available to the regulator and therefore its ability to manage the activities. This has been a problem with the cost recovery model applied to fisheries. Land taxes While the Background Paper identified some advantages of a comprehensive land tax it encouraged submissions on what the appropriate treatment of Maori land might be when that land is a toanga asset. This encouragement recognized the potential difficulties of taxing a cultural ‘asset’ that its owners would not be intending to generate income from. The same issue arises for land that is held for environmental and conservation purposes. Would DOC, councils (for their public parks and reserves) and charities such as Forest & Bird (for their nature reserves), or those with QEII covenants be taxed on that land that is being held for conservation purposes and the provision of environmental services to the wider community? One of the perverse outcomes from a comprehensive land tax could be the incentives it would produce to destroy indigenous biodiversity and undermine the provision of other environmental services such as water quality. Much of New Zealand’s historic environmental damage was caused by economic incentives to ‘develop’ marginally productive land. A comprehensive land tax could generate perverse incentives to repeat this sort of environmental vandalism. Trade related aspects Like other aspects of the tax system, environmental taxes could face challenges due to the way the wider global economy is run, as well as facing specific challenges from the countervailing effect of subsidies. The four policy measures that are important to strengthen the durability of environmental taxes are:  Removing subsidies that contribute to environmental harms that the Government may wish to reduce. This also includes removing hidden or indirect subsidies that are not readily apparent.  Establishing enforceable ‘not-lowering-standards’ clauses in trade agreements or similar clauses aimed at reducing the opportunities for investors to shop around for low-standard countries in which to locate production.  Prevent ‘regulatory chill’ by exiting from investor-state dispute resolution, especially where it enables legal challenges on indirect expropriation 7  Establishing border tax adjustments to equalize the level of environmental tax applying irrespective of where products or services sold in New Zealand are produced Examples of subsidies applying in New Zealand include:  Free allocations under the emissions trading scheme, including the current 100% free allocation to the agriculture sector for agricultural gases. There is no economic basis for free allocation to the agriculture sector. Under emissions trading, emission reductions should happen at the locations of least cost, therefore if it is not cost effective for the agriculture sector to reduce its emissions (because of technical barriers for example) the agriculture sector should source lower-cost emission reductions from elsewhere  Irrigation subsidies, which are being scaled back presently.  Legislated below-market rentals for Crown pastoral lease and a valuation system that privatises public value in Crown pastoral lease without fair compensation to the Crown through tenure review  Fossil fuel production subsidies. Housing affordability – environmental versus tax considerations New Zealand has a tradition of unimaginatively dealing with a mismatch between supply and demand in markets by increasing supply through policies that ignore environmental limits. One example of this is the constant pressure to relax the protection of environmental limits set under the Resource Management Act. As a consequence New Zealand is approaching and in some cases breaching environmental limits associated with land management (see for example the most recent OECD assessment of New Zealand’s environmental performance). The recent State of the Environment report from Stats and MfE examining the country’s use of land recorded a 10% increase in the total size of our towns (between 1996-2016) – much of it on some of our most productive soils. Unfortunately New Zealand has a very poor record of low density housing which makes the supply of associated infrastructure very expensive – both financially and environmentally. New Zealand needs to consider more creative ways of managing supply and demand, including changing the tax system for housing to limit urban expansion and encourage higher density housing. Consideration should also be given to the impact of expanding the urban foot print on the ability of people to respond to emissions pricing signals. Excessively dispersed urban form will lead to unavoidable emissions as people are forced to travel longer distances to workplaces and services making it difficult to respond to emissions price increases. 8 Tax system unintentionally causing environmental harms. Addressing limitations caused by inelastic demand Elasticity of demand: when considering the role of environmental taxes it is important to also consider the limitations of taxes in changing behavior where people’s circumstances mean that they are not responsive to price. For example, if public transport is unavailable then increasing the price of fuel may not lead to lower use of vehicles as people are constrained by the requirement to reach their workplace or shopping locations. Consideration should be given to complimentary measures that reduce barriers to changing behavior (on-farm advice for example). These measures could include the provision of information and support to change, assisting with capital costs where they act as a barrier to change (e.g. home insulation assistance) or the provision of alternatives (such as public transport). Dealing with regressive aspects to environmental taxes Environmental taxes can be regressive in character as costs get distributed through the economy via prices. This means there is a risk that for some taxes those least able to pay may contribute a relatively higher proportion of their income in tax than those on higher incomes. This can be corrected by making the income tax system more strongly progressive. Kevin Hackwell Chief Conservation Advisor Forest & Bird

Without high level reviews it can be easy for tax policy development to get embroiled in micro reforms which don’t have the necessary macro view. Ensuring a tax system is fit for purpose involves an examination of how much tax revenue is required and what can be taxed to raise that revenue, generally in the least distortionary way. It is difficult to make a submission to the Tax Working Group without having an understanding of the options being considered and the overall package of reform. For example, broadening the tax base through the introduction of new taxes will be more palatable when it is combined with a lowering of taxes in other areas. Until the options and tradeoffs are known it is difficult to comment on any reform package including its component parts. It is with this context that we do not provide direct views on the Tax Working Group submission paper other than noting that we are in general agreement with the process and many of the observations made in the documents to date. We instead provide some observations and international comparisons. Observations 1. To ensure New Zealand continues to collect the tax revenue it needs, the emphasis should be on initiatives that encourage the economy to grow with increased tax revenues flowing from that growth, rather than just taxing existing economic activity harder. A key lens through which the tax system and initiatives relating to it should be analysed is therefore from the perspective of what can be done to help New Zealand be more productive and grow, rather than being drawn into micro base maintenance concerns which have dominated recent policy deliberations. 2. New Zealand is a country which is reliant on foreign capital, it should be at the forefront of the minds of the Tax Working Group that New Zealand’s tax rules need to be designed to both tax and retain what capital is already invested here, but also to attract and retain foreign capital. The Tax Working Group should be focused on ensuring there is an attractive tax regime that is internationally competitive, recognizing that there is a balance to be struck between appropriately taxing economic rents and looking to attract and retain mobile capital. Consistent with the findings of previous reviews, we think that drawing the line is not easy. In analyzing whether our tax rates are appropriate there is a need to consider where we stand vis-à-vis other jurisdictions, in particular our trading partners. As an example, New Zealand’s 28% corporate rate is at the high end of the range by international standards. That said, one competitive advantage New Zealand currently has is the lack of a general capital gains tax. 3. The taxation of savings also needs to be considered. New Zealand needs to be encouraging and incentivising New Zealanders to save. Tax “the emphasis should be in initiatives that encourage the economy to grow with increased tax revenues flowing from that growth” Tax Working Group | Executive Summary 04 can play a part in this by reducing taxes on saving. New Zealand is an outlier in following a Tax-Tax-Exempt (TTE) model and steps should be taken to reduce taxes at the investment and earning stages of the savings cycle. 4. The tax system should also be analysed on the basis of what it best for the tax system; what are the fairest and most efficient ways of collecting tax. The Tax Working Group should not be focusing on how the tax system could be used to redistribute wealth, very few tax systems do this. This is the function of the welfare / transfer system. 5. Addressing or mitigating the effects of the hidden economy should be a priority in the current review. The amounts involved are material as are the equity issues. An immediate response could be to hold a tax amnesty to draw taxpayers out. The New Zealand approach of not requiring individuals to file returns could be revalidated as part of this issue and in particular whether the lack of tax return filing contributes to the hidden economy given the impact on tax literacy. 6. Tax systems in other countries are beginning to anticipate a need to encourage employment and to support training. In 2006 New Zealand undertook consultation on Skills Training Tax Credits. While not proceeded with at that time, there could be merit in reassessing the work done in 2006 to determine whether there is a place for Skills Training Tax Credits in 2018. 7. The effectiveness of behavioural taxes varies depending on the subject matter in question. With a small population of consumers the deadweight costs of imposing and administering new taxes may negate any perceived benefit. In many instances education, information sharing and at the extreme simply regulating an outcome, is a better option for influencing / impacting behaviour; for example promotion of the harm plastic straws can cause to sea life has seen a shift away from plastic straws in mainstream life, this has been largely driven by consumer awareness and demand. 8. Housing issues are not unique to New Zealand and internationally arise whether or not gains are taxed. Likewise, it is not clear that any perceived (or real) under-taxation of housing is justification for the imposition of a capital gains tax on all assets. International Perspectives While some may consider New Zealand an isolated country in terms of geography, the New Zealand tax system does not operate in isolation. The New Zealand tax system needs to achieve two broad outcomes. First to tax what is here and will remain here (economic rents); second to ensure that it is able to compete against other tax systems around the world to attract mobile capital and labour. It is therefore important that when analyzing New Zealand’s tax system, regard is had to the tax systems in other countries. The Tax Working Group submissions paper identifies a number of challenges facing the New Zealand tax system. New Zealand is not at all unique in having an aging population and the imminent threat of a mobile digital economy. It is the ubiquitous nature of these challenges (or opportunities) that has lead Deloitte to undertake a survey of tax systems.

Tax Working Group | Taxing people 06 Taxing people Personal income tax can be easy to collect when tax is withheld at source from employees. But more and more of us aren’t employees and don’t work a single job. The changing nature of work means that New Zealand needs to consider the best manner to tax its workers. The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) collection system will lose some of its effectiveness as we increasingly move to new business models and New Zealand needs to ensure workers are paying their fair share. We posed the following question: New Zealand has an efficient and effective system for collecting tax off employees (in New Zealand employers withhold tax at marginal rates each pay day. Employees cannot claim tax deductions for costs of earning employment income). In New Zealand people who work as 'contractors' only have tax withheld at source in a limited number of industries. However the world is changing from people having a single full time jobs to working for multiple employers or being contractors / self-employed. In a world where less tax can be collected at source, what is your country doing to ensure tax can be collected in an efficient way? What measures are in place to ensure individuals are declaring all income (e.g. collecting & matching data)? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Employers act as withholding agents when paying employees, but also all companies must act as withholding agents when paying independent contractors on the amounts they are invoiced. On an annual basis, individuals must declare all their assets, with a test to determine whether the change in assets is reasonable based on declared income. Australia Australia is implementing a number of initiatives to ensure that income is accurately reported. These include “single touch payroll” (which is real time reporting of tax and superannuation payments), payment reporting systems for contractors operating in certain industries (cleaning, couriers and construction), a black economy taskforce (which has examined risks and solutions posed by the black economy), automated and standardized third party reporting of interest, dividends, land transactions, share transactions and data matching programmes (including for online sales, motor vehicle acquisitions, welfare declarations). More information is available at the following links. Tax Working Group | Taxing people 07 Single Touch payroll: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Single-Touch- Payroll/ Taxable payment reporting system: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new- legislation/in-detail/direct-taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/black-economy- taskforce--extension-of-the-taxable-payments-reporting-system-to- contractors-in-the-courier-and-cleaning-industries/ Black economy taskforce consultation paper: https://consult.treasury.gov.au/tax-framework-division/black-economy- taskforce/ Third party reporting systems: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Third- party-reporting/ Specific data matching programs: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Building-confidence/In-detail/Data- matching/?anchor=Datamatchingprograms Brazil Under Brazilian rules, employers act as withholding agents of individual income tax and social security when paying employees’ salaries. All income received by the individual must be declared on an annual income tax return in which any residual tax should be collected by the submission deadline. Independent contractors are also subject to specific withholding mechanisms that apply on a case by case basis. Canada Canada withholds at source on employment income. In addition, where prior year's residual tax liability is $2,000 or more, tax instalments are required to be paid by the employee quarterly. For non-resident contractors, a withholding tax regime is in place (subject to certain exemptions). China China still heavily relies on a withholding mechanism to collect tax from individuals. A party making payments to an individual generally has the obligation to withhold the tax at source and remit the tax to authorities, except for certain situations (e.g. the individual doing business through a sole proprietorship, partnership, or "individual industrial and commercial household"). However, China has considered moving the existing typical scheduler Individual Income Tax system towards a more comprehensive system, which might require more self-reporting by individual taxpayers. Chinese tax authorities have made efforts to establish information exchange mechanism with other government departments (e.g. the State Administration of Foreign Exchange) to regularly collect income-related information for internal matching/audit purposes. France As from 2019, a pay-as-you-earn system will be set up. In addition, France intends to develop data mining to ensure individuals are declaring all income. Tax Working Group | Taxing people 08 Germany Employers act as withholding agents when paying employees, but there is no withholding requirement when paying independent contractors. Germany is relying on additional data collection and exchange of information to make sure that in the case an expense is claimed by the principal company the payment is taxed at the level of the recipient. This mostly happens in case of a tax audit at the level of the principal company. There currently is no "real-time" mechanism in place. Tax auditors and social security auditors have begun analysing payments to freelancers or contractors in much more depth, than a couple of years ago. No other new or specific measures have been introduced. Hungary Companies are required to withhold taxes from salaries and fees paid, irrespective of whether the individual is an employee or contractor. All employers ought to report the earnings of their employees to the tax authority though a central database. The tax authority then prepares a return for the taxpayer automatically, which may be modified by the taxpayer. This practice helps eliminate opportunities for undeclared earnings and reduces administrative burdens. The personal tax rate in Hungary is a flat rate of 15%. Israel The duty to withhold tax is on the payer, with criminal sanctions in place if tax is not withheld (except where the worker has provided a tax exemption). Italy In Italy both employees and the self-employed are subject to withholding taxes. Japan Many payments to individuals are subject to withholding tax, even outside of employment relationships, for example, payments to a Japanese resident lawyer, accountant, consultant, translator, and several others are subject to withholding in Japan. More information is available in the Japanese tax authority withholding tax guide: https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/pamph/gensen/shikata2018/pdf/withhold ingtaxguide2018.pdf Luxembourg Luxembourg withholds at source for some revenues (e.g. salaries and pensions). A "full" tax return should be completed once a year. This must disclose all income received, with sanctions applying if obligations are not met. There is an exchange of information in place between European countries concerning some revenues (including salaries of cross-border workers). There is also an exchange of information in place between national authorities (tax authorities and authorities in charge of social matters). Recently, there was a tax amnesty whereby if an individual declared revenues not yet declared, less sanctions were applicable. More information on this tax amnesty is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/implementation- luxembourg-tax-amnesty.html Tax Working Group | Taxing people 09 Mexico The tax rules applying to employees and self-employed contractors are similar; in a sense, that businesses are required to withhold taxes from salaries and fees paid, irrespective of whether the individual is an employee or a self-employed contractor. To ensure taxes are collected in an efficient way there is an obligation to issue electronic tax invoices which are shared with the Mexican tax authorities. Additionally, the tax authority prepares a “pre filled” return for the taxpayer, which may be modified by the taxpayer. This practice helps eliminate opportunities for undeclared earnings and reduces administrative burdens. Russia Multiple employment is not very common in Russia and therefore there are no specific initiatives related to this issue. All contractors must be registered with the tax authorities to carry out an independent business. Spain As a general rule, payments to self-employed individuals (e.g. contractors) are currently subject to 15% withholding tax at source regardless of industry. United Kingdom The UK has an efficient payroll withholding system for employees and pensioners. It has required that public sector engagers take responsibility to withhold from contractors deemed to be employees. There is discussion about broadening this to private sector engagers. There is also discussion about requiring information and possibly withholding from platforms engaging gig workers. The issue has been the subject of a review: “Good Work: The Taylor Review of Modern Working Practices”. More information about the review and the UK government’s response are here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review- of-modern-working-practices and https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to- the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices Summary Internationally there is a clear trend towards real time data collection, which is used to either pre-fil returns or verify tax return reliability. This data collection is increasingly being available to taxpayers themselves to provide transparency to their affairs. The requirement on all taxpayers to file tax returns in other countries brings integrity to the tax system. Given recent research in New Zealand on the size of the hidden economy and the current Business Transformation project, now seems the right time to reevaluate whether we should return to all taxpayers filing annual tax returns. Like Luxembourg, consideration should be given to holding a tax amnesty to allow taxpayers to draw a line under the past and change behaviours going forward. Tax Working Group | Technological change 10 Technological change It’s all well and good taxing people, but what if workers are replaced by robots? Technology should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat, but what is being done to prepare for and embrace it? We posed the following question: There is concern the coming wave of technological change will result in job destruction / higher unemployment. Is your country doing anything to ensure tax rules encourage the retention / growth of employment? For example tax incentives for training or increasing staff numbers All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has tax incentives on training. Other tax incentives usually require employers to maintain staff numbers. Australia In Australia the 2017-18 budget focused on the following broad areas to achieve stronger growth in jobs: http://budget.gov.au/2017-18/content/glossies/jobs-growth/html/ The Australian government has made significant progress in implementing its National Innovation and Science Agenda and FinTech measures to encourage individuals and businesses to innovate through greater collaboration, building talent and skills, supporting entrepreneurship and improving access to capital: http://budget.gov.au/2017- 18/content/glossies/factsheets/html/FS\_innovation.htm Brazil Recent labour reforms have been made, but these changes are not necessarily related to the fact that new technologies are evolving. Canada There is no comprehensive tax program to encourage the retention or growth of the size of the workforce. Some provincial credits or levies have been introduced over the years. China China has tax incentives to encourage the employment (including self- employment) of specific group of people, notably the disabled, ex- servicemen, fresh graduates and unemployed individuals from low-income families. For example, companies are entitled to additional deductions for Tax Working Group | Technological change 11 salary expenses paid to the disabled employees. Qualifying small businesses that hire certain individuals may be entitled to tax credits. France Since 2013 France has had a tax credit for competitiveness and employment (“CICE”). The CICE was introduced to reduce the cost of employing workers. The tax credit, based on the wages an entity pays to its employees over the calendar year, currently is 7% of gross payroll on the portion of remuneration that does not exceed 2.5 times the national minimum wage. The CICE generates a receivable against the French treasury that may be offset against the entity’s corporate income tax liability, or refunded after three years. Some recent changes to the CICE are explained in the following article: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8954/France/2017/Parliament-adopts- second-amended-finance-bill-for-2017-and-finance-bill-for-2018 Germany There is no current known activity in Germany in this area. Hungary Hungary is promoting the retention of employees through having a fairly low personal income tax rate (a flat rate of 15%) and favourable tax exemptions and allowances. Refer to the Hungary Country Guide for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-hungaryguide-2017.pdf Israel There is no current known activity in Israel in this area. Italy In Italy there are tax deductions available which encourage open-ended employment contracts. Japan Japan has a number of initiative to address the changing nature of work. There is a tax credit available to companies based on the number of employees hired, however, this is only for companies that hire outside the major cities of Japan. There is a tax credit available for companies that raise wages and capital investment. An additional tax credit will be available to companies that increase training costs. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/jp/Documents/tax/bt/jp- bt-japan-inbound-tax-alert-dec-2017-no26.pdf Luxembourg No such new measures have been implemented in Luxembourg yet. There have been (non-tax) initiatives in relation to allowing flexibility at work in order to acknowledge the particular circumstance of Luxembourg being a small country with many cross-border workers. “At a national and local level, government subsidies are provided for qualifying training programmes.” Tax Working Group | Technological change 12 Mexico Recently, Mexico has launched seven special economic zones (SEZs). The SEZs aim to stimulate growth, reduce poverty, facilitate the supply of basic services and attract investment to economically underdeveloped or depressed areas. SEZs are available to Mexican companies or state-owned entities that obtain permission to become “integral administrators” and Mexican or non- resident entities and individuals that receive authorization from the Ministry of Finance to be qualified SEZ “investors” and that carry out qualifying “economic productive activities” in an SEZ. The tax benefits available in SEZs for qualifying integral administrators and investors includes, among others: • A 100% reduction of the normal corporate income tax rate for the first 10 fiscal years, and a 50% reduction for the following five fiscal years, subject to certain requirements (except for the Progreso SEZ, which offers accelerated depreciation); • A tax credit equal to 50% of the employer's contribution for illness and maternity insurance for the first 10 fiscal years, reducing to 25% for the following five fiscal years. More information about SEZs is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8935/Mexico/2017/Two-more-SEZs- launched Russia No specific developments. Spain From a corporate tax standpoint, article 37 of the Spanish Corporate Income Tax Act (“CIT”) provides for a tax deduction for employing individuals under 30 years of age. At a national and local level, government subsidies are provided for qualifying training programs. United Kingdom The UK has introduced an Apprenticeship Levy of 0.5% on payroll costs to finance new apprenticeships. At the autumn Budget 2017, a new tax relief for self-funded work related training costs was announced (employer costs are deductible and not a taxable benefit), with consultation currently being undertaken: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/taxation-of- self-funded-work-related-training Summary There is a trend towards implementing tax rules which encourage employers to grow the workforce and also enhance the skills of their employees. Employment is critical for New Zealand’s growth, but it is also important that employees are productive in their work and there is matching between the skills and strengths of employees and the work they are engaged in. An employee using his or her strengths are more likely to be productive and happy in their work. New Zealand should monitor the approach being taken in the United Kingdom of looking at how the tax system can support those needing to upskill and retrain, particularly for those who want or need to change career. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 13 The sharing economy Thinking smarter and utilizing assets and workers is what the sharing economy is about. But have tax systems adapted to ensure these new business models are taxed? We posed the following question: The sharing economy generally refers to people using online platforms to share assets such as their house or car with third parties (think Air BNB, Uber). Is your country doing anything to change the tax rules to ensure these transactions are taxed? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has taken the step of prohibiting Uber, however this has not been successful and Uber still operates. Credit card companies were also mandated not to collect money on behalf of Uber. These moves do not appear to be tax driven. Australia The Australian Taxation Office has engaged in some high profile litigation in respect of the requirement for ridesharing to be registered for GST where it is below the GST threshold of $75,000 (on the basis it is a taxi-service) https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?LocID=%22JUD%2F2017ATC2 0-608%22&PiT=99991231235958 Australia has been proactive at considering taxes and the sharing economy, including holding targeting educations campaigns, such the following three examples related to the sharing economy generally, holiday homes and ride sharing: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/The-sharing-economy-and-tax/ https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Property/In-detail/Holiday-homes/ https://www.ato.gov.au/general/ride-sourcing-and-tax/ The guidance on ride sharing communicates that the Australian Tax Office undertakes data matching in order to ensure drivers are complying with tax obligations. The Black Economy Taskforce has also acknowledged in its interim report that the sharing economy incentivises participation in the black economy https://consult.treasury.gov.au/tax-framework-division/black-economy- taskforce/supporting\_documents/BE\_IR.pdf Brazil There have been discussions on how to adapt the current legislation to the new sharing economy, but nothing concrete has been issued at this point. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 14 Canada The province of Quebec, in its most recent budget, expanded its VAT regime to include non-residents supplying the digital economy. The federal government has recently announced that it is commencing a study to determine whether changes are required. Domestically, the Canadian tax regime encompasses transactions such as Airbnb, Uber, via worldwide taxation and self-reporting requirements. However, no new compliance measures have been introduced. China The government is studying the relevant issues of the sharing economy. However, there have not yet been any announcements of plans to change the existing tax rules. France As from 2019, collaborative platforms will have to transmit the income realised by their users through their platform to allow the tax administration to pre-fill the tax declarations. In addition, a bill will be examined by the Parliament in June. If the bill passes as it is drafted, the platforms will also have to transmit information to their users concerning their tax obligations and a document mentioning the relevant elements to enable them to fill their declaration. Germany Germany is part of the EU's initiative to tax the digital economy. See the following Tax Alert article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-alert-european-union-23-march-2018.pdf Germany has not yet implemented any specific measures relating to the sharing economy. Hungary A proposal has recently been submitted to make online cash registers mandatory at the place of all accommodation services. These registers are hooked to the central data system of the tax authority. Israel At this point there are no tax rules that ensure these transactions are taxed, but this is a current issue under consideration and the tax authorities have stated an intention to publish a position on the sharing economy. Italy There is a specific 21% flat tax on rental fees (colloquially known as the Italian Airbnb tax). This is an optional flat tax on short-term rental (less than 30 days) income. The tax applies to the gross rental income with no deductions available. The 21% rate compares with progressive tax rates ranging from 23% to 43%. Tax Working Group | The sharing economy 15 Japan From an indirect tax perspective, Japan has introduced digital service rules requiring foreign enterprises that provide digital services to Japanese customers to collect and remit Japanese Consumption Tax. Luxembourg There are no current specific rules in Luxembourg. It is noted that there is an EU proposal to tax the digital economy. Mexico In Mexico, there is an electronic tax obligation that, among others, establish the obligation to issue electronic invoices, which are shared with the Mexican tax authorities. Additionally, Mexican banks have the obligation to inform tax authorities when there is cash deposit that exceed a specific threshold. Russia No specific developments. Spain The Spanish Revenue Agency has recently expressed not only concerns, but also action plans to ensure appropriate tax is being collected from online platforms related to the "sharing economy." This comprises both Airbnb, Uber, and online marketplaces (Wallapop, similar to Ebay in the United States). This is being addressed from both a direct tax and indirect tax perspective. The Spanish Revenue Agency has publicly announced its intention to pay particular attention to these businesses and to conduct appropriate tax audit proceedings. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has not yet implemented new laws specific to the sharing economy. Steps are being taken to ensure that platforms selling goods of others share responsibility for collection of VAT. For more information see the following consultation paper regarding a possible options for a split payment mechanism (whereby payment merchants could be required to withhold and remit VAT to HMRC on a real time basis): https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/alternative-method-of-vat- collection-split-payment Summary The sharing economy does not necessarily require special tax rules but it is important that revenue authorities educate taxpayers about tax obligations, particularly to the extent its participants are individuals who have had limited interaction with the tax system due to New Zealand’s approach of not having compulsory personal tax returns. The digital nature of the sharing economy presents facilitates data collection and matching and this is necessary to ensure the sharing economy does not contribute to an increase in the hidden economy. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 16 Information is everything If you can’t collect tax at source, the next best thing is information. Information gives the revenue authority the power to raise assessments and query return positions. We posed the following question: Information is everything and we're starting to get the computer power to process a lot of information and to undertake data matching. Does your country collect a lot of data on a regular basis and use it to verify/audit tax positions? For example, submitting invoices with VAT/GST returns. All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina There are more than 100 information collecting regimes for tax purposes. For example, credit cards, schools, banks, even neighborhoods must report how much money individuals spend. Electronic invoicing is mandatory on most transactions, and any expense higher than USD50 must register who is the buyer to track expenditure. Australia Australia has a legislated system of third party reporting to enable data collection in a uniform and prescribed manner. This includes collection in respect of:  Interest and dividends  Employment income  Government payments  Capital gains tax from the disposal of shares and property  Employment-related foreign source income  Taxable government grants and payments  Payments made to contactors in the building and construction industry, cleaning and courier services  Distributions from partnerships, trusts and managed funds. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Building-confidence/In-detail/Data- matching/?anchor=Legislateddatacollection#Legislateddatacollection Further data collection is undertaken as one-off requests for information, largely around compliance risks. The ATO routinely uses data analytics to assess compliance risks, and to conduct taxpayer reviews. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 17 Brazil Brazilian corporate taxpayers operating in Brazil are required to comply with the Public Digital Bookkeeping System (Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital, SPED), which is replacing paper bookkeeping. The SPED is a new complex and sophisticated data requirement in which taxpayers should file on an annual or monthly basis (and not just in case of audit) all account and tax information available based on standard uniform electronic layout. Canada This type of data is not collected on a regular basis but it may be requested upon audit. China Chinese tax authorities have made efforts to establish information exchange mechanisms with other government departments to regularly collect income-related information for internal matching/audit purposes. China's State Administration of Taxation has launched a program to identify and request certain large businesses to regularly provide their relevant tax and financial information. China has established a nationwide electronic system and all domestic VAT invoices must be issued through the system. France The French Tax Authority is using data mining to verify and audit tax positions for individuals as well as for companies; for example, a lot of transfer pricing information is transmitted. For individuals, most of the information is focused on their accounts. Banks also have important reporting obligations in this area. Germany Data collection by the tax authorities is an important topic in today's environment. Tax auditors generally want to have access to the company's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in order to analyse the company's data. For VAT purposes data analytics has been a common theme for a while. When filing the annual tax returns an electronic balance sheet needs to be submitted so that the tax authorities can verify the data in case of a tax audit. Hungary The use of online cash registers is mandatory to perform certain activities. These cash registers prevent the erasure of items post sale and provide the tax authority with information on a daily basis. As of 1 July 2018 real-time data exchange on transactions, where the invoice includes more than approximately €320 of VAT will become compulsory. Hungary is also taking part in the EU’s Intrastat data collection. Intrastat requires companies to send monthly statistical declarations to national authorities in a close link with the tax system. In addition, taxpayers are required to file EC Sales List reports when trading with other EU Countries. More details about Intrastat are available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/be/Documents/tax/dttl- tax-intrastat-guide-2017.pdf Israel The Israel Tax Authority regularly collects large amounts of data and uses it to verify and audit tax positions. Tax Working Group | Information is everything 18 Italy A lot of information is collected electronically in Italy. For VAT purposes there is a requirement on certain businesses to issue electronic invoices, for example supplies made to public bodies (B2G transactions) must have an electronic invoice issued before payment can be made. An annual VAT return summarizing transactions undertaken in the previous year must be filed. Japan The authorities collect information returns regarding payments subject to withholding tax paid by a company so that they can match with the recipient to ensure they are reporting such payments as income. Luxembourg The filing is more and more under the format of e-filing. Also data is required and exchangeable on the basis of the different exchanges of information in place (exchange of information on request, automatic exchange of information, and spontaneous exchange of information). Mexico The Mexican Tax Authority has a standardized trial balance and taxpayers must upload standardized trial balances on a monthly basis. All Mexican taxpayers must issue invoices electronically in a format established by the Mexican Tax Authority, this is known as “CFDI” (its acronym in Spanish). From 1 January 2018 there is a new 3.3 version of CFDI. These obligations provide the Mexican Tax Authority with a lot of information to verify tax positions and to undertake data matching. Russia Russia is not doing anything special in this area. The tax authorities have a right to request any information they may need to verify the tax position. Spain The Spanish Revenue Agency has a very powerful technology reach and practically all taxpayers must mandatorily file their returns and communicate with the Spanish Revenue Agency electronically. Extensive resources have been invested towards creating a strong information technology system to conduct data matching which often results in tax assessments / audits. From an indirect tax perspective, as of almost a year ago, VAT information is being submitted for qualifying taxpayers practically on a real-time basis as per Suministro Inmediato de Información (SII) system, which is conducted entirely online and provides the Spanish Revenue Agency with various sources of VAT data to reduce tax evasion. United Kingdom The UK requires iXBRL tagged accounts and tax computations for companies. It does not require any transaction data. The government is consulting on requiring digital record keeping and return submission for VAT, which is due to be introduced in April 2019. It may require the same for self-employed and landlords but not before April 2020. This project is called “Making Tax Digital” and more information is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/7510/United- Kingdom/2017/Consultation-published-on-making-tax-digital “For VAT purposes data analytics has been a common theme for a while.” Tax Working Group | Information is everything 19 Summary Data collection is becoming an important tool to ensure tax compliance in a cost effective way for tax authorities. It will be important to seriously consider compliance costs for taxpayers before pursuing a regime where large amounts of data are routinely collected. If additional information reporting is required, then on the basis that any enhanced information reporting increases tax compliance (and so tax revenues), consideration could be given to compensating entities which are required to report additional information. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 20 The company tax rate The headline tax rate can have a significant impact on the allure of a country for international investors. If New Zealand’s company tax rate stays at 28% what sort of competition will we be facing? We posed the following question: A number of countries have dropped company tax rates recently. Is your country actively considering a company tax rate reduction? Is your country planning to keep the company tax rate the same but change effective tax rates in other ways (e.g. through enhanced deductions)? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina - The company tax rate in Argentina is 30% The company tax rate has just been reduced to 30% this year and will be further reduced to 25% in 2020. Australia - The company tax rate in Australia is 30% Australia aims to reduce the large company corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over 10 years. The government has already legislated a company tax rate cut for small business up to AU$50million turnover. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/company-tax/ https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Changes-to-company-tax- rates/?page=1#Base\_rate\_entity\_company\_tax\_rate In addition to dropping the company tax rate, certain tax incentives exist. For example there is a $20,000 instant asset write off available up to 30 June 2018. For more information see the following link from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/newsroom/smallbusiness/lodging-and- paying/$20,000-instant-asset-write-off/ The National Science and Innovation agenda includes some tax initiatives including Research & Development Tax Credits: https://www.innovation.gov.au/ Brazil – The company tax rate is 15% but various surtaxes provide an effective tax rate of 34% The Brazilian government is considering a corporate income tax rate reduction but nothing concrete been enacted as yet. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 21 Canada - The federal company tax rate in Canada is 15%. Provisional general corporate income tax rates range from 11.5% to 16% There is no planned reduction to the general federal corporate tax rate. However, the federal government has announced a review of the impact of US tax reform on Canada. The federal government and certain provinces have recently reduced the tax rate on small corporations. China - The company tax rate in China is 25% Qualifying small businesses may enjoy a tax rate reduction so that the effective corporate income tax rate is only 10%. China plans to significantly expand the scope of small businesses eligible for this incentive. France - The company tax rate in France is 28% for the first €500,000 taxable profit and 33.33% thereafter The French Parliament just voted for a corporate income tax reduction. The corporate income tax rate will gradually be reduced to 25% by 2022 over a four-year period (2018-2022). More information is available here: https://www.taxathand.com/article/8954/France/2017/Parliament-adopts- second-amended-finance-bill-for-2017-and-finance-bill-for-2018 Germany - The company tax rate in Germany is approximately 30%. This is made up of a base rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge and a variable local trade tax Germany is currently not considering a tax rate reduction or changing effective tax rates in other ways. Hungary - The company tax rate in Hungary is 9% Hungary already has a rather low corporate income tax rate of 9%. Israel - The company tax rate in Israel is 23% Since 2015, the corporate tax rate has been reduced (2015: 26.5%, 2016: 25%, 2017: 24%, 2018: 23%) and they will be reduced further in the future. In addition at the beginning of 2017, there was an amendment to the Israeli encouragement law, which introduces a new route of tax benefits that in case a company will meet some terms the corporate tax rate applying to that company can be reduced to 7.5%. Some examples where reduced corporate tax rates will apply are set out in this guidance: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/internation al-business-support/deloitte-cn-ibs-israel-int-tax-en-2017.pdf Italy – The company tax rate is 24% In Italy the company tax rate was reduced from 27.5% to 24% from 1 January 2017. There is an addition 3.5% surcharge on financial institutions. There are also accelerated depreciation deductions available for investments in tangible assets and R&D incentives which reduce the effective tax rate further. Japan - The effective company tax rate in Japan ranges between 30%-34% depending on the size of the company. Over the past few years Japan has dropped its effective tax rate to about 30%. There are no known plans for further reductions. Tax Working Group | The company tax rate 22 Luxembourg - The company tax rate in Luxembourg is approximately 26%. This is made up of a base rate of 18%, a surcharge for the employment fund and a variable local trade tax There was a main tax reform with a reduction of corporate tax rate over the last two years (from 29.22% to 26.01% for entities located in Luxembourg City). See the following article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax-reform-2017.html Mexico - The company tax rate in Mexico is 30% The Mexican income tax rate applicable to entities is 30%. There is no current expectation of a rate reduction or enhanced deductions. Russia - The company tax rate in Russia is 20% A corporate tax rate of 20% has been in place in Russia for many years and there are no expectations that the rate will change in near future. Spain - The company tax rate in Spain is 25% Following an overhaul to taxing legislation, effective 1 January 2015, the corporate tax rate was reduced from 30% to 25%. As a compromise to the corporate tax reduction (which is not expected to be reduced any further) most historical deductions were eradicated. The current corporate tax deductions revolve around R&D, film/audiovisual/artistic productions, employment creation, and hiring of disabled individuals. The Spanish government is actively trying to increase tax revenue collection and in has for a period had a minimum corporate tax installment based on the accounting result (i.e. if tax due under the tax rules is lower, the minimum corporate tax installment must be paid). The corporate tax rate for installment payments was also increased for large-sized enterprises so that it better matches the effective tax rate borne in the final balancing payment. United Kingdom - The company tax rate in the United Kingdom is 19% The UK has a 19% corporate tax rate and has legislated for a 17% from April 2020. It offers an effective 10% rate on certain income from patents. It offers enhanced deductions for enhanced R&D costs and for qualifying creative industries costs e.g. films, animation etc. No new incentives have been announced in the last 2 years. Summary Tax rates involve a series of trade-offs between taxing mobile and immobile capital and labour. It is clear that many other countries have and are considering a reduction in company tax rates. Some of this is likely to have been driven by a need for competitiveness and in part be a reaction to other countries. In addition, it may also be an acknowledgment that company taxes can be more harmful to economic growth than other forms of tax. Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 23 What else can be taxed? We tax a broad range of things in different ways, but are there other things which could also be taxed? We posed the following question: Income taxes, capital gains tax, employment taxes, consumption taxes (VAT/GST) are all fairly common. Does your country tax other things? (e.g., environmental taxes) Is your country considering any new types of taxes? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina has a number of taxes: VAT and GST; a tax on minimum presumed income (however this has been repealed from 2019); a 1% stamp tax on written agreements; personal assets tax, which is a tax on the net wealth of individuals each year; tax on use of bank accounts. In addition to taxes there are numerous withholding systems which accelerate collection and increase the administrative burden on taxpayers. Australia Australia has a comprehensive capital gains tax regime, and goods and services tax. At the state level, there are a number of taxes imposed including payroll tax, land tax and stamp duty on a transfer of real property. Recently, Australia has introduced a Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) for taxing permanent establishment avoidance and a Diverted Profits Tax (DPT). More information is available here: https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/International-tax-for-business/In- detail/Doing-business-in-Australia/Combating-multinational-tax-avoidance-- -a-targeted-anti-avoidance-law/ and here: https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-detail/direct- taxes/income-tax-for-businesses/diverted-profits-tax/ Brazil Apart from the several layers of VAT (Federal, State and Municipal), Brazil imposes Excise Tax, Import Duty, Financial transactions tax, property tax, transfer tax, capital gain tax (resident and non-resident), inheritance state tax, income tax (corporate and individual), social security, taxes on specific cross border payments (technical services and royalties), withholding taxes, amongst others. Brazil has also initiated discussions on the indirect taxation of the digital economy on a State and Municipal level. Brazil is not currently considering any new taxes. Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 24 Canada Canada has indicated a commitment to some form of carbon tax to be implemented by the provinces/territories as they determine. Some jurisdictions have already introduced measures. Canada has indicated that it will review the taxation of the digital economy. China China has Resource Tax (which is imposed on various mineral resources) and Environment Protection Tax (which is imposed on taxable pollutants). The Environment Protection Tax started to be collected from 1 January 2018; noting this tax was previously collected as a fee charged by government authorities. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/tax/tax- newsflash/deloitte-cn-tax-newsflash-bilingual-161229.pdf France France has created many other taxes, such as environmental taxes. In addition, France is one of the country’s leading the discussion which are taking place at the EU level to tax digital services. Germany Germany has a variety of other taxes like e.g. real estate transfer tax, real estate tax and other consumption and indirect taxes. Germany is currently not considering any new types of taxes. Hungary Hungary has special taxes for the energy sector, financial institutions, telecommunications, utility pipes and insurance companies. It cannot be excluded that more special taxes will be proposed in the future. Israel No new tax types are currently being considered. Italy Italy imposes real estate tax (a levy of 0.76% on immovable property); transfer taxes on all transactions involving real property; a stamp duty of €2 on any invoices zero-rated for VAT purposes that exceed €77.47; a “Tobin Tax” applies in the form of a stamp duty on transfers of shares and other financial instruments issued by Italian companies (the rate is 0.2% of the transaction value, reduced to 0.1% where the sale takes place on a listed market). Japan Japan has a number of other taxes, for example:  Depreciable asset tax - tax imposed on value of depreciable assets  Real estate registration tax - tax imposed on value of real estate when transferred  Stamp duty  Business premise tax - imposed on amount of office space used More details of these taxes are available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-japanguide-2017.pdf?nc=1 Tax Working Group | What else can be taxed? 25 Luxembourg To increase the level of building sales there is a temporary lower tax rate. More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax-reform-2017.html Mexico No new tax types are currently being considered. Russia An ecological levy has recently been introduced. It is payable by virtually all manufacturers and importers in Russia. Spain There are so-called "green taxes" in Spain and corporations engaged in the hydrocarbon industry suffer a higher tax rate and reduced benefits. A "sugar tax" for the beverage industry has also been the subject of debate in congress. United Kingdom The UK has recently introduced a soft drinks industry levy and is considering a tax on single use plastics. It has various environmental taxes and an air passenger duty. Details of yield from taxes can be obtained from the Office of Budgetary Responsibility analysis; with the soft drinks industry levy collecting less than half the amount forecast (refer page 213): http://cdn.obr.uk/EFO-MaRch\_2018.pdf Summary While there are a wide range of different taxes around the world, what is not known from the information above is the level of efficiency and effectiveness of these taxes. Taxes are about raising revenue required for Governments; our tax system should therefore favour taxes which are the most effective and efficient. Any new taxes would add compliance costs which need to be considered in assessing the merits of such. Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 26 Influencing behaviour The tax system has the ability to operate as a carrot or a stick. In general New Zealand has sought to avoid picking winners and losers. We posed the following question: Tobacco taxes and alcohol excise tax are fairly common. Some believe there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally aim to modify behaviour. Does your country impose taxes on "bad" things? (For example sugar, plastic bags) Does your country do anything in the tax system to incentivise "good" things? (For example exempting healthy food from VAT/GST tax) If so, is there any evidence this is effective? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Argentina imposes excise taxes on many items, including alcoholic beverages, sodas, expensive cars, etc. There was a plan to reduce excise tax on sodas depending on the level of sugar, but this was ultimately not implemented, but may still occur. Sodas with natural juice pay less tax. Australia Australia levies excise taxes on items such as alcohol and tobacco, fuel and petroleum products. https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/ Australia has resisted calls for taxes on sugar and plastic bags. The current GST system exempts many items e.g. unprocessed foods, education, health etc. See the following page from the ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/when-to-charge-gst-(and-when-not- to)/gst-free-sales/#MainGSTfreeproductsandservices Brazil Brazil levies excise taxes. These taxes are higher on certain products such as guns and tobacco. Canada Canada regularly increases tax rates on tobacco and is planning a tax regime for recreational cannabis once legal in July 2018. Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 27 China China has a "Consumption Tax" (which is somewhat like other countries' excise tax). The Consumption Tax is imposed on certain luxury goods (e.g. luxury watches, luxury cosmetics, golf balls and accessories, etc.) and energy-consumptive/highly pollutant or resource-incentive goods (e.g. certain cells/batteries, coatings, etc.). More information is available here: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dtt l-tax-chinaguide-2017.pdf?nc=1 China has some VAT and income tax incentives to encourage renewable energy (e.g. wind power) and waste recycling (e.g. reclaimed water, construction materials made from solid wastes). France The most relevant are the taxes on sodas, applicable since 2013. A new scale will enter into force as from July 2018. The current rate of tax for beverages with added sugar is €7.5 a hectolitre. This will soon start at 1g sugar/100ml; rising to €20 a hectolitre for drinks with more than 11g/100ml. France has also banned free refills of fizzy drinks in restaurants. Germany Germany imposes consumption taxes on a lot of "bad" things, for example alcohol, tobacco, gas, air travel, etc. Certain items like medical products and certain types of food benefit from a reduced 7% VAT rate instead of the general 19% VAT rate. Most of these incentives however were introduced to generate revenue and not so much to influence the consumption behavior of the population. Whether the introduction of such measures is effective and creates a significant effect on the consumption behavior is heavily discussed amongst tax practitioners and scholars. We are not aware of any evidence for the success of any such measures in Germany. Hungary Excise taxes are levied on alcoholic products, tobacco, fuel and products containing sugar. In addition, environmental taxes are levied on the manufacture of certain products (e.g. batteries). A reduced VAT rate is applied on certain meats, such as chicken or fish. Israel There are very high taxes on items such as cigarettes. Italy No such taxes have been imposed. Japan Japan has a liquor, tobacco and gasoline tax. Luxembourg For "good" things, there are some incentives in connection with green mobility (electric car, electric bikes etc). “Whether the introduction of such measures is effective and creates a significant effect on the consumption behavior is heavily discussed amongst tax practitioners and scholars. We are not aware of any evidence for the success of any such measures in Germany.” Tax Working Group | Influencing behaviour 28 Mexico Regarding incentives, there is a special limit for the deduction of hybrids cars as well as for assets uses in the generation of renewable energy. A 0% VAT rate applies to products to be use as food (exceptions apply), books and medicines. Russia In Russia there are regular excise taxes and VAT. Lower VAT can apply to certain categories of goods (such as certain food and groceries). Spain There are currently more taxes on "bad" things than on promoting or incentivizing "good" things. United Kingdom The UK has introduced taxes on sugary drinks and consultation on single use plastics. Wales is considering a vacant homes levy. There is 100% tax relief on certain environmental equipment and lower tax rates on electric and low emission cars. Summary Whether the tax system is best way to influence behavior may depend on the particular behavior in question. In many instances other approaches, such as education, are likely to be a better option and lead to more successful outcomes rather than applying the tax “stick”. Tax Working Group | Housing 29 Housing Housing is a complex problem, is tax an easy solution to solve the problem? We posed the following question: There is a concern that there is a housing shortage in New Zealand and this is influencing housing affordability. There are many ways to attack this problem but it is unclear whether the tax system should be used to address this shortage. Does your tax system do anything to incentivise the increase in the supply of housing? Does your tax system do anything to disincentivise investment in housing? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Employees are only permitted to claim a limited number of deductible expenses, one of them is the interest paid on mortgages. Australia The Australian Federal Government announced about 10 initiatives to promote housing affordability in 2017-18. See the following fact sheets: http://budget.gov.au/2017-18/content/glossies/factsheets.htm Brazil There are no specific initiatives. Canada The province of British Columbia has introduced a levy on unoccupied homes with a view towards making more residential spaces available. China The current policy objectives of the government for real estate sector are to cool off the market and control the ever rising high price of residential property so that the middle-/low-income group of people can afford their housing. Therefore, most tax incentives in the real estate sector are granted to the supply of middle-/low-end housing which are designated to be provided to the middle-/low-income group, e.g. exemptions from stamp duty, urban land use tax, etc. Supply of high-end housing may face less favourable tax treatment, e.g. higher profit rate when tax authorities assessed the taxable profit. The government is also considering the expansion of the scope of real estate tax to include certain residential properties. Tax Working Group | Housing 30 France France has chosen to put into place a tax on vacant units. Some tax incentives favour rental investment. As from 2018, the French government has been willing to incentive financial investment rather than investment in housing by refocusing the wealth tax only on real estate. Germany The German tax system does not incentivize the increase in the supply of housing. The last tax incentive for supporting housing was abandoned back in 1995. There are certain non-tax incentives for the supply of housing, the current government is planning to introduce an incentive for families with children in the form of a cash payment. There are no specific tax measures that disincentivise housing. Hungary Hungary levies a reduced 5% VAT on certain building constructions and offers allowances from real estate duties for first-time real estate owners and on certain new apartments. Savings accounts dedicated for real estate ownership are supported with supplemental credits. In addition, the “CSOK” aid grants up to approximately €32,000 for the creation of family homes (exact amount is based on the number of children in the family). Extraordinarily favourable loan opportunities are also part of the CSOK package. Israel Israel, especially across Tel-Aviv, has a problem with a lack of housing. Consequently housing is very expensive and difficult to purchase. In light of the housing shortage in 2017, the tax authorities issued a rule which states that there will be tax on each person that has more than 2.5 apartments. Italy There is no housing shortage in Italy. Despite this there are many incentives to purchase and restore homes. Japan Japan allows a deduction for interest on a mortgage. Luxembourg To increase the level of building sales, there is a temporary lower tax rate and other initiatives such as a 50% tax exemption for rental income derived from qualifying social dwellings. See the following article for more information: https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/tax/articles/tax- reform-2017.html Mexico There is a personal deduction available for all individuals for mortgage interest payments when mortgage credit is up to approximately US$243,000. Note, all personal deduction are limited to the lower of 15% of the total income, or the equivalent to approximately US$7,900. Additionally, Mexico has a tax exemption for individuals on the sale of a primary residence. Russia Russia has a tax exemption for individuals on the sale of primary residence after 5 years of ownership. Tax Working Group | Housing 31 Spain There are incentives from an individual tax perspective as there are tax benefits related to one's primary home. On the other hand, ownership of a second home which is kept for one's sole enjoyment (i.e. it is not rented) is subject to a certain degree of additional taxation. United Kingdom The UK has introduced several measures to make it more costly to be a buy-to-let landlord. These include a 3% supplement on purchasing property and a limit on the deductible of finance costs (so they are deducted at the 20% basic rate and not the landlord's marginal rate, which could be 40% or 45%). Summary It is clear that New Zealand is not unique in having issues associated with housing. The range of examples expressed above indicate there are a number of ways to tackle the problem. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 32 Retirement savings With an aging and expanding population that is also living longer, the youth of today can expect a very different world when they come to retire. Universal superannuation may be a thing of the past in 2058, so should there be incentives now to save for the future? We posed the following question: More people are reaching retirement age, we're expecting more "baby boomers" to start retiring. Is your country doing anything to incentive savings? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina Certain financial products are exempt from tax. Australia Whilst Australia does not have specific savings incentives, the tax incentives within the superannuation system are attractive to savers. Australia has both a compulsory and voluntary superannuation savings. The compulsory regime is the superannuation guarantee scheme which requires employers to contribute superannuation contributions of 9.5% of an employee’s ordinary-time earnings to superannuation (this will eventually increase to 12% in financial year 2025-2026). Employees can also make contributions either as salary sacrificed (before tax) or after tax contributions subject to a capping system. More information on the taxation settings of the Australian superannuation system can be found on page 3 of this Budget 2016 fact sheet: http://www.budget.gov.au/2016- 17/content/glossies/tax\_super/downloads/FS-Super/01-SFS- budget\_narrative-161109.pdf The Re:think Tax Discussion Paper (March 2015) also provide a full summary of the taxation of savings in Australia (pages 57-72): http://bettertax.gov.au/files/2015/03/TWP\_combined-online.pdf In addition Australia operates under a dividend imputation system which imputes a credit for tax paid at a company level to the shareholder. This provides an incentive for Australian residents to invest in Australia companies. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 33 Brazil Specific retirement funds benefit from a withholding tax exemption. Canada Canada has a registered retirement savings plan regime which provides a tax deduction for contributions and tax deferred growth accumulation. As well, a tax-free saving account has been introduced to further encourage savings. There are limitations on contribution amounts to both. China China has been encouraging employing companies to set up annuities for employees by providing an income tax deferral treatment, i.e. the income tax will not arise until the withdrawal. China recently launched a pilot programme to provide income tax deferral treatment to individuals who purchase qualifying commercial pension insurance products. France France have some measures to orientate savings to certain types of investments helping the financing of specific companies or sectors. Germany There are specific retirement plans that are tax subsidized. Payments out of the general old age insurance are generally taxable whereas contributions into the old age insurance system are tax deductible. Hungary Hungary have quite limited incentives. Voluntary contributions in pension funds are supplemented with another 20% of the in-payment as a tax allowance. Israel In 2017 the Social Security started to save 50ILS (US$14) monthly for each child aged under 18. Italy Italy has always implemented a favourable tax regime for savings. For example there are generally no capital taxes and there are favourable tax rates for interest. Japan Japan introduced NISA (National Individual Savings Account) which can accumulate earnings tax free (subject to limitations). Luxembourg There are dedicated tax regimes for optional retirement regimes with tax deductions. Mexico Until the mid-1990s, the country had a traditional defined-benefits pension system, which was administered by the government. However, this system was modified in 1997 and since then each worker have their own pension account. Pensions are no longer administered by the Mexican Social Security Institute, and have been passed into the hands of administradoras de fondos para el retiro (AFORES), or retirement funds administrators, which opened the way for private participation in the segment. Tax Working Group | Retirement savings 34 It is important to mention that this pension funds are funded through contributions made by the employee, employer and government. Under Mexican income tax law, personal pension account contributions are available to be claimed as a taxable deduction for the individual subject to certain requirements and limits. Russia There are no specific initiatives. Spain Tax incentives for savings are small and one could say they do not have a real impact on large figures. The Social Security system needs to find new ways of funding, but real decisions have yet to be reached. More could probably done. United Kingdom The UK has Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) which allow an individual to save £20,000 annually in a tax-exempt environment. There are Lifetime ISAs and Help to Buy ISAs which offer additional incentives to save (supplements paid in by the government). An individual's main residence is exempt from capital gains tax. Pension saving follows the EET model, with limits on the amount that can be saved. The UK introduced auto-enrolment for pensions, where all employers have to enroll employees in a pension with a minimum employer and employee contribution. Employees may opt out but few do; the numbers saving has increased significantly. The minimum contributions are due to rise and naturally there is concern that more employees could opt out. “More could probably be done.” Summary The taxed-taxed-exempt (TTE) approach in New Zealand differs from many other countries and there is merit in exploring how New Zealand could reduce taxes on savings so as to grow the domestic supply of capital. Tax Working Group | Other examples 35 Other examples The catch-all. Is there anything else unusual out there in the tax world that New Zealand could consider? We posed the following question: Are there particular tax issues / challenges your country is facing? Has your country done (or considering) anything unique or novel with its tax rules? All responses are general in nature and should not be relied on without further detailed advice. Argentina The level of non-declared sales is very high, mainly by small companies and shops. It was recently made mandatory to accept debit cards, which helps tracking sales. Electronic invoicing is also expected to increase tracking to reduce non declared sales. Australia Due to the political make-up of the Senate, the Australian government is not tackling significant tax reform initiatives apart from multinational tax avoidance, housing affordability and risks in respect of the black economy. Brazil There are ongoing discussions of tax and social security reforms which are necessary to recover the economy of the country. In addition, there are current discussion on the creation of a unified VAT system to reduce complexity. Canada Canada offers R&D incentives. China No. France No. Germany The tax environment in German is relatively stable, the last change in tax rates and a major overhaul of the corporate tax system took place in 2008. There are currently no plans to do anything unique or novel in the area of Germany's tax rules. Germany is one of the few countries that does not offer any R&D tax incentives. Hungary No. Tax Working Group | Other examples 36 Israel No. Italy Web taxation has been introduced and should apply from 1 January 2019. This is a 3% tax on certain internet transactions (this was originally proposed to be 6%). The tax is levied on firms buying “intangible digital products” such as online advertising and sponsored linked embedded in webpages. There is a de minimis threshold of 3,000 transactions in a calendar year before the tax applies. More information on this tax is available here: http://newsletters.usdbriefs.com/2017/Tax/WTA/171215\_5.pdf Japan As a means to more effectively utilize tax authority resources, the tax authority introduced a tax governance program whereby companies, which show that they have good tax governance and are in communication with the tax authorities prior to large transactions, can be subject to less frequent tax audits. Luxembourg No. Mexico No. Russia Russia has "deoffshorization" laws in place incentivising Russian based activities and punishing "tax heaven" activities. Spain From an individual income tax perspective, a new Form 720 was introduced to report assets held abroad by Spanish tax residents (similar to the US's FBAR declaration). United Kingdom The UK has implemented a Diverted Profits tax. The UK is considering turnover tax on certain digital businesses, probably as part of an EU initiative. See the following link for more information: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/corporate-tax-and-the- digital-economy-position-paper Summary Each system has its own nuances and tax policy changes will be made bearing in mind the challenges faced and the nuances of the particular system. What is interesting to observe is there is no indication of moves away from traditional sources of tax to “new” or “novel” methods of taxation.

The Human Rights Commission (Commission) welcomes the opportunity to make this submission to the Tax Working Group (Working Group). The Commission is New Zealand’s National Human Rights Institution (NHRI). NHRI’s promote and monitor the domestic implementation of international human rights standards as part of the United Nation’s (UN) human rights system. The Commission is accredited as an “A Status” NHRI, meaning that it meets the required standards of practice and independence set by the Global Alliance of NHRIs and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. 2. Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights has stated that “tax policy is, in many respects, human rights policy.” 1 That is because human rights standards offer a universal and comprehensive normative framework in which tax policy can be assessed. The duty under the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) to devote the “maximum available resources” to economic, social and cultural rights gives legal force to demands for effective and fair taxation systems which contribute to the realisation of human rights for all. The human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination also reinforce understandings of fairness which at times is trumped in tax policy by the pursuit of efficiency. Tax also plays a key role in shaping how accountable governments are to their people. 3. This link between tax policy and human rights is not necessarily an intuitive one. However, it has been increasingly addressed by UN bodies and can be summed up as follows: 2 1 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, A/HRC/29/31 (26 May 2015) para. 53, http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage\_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/29/31. 2 See Olivier De Schutter, Taxing for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, Institute for Interdisciplinary Research in Legal sciences (May 2017) https://sites.uclouvain.be/cridho/documents/Working.Papers/CRIDHO-WP-2017-29May%202017- O.DeSchutter3.pdf; Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, A/HRC/29/31 (26 May 2015) http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage\_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/29/31; Philip Alston, Keynote Address at Christian Aid conference on the Human Rights Impact of Tax and Fiscal Policy, “Tax Policy is Human Rights Policy: The Irish Debate” (12 February, 2015) http://www.rightingfinance.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/speech.pdf; Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, A/HRC/26/28 (22 May 2014) https://documents-dds- ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/033/74/PDF/G1403374.pdf?OpenElement. 3 a. Resource availability: Tax allows States to raise revenue to fund human rights expenditure, such as for health, education, housing, social protection, all of which are indispensable human rights. b. Redistribution of wealth: Tax allows for States to redistribute wealth from the richest part of the population to the poor. The regressive or progressive nature of a State’s tax structure shapes the allocation of income and assets across the population, and thereby affects the right to equality and non-discrimination. c. Accountability: Tax policy is central to democratic accountability and the human rights principles of participation and transparency, including around how decisions about tax are reached and what decisions are made. Tax policies reflect the real priorities of government to which it needs to be held accountable. 4. The Commission’s submission focuses on this relationship between tax policy and human rights. It makes the following recommendations to the Working Group: a. Adopt a human rights-based approach to its review of New Zealand’s tax system, grounded in international human rights standards and directed at promoting and protecting human rights. b. Consider the following principles in the design, development, implementation and evaluation of tax policy and budget allocations: i. Non-discrimination and equality ii. Mobilising “maximum of available resources” iii. Access to information, transparency, accountability and participation c. Call on the Government to implement the following recommendations of the UN Committee for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights following its review of New Zealand in March 2018: i. Take measures to ensure the maximisation of the resources allocated for the realisation of Covenant rights, including by making the necessary adjustments to the Public Finance Act 1989 by introducing human rights impact assessments. ii. Give appropriate consideration of the Government’s ICESCR obligations when fiscal and resource generation and allocation decisions are made. 4 iii. Ensure resources dedicated to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are underpinned by the obligations under ICESCR. d. Ensure transparency and accountability in tax policy, including through broad public participation; analysis of the distributional consequences and tax burden borne by different income sectors and disadvantaged groups; and by considering gender impacts of tax policy. 5. The Commission is happy to be contacted for further discussion on this submission. We have included a list of resources that the Working Group may find useful at the end of the submission. International human rights law and tax policy 6. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development incorporates 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focused on social, economic, political, cultural and environmental development through good governance, the rule of law, access to justice, personal security, and the fight against inequality. 3 7. The SDGs are explicitly grounded in human rights derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and core UN human rights treaties. 4 In particular, the goals and their targets reflect many of the rights set out in the ICESCR, 5 including, among others, the right to education, the right to health, the right to an adequate standard of living, non-discrimination and gender equality. 6 The implementation of the SDGs is dependent on good governance, transparency, participation and accountability. 3 For an overview of the relationship between the SDGs, human rights and corruption see Angela Barkhouse, Hugo Hoyland and Marc Limon, Policy Brief Corruption: A Human Rights Impact Assessment, Universal Rights Group, https://www.universal-rights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Policy\_report\_corruption\_LR\_spread.pdf. 4 UN General Assembly Resolution 70/1 (25 September 2015) para. 10. The Danish National Human Rights Institute has completed a full analysis of all SDGs mapped to all human rights treaties. See The Human Rights Guide to “A Blueprint for the Sustainable Development Goals, http://sdg.humanrights.dk/. 5 See Report of the UN Secretary-General on the Question of the realization in all Countries of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, A/HRC/34/25 (14 December 2015) para.10 (“Many of the targets under the Goals explicitly reflect the content of relevant international human rights standards. Many address availability, accessibility, affordability and quality of education, health, water and other services related to those rights. The goals include targets on access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all, universal health coverage, free equitable and quality primary and secondary education, access to safe and affordable water, sanitation, hygiene and housing, and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.”) 6 UN General Assembly Resolution 70/1 (25 September 2015) paras. 8, 10. 5 8. New Zealand is legally bound by the key human rights treaties that underpin the SDGs, giving rise to obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. Most important, when it comes to tax policy, is the ICESCR ratified by the Government in 1978, which protects the most fundamental needs of citizens – the right to health, the right to work, the right to education and the right to an adequate standard of living including food and housing. Under the ICESCR, the Government agreed to: take steps . . . to the maximum of its available resources, with a view of achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognised in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures. 7 9. With this provision, the Government’s decisions about how it will mobilise resources and how it defines its spending priorities become human rights issues, which will be discussed further below. 10. At the core of the ICESCR is the wellbeing and dignity of people, which forms the foundation of the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework, setting out four capitals (financial/physical, natural, social, human) against which government policy can be assessed. 11. The close relationship between government’s tax policy and human rights has been increasingly recognised by UN treaty body committees that monitor the ICESCR and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as by Special Rapporteurs and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 12. In 2012, the UN Secretary General observed that progressive tax policies play an important role in addressing inequality and poverty and called for Governments to consider a combination of progressive income taxes and highly redistributive transfers to decrease income inequality and its impact on social development. 8 13. Two years later, former UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, presented a report to the UN Human Rights Council on tax policy and human rights. The report explained the scope and content 7 Article 2(1). Similarly, the Government has agreed under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 4) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 4(2)) to take measures to the maximum extent of their available resources to implement the rights recognised in the Conventions. 8 Report of the Secretary-General, The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order and an assessment of the implications of inequality for development, A/67/394 (26 September 2012) para. 56 http://undocs.org/A/67/394. 6 of human rights principles and obligations relevant to tax policy. It reminded States that: Although taxation policy may seem far removed from the daily problems of the poor, it in fact plays a major role in determining and adjusting levels of inequality in a society and in funding essential services, social protection and poverty reduction measures; it is therefore central to realizing the rights and defining the opportunities of people living in poverty. 9 14. The current Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has also emphasised the impact tax policy has on levels of inequality, stating: The regressive or progressive nature of a State’s tax structure, and the groups and purposes for which it gives exemptions or deductions, shapes the allocation of income and assets across the population, and thereby affects levels of inequality and human rights enjoyment. 10 15. In 2017, the OHCHR published a guide titled “Realizing Human Rights Through Government Budgets”. The publication explores the link between international human rights obligations and budget policies and processes. 11 It provides a guide for governments on their human rights obligations as they develop and implement revenue-raising schemes, decide on budget allocations and implement planned expenditure and assess budget’s impact on the realisation of human rights. 16. Moreover, in December 2017, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights published a report on “Poverty and Human Rights in the Americas”, calling on Governments to adopt human rights-based fiscal policies to eradicate poverty, recognising that "the principles of human rights constitute a framework that underpins the key functions of fiscal policy and taxation.” 12 The Inter-American Commission identified three factors preventing government fiscal policies from reducing poverty: insufficient tax revenues; regressive nature of tax systems; and insufficient social spending. 17. Drawing on this material, the Commission recommends that the Tax Working Group adopts a human rights-based approach to its review of New Zealand’s tax system. A 9 Ibid., para. 3. 10 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, A/HRC/29/31 (26 May 2015), para. 53, http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage\_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/29/31. 11 UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2017), Realizing Human Rights Through Government Budgets, http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/RealizingHRThroughGovernmentBudgets.pdf. 12 The report was published in Spanish but a summary has been proved by the Center for Economic and Social Rights, http://www.cesr.org/iachr-calls-states-adopt-human-rights-based-fiscal-policies-eradicate-poverty. 7 human rights-based approach is one that is based on international human rights standards and directed at promoting and protecting human rights. According to the United Nations Development Group, a human rights-based approach includes the following human rights principles and standards: a. Universality and Inalienability: Everyone is entitled to human rights. b. Indivisibility: Economic, social and cultural right have equal status to civil and political rights. c. Inter-dependence: Realisation of one right is often dependent on the realisation of others. d. Equality and Non-discrimination: All humans are equal and entitled to human rights without discrimination. e. Participation and Inclusion: All humans are entitled to meaningful participation and inclusion in the enjoyment of human rights. f. Accountability and Rule of Law: States and businesses are accountable for observance of human rights and rule of law. 13 18. A human rights-based approach to tax policy may help to focus efforts on those who are most at risk, most marginalised and most vulnerable, or, to use the terminology of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, those who are “left furthest behind.” Key human rights principles in relation to tax policy 19. The Commission encourages the Working Group to consider the human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination, maximum available resources, and participation and accountability to guide all phases of the design, development, implementation and evaluation of tax policy. We elaborate on these principles below. Equality and Non-discrimination 20. The rights to equality and non-discrimination are a central tenet of international 14 and 13 United Nations Development Group, The Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding Among UN Agencies (2003) https://undg.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/6959- The\_Human\_Rights\_Based\_Approach\_to\_Development\_Cooperation\_Towards\_a\_Common\_Understanding\_am ong\_UN.pdf. 14 International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Article 3 (“The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant”); ICESCR, Article 2.2 (“The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to guarantee that the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race, 8 domestic 15 human rights law and require that any action or omission by the State must not discriminate, either directly or indirectly, against any individual or group, on specified grounds. 21. The Commission considers income and wealth inequality to be the most pressing issues that requires addressing under the current tax system. Major international institutions such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have acknowledged that extreme inequalities in wealth and income are economically inefficient and socially damaging. However, large disparities in wealth and income continue to exist in New Zealand. An estimated 15-16% of New Zealanders live in poverty. 16 Of those, 27% are children living in households with income that is 60% or less of New Zealand’s median household income. 17 Furthermore, in 2017, 28% of income growth went to 1% of New Zealanders and the 1.4 million people who make up the poorest 30% of the population got just 1%. 18 22. According to the former Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, compliance with the rights to equality and non-discrimination requires States to: set up a progressive tax system with real redistributive capacity that preserves, and progressively increases, the income of poorer households. It also implies that affirmative action measures aimed at assisting the most disadvantaged individuals and groups that have suffered from historical or persistent discrimination, such as well-designed subsidies or tax exemptions, would not be discriminatory. In contrast, a flat tax whereby all people are required to pay an equal portion of their income would not be conducive in achieving substantive equality, as it limits the redistributive function of taxation. 19 colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”); ICCPR Article 26 (“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this respect, the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”) 15 Section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act provides that “Everyone has the right to freedom from discrimination on the grounds of discrimination in the Human Rights Act 1993.” Section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 sets out the prohibited grounds of discrimination, which include among other things sex, race, ethnic or national origins, disability, and age. 16 Perry, B.

Wellington: Ministry of Social Development, https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our- work/publications-resources/monitoring/household-incomes/. New Zealand has no official definition of poverty, so various measures are used, such as the percentage of those earning less than 60% of the median household income after housing costs. 17 Office of the Children’s Commissioner, Child Poverty Monitor, Defined as households with income 60% or less of New Zealand’s median household income, adjusted after housing costs, tax and for family size and type – see Child Poverty Monitor 2017, http://www.childpoverty.co.nz/flow-infographics/income-poverty-2016 18 https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/richest-1-kiwis-bagged-28-all-wealth-created-last-year 19 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, A/HRC/26/28 (22 May 2014) para. 16, https://documents-dds- ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/033/74/PDF/G1403374.pdf?OpenElement. 9 23. Accordingly, the Rapporteur recommended that States should evaluate the differential impact of existing and proposed fiscal policies on different groups, in particular those who suffer from structural discrimination. 20 The Rapporteur also noted that, overall, high tax rates for goods and services and low rates for income, wealth and property bring about inequitable and discriminatory outcomes. 21 24. Typically, indirect taxes, such as those based on consumption, are regressive because they generally constitute a larger portion of the income of people living in poverty. 22 After the United Kingdom increased the threshold for the payment of inheritance tax and increased VAT, the UN Committee for the ICESCR recommended that the Government: conduct a human rights impact assessment, with broad public participation, of the recent changes introduced to its fiscal policy, including an analysis of the distributional consequences and the tax burden of different income sectors and marginalized and disadvantaged groups. 23 25. It has also been argued that women bear the regressive brunt of consumption taxes because they tend to use larger portions of their income on basic goods due to gender norms that assign them responsibility for the care of dependents. 24 Maximum Available Resources 26. As outlined earlier in this submission, New Zealand is legally bound under the ICESCR to “take steps . . . to the maximum of its available resources, with a view of achieving progressively the full realization of the rights.” Taxation is therefore a vital tool in meeting human rights obligations under the ICESCR so that the Government can mobilise resources to invest in health, education, housing, social protection. 27. The Committee for ICESCR has interpreted the obligation to use maximum of available resources to mean: 25 20 Ibid. para. 17. 21 Ibid. para. 47. 22 Ibid. para. 46. 23 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations on the sixth periodic report of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, E/C.12/GBR/CO/6 (14 July 2016) para. 17. 24 Ibid. para. 46, citing UNDP, Gender Equality and Poverty Reduction: Taxation, Issues Brief, No. 1, April 2010. 25 See Committee for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 3 (1990); United Nations Development Group, The Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding Among UN Agencies (2003) pg. 29. 10 a. Governments must do the maximum it can to mobilise resources within the country and budget revenue. b. Governments must give due priority to economic, social and cultural rights in the use of resources. c. Government expenditure should be efficient and effective. d. Governments should not adopt deliberately retrogressive measures affecting economic, social and cultural rights. 28. The Government has similar obligations that are specific to children’s rights. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States are required to “mobilize resources” for the realisation of children’s rights. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment no. 19, on public budgeting for the realisation of children’s rights, interprets this obligation as requiring States to take concrete sustainable measures to mobilize domestic resources. 26 29. At a recent conference on “Taxation and the SDGs” major international organisations including the IMF, OECD, UN and World Bank called on governments around the world to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of their tax systems to generate the domestic resources needed to meet the SDGs and promote inclusive economic growth. 27 30. States obligation to direct the maximum available resources to fund economic, social and cultural rights is directly undermined through tax minimalisation and evasion practices by wealthy individuals and corporations. 31. The former UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, has described tax the effect of tax abuse on human rights in the following way: Tax abuse is thus not a victimless practice; it limits resources that could be spent on reducing poverty and realizing human rights, and perpetuates vast income inequality. While the rich benefit from this practice, the poor feel the negative impact on their standard of living, their unequal political power and the inferior quality of health and education services for themselves and their children. . . 28 26 Committee on the Rights of the Child, General comment No. 19 (2016) on public budgeting for the realization of children’s rights (art. 4) CRC/C/GC/19 (20 July 2016) http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/\_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2fC%2fGC%2f19&Lang =en. 27 http://www.oecd.org/tax/platform-for-collaboration-on-tax-conference-statement-2018.pdf. 28 Ibid. para. 3. 11 32. She added: States that do not take strong measures to tackle tax abuse cannot be said to be devoting the maximum available resources to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 29 33. Similarly, a 2013 study by the International Bar Association on Tax Abuses, Poverty and Human Rights found that: Tax abuses have considerable negative impacts on the enjoyment of human rights. Simply put, tax abuses deprive governments of the resources required to provide the programmes that give effect to economic, social and cultural rights, and to create and strengthen the institutions that uphold civil and political rights. Actions of states that encourage or facilitate tax abuses, or that deliberately frustrate the efforts of other states to counter tax abuses, could constitute a violation of their international human rights obligations, particularly with respect to economic, social and cultural rights. 30 34. The Commission recently highlighted the Government’s human rights obligations in relation to base erosion and profit-sharing in its submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill. The Commission’s submission highlighted that planning strategies to evade tax, it not only results in unfairness and the loss of public trust in the integrity of the tax system, but it deprives the government of the resources it needs to fulfil its international human rights obligations. 35. The human rights obligations of businesses are highlighted under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, including the obligations to respect human rights, seeks ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and carry out human rights due diligence. 31 Furthermore, under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights require States to protect against human rights abuses by business enterprises and for businesses to respect human rights, including an expectation that companies act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others. 32 29 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, A/HRC/26/28 (22 May 2014) para. 60. 30 International Bar Association, Tax Abuses, Poverty and Human Rights: A report of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute Task Force on Illicit Financial Flows, Poverty and Human Rights (October 2013) pg. 2, https://www.ibanet.org/Article/NewDetail.aspx?ArticleUid=4A0CF930-A0D1-4784-8D09- F588DCDDFEA4. 31 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, pg. 31, http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf. 32 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR\_EN.pdf. 12 Accountability, access to information, transparency and participation 36. Accountability, access to information, transparency and participation are important human rights principles that should guide all phases of the design, development, implementation and evaluation of tax policy. The right to participation is the cornerstone of democracy and human rights and is guaranteed by ICCPR, article 25 and the right of access to information is protected by article 19. The principle of accountability, whereby the government is accountable to its people for its actions in realising or failing to realise human rights, is also important. 37. The Commission welcomes the open and inclusive spirit of the Working Group in its review of the current tax system. Ensuring participation and transparency in the tax system is a way to ensure that the voices of the most vulnerable groups in society are heard. The Commission encourages the Working Group to take specific measures to ensure equal access and opportunities to participate, particularly for people living in poverty or those suffering from structural discrimination. 33 38. Transparency and accountability in terms of what and how taxes are raised and budget setting are also essential. If people are to hold the Government to account for realising rights, they too need to know about the budget. This is particularly true for marginalised and excluded groups, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and minorities, as the budget has a disproportionate impact on their welfare. 34 39. The Commission has called for the Government to make legislative changes to ensure that the SDGs and human rights are considered when making fiscal decisions. The Commission recently submitted a report to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights prior to its review of New Zealand in March 2018. The Commission recommended that the Committee call on the Government to amend the Public Finance Act to ensure that economic, social and cultural rights are taken into account in fiscal decisions. 35 33 Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, A/HRC/26/28 (22 May 2014) para. 22. 34 UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2017), Realizing human rights through government budgets: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/RealizingHRThroughGovernmentBudgets.pdf. 35 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in New Zealand: Submission of the Human Rights Commission for the Fourth Periodic Review of New Zealand under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (15 February 2018) pg. 5, http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/\_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2fCESCR%2fNHS%2fNZ L%2f30299&Lang=en. 13 40. The CESCR Committee’s concluding observations expressed concern that the Government’s obligations under ICESCR are not adequately considered in the budget process and that budgetary allocations for areas relating to the ICESCR remain insufficient. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the Government: take measures to ensure the maximization of the resources allocated for the realization of Covenant rights, including by making the necessary adjustments to the Public Finance Act (1989) by introducing human rights impact assessments. It also recommends that appropriate consideration of the Covenant obligations of the State party is established when fiscal and resource generation and allocation decisions are made. While noting the State party’s commitment to the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Committee recommends that the initiatives and resources allocated to their achievement be underpinned by the Covenant obligations. 36 41. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also recommended that the Government enhance allocations and budgetary measures in relation to child poverty. The Committee called on the Government to adopt a child-rights approach to the budget and ensure transparent and participatory budgeting process. 37 It also urged the Government to: increase substantially the allocations necessary to directly and comprehensively tackle child poverty and ensure that budgetary lines for children in disadvantaged, vulnerable situations and situations of poverty that may require affirmative social measures are adequate and protected even in situations of economic crisis, natural disasters or other emergencies. 38 42. The Commission welcomed an approach along these lines in the Child Poverty Reduction Bill through the amendment of sections 38 and 39 of the Public Finance Act. 39 Linking child poverty reporting with the annual budgetary process by requiring a report on child poverty to be included with the supporting information for the main Appropriations Bill, the Government’s realisation of children’s rights. 40 36 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding observations on the fourth periodic report of New Zealand (1 May 2018) para. 15 http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/\_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=E%2fC.12%2fNZL%2fCO%2f4 &Lang=en. 37 UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, Concluding Observations on the fifth periodic report of New Zealand, 21 October 2016, CRC/C/NZL/CO/5, paras, 36(a) and (b), http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CRC/Shared%20Documents/NZL/INT\_CRC\_COC\_NZL\_25459\_E.pdf. 38 Ibid., para. 35(b). 39 See Human Rights Commission Submission on the Child Poverty Reduction Bill to the Social Services and Community Committee. 40 This clause follows the recommendation of EAG Working Paper No 6 that an amendment be made to the Public Finance Act to require the Minister of Finance to specify, as part of the annual budgetary process, the allocations earmarked for meeting the short-term and long-term child poverty targets, EAG Working Paper No 6 page 21, Recommendation 7.3. 14 43. A good example of the incorporation of human rights in relation to women’s rights is through gender budgeting. In 2016 the OECD released a Recommendation on Gender Equality in Public Life which included a recommendation for Governments to adopt specific and targeted policies and for the mainstreaming gender-responsiveness into all government action to ensure that policies or budgets to do not inadvertently discriminate against women. 41 The OECD has defined gender budgeting as: Integrating a clear gender perspective within the overall context of the budgetary process, through the use of special processes and analytical tools, with a view to promoting gender-responsive policies. 42 44. In 2017, the Budgeting and Public Expenditures Division of the OECD published a report titled Gender Budgeting in OECD Countries. The report highlighted the many disparities and inequalities that exist between the sexes and emphasised that they “appear to have become embedded, to a greater or lesser extent, in the baseline of public policies and the allocation of public resources.” 43 According to the OECD “The factor most frequently cited as the primary reason for the introduction of gender budgeting is perceived inequalities.” 44 45. The 2016 OECD Gender Budgeting Survey, found that almost half of OECD countries have introduced or are actively considering the introduction of gender budgeting. For example, in Australia a “Women’s Budget Statement” has been published annually since 2008 providing discussion of government policies significant for women and gender equality more broadly. The Canadian Government has also committed to the analysis of gender-specific policy impacts on women, publishing its first Gender Statement in 2017. 45 46. New Zealand has not indicated any intention to adopt gender budgeting measures and has not taken any administrative steps in the direction of implementing gender budgeting. 46 Moreover, the Treasury’s well-being approach does not indicate specific focus on gender. However, a Working Paper published by the New Zealand Treasury 41 2015 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Public life, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264252820-en. 42 OECD, Gender budgeting in OECD countries (2017) pg. 6 http://www.oecd.org/gender/Gender-Budgeting-in- OECD-countries.pdf. The established definition of Gender Budgeting used by the European Commission is “a gender-based assessment of budgets, incorporating a gender perspective at all levels of the budgetary process and restructuring revenues and expenditures in order to promote gender equality” (Council of Europe, 2009) 43 OECD, Gender budgeting in OECD countries (2017) Executive Summary, pg. ii http://www.oecd.org/gender/Gender-Budgeting-in-OECD-countries.pdf. 44 Ibid., pg. 10. 45 https://www.budget.gc.ca/2018/docs/plan/chap-05-en.html 46 OECD, Gender budgeting in OECD countries (2017), Figure 2.9, pg 18. 15 in April 2018 argued that New Zealand would benefit from exploring the potential application of gender budgeting principles to increase the transparency of fiscal policy and inform policy debate. 47 47 Ibid., Executive Summary, pg. ii http://www.oecd.org/gender/Gender-Budgeting-in-OECD-countries.pdf. 16 Useful Resources UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (2017), Realizing human rights through government budgets: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/RealizingHRThroughGovernmentBudgets.pdf Tax as a Fundamental Human Rights Issue, YouTube Video by Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdRGFp7D66A Tax Policy is Human Rights Policy: The Irish Debate, Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights (12 February 2015): http://www.rightingfinance.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/speech.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, UN Doc.

The Institute’s flagship project, Project 2058, focuses on New Zealand’s long-term future. As a result of our observation that foresight drives strategy, strategy requires reporting, and reporting shapes foresight, we developed three interlinking policy projects: ForesightNZ, StrategyNZ and ReportingNZ. Each of these tools must align if we want New Zealand to develop durable, robust and forward-looking public policy. The policy projects frame and feed into our research projects, which address a range of significant issues facing New Zealand. In preparing this submission, the Institute has drawn largely on our policy projects ReportingNZ and StrategyNZ and our research project TacklingPovertyNZ.

Changes in Crown revenue have always been an area of interest for the McGuinness Institute, as indicated by the image on the cover of this submission, which draws on work the McGuinness Institute undertook in 2012. The pie charts on the right indicate changes in Crown Receipts over time. At the beginning of the 20th century, indirect taxation was the dominant form of revenue collected by government (e.g. ‘over 60% of tax revenue came from alcohol and tobacco’ with sugar also taxed – see Appendix 1). However by the middle of the century direct taxes became more popular. Today, we are arguably seeing a move back towards indirect taxes as the prevailing form of taxation. The distinction between direct and indirect has dominated reporting of taxation. In 1899 indirect taxes on goods and services included customs duties, beer duty, and stamps. During the middle of the century indirect taxes included items such as sales tax, customs and excise duty and motor vehicles taxation. By 1975 indirect taxation included items such as motor vehicle fees and charges, customs duty, beer duty, sales tax, racing duty, stamp and other duties, motor spirits duty, highways taxation and payroll tax. 1 Indirect taxes have become increasingly broad and varied. In contrast, direct taxation on income or profits has remained relatively static and streamlined. At the start of the century direct taxes included land tax, income tax, railways, registration and other fees, marine dues and territorial revenue. By the middle of the century direct taxes included income tax, social security tax, national security tax, land tax and death duties. However by 1975 direct tax included only major four items: income tax, estate and gift duty, land tax and property speculation tax. We support this trend towards indirect taxes as a way to collect more revenue, to put less pressure on the most challenged in society and as a way of changing behaviour to encourage a more sustainable low- emissions economy. Our submission is divided into four parts: Part 1 responds to the direct questions in your Submissions Background Paper. Part 2 contains nine topics that either did not easily fit under your chapter headings or, in our view, warranted more detailed discussion: A: Sanitary items GST exemption B: Carbon tax and livestock tax C: Sugar tax D: Alcohol tax E: Water tax F: Plastic tax G: Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) and tax treaties H: Government Department Strategies (GDS) and annual reports I: Local government property taxes (rates) and other sources of revenue. Part 3 illustrates the importance of mapping the current system and then developing a range of alternative scenarios for its development. An initial map is provided using the lens of input taxes, process (transaction taxes) and output taxes; however, there are a range of ways the tax landscape can be visually mapped and then assessed. Part 4 brings all our recommendations together in one complete list. 1 McGuinness Institute. (2011).

Which of these are most important? The initial list of eight challenges and opportunities is a good starting point but we feel it is necessary to make four overarching points. (a) Risks cannot be assessed in isolation and/or seen in terms of timeframes (as implied). What we are really going to see is a more complex mix of existing and emerging issues that will put pressure on the current system. The World Economic Forums calls this our increased vulnerability to systemic risk. Humanity has become remarkably adept at understanding how to mitigate countless conventional risks that can be relatively easily isolated and managed with standard risk management approaches. But we are much less competent when it comes to dealing with complex risks in systems characterized by feedback loops, tipping points and opaque cause-and-effect relationships that can make intervention problematic. 2 (b) Risks should be assessed in terms of magnitude and impact (i.e. possible effects not the chance of occurrence). The concept of ‘main risks, challenges, and opportunities’ is problematic as it implies that some will have greater impact than others. We believe that the reality will be a range of pressures from which it will be difficult to identify the one that will have the greatest impact on the system. Nassim Nicholas Taleb (author of Black Swan) recently discussed the difference between probability and magnitude at a workshop in New York, arguing that we are reaching a point where probability will no longer be relevant. 3 We should instead look at the magnitude of a risk and focus on ways to prevent it from occurring and/or explore ways to optimise/build antifragility to be able to weather the impacts of risks if they occur. In terms of the tax system, this means we need to identify all risks and spend time managing those risks. This means that rather than ranking risks by probability, we should rank risks by our understanding of the magnitude of impact if such a risk occurs – what is the ripple effect? (c) Risks should be assessed in terms of sociological and technological impacts. Viewing risks in terms of their sociological and technological impacts and how these interrelate gives the advantage of identifying and understanding the era we are living in. For example, there have been phases in our development that have been slow or even static, as well as times when change has been rapid. Andrew G Haldane, a Bank of England economist, acknowledged in a speech that he is not sure which comes first – sociological or technological change – but states: Some insight into that debate can be provided by looking at patterns of growth through a long lens. Over long runs of history, it is possible to detect distinct phase shifts in growth. Some growth epochs have seen secular stagnation, others secular innovation. Understanding the determinants of these growth phases – sociological and technological – provides insight into the forces of secular stagnation and innovation operating today. 4 (d) Small changes to the system can have significant impacts. This is what some people call the ‘butterfly effect’. In the same way that terrorism is changing the world and how we prepare for and respond to terrorist events, we are seeing equally small events having big impacts on the tax system. For example, consider the fact that Apple was found to be 2 World Economic Forum. (2018). The Global Risks Report 2018 13th Edition, p. 15.

This was possibly one of the events that led to this review. Another example is cyber security, where one or a small number of people are able to have a big impact on privacy systems and public trust. The same can be said of tax system reviews, assessments and improvements (e.g. loopholes are fixed, those manipulating the system are found and penalised and the system simplified so that it is easier to use and understand). With these four overarching points in mind, other unmentioned risks that we believe may impact the tax system separately or cumulatively (beyond your initial list of eight) are listed below: Sociological risks (i) Who owns and has rights over data – how is the tension between individual rights and the common good managed? (ii) What is the impact of changes to the work-life balance? For example, it may be that people are opting to work fewer hours (i.e. a reduction in the tax-take) and/or establishing fewer businesses (i.e. a reduction in entrepreneurs to employ people). (iii) The changing structure of businesses due to the way buyers and sellers interact. Observations worth investigating are: a. An increasing number of companies may be becoming intangible asset rich but tangible asset poor. b. An increasing number of companies may be becoming revenue rich but asset poor (e.g. Uber). c. An increasing number of companies may be becoming SMEs (fewer than 20 employees) meaning fewer employees pay PAYE. d. An increasing amount of tax is being shifted off shore (legally and illegally) by multinational companies using base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). e. An increasing number of organisations are operating as social enterprises, focusing not just on the creation of profit. They see themselves as innovative but some are arguably operating outside of the tax system, as they provide workers with intrinsic and other non-financial benefits rather than collecting PAYE. Technological risks (iv) Cyber security risks – how might these impact tax compliance? For example, how might the IRD data systems be compromised and what backup exists? (v) Automation/AI as part of the changing nature of work – for example, as automation replaces workers, will tax revenue be reduced due to there being fewer taxable PAYE earners? This has led to some discussion as to whether companies should be taxed for their use of automation. 5 (vi) Climate change risk. Climate change will result in enormous strain and shock to the economy and government that will extend far beyond warmer water and increasing sea levels. The whole structure of the economy is likely to be affected, meaning businesses will need to transform in order to continue operating. This will have an enormous impact on tax-take at both central and local government levels. This climate change shock is likely to happen at the very time we are going to be hit by a technology shock (e.g. automation/AI leading to a lower number of taxable workers). The two risks together may significantly reduce our tax-take under the current structure. We need to start saving and transforming our systems and industries now. This means we should not only be looking at the way revenue is earned (options to collect revenue) but the amount of revenue/tax-take we will need to deal with future infrastructure requirements and to improve wellbeing for those severely affected. 5 Delaney, K. J. (2017). The robot that takes your job should pay taxes, says Bill Gates. Quartz. Retrieved 30 April 2018 from www.qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes. 6 | P a g e (2) How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? As with any complex system, constant review is crucial. This requires robust, built-in feedback loops to continually assess whether the system is delivering what is intended. Recommendation 4 (see p. 7) is one of our overarching recommendations, and is supported by the detail explained below. We consider it to be important to increase tax-take during the next ten years in order to build up a reserve for incidentals (unknown impacts) and to be able to tackle poverty and build infrastructure to help mitigate known climate change impacts. Figure 1 illustrates that although it is generally accepted that wellbeing has improved for citizens, this is only temporary (see blue lines). As climate change impacts worsen, many citizens are likely to see a significant and sharp decrease in wellbeing. Direct effects likely to impact wellbeing include impacts on ports (sea level rise), air travel (turbulence), fish and shellfish (water temperature rising) and infrastructure damage to roads and bridges (flooding and storms). The scenarios indicate a range of outcomes for New Zealand depending on how quickly we respond by building resilience in our communities and in our infrastructure. This will depend on capacity for adaptability, skills and available revenue. This is why we believe tax-take needs to be increased in order to create a buffer for known and unknown impacts of climate change. Figure 1: Illustrating the costs and benefits of acting early in response to climate change risks (3) How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focused tax system? These are useful principles that might be able to be applied across the tax system as a whole. This would be an interesting area to explore further. For example, adjustments to the tax system could be organised in line with the three principles above: (i) Manaakitanga (hospitality, kindness, generosity and support) could guide the integrity of the tax system by ensuring companies are paying their fair share and personal income/property is being taxed in an equitable manner (see Sections G, H and I). Scenario One: NZ manages climate change risks well Scenario Two: NZ manages climate change risks poorly Scenario Three: NZ manages climate change risks not at all well 2000 2030 2060 Level of wellbeing + - Climate change impacts Time 7 | P a g e (ii) Kaitiakitanga (guardianship and conservation), could guide the implementation of carbon taxes, livestock taxes or water taxes (see Sections C, E and F). (iii) Whanaungatanga (relationships, kinship and family connections) could guide discussions on the removal of GST on sanitary items and guide adjustments to excise taxes such as the creation of sugar tax or increasing alcohol tax (see Sections A, B and D). Shaping tax around care and consideration of people (social capital) and the environment (natural capital) can help link principles to strategies in the tax system. Recommendations from Chapter 2 1. Support further foresight and risk reporting at IRD and develop scenarios to explore what risks or combination of risks might lead to significant reductions and/or increases in the tax- take. Explore not only ways to collect tax but the size of the tax-take needed to manage the risks ahead. 2. Collect data on the changing structures of commercial organisations: a. Understand the landscape of business in New Zealand and monitor it over time. b. Identify the distinction between charitable organisations and charitable organisations that run for-profit companies in order to respond to the changing needs of tax providers and other users. For example, make an iwi and corporate charity subsection on the Charities Register and look at how this interrelates with the Companies Register. c. Look more closely at social enterprise organisations and how benefits are shared/gained within these. d. Consider a ‘robot tax’. 3. Support reporting on cyber-security breaches, particularly where tax data is compromised. 4. Maintain income tax and company tax regimes as ‘broad-based’ and with current thresholds in place (i.e. although we support changes in the tax rates we do not support a shift to progressive company tax for SMEs etc.). However, also explore ways to significantly increase the tax-take in terms of collecting additional revenue through taxing consumer assets, goods and services (e.g. capital gains tax on third dwellings, GST on products purchased online from overseas), polluting goods (e.g. phosphates and plastics), goods that have long-term health impacts (e.g. sugar) and scarce resources (e.g. water). 5. Explore in more detail the implications of applying tikanga Māori across the tax system. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system (4) What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Tax has long been a feature of New Zealand society (see Appendix 1). 6 Tax enables governments to build resilience and improve wellbeing. Regarding wellbeing, we would firstly like to express our strong support for Treasury’s Living Standards Framework and its attention to the four capitals. Secondly, we note that developing the principles for assessing a good tax system requires a deeper understanding of whether we are assessing its inputs, outputs or outcomes or all of these. The principles that drive the tax collection system (receipts) cannot be seen in isolation from the principles driving the provision of public services (payments). The net effect of both receipts and payments over time should balance each other. 6 A brief history of tax developments in New Zealand makes up thread 46 of our 2017 book Nation Dates (third ed.). 8 | P a g e Lastly, we note that fraud undermines the tax system. Transparency underpins trust, as articulated by Associate Justice Louis Brandeis when he said that ‘sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants’. 7 Listing those who defraud or avoid the system is critical to building trust. Key principles for consideration listed are below: (i) Balance (that the system balances receipts and payments over time and ideally creates a surplus). (ii) Regulatory compliance (that citizens comply with the system and that the system is policed – an external focus). (iii) Cost effectiveness (that management administers processes effectively to minimise costs – an internal focus). We believe it would be useful to understand the administration costs of the different types of taxes. See discussion in Section H. (iv) Simplicity and incontestability (that citizens find the system easy to understand, use and trust; complex systems tend to hide loop holes and enable hidden benefits). Are there unintended consequences of our tax system we are not seeing? (v) Durability (that changes of government do not result in major changes to the tax system. This implies that some form of cross-party agreement is preferable). (vi) Alignment (that the system aligns with international rules, treaties and standards, and with other national rules and standards). (vii) Transparency (that the system as a whole, including public disclosure of those who do not follow the rules, is transparent. We thought The Spinoff’s series ‘Tax Heroes’ was a great angle to contrast the tax scoundrel, but those who do not pay their fair share should be held publicly accountable in some way or another. 8 For example, companies should be required to publish penalties in their annual report). (5) How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? Our view is that fairness is about equity. There seems to be two ways of looking at the overall goals of the tax system. The first angle is ‘equity at collection’ – striving for a tax system that collects from individuals and companies in a way that is proportional and fair to their circumstances. The second angle is ‘equity at redistribution’ – this is more concerned with collecting tax revenue in a flat, horizontal and equal style and redistributing later to ensure vertical equity. The article Pencilsword: Greed vs Need sheds some much needed light on the difference between tax evasion and benefit fraud in New Zealand, and the associated social stigmas. New Zealand suffered $1.24 billion in stolen tax revenue compared to $30 million in defrauded benefit money in 2014. The average value of a tax evasion offence is $229,000 while benefit fraud is $77,000, yet the New Zealand government spends $3 (per $100 recovered) on tax evasion compared to $17 (per $100 recovered) on benefit fraud. It is clear that tax evasion is a more significant crime both in number of offences and amount of potential tax revenue lost. We need to look at how to make better use of resource efforts to combat tax evasion as well as to eliminate legislation loopholes. 9 The example of Warren Buffet’s $29 billion net worth increase from a rewrite of the US Tax Code illustrates the fact that ‘fairness’ can only be defined in the context of the system’s goals: 7 Brandeis, L. (1914). Other People’s Money and How the Bankers Use It, p. 92. Retrieved 30 April 2018 from www.ia802702.us.archive.org/32/items/otherpeoplesmone00bran/otherpeoplesmone00bran\_bw.pdf. 8 Greive, D.

A large portion of our gain did not come from anything we accomplished at Berkshire. The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’s operations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code. 10 In our view, the tax system should meet social and environmental goals and work with society to deliver better outcomes. We believe it should always be reviewed in terms of the needs of society, hence why this review is timely. We also believe that the tax system being simple and staying relatively constant over time is a positive thing, but we think it could be better utilised to meet current and future needs. We have attached the People Deprivation Index in Appendix 2, which highlights some of the current gaps by geographical region. We need to use all of our systems to give every New Zealander the opportunity to improve their living standards; this is particularly the case for New Zealanders that are currently experiencing immense challenges. We have also attached Appendix 3, which is an output of our Project TacklingPovertyNZ workshops. This project aims to contribute to a national conversation on how to reduce poverty in New Zealand. Key outputs of these workshops were Working Paper 2017/01 – TacklingPovertyNZ 2016 Tour: Methodology, results and observations and A regional perspective of the talking tour 2016/He tūāhua o te haerenga kōrero 2016 infographic. 11 The infographic illustrates how communities would be able to tackle poverty as identified by the TacklingPovertyNZ workshop participants, as well as the main measures for empowering those in poverty. The tax system is part of a much larger system designed for the overall public good. It is important to look at where the systems are failing in other areas to develop a more holistic approach to tax. This same sentiment forms the basis of Think Piece 29 – Proposed changes to s 211 of the Companies Act 1993 (to be published in late May 2018), which was developed based on the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. We look at improving the quality of corporate reporting in New Zealand by amending s 211 of the Companies Act 1993 (Content of an annual report) to require a wellbeing statement on the four capitals (natural, social, human, financial/physical) for significant companies (ideally ‘large’ companies). Our view is that good quality reporting practices from companies with the most significant impacts on New Zealand will enable public policy leaders and industry standard-setters to develop robust systems in the face of emerging technological, environmental and social disruptions. Wellbeing statements could include disclosures such as carbon emission and water usage statistics (natural capital), employee information (human capital), income tax, GST and cyber-security breaches (financial/physical capital) and political donations (social capital). Recommendations from Chapter 3 6. Consider the seven principles (i) to (vii) on p. 7 of this submission. 7. Research tax loopholes for each type of tax dollar collected. 8. Report regularly on the administration costs of each type of tax dollar collected (e.g. what is the most cost-effective and robust way to collect tax over time). 9. Research whether we are policing our tax laws well enough and review the penalty fee applied to each type of tax dollar collected (e.g. what is the most cost-effective and robust way to police tax collection over time? Are penalties significant enough to act as a disincentive?). 10. Research whether we are taxing low income brackets too much and high income brackets too little. 11. Research ways tax is currently being (or could be) crafted to deliver better outcomes for society (e.g. which is most cost-effective: creating a special rebate for hybrid cars (feebate) or increasing petrol taxes?). 10 Buffet, W. (2018). Letter to Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Retrieved from www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2017ltr.pdf. 11 These, and other workshop publications, are available to download from the TacklingPovertyNZ website: www.tacklingpovertynz.org/publications. 10 | P a g e 12. Research BEPS and develop strategies to combat illegal behaviour and/or make undesirable behaviour illegal. See Section G. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system (6) New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? We respond to this question throughout this proposal. However, we also note a question that is not easy to address anywhere else: who pays tax and who does not and how transparent is this within the current system? Specifically, companies and organisations with charitable statuses and tax exemptions operate in an area of the system that is difficult to navigate. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist Church in New Zealand (a charitable trust) owns a number of commercially driven entities, most notably Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company. Sanitarium is a producer of health foods in both New Zealand and Australia. The Charitable Trust status means that the Seventh-day Adventist Church and its food giant Sanitarium are not liable for tax on earnings. The Seventh-day Adventist Church accumulated a total revenue of $222,857,232 through its ventures in the 2016 financial year. This level of revenue would usually place an organisation in the Deloitte Top 200 Index. Presently, iwi organisations and companies are registered on the Charities Register but you cannot easily search for them. Further, there appears to be no link between the Charities Register and Companies Register. It would improve transparency if the IRD were to regularly report on the public good benefit produced by iwi and other non-profit organisations. This would answer questions such as i) what tax-take is being lost in exchange for what benefit (the cost/benefit), and ii) are there ways we could use this information to build a stronger philanthropy sector (e.g. requiring charities to register by geographical location and philanthropy type) and/or a stronger business sector (e.g. requiring companies to identify and be searchable by their type of industry and number of staff)? New Zealand (and the tax system) would arguably be better supported if we had one large national register that was easy to search. Our issue is not with for-profit organisations supporting charitable work. We simply seek to highlight that this work should be undertaken in a manner that is transparent and open about any conflicts of interest. There needs to be a clear separation between entities operating for profit or not-for-profit purposes. (7) Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Yes. We believe that we already use the tax system to intentionally change behaviour and that we could be more deliberate going forward. Current examples are taxes on petrol, tobacco and alcohol. As you will see in the additional sections to this submission (A: Sanitary items GST exemption, B: Carbon tax and/or Livestock tax, C: Sugar tax, D: Alcohol tax, E: Water tax and F: Plastic tax), we believe these mechanisms could be better used to change behaviour. We believe it is important to consider the behaviours we want to support and the behaviours we want to discourage. A comprehensive list is beyond this submission but we do want to alert you to a few we believe are important and have had a part in shaping our responses in this submission. 11 | P a g e  Helping people and businesses move to a low-emissions economy o Using feebates to support energy-efficient or environmentally friendly practices such as electric cars or managing plastic bag use. o Supporting intensive urban development (e.g. apartments and other models of high- density living, in parallel with initiative to build empowered community and support councils to build strong, robust environments). We therefore support apartments and good central infrastructure (e.g. transport, housing, renewable energy, hospitals etc.). o Supporting regional communities. E.g. we suggest petrol tax needs to be raised, particularly for petrol tax purchased within major cities (e.g. Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton, Christchurch, Tauranga and Dunedin). This would avoid disadvantaging regional areas and motivate city dwellers to use public transport. o Building more interconnected transport networks between roads, train stations and ferries and moving towards renewable energy in these networks as much as possible.  Helping people to stay healthy o Increasing the cost of alcohol, as drinking less reduces the risk of cancer. o Reducing obesity through a sugar tax, as less sugar reduces obesity. o Improving ccess to national parks and clean rivers – an embedded part of the New Zealand lifestyle. o Ensuring basic needs are cheap and accessible. o Attacking societal problems at their core (e.g. roots of homelessness, drug abuse).  Helping people to be self-sustaining financially o Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship through fostering an equitable tax system. o Putting wellbeing at the forefront of public policy e.g. work hard, play hard. o Creating a system that does not disadvantage regional communities. o Ensure equitable access to technology (closing the Internet divide). o Ensuring the provision of affordable housing. (8) Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Yes. There is potential to design the tax system for the public good and to encourage public trust. Participants of the Institute’s 2012 LongTermNZ workshop recognised the issue of retirement savings and explained it in their own terms through ‘the Auntie Gertrude challenge’ cartoon (see Appendix 3). 12 Encouraging saving for retirement within the tax system could be a key component of addressing the future challenges of New Zealand’s aging population. Recommendations from Chapter 4 13. Improve the tax system to deliver public good objectives, in particular, to tackle poverty and improve the environment. 14. Make for-profit and not-for-profit entities transparent in a central register (combining the companies register and the charities register) as an entity’s tax status is not always apparent or easy to find. 15. Increase the tax on petrol purchased within New Zealand’s largest cities to help New Zealand move to a low-emissions economy and to help fund public transport. 16. Research ways to encourage saving for retirement via the tax system. 12 The cartoon is a fun and creative way to explain the superannuation challenge highlighting that this burden must not be left to younger generations to carry. It was developed as part of the LongTermNZ Youth Statement on New Zealand’s Long-term Fiscal Position workshop booklet, which can be downloaded from the McGuinness Institute website: www.mcguinnessinstitute.org/workshop-publications. 12 | P a g e Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system (9) Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? We do not have enough information to respond to this question. (10) Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? We do not have enough information to respond to this question. (11) Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? No, as evidenced by poor water quality and pollution levels. We see the tax system as a way to protect and build our national capital. See discussion in Part 2, Sections B: Carbon Tax and/or Livestock Tax, E: Water Tax and F: Plastic Tax. (12) Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? We do not have enough information to respond to this question but we consider it to be an important one. We are aware of the difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting practice) net income and taxable income and, based on our research, the reconciliation between the two is not always clear. We wonder if IRD have undertaken any work looking at compliance in this area. Recommendations from Chapter 5 17. Research ways tax systems can be used to deliver better outcomes for social and environmental capital. 18. Research types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system (13) What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? The review of the tax system needs to consider the impact of tax on social capital, natural capital, human capital and financial capital as part of a complex ecosystem – all capitals are interconnected. See also our response to question 5 above. (14) Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? As noted above we believe the tax-take needs to increase, so we would argue that New Zealand needs additional taxes as well as retaining the current system and rates of tax. Recommendations from Chapter 6 19. New taxes for consideration are discussed in Part 2. These include Section A: Sanitary items GST Exemption, B: Carbon Tax and Livestock Tax, C: Sugar Tax, E: Water Tax, and F: a Plastic Tax. 13 | P a g e Chapter 7: Specific challenges (15) How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? We do not have enough information to respond to this question. (16) Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? We consider a capital gains tax to be well overdue, but this should exclude two dwellings. This is particularly relevant as it seems there is a move to a lifestyle whereby people have an apartment during the working week and spend weekends out of town at a bach, boat or country home. This is not just good for the city and urban areas; it is good for a person’s mental and physical health. (17) Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? We are not sure how this would be different from rates. (18) What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? The research phase of Project ReportingNZ was incredibly eye-opening for the Institute, as we discovered how little companies are reporting on environmental issues. Examining the content of the 126 NZSX- listed companies’ 2016 annual reports, we found that: 19% of annual reports mentioned water statistics, water controls and/or water targets; 25% of annual reports mentioned carbon emission statistics, costs, controls and/or targets; and 29% of annual reports mentioned environmental practices or targets. 13 It is concerning that the rate of reporting (even at the level of simply mentioning there are risks) of this kind of environmental information is so low. There are no requirements or incentives that hold companies accountable for the degradation of the environment. Carbon or livestock taxing would provide this incentive, alongside mandatory requirements to report on the environment to create a data set to measure progress and inform policy. See Part 2, Sections B, E and F for a discussion on carbon, water and plastic taxes. (19) Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? Although we would like to support this idea, we suspect a small number of companies would use this as an opportunity to restructure into a number of small to medium-sized enterprises to take advantage of the opportunity to minimise tax payments. (20) Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? Please see (A) Sanitary items GST Exemption discussion below. Recommendations from Chapter 7 20. Introduce a capital gains tax on any third or more dwelling. This intentionally excludes a family home and a secondary dwelling (such as a bach or apartment or boat). 21. We do not support a progressive company tax regime. 13 See Graphs 12, 14 and 16 in ReportingNZ 2018 Worksheet: An analysis of the state of play of EER, found on the McGuinness Institute website: www.mcguinnessinstitute.org/publications. 14 | P a g e PART 2: NINE ADDITIONAL TOPICS This part of the submission discusses nine specific topics in more detail. A: Sanitary items GST exemption We believe sanitary items should be exempt from GST in order to help correct the current gender inequity in the tax system and by doing so, deliver cheaper sanitary items. In order for sanitary products to be GST exempt (or zero-rated), they need to fall into a discrete category. For the purpose of this discussion the Institute defines sanitary items as ‘personal care products used for menstruation, which are are disposable or reusable and include sanitary pads, tampons, liners, and menstrual cups’. Background As discussed earlier, the infographic in Appendix 3 outlines the findings from our TacklingPovertyNZ project, which illustrates how people living in poverty might go about tackling poverty in their community, as identified by the workshop participants. The key assumptions that drove our analysis were: 1. If you ask people how to tackle poverty they will indirectly point out the failings in the current system and suggest improvements or novel solutions to existing problems. 2. If knowledge lies with people and the tools lie with government, the list of ‘hows’ we have collected in Project TacklingPovertyNZ represents the knowledge of the people and illustrates to government how they might use their tools more effectively. The findings of this research indicate that people experiencing poverty highlight survival (identified in the Appendix 3 infographic as Factor 1) as a key need; people are largely concerned with their lack of basic items. Not only does this material hardship prevent full participation in education and work, it also deprives people of their dignity. Young people in particular note that the prices of sanitary items are too high, preventing them from participating in their normal routines when menstruating. There are anecdotal reports of students missing school due to the inability of their families to afford sanitary items for multiple family members. Other stories detail the indignity of using newspapers and rags, due to the inability of some families to afford both basic sanitary items and groceries for the week. 14 Other stories mention theft of sanitary items out of desperation. 15 There is keen interest in this conversation and much discussion among young people who are supportive of reducing period poverty. While commenters (and we) are not entirely sure of the mechanisms to best achieve a reduction in the cost of sanitary items, we are interested to see what the working group is able to find in terms of data which explores the idea. From our initial research, the key areas people were unsure about relate to the implications of removing GST from these goods, and whether or not the reduced tax would be passed on to consumers as reduced retail prices. As part of the Working Group’s research, we believe further exploration of the implications of zero-rating sanitary products would be a worthy enquiry. Outstanding questions from our initial research include:  What is the actual tax revenue the government gains from the sale of sanitary items?  What might be the real reduction in cost for the consumer if GST was removed from sanitary items?  Is the consumer cost of sanitary products impacted by whether or not sanitary items are imported or manufactured in New Zealand? 14 Harris, S.

Retrieved 30 April 2018 from www.stuff.co.nz/national/103341262/women-in-period-poverty-using-socks-as-sanitary-pads. 15 | P a g e  How much government tax revenue is generated by GST on sanitary items?  What principles support a tax on an essential item required by half of the population?  If GST removal is not the correct mechanism to reduce the cost of sanitary items, what are other alternatives to reduce cost of these items? For example, could Pharmac bulk-buy these goods and then sell them to supermarkets at cost? Although, in April 2017 Pharmac refused a request to fund women’s sanitary items ‘on the grounds that sanitary products were not medicines’. 16 While the Institute recognises and acknowledges the reasons for supporting a broad base for GST, we hold that exempting sanitary items from this tax is an easily applicable measure to reduce the cost of this essential item for half the population. Unlike the debate on GST zero-ratings for other items such as food or petrol, the category of ‘sanitary items’ is discrete and not significant in terms of the overall GST tax- take. Further, the Australian Tax Office has developed tools for their far more complex exemption system, which could be used for the exemption of these goods. This is not a new idea. Many jurisdictions around the world have zero-rated sanitary products to exclude them from national sales taxes. This includes Ireland, Canada, Kenya, and some states of the US (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). 17,18,19 In Australia the debate is ongoing and arguably more complicated, because Australia already has a wide range of ‘necessary’ goods that are exempted from sales tax. In New Zealand the conversation is simpler because it involves extending a list of six existing exemptions to include a seventh class of items that is easily definable. 20 Locally the issue has already been raised by two Whangaparoa College students, whose petition calling for GST to be removed from sanitary items now has 36,000 signatures. 21 Further, there has been a lot of discussion of this on our Facebook page – in 16 Stuff.

In the nineteenth century sugar was seen by government as an important energy source for the working class. In 1878 for example, tea and sugar duties were reduced ‘as a nod towards a “free breakfast table” for the labouring classes’. 29 In 1907 duties were removed from sugar (amongst other foodstuffs) if it was British. 30 In the 1953 Budget, as exemptions became a more common tax practice, Prime Minister Sydney Holland ‘with a wink to the children ... made “fizzy drinks” free’. 31 When GST was first implemented on 1 October 1986, at a rate of 10% for all goods and services (excluding rental accommodation, housing and financial services), pamphlets explained and justified the new tax by claiming that everyday goods affected by the tax would actually decrease in price – including ‘sweets, icecream, softdrinks’. 32 The Institute acknowledges that much research and discussion at both governmental and industry levels has occurred on the topic of the sugar tax, including what mechanism might be best suited to discourage consumers from purchasing large quantities of food items linked with obesity and diabetes. While some organisations and government departments have issued reports declaring the price-signalling impact of a sugar tax to be nil, the Institute thinks that the Working Group should keep an open mind to this policy and not give it a ‘no’ until further research has been undertaken. In the UK, manufacturers are to carry the cost of ‘a sugar-sweetened beverage tax’, officially implemented in April this year. This approach will ultimately produce a product containing less added sugar, as Dr Chepulis explains: The UK had the lowest proportion of sugar in their drinks which kind of ties in with the fact that the whole taxation is working for them. What they do in the UK is they pass that sugar tax on to manufacturers. So the manufacturers 24 NZ Herald. (2018, January 16).

The reality is that something must be done for the wellbeing of New Zealanders and a sugar tax is one such option. Recommendations on sugar taxes 25.

C: Carbon tax and livestock tax New Zealand’s emissions continue to rise despite the introduction of an ETS in 2008. New Zealand’s gross emissions have increased 19.6% since 1990 and net emissions have increased significantly since 2008 (see Figure 3). 35 Unit prices have not remained stable during this time, leading us to ask if a carbon tax might be a more effective and broad-based mechanism to decrease carbon emissions. Figure 3: New Zealand’s gross and net emissions from 1990 to 2016 36 This section covers direct taxes that could be adopted to change the behaviour of producers and consumers with a view to reducing greenhouse gases. From our perspective, these can either be input taxes (e.g. a livestock tax and/or nitrogen tax) or output taxes (e.g. costs being passed on by producers to consumers such as in the case of milk, meat prices or flights). Our preferred solution is a strategy to reduce livestock (say by 20%) to then be followed up by a livestock tax in the short- to medium-term. 33 Nyika, R. (2018, January 16).

The issue of carbon pricing is still relatively new and we think that the working group should stay open as to which mechanism might best suit our nation’s unique economy. Although some may argue that it is not the tool itself that is the issue (i.e. there is no difference whether emissions are decreased via an ETS mechanism or a tax on carbon), we are interested in further research on the benefits of a carbon tax over the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The Institute believes that a carbon tax might be more transparent, harder to contest, more cost-effective to administer and easier for the public to understand. The ETS has been clouded with much political controversy, which may prevent citizens from understanding the importance of price signals for reducing emissions. Figure 4: New Zealand’s emissions profile in 2016 37 Although there are a number of industries contributing to emissions (see Figure 4), we are particularly interested in agricultural emissions and their implications for New Zealand’s exports going forward (both positive, in terms of brand association, and negative, in terms of being uncompetitive in the market). The current climate change policy, until recently, has remained at an impasse. This is not just reflected in public policy but also in private practice. The research phase of Project ReportingNZ was incredibly eye- opening for the Institute, as we discovered how little companies are reporting on environmental issues. Examining the content of the 126 NZSX-listed companies’ 2016 annual reports, we found that only 25% of annual reports mentioned carbon emission statistics, costs, controls and/or targets. 38 Similar to our recommendations in Project ReportingNZ (see response in Chapter 4, question 6), the recent draft report by the Productivity Commission discusses implementing legislative change to existing reporting requirements to incorporate climate-related disclosures. The report finds: Existing financial reporting requirements (eg, as contained in the Companies Act 1993) will likely fail to adequately incentivise the disclosure of climate risk in a manner that is consistent and credible. 39 37 MFE.

Retrieved 30 April 2018 from www.productivity.govt.nz/inquiry-content/3254?stage=3. 20 | P a g e While we agree with and support the Commission’s recommendations, we are concerned that our current Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is failing to incentivise companies to transition into a low-carbon economy. Companies are not reporting on this policy programme and there is an urgent need for significant change in our taxing and reporting frameworks. It would be pertinent to look at a carbon tax to both guide behavioural change, and to incentivise investors, corporations and consumers to favour low-carbon businesses. Adjusting the legislation on reporting requirements can ensure a swift transition into a low-carbon economy. Mandatory disclosures of climate-related ‘governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets’ will aid in measuring progress and gathering the information required for informed, long-term decision making. 40 The Productivity Commission’s recently published draft report, Low-emissions economy generates three focus areas or goals to guide sustainable reporting towards a stable climate-related ethic: 1. Commitment to net-zero emissions 2. Profitable net-zero business model 3. Quantitative mid-term targets. 41 Given our research and the Productivity Commission’s recent report, the Institute has recently commenced research for Working Paper 2018/03 – Analysis of Climate Change Reporting in the Public and Private Sectors. This working paper will look at the 2017 annual reports of NZSX-listed companies and 2017 Deloitte Top 200 companies, as well as the 2017 annual reports of central and local government organisations. The aim of the project is to assess the current climate reporting landscape, identify gaps in the system and, where appropriate, suggest recommendations to create better alignment between our public and private sectors. This research will be published later this year. Recommendations on carbon and livestock taxes 27. Prepare an updated CBA comparing an ETS with a carbon tax. 28. Research which mechanism is most effective (using international examples) at discouraging political manipulation of the national carbon budget (either through raising the units of carbon allowed or lowering the carbon tax amount). 29. Research whether a carbon tax is more effective than an ETS in confronting the difficult issue of how to tax primary agricultural producers. D: Alcohol tax Excise tax on alcohol has been used as means to deliberately modify behaviour by raising taxes on goods that the government wants to reduce consumption of. This is intended to optimise public health and minimise negative health impacts. Background Late last century, ‘over 60% of tax revenue came from alcohol and tobacco’ (see Appendix 1). At present, New Zealand uses excise taxes in the cases of alcohol and tobacco to discourage drinking and smoking. While excise taxes go up slightly each year, the rate of increase is barely noticeable. 42 The value-add tax rate on absolute alcohol in New Zealand is comparatively low to other OECD countries in 2016, sitting at just 15% in comparison to 20% in the UK. 43 Our excise taxes are much lower than Australia’s: our rates sit at 10% of the retail price for beer, 15% for wine and 38% for spirits in comparison to 24%, 25% 40 Ibid., p. 419. 41 Ibid., p. 156. 42 New Zealand Customs Service.

Recommendation on alcohol taxes 30. Consider raising the price of alcohol by increasing the existing excise tax. E: Water tax There is significant public support for taxes on fresh water, as evidenced by Water New Zealand in a survey undertaken in late 2017. The survey notes that 77% of those surveyed supported agricultural and horticultural producers paying for their use of water – this includes 77% of those who live in rural areas. 45 In addition to fresh water taxes on litres used, there is also an argument for taxing components that pollute water such as phosphorus (which is used in animal feed supplement and fertiliser). 46 In addition to fresh water taxes on litres used, there is also an argument for taxing components that pollute water such as phosphorous. Along with nitrogen, phosphorous pollutes water by over-enriching it with nutrients in a process called eutrophication, leading to blooms of toxic algae that impact biodiversity. 47 Pollution of water in this way ‘has major socioeconomic consequences that include lost livelihoods, reduced property values, damage to fisheries, loss of recreational opportunities, and several health risks’. 48 Evidence suggests that, ‘without changing current trajectories, the effects of eutrophication will spread and worsen in the coming decades’. 49 However, lowering the input of phosphorous to water would reduce or remove this risk and we consider it to be worth exploring whether a tax on phosphorous imports is a feasible solution. 50 Background The Institute notes that the Submissions Background Paper does not mention a tax on fresh water use for commercial purposes or a tax on polluted water or components that pollute water. If this is a political issue, we believe a water tax should still be researched and explored in order for this to truly be a holistic review of the future of tax. In terms of fresh water taxes, there is a misconception amongst 42% of respondents to the 2017 Water New Zealand survey that all water users are already paying for use of water. This perhaps indicates that the tax is widely received by the public as a non-controversial idea, apart from a small section of industry 44 Alcohol Healthwatch (AHW). (2009). Tax and Pricing.

Water New Zealand noted that these opinions ‘are consistent across city, regional and rural regions’. 51 New Zealand dairy farms use the equivalent amount of water as 58.2 million people. 52 This illustrates the extent of this issue for New Zealand, particularly given the impacts of climate change on air and water temperature and the broader issues of global water shortages. There is much disputed research on the cost of a water tax to dairy farms, with Auckland University’s Public Policy Institute calculating different results to the industry group DairyNZ dispute using the same figures. 53 There is not much research being conducted using established consensus data. This is an obstacle to having clear and transparent public debate on the topic. In terms of phosphorus, we have not looked at this in detail but we understand that Denmark does operate an animal feed mineral phosphorus tax and that it is working. Although the ‘analysis published shows that a tax on phosphorus would have been environmentally and economically more effective if applied to all sources, including also to mineral fertilizer’. 54 Sweden implemented a tax on mineral fertilisers in 1984 to mitigate negative environmental impacts. It targeted nitrogen and phosphorus, but after ten years phosphorus was swapped out to cadmium when the 50% phosphorus reduction goal was reached. Cadmium is found in phosphorus fertilisers, so the tax still (for the most part) indirectly reduced phosphorus pollution. At the time, cadmium was more of a health threat than an environmental threat, hence the change. The tax was abolished in 2009 in response to the financial crisis, and environmental advocates are pushing for its return given its previous success in combatting pollution. 55 Recommendations on water taxes 31. Include water taxes as part of the scope to this review. 32. Research the economic impacts of a fresh water tax and a phosphorus tax on agricultural and horticultural industries. 33. Consult iwi and urban Māori for their views on the commercial use of fresh water (e.g. bottling water, irrigation etc.). 34. Research who is the best party (e.g. central or local government) to collect fresh water and water pollutant taxes. F: Plastic Tax One key issue impacting our unique ecosystems is the pollution caused by plastic bags in marine environments. There is now significant public support for reducing plastic bag usage. Research from the National Academy of Science in the US estimates that up to 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic. This is compounded by local research conducted by Dan Godoy at the Coastal-Marine Research Group at 51 Manch, T. (2017). Over half of Kiwis want all water users to pay, Water NZ survey shows.

In 2015 it was at 322 million tonnes, whereas it is estimated to rise to 600 million tonnes by 2025. 57 When translated into local figures, this represents a significant issue for New Zealand’s wildlife and our tourism brand based on the ‘clean and green’ image of New Zealand. Some other states have already introduced a tax on single-use plastic bags, which has effectively reduced their use. For example, Britain’s use has gone down by 6 billion since the introduction of a 5p tax. 58 Recommendations on plastic taxes 35. Research mechanisms for collecting revenue on single-use plastic bags and explore how this revenue might be redistributed for environmental measures. 36. Research other jurisdictions’ approaches to disincentivising excessive plastic packaging and the environmental and administrative efficacy of these approaches. 37. Research the impact on lower-income consumers of a plastic bag tax to explore whether this tax may disproportionately impact those who do not have access to cars (and therefore access to a stable supply of reusable bags). G: Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) and Tax Treaties As at June 2017, company tax accounts for just under 20% of total tax revenue. 59 The lack of transparency in the tax system is one of the key issues for the Tax Working Group to consider. BEPS and tax treaties are areas of the tax system that are particularly lacking in transparency – both for the general public and possibly for those operating the system at IRD. Our focus below is on the tax treaty between Australia and New Zealand, but we expect there are a number of other tax treaties that should be assessed. 60 The following discussion aims to highlight the issues of transparency, particularly in how the New Zealand tax system applies to international organisations. We argue that there is a fundamental lack of transparency over such basic questions as which companies are paying tax, which companies are not and what the losses are in terms of New Zealand public good. In order to try and understand the answer to some of these questions, we looked at which companies are preparing and registering their financial statements and which are not. This research resulted in Table 3 but, as explained, the data in the table is tentative due to the unavailability of some information. We argue that this information should be easy to find, particularly the tax-take specific to New Zealand, which should be compiled in summary reports by IRD. 56 Cann, G. (2017).

The ability of companies with cross-border operations to profit shift undermines the integrity of tax systems and smaller-scale enterprises. The issue of tax recently came under the spotlight when it was discovered that Apple Sales New Zealand had legally not paid any tax to Inland Revenue for the past decade. Dual claims to income tax default to where the company is controlled under a tax treaty between Australia and New Zealand. As Apple Sales New Zealand is wholly-owned by its Australian parent company, it could legally opt-out of paying any income tax to the New Zealand Government. 64 This is despite the company being number 55 on the 2017 Deloitte top 200 list and ‘accounting for a quarter of the local smartphone market’ in 2016. 65 Another story that has come to light revealed that, in 2016, Facebook declared only $1.2 million in revenue, which is only a fraction of what Kiwi businesses spent on the platform. 66 On 1 May 2018 Facebook paid The Australian Tax Office (ATO) AUD$31 million in back-taxes following the passing of the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) Act 2017. This amendment clamped-down on tax avoidance and profit- shifting. 67 The ATO estimated that it loses AUD$2 billion to profit-shifting by multinational corporations 61 Parliament. (n.d.).

With a significant portion of New Zealand’s largest companies being direct subsidiaries of overseas companies (see Table 3 below), the Tax Working Group will need to explore the extent to which the tax treaty between Australia and New Zealand advantages or disadvantages New Zealand overall (we suspect significant disadvantages). Our corporate tax system may provide a competitive advantage for multinational corporations: they can avoid paying tax while New Zealand businesses such as those listed on the NZX remain under much greater scrutiny. Of the businesses in New Zealand, 97% are small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and are subject to the same tax rates but cannot use BEPS to undermine the system. 69 Despite our moderate 28% corporate tax rate, there may be a small number of companies using BEPS to minimise paying tax to the New Zealand Government. This is a missed opportunity for maximising New Zealand’s total tax revenue and utilising company tax for public expenditure. Profit-shifting is not always illegal: it has been built into the system to encourage and enable companies to reduce their tax costs, making this a political issue rather than a corporate one. A 2016 NZ Herald investigation found that the 20 of the most aggressive multinational companies shifting profits out of New Zealand recorded nearly $10 billion in annual sales to New Zealand consumers, $133 million in profit, and paid only $1.8 million cumulatively in tax. 70 The analysis showed that, had the companies reported profits at the same rate as their parent company, the combined tax would have been nearly $490 million. 71 The method used by NZ Herald compared the pre-tax profit margins disclosed by the subsidiary with the parent company. The amount of tax paid to a country by a subsidiary of a multinational business should be easily isolated from the total amount of tax paid by the parent company. 68 Keall, C. (2018).

In contrast, companies that are completely New Zealand owned and operated are not required to file their financial statements on the Companies Office website each year. 75 See Footnote 73 above. 76 See Footnote 73 above. 77 We know this figure will be larger than 18 but we were unable to find any way of collecting this information from the public arena. Instead we arrived at the figure during the initial steps of the Project ReportingNZ research (which involved locating the financial statements and/or annual reports of both the 2016 Deloitte Top 200 companies and NZSX-listed companies, as at June 2017). Of the 2016 Deloitte Top 200, 15 companies had no legal obligation to file their financial statements on the Companies Office. We can only assume these companies are fully New Zealand owned and operated. As listed issuers are legally required to file financial statements under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, we cannot determine which of the NZSX-listed companies are fully New Zealand owned and operated. 78 Companies Office.

Please note there is a discrepancy between the figures for ‘Total companies registered on the Companies Office’ (596,437) and ‘Total enterprises’ (528,170). Because the term ‘enterprise’ encompasses all entities, including government organisations (see definition in footnote 85), the enterprise figure should be significantly larger than the figure for companies registered with the Companies Office. Table 3 indicates the current landscape of entities operating in New Zealand. This information was gathered from a wide range of available sources. Given that there are a number of gaps, estimates and inconsistencies, and that we do not have access to the same data as IRD, this table cannot be relied upon. It is included here to illustrate the information that we believe should be readily available and that the tax- take for each of the above should be clearly accessible, identifiable and reported upon. The McGuinness Institute’s Project ReportingNZ recently found that while parent companies disclose their total amount of tax paid for the year ended, they do not disclose the distribution of this tax by nation state (e.g. they do not separate how much was paid to the Australian government versus the New Zealand Government). From our research, nine NZSX-listed companies are overseas companies and did not break down their total tax paid into the amounts paid to each country of operation (see Graph 4f (iii), Appendix 5) in their 2016 annual reports. It is troubling that the NZ Herald’s methodology (which is a 83 Local Government New Zealand. (2017). Council maps and websites.

In the interests of improved transparency, it would be valuable in future to have a publicly available breakdown of government tax revenue beyond what is currently available on the IRD website. 90 While the total GST figure is useful, it would be further beneficial to have a figure for PAYE revenue, a breakdown of income tax, and a breakdown of company tax (e.g. distinction between ‘large’ and SME companies). Lastly, when analysing the 2016 annual reports of 126 NZSX-listed companies during the Project ReportingNZ research, we noted that very few companies disclose their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) in the report. While still a new and emerging concept in New Zealand business, the use of NZBNs appears ambiguous. This begs the question as to whether they are being used efficiently. As this information is publicly available, are these numbers being utilised by businesses and government agencies for greater efficiency and communication? How could NZBN identification numbers be used to tackle profit-shifting? Alternatively, how might the recently imposed Key Auditing Matters (KAMs) 91 be used to ensure reporting on tax figures doesn’t go unnoticed? At present, only auditors of FMC Reporting Entities are required to disclose KAMs. Recommendations on BEPS and Tax Treaties 38. Review the 2009 ‘Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion’. Specifically, put in place a public reporting framework to monitor transactions between New Zealand subsidiaries and their parent companies in terms of BEPS and tax treaties. This could be progressed under s 17 of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. 39. Require ‘tax paid to the New Zealand Government’ to be disclosed as a separate item in the cash flow statement of all financial statements filed with the Companies Office or, alternatively, make this information a requirement under s 211 of the Companies Act. 40. Update Table 3 above and ensure it is published annually to the public (possibly prepared by MBIE) to understand the organisation landscape in operation in New Zealand and benchmark it over time. 41. Clarify the use and value of business numbers and how they relate to IRD numbers. For example, could we use the business number to track tax payments, tax avoidance and tax compliance? a. Improve the quality of reporting. For example: require every company to use its legal name/s on the cover of every annual report filed and to state on the inside cover its business number, registered address and industry classification used by Statistics New Zealand. b. Implement wider use of industry classifications to track tax paid across sectors. c.

Robust reporting is vital for building public trust and for informing politicians, the public and policy analysts how the system is working or not working. Foresight is particularly important for the IRD for two reasons: the tax-take needs to be sufficient to fund long-term public investments and allowances need to be made for the time it takes to change the tax system through legislation. The Institute suggests planning ahead for a period of ten years as a realistic target; long-term strategy is an essential part of driving change. This section focuses on reporting and, in particular, the reporting of strategy. Background As part of Project StrategyNZ the Institute has undertaken a significant amount of work on best practice in public sector strategic management. Each year we conduct an analysis of all recently published government department strategies (GDSs) in order to assess how well government is drafting strategic documents and using these documents to execute long-term strategic thinking. Currently, the number of GDSs dealing with tax is minimal. There were no strategies to drive the tax system evident in 2014/15 (see Appendix 6) and we found only one GDS in 2016 (the IRD Corporate Strategy 2016) that included discussion of the tax system. From the perspective of the public, the tax system appears ‘frozen in time’ with foresight considerations relatively absent. This observation is, of course, limited to work that is publicly available and may not accurately represent the current internal strategic thinking of IRD. However, it may alternatively indicate that there is a lack of underlying policy to drive strategy development and, consequently, an inability to design the tax system for the future. Figures 27 and 28 in Appendix 6 are pie charts that illustrate estimated sector appropriations compared with the number of GDSs published by that sector. 92 This analysis demonstrates the significant strategy work that has been occurring in some sectors. We argue that the Tax Working Group’s final report has a role to play in supporting more foresight work and strategy development going forward. As part of Project ReportingNZ, the Institute has also undertaken a significant amount of work on best practice in both public and private sector reporting. This work involved an analysis of annual reports. As one example, the IRD 2017 annual report, while strong in some areas, does not provide as much detail as we would like to see. 93  Emerging risks are not well articulated and are arguably broader and more integrated than as defined in the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper. See earlier discussion of risks in Chapter 2 of this submission.  IRD’s disclosure of statistics could be expanded. For example, corporate tax could be broken down into which companies are paying which tax (i.e. international companies, New Zealand large companies and SMEs (see p. 9).  The report could also disclose administration costs per tax type, penalties collected per tax type and more information on actions that progressed to court (pp. 37–38). The ReportingNZ project involved two 2017 surveys (prepared in collaboration with the External Reporting Board) on the attitudes of users (stakeholders) and preparers (CFOs) towards Extended 92 McGuinness Institute.

We found that there were very few areas in which the views of both users and preparers of annual reports aligned. However, when asked how important they considered the disclosure of a number of statistics to be, total company income tax paid was ranked the second most important by both users and preparers, following total deaths at work (see Figure 5 below). This highlights the importance of transparent disclosures on company tax contributions in EER information. 94 (Please note the survey question referred to tax paid, not tax expenses.) Figure 5: Preparers’ and Users’ views on statistics that are considered to be important or very important to disclose in annual reports Recommendations on Reporting on Taxes 42. IRD should disclose data and other relevant information on the effectiveness of the tax system in their annual report. This should include benchmarking taxes over time (e.g. by analysing compliance costs, administration costs and penalties by dollars and quantity) and analysis of the risks and opportunities that lie ahead. 43. GDSs should be published by IRD on their strategy for taxing the public, explaining their approach, the risks and opportunities they foresee and the frequency with which these strategies will be reviewed. The name of each GDS should be accessible in the annual report of the IRD. I: Local government property taxes (rates) and other sources of revenue In the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference (Appendix 1) there is no mention of local government rates. In our view, this limits the scope of this review. In the Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper, we could only find one mention of local government rates (on p. 5). In 2016 local authorities represented 3.8% of GDP. 95 While local authorities do not pay tax, they do collect tax and we consider the relationship between these taxes and the central tax system to be an important part of the design of New Zealand’s tax system overall. Background The Institute believes that the review should cover an analysis of local government taxes. Each citizen is impacted by taxes (or rates – ‘property taxes’) at both the local and central government level and it is important that this is reflected in any investigation reviewing the Future of Tax. Property taxes may be 94 For a full comparison of preparers’ and users’ views on EER statistics disclosures, see p. 15 of Survey Insights: An analysis of the 2017 Extended External Reporting Surveys at www.mcguinnessinstitute.org/surveys. 95 Local Government New Zealand. (2017). Local government finance. Retrieved 30 April 2018 from www.lgnz.co.nz/nzs-local-government/new-section-page. 31 | P a g e applied in many different ways and it is relevant to discuss whether this should be standardised nationally, or left for each local government body to decide the most effective model for their region. Local Government NZ stated that property taxes can take many forms: General rates – based on the land, capital or rental value of a property (with the exception of Auckland Council which is required to use capital value) Targeted rates – rates calculated on the basis of a feature of a property and used to fund a specific service, such as funding the cost of a sea wall to halt erosion based on the frontage size of affected sections Uniform annual general charges (UAGC) – a standard cost per property, not related to property value (only 30% of rates can be made up of UAGCs). 96 There is no consolidated annual report for all of New Zealand’s local authorities. This prevents comparability and analysis of revenue collection and revenue spending across different regions in New Zealand. Local government rates (and other revenue collection methods such as water permits in the Marlborough Sounds) are key mechanisms for collecting revenue at the local level. It would be useful to be able to assess the different ways that local government bodies collect and spend taxes. This is not currently an easy task due to the lack of consolidated information on local body revenue collection. While information for individual councils can be found in each council’s Funding Impact Statement (FIS) and their Rating Resolutions, it would be useful for public interest and policy if there was a central resource combining all national data relating to local bodies. This could take the form of a report consolidating all local government annual reports. This would show the different ways revenue is collected at the local level and would enable councils to review their revenue streams against the composite total. It would also enable IRD to have a deeper understanding of how the tax system impacts and operates within local government. We suggest that central government often fails to understand the full implications of its actions on local communities (and vice versa). Bringing local government taxes under this review of the Future of Tax seems logical and timely. Recommendations on local government property taxes (rates) and other sources of revenue 44. Include local government taxes as part of the scope to this review to ensure they are working correctly, cost effectively and fairly. Assess whether there are any lessons or alignments that might be put in place to deliver a fairer and more cohesive tax system in New Zealand. This is particularly relevant for two reasons: (i) climate change is likely to negatively impact some local communities more than others and (ii) social and natural capital tend to be local and financial and human capital tend to be national. 45. Encourage local governments to issue a consolidated annual report showing, for example, the total of all taxes collected. 96 Ibid. 32 | P a g e PART 3: MAPPING THE TAX LANDSCAPE This part of the submission highlights the importance of mapping the current tax system and then developing a range of alternative scenarios. An initial map is provided using the lens of input taxes, process (transaction) taxes and output taxes, but there is a range of other ways the tax landscape could be mapped and then assessed. Below we share the approach we would propose if the Institute were to undertake a review and design of the future of tax. Firstly we would prepare a comprehensive, detailed analysis of the current tax system, identifying each part in isolation and then reviewing the system as a whole (the supply side). We would be attempting to answer the question of what is working and what is not in terms of things like behaviours, unintended consequences and administration costs per tax dollar, as well as in terms of the new goals and key principles to be agreed by the Tax Working Group. Secondly we would want to understand what level of tax-take is required to run the country in the next five, ten, 15 and 20 years (the demand side). Next we would explore a range of alternative tax systems that would meet the demand side while matching the goals of the system and the new set of principles agreed by the Tax Working Group. We would be exploring what might work and what might not work. Table 4 sets out how we would map the tax system using the alternative ideas we have discussed in this submission. Recommendations on mapping the tax landscape 46. Develop an approach that enables you to explore a range of alternative tax systems to discuss and propose to ministers and the wider public. 33 | P a g e Table 4: A possible tax landscape for New Zealand Note: A tick represents a tax the Institute would support investigating in detail.

Chapter 2: The future environment 1. Support further foresight and risk reporting at IRD and develop scenarios to explore what risks or combination of risks might lead to significant reductions and/or increases in the tax- take. Explore not only ways to collect tax but the size of the tax-take needed to manage the risks ahead. 2. Collect data on the changing structures of commercial organisations: a. Understand the landscape of business in New Zealand and monitor it over time. b. Identify the distinction between charitable organisations and charitable organisations that run for-profit companies in order to respond to the changing needs of tax providers and other users. For example, make an iwi and corporate charity subsection on the Charities Register and look at how this interrelates with the Companies Register. c. Look more closely at social enterprise organisations and how benefits are shared/gained within these. d. Consider a ‘robot tax’. 3. Support reporting on cyber-security breaches, particularly where tax data is compromised. 4. Maintain income tax and company tax regimes as ‘broad-based’ and with current thresholds in place (i.e. although we support changes in the tax rates we do not support a shift to progressive company tax for SMEs etc.). However, also explore ways to significantly increase the tax-take in terms of collecting additional revenue through taxing consumer assets, goods and services (e.g. capital gains tax on third dwellings, GST on products purchased online from overseas), polluting goods (e.g. phosphates and plastics), goods that have long-term health impacts (e.g. sugar) and scarce resources (e.g. water). 5. Explore in more detail the implications of applying tikanga Māori across the tax system. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system 6. Consider the seven principles (i) to (vii) on p. 7 of this submission. 7. Research tax loopholes for each type of tax dollar collected. 8. Report regularly on the administration costs of each type of tax dollar collected (e.g. what is the most cost-effective and robust way to collect tax over time). 9. Research whether we are policing our tax laws well enough and review the penalty fee applied to each type of tax dollar collected (e.g. what is the most cost-effective and robust way to police tax collection over time? Are penalties significant enough to act as a disincentive?). 10. Research whether we are taxing low income brackets too much and high income brackets too little. 11. Research ways tax is currently being (or could be) crafted to deliver better outcomes for society (e.g. which is most cost-effective: creating a special rebate for hybrid cars (feebate) or increasing petrol taxes?). 12. Research BEPS and develop strategies to combat illegal behaviour and/or make undesirable behaviour illegal. See Section G. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system 13. Improve the tax system to deliver public good objectives, in particular, to tackle poverty and improve the environment. 35 | P a g e 14. Make for-profit and not-for-profit entities transparent in a central register (combining the companies register and the charities register) as an entity’s tax status is not always apparent or easy to find. 15. Increase the tax on petrol purchased within New Zealand’s largest cities to help New Zealand move to a low-emissions economy and to help fund public transport. 16. Research ways to encourage saving for retirement via the tax system. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system 17. Research ways tax systems can be used to deliver better outcomes for social and environmental capital. 18. Research types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system 19. New taxes for consideration are discussed in Part 2. These include Section A: Sanitary items GST Exemption, B: Carbon Tax and Livestock Tax, C: Sugar Tax, E: Water Tax, and F: a Plastic Tax. Chapter 7: Specific challenges 20. Introduce a capital gains tax on any third or more dwelling. This intentionally excludes a family home and a secondary dwelling (such as a bach or apartment or boat). 21. We do not support a progressive company tax regime. Section A: Sanitary items GST Exemption 22. Research the Canadian, Irish, Kenyan and US approaches to exempting sanitary items from sales taxes in order to identify the most effective way of reducing the cost of these items in New Zealand. 23. Research the overall tax revenue gained from the sale of sanitary items and ways in which this might otherwise be gained if these items were made GST-free. 24. Research alternative ideas to zero-rating goods (in order to correct the current gender inequity in the tax system) by looking into solutions such as credits for sanitary items, Pharmac funding of sanitary items, or other options. Section B: Sugar Tax 25. Research the long-term impact on dental decay and obesity levels in counties (or states) that have adopted a sugar tax. 26. Collect further data on the ‘substitution-effect’ problem. Section C: Carbon Tax and Livestock Tax 27. Prepare an updated CBA comparing an ETS with a carbon tax. 28. Research which mechanism is most effective (using international examples) at discouraging political manipulation of the national carbon budget (either through raising the units of carbon allowed or lowering the carbon tax amount). 29. Research whether a carbon tax is more effective than an ETS in confronting the difficult issue of how to tax primary agricultural producers. 36 | P a g e Section D: Alcohol Tax 30. Consider raising the price of alcohol by increasing the existing excise tax. Section E: Water Tax 31. Include water taxes as part of the scope to this review. 32. Research the economic impacts of a fresh water tax and a phosphorus tax on agricultural and horticultural industries. 33. Consult iwi and urban Māori for their views on the commercial use of fresh water (e.g. bottling water, irrigation etc.). 34. Research who is the best party (e.g. central or local government) to collect fresh water and water pollutant taxes. Section F: Plastic Tax 35. Research mechanisms for collecting revenue on single-use plastic bags and explore how this revenue might be redistributed for environmental measures. 36. Research other jurisdictions’ approaches to disincentivising excessive plastic packaging and the environmental and administrative efficacy of these approaches. 37. Research the impact on lower-income consumers of a plastic bag tax to explore whether this tax may disproportionately impact those who do not have access to cars (and therefore access to a stable supply of reusable bags). Section G: Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) and Tax Treaties 38. Review the 2009 ‘Convention between Australia and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Fringe Benefits and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion’. Specifically, put in place a public reporting framework to monitor transactions between New Zealand subsidiaries and their parent companies in terms of BEPS and tax treaties. This could be progressed under s 17 of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. 39. Require ‘tax paid to the New Zealand Government’ to be disclosed as a separate item in the cash flow statement of all financial statements filed with the Companies Office or, alternatively, make this information a requirement under s 211 of the Companies Act. 40. Update Table 3 above and ensure it is published annually to the public (possibly prepared by MBIE) to understand the organisation landscape in operation in New Zealand and benchmark it over time. 41. Clarify the use and value of business numbers and how they relate to IRD numbers. For example, could we use the business number to track tax payments, tax avoidance and tax compliance? a. Improve the quality of reporting. For example: require every company to use its legal name/s on the cover of every annual report filed and to state on the inside cover its business number, registered address and industry classification used by Statistics New Zealand. b. Implement wider use of industry classifications to track tax paid across sectors. c. Statistics New Zealand and the Charities Commission need to put in place a separate charity classification system (e.g. poverty, environment, mental health etc.). 37 | P a g e Section H: Reporting: Government Department Strategies and Annual Reports 42. IRD should disclose data and other relevant information on the effectiveness of the tax system in their annual report. This should include benchmarking taxes over time (e.g. by analysing compliance costs, administration costs and penalties by dollars and quantity) and analysis of the risks and opportunities that lie ahead. 43. GDSs should be published by IRD on their strategy for taxing the public, explaining their approach, the risks and opportunities they foresee and the frequency with which these strategies will be reviewed. The name of each GDS should be accessible in the annual report of the IRD. Section I: Local government property taxes (rates) and other sources of revenue 44. Include local government taxes as part of the scope to this review to ensure they are working correctly, cost effectively and fairly. Assess whether there are any lessons or alignments that might be put in place to deliver a fairer and more cohesive tax system in New Zealand. This is particularly relevant for two reasons: (i) climate change is likely to negatively impact some local communities more than others and (ii) social and natural capital tend to be local and financial and human capital tend to be national. 45. Encourage local governments to issue a consolidated annual report showing, for example, the total of all taxes collected. Part 4: Mapping the tax landscape 46. Develop an approach that enables you to explore a range of alternative tax systems to discuss and propose to ministers and the wider public. 38 | P a g e Appendix 1: History of tax and benefits in New Zealand Note: This text comes from thread 26: Tax and benefits in the third edition ofMcGuinness Institute’s signature book Nation Dates: Events that have shaped the nation of New Zealand.

Date Event Details 1841 1 Jul First New Zealand tariff system introduced The Customs Regulation Ordinance 1841 introduces the first tariff. Previously, New Zealand came under the jurisdiction of the New South Wales tariff regulations. (Goldsmith, 2008: 18) 1845 19 Apr First local government rates system attempted The Public Roads and Works Ordinance 1845 represents the first attempt to establish a system whereby local authorities could levy rates to pay for things such as roads, bridges, waterworks and markets. This is followed by several pieces of legislation in the 1860s, including the Municipal Corporations Act 1867, which aimed to consolidate local authorities. (Goldsmith, 2008: 48–49) 1866 Oct Stamp and death duties introduced ‘The first permanent tax taken directly from the taxpayer – rather than indirectly’ is stamp and death duties. Previously, ‘over 60% of tax revenue came from alcohol and tobacco’. Sugar was also taxed. The stamp and death duties are ‘forced on the population \[due to\] the cost of the 1860s New Zealand wars’. ‘Stamp and death duties \[are\] passed into law in October 1866.’ Stamp duties tax documents (such as mortgage deeds) and death duties tax inheritance. Death duties exist in some form until 1992 when they are abolished by the Minister of Finance Ruth Richardson. (Goldsmith, 2008: 308; 2010a) 1878 29 Oct Land tax introduced Premier Sir George Grey introduces a land tax through the Land Tax Act 1878 to shift the burden of taxation off the poor. This is replaced the following year with a broader property tax that covers the value of land, herds and personal possessions. Over time, income tax (rather than land tax) becomes the more prevalent tax. 39 | P a g e (Goldsmith, 2010a; McAlister et al., 2012: 4) 1891 8 Sep Income tax introduced The Liberal Party comes to power promising to introduce progressive income tax. It passes the Land and Income Assessment Act 1891. Anyone who earns less than £300 per year is exempt from paying tax on income (which includes the majority of the population). Income tax increasingly becomes the largest source of government revenue. \[t26–1927\] (Goldsmith, 2010b; McAlister et al., 2012) 1927 15 Nov Motor-Spirits Taxation Act 1927 As car ownership increases a tax on petrol is introduced, justified by the need to fund new roads. Petrol continues to be taxed. (Goldsmith, 2008: 158) 1930 11 Oct Poll tax introduced to create funds for unemployment relief The government imposes a £1 10s poll tax on every male over the age of 20 by passing the Unemployment Act 1930. ‘Poll’ is an old English term for ‘head’, hence a ‘poll tax’ is a fixed amount per person. In 1931 an additional 1.25% flat income tax is introduced as an ‘Emergency Unemployment Charge’. This is the first time all citizens have been asked to pay some direct taxation. (Goldsmith, 2010c) 1933 8 Feb Sales tax introduced A 5% sales tax is introduced on all goods sold, with the exception of most everyday food items and items used by farmers. This is one of the first indirect taxes that is not levied at the border. (Goldsmith, 2008: 175; 2010c) 1958 26 Jun Black Budget introduces PAYE and increases indirect taxation The incoming Minister of Finance, Arnold Nordmeyer, introduces the Black Budget in response to the balance of payments crisis. The budget introduces the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system for income tax and doubles duties on beer, spirits, tobacco and cars. ‘The outcome was an 18 per cent increase in taxation.’ (Goldsmith, 2010d; McDermott & Sethi, 2010a; McKinnon, 2003: 219–220) 40 | P a g e 1986 1 Oct Goods and Services Tax introduced As part of the Labour Government’s economic reforms, a 10% tax is added to most goods and services, increasing the reliance on consumption tax for government revenue. This tax is increased to 12.5% in 1989 and then to 15% in 2010. (MCH, 2017x) 1991 30 Jul Richardson releases ‘mother of all budgets’ Finance Minister Ruth Richardson announces ‘the mother of all budgets,’ which cuts welfare benefits, introduces market rates on state houses, and, through the Employment Contracts Act 1991, ‘de-unionise\[s\] much of the workforce’. (Bohan, 2004: 176; James, 2016; Waldegrave et al., 2003, 197–198) 2015 16 Nov Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015 Rapidly rising house prices, particularly in Auckland, lead to the introduction of a bright-line test for the sale of residential property. With the ‘exception of the main family home’, this test requires ‘income tax to be paid on any capital gains from the sale of residential property that is bought and sold within two years’. This is the closest New Zealand has to a capital gains tax. (Bell, 2017; Claus, Jacobsen & Jera, 2004: 18, fn. 33; Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue & Treasury, 2015: 1; Roughan, 2017: 246–247) 41 | P a g e Appendix 2: People Deprivation Index People Deprivation Index Singh, H.

For many years my properties were cashflow negative. I did not deliberately set our for this to happen, as to me running a property at a loss makes little sense. However in the late 1980s and early 1990s (following the share market crash, in which I lost money I had hoped to use to refinance my properties), interest rates rose. property prices dropped, rents dropped alarmingly and as it was a renter's market the tenants could demand concessions such as new drapes to match their furniture). In addition costs such as insurance and rates and water went up (they never go down). I made substantial losses. Unfortunately, these (unexpected) losses were ring fenced then with only $10,000 per annum being allowed. Within two years the legislation around this was reversed, as the (un)expected consequences included loss of rental properties. Even though ring fencing was reversed the rules re the previous losses stayed in place and I had to spread the loss over the next six years. This precluded me from making rational decisions about new investments. Since this time my properties have been cashflow positive, although I seem to have an unexpected large cost (and/or loss of income) on each property about once every ten years. i.e. I have around 10 investment properties with a 10% of a problem (these have included landslips, failure of a re-roof, replacement of a bathroom due to a hidden leak, a septic tank failure - it had to be replaced). I also have at times had a dud tenant who caused damage and/or failed to pay rent. As it takes a while to get a Tenancy Tribunal Hearing and more time to get it actioned (e.g. an eviction), there is often no income for several months, while the standard costs (insurance, rates, mortgage, body corporate fees etc) continue, then thousands may be spent remediating damage (which the current rules deem to be at the landlord's cost, not the tenant's), while the place still remains empty (I am facing this very predicament at present). So a stream of positive cashflow years may be followed by one with a loss, so it hardly seems fair to prevent this being claimed in a given year. Many expenses and cashflows are also predicted to be lumpy. e.g. my daughter is considering investing in a rental property and is looking at three different scenarios presented by a property consulting firm. In these, years of profits may be followed by a loss due to fixed interest rates going up at the end of the fixed term and increased maintenance being scheduled every few years. I also prepare Long Term Maintenance Plans for several body corporates (as required by law). Even though I try to spread the maintenance costs evenly over the years, this is impossible due to several costs being relatively high (e.g. a complete exterior repaint, replacing a shared driveway, renewing services). It makes economic sense to do some of these at the same time. e.g. replace stormwater, sewerage, phone, gas and power lines and then relay the driveway. So all the costs tend to be lumped. Other costs also arise for which the investor has little control. For instance, we are faced with putting in or upgrading insulation and smoke alarms with the former not being deductible. We do not yet know what will be required under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill recently passed. For instance if we have to provide heat pumps we bear costs of several thousand per property. If an individual investor had been making profits for some years and paying tax of these, then was faced with high body corporate fees for a given year, then it is hardly fair to ring fence this loss. If other costs are then deemed non-deductible on top of this, then landlords may be driven out of the business. The state would end up having to provide more accommodation (as occurred in the early 1990s, leading to the abandonment of ring fencing then). Such situations are not good for investors, tenants or the State. So think very carefully of the consequences and inequalities of ring fencing being applied to residential property investments (particularly as they are not applied to other forms of business). John Paynter MSc, BCom, JP I am happy to meet the Working Group to discuss this issue and provide documentation of practical examples where legitimate losses have occurred in the past or may occur in the future. \[1\] 2 From:Kathy Gordon Sent: Thursday, 10 May 2018 8:57 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Future of tax background paper Dear Tax Working Group Many thanks for publishing the above paper. It made for interesting reading and I can see that there are some challenges facing the group regarding fairness in taxation and efficiency in revenue gathering for the future. As a Humanities teacher of nearly 40 years, to me, taxation needs to deal with the disparities in wealth that have developed in our country since the late 1980's. Despite the issues regarding the administration of exempting food and drink from gst, I still believe that it will be fairer for lower income households. As you state, 1/5 of those incomes are spent on food. We need New Zealand children to be well nourished, so it is well worth the effort. It should be relatively easy to define luxury food and drink items or sugary items and they could attract gst. I don't believe that increasing welfare benefits for lower income households is a socially acceptable alternative to gst exemption on food. Welfare is still a stigma and many New Zealanders criticize people who receive ANY income support. If zero rating food is in the too hard basket, how about having the first $10,000 of annual income free of paye for families? Regarding gst in online purchases from overseas, yes, let's have it and make the supplier register for and collect the tax, not distribution services in NZ. They are Kiwi companies and shouldn't have more compliances added to their business operations. Capital Gains Tax rather than a Wealth tax please, your own research supports this idea! I agree with your comparative evidence that New Zealand is poor at encouraging its residents to save for retirement. There are no concessions in this regard and they should be implemented quickly so that our youth will not be poverty stricken in old age and the country in financial ruin - even after we baby boomers are gone! You could have superannuation contributions that are tax free from gross income, to allow personal 'Super' funds to grow rapidly and not tax the end payout too harshly. In addition, encourage our children to save by not taxing the few dollars that they earn in interest per year. If they start saving when they are young, people will continue the habit if it is seen as worthwhile. That's probably more than I am allowed to say but again, you have given interested people an opportunity to contribute, for which I am grateful. I want to see this country become the best place in the world to live, as it has been in the past. Kind Regards, Kathy Gordon. \[1\] 3 From: Sent:Monday, 7 May 2018 11:39 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Comments on taxes from Steve Dudley LAND TAX This is unfair since land is already taxed via rates. If it is introduced will you only tax the productive part of the land, since some land owners (farmers and lifestylers) may have already allocated some of the land to bush/forestry for environmental reasons? Will those owners who plant lots of trees on their land be rewarded? If land is to be taxed then owners should be allowed to build an extra (second) residential property on it, particularly if the land is rural. On rural properties this additional home will take very little away from the size of the property. GST GST on RATES is clearly unfair since it is a tax on a tax. Remove GST from food purchases. This will assist the under-privileged. TAXATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS All New Zealanders should be treated equally when it comes to tax. OVERSEAS OWNERS OF NZ PROPERTY They should be taxed on the difference between the tax already paid in their own country and what would be due if they were taxed at NZ rates. FINES Increase fines for bad behaviour; speeding, cell phone use while driving, littering, dumping, etc. CAPITAL GAINS TAX Most unfair to tax those who have been successful, particularly tax on second homes. ESTATE DUTIES, GIFT AND INHERITANCE TAX These are all taxes on what is left after already paying a life-time of taxes. Having paid taxes all my life it is reprehensible that I should pay tax, on my death, on what is left. Why can I not gift my children money or assets, tax-free, during my lifetime? There is no compelling reason why inheritors should pay tax, since you are really taxing the dead. \[1\] \[1\] 4 From:Peter Webb Sent: Sunday, 6 May 2018 5:49 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Tax proposal Hello, It is good to see from the analysis of respondants that a majority do want change to tax in New Zealand. Although I did not make a submission, I do agree with many respondents who want a more comprehensive capital gains tax. Here is some other ideas with the rational behind each one: Make unpackaged and unprocessed fresh fruit and vegetable GST free. This would encourage all New Zealanders to make better food choices. Make the $20k of income tax-free. This would benefit all income earners. It will also give a living- wage to minimum-wage earners without hitting employers in the pocket. Introduce a land tax on under-utilised intercity land. This would disincentive "land-bankers" and therefor free-up land for medium and high density housing - land that is already connected to infrastructure like roads and water. A full capital gains tax on all investment, both long and short term, excluding the family home. The current situation allows people with excess capital to invest in shares or property, both of which are not fully taxed on capital gains. These investment options are only available to the rich, given then access to a tax-loophole unavailable to low-income earners. Introduce at new top tax of 40% on earners over $150k. This would bring NZ top-tax rate inline with the vast majority of countries in Europe, North Amirice, and Australia. Finally, adjusting the other income tax rates so that the overall government tax take is the same as what is is now. As I do not have full NZ Treasury income tax information, I do not know the exact rates. However, here is an example. Begin End Rate Example Pay Tax per annum Take Home Pay per ammum Effective Income Tax Rate $ - $ 20,000 0% $ 30,000 $ 2,000 $ 28,000 6.67% $ 20,000 $ 40,000 20% $ 50,000 $ 7,000 $ 43,000 14.00% $ 40,000 $ 80,000 30% $ 80,000 $ 16,000 $ 64,000 20.00% $ 80,000 $ 120,000 35% $ 100,000 $ 23,000 $ 77,000 23.00% $ 120,000 $ 160,000 40% $ 150,000 $ 42,000 $ 108,000 28.00% $ 160,000 + 45% $ 250,000 $ 86,500 $ 163,500 34.60% These proposals would give the vast majority of New Zealanders more after-tax income, free up intercity land for developing housing, encourage healthy food choices, and close tax loopholes that are only available to the rich. \[1\] 5 I would very much appreciate any feedback on my proposals. Kind Regards, Peter Webb 6 From:miriam marcon Sent: Sunday, 6 May 2018 12:06 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Some ideas perhaps To whom it may concern, I have some comments to make on this subject and hope that some might have some merit. I will put them in bullet point format as ideas come to mind. Mostly my motivation is to see less companies avoiding tax or individuals also, especially foreign interests and use of NZ as tax haven and locals involved in that ought to be investigated. Persons banned in a fiscal sense overseas should not be able to work in NZ and use NZ laws to advise others overseas how to avoid tax. In my limited knowledge I just want fairer tax for low income earners, more people able to pay more tax who can afford to and for attempts at savings to be more possible. For it to be possible to move into a higher tax bracket rather than languish in low income. well you get the idea. - tighten up tax areas around donations to political parties and so on by individuals or groups. not a tax write off. can't donate to more than one entity. - sugar tax and possibly salt tax. - employ persons to confirm beneficiaries statuses to reduce benefit fraud. known fathers / partners separated must pay child support - No Stamp Duty. - An 'under the table 'amnesty of sorts: for example a wait -person trying cafe work for a day to see if it might be a job for them , works a day then decides it's not for them or the employer says so and they get paid for a days work. Another example of someone getting a trades-person to put in French doors, less cost , no council approval . How about compulsory notation of 'under the table' work i.e job done , cost but under figure of say $300 nothing is paid or only 50% tax is paid if over $100 Trades-person work occurs without council approval it must be declared at point of sale of house ( buyer beware.) Every now and then audit to note areas of under the table work and possible rorts. - An Extraction tax in addition to existing company tax for foreign owned companies that take NZ Resources like water, oil and gas. - A Fiscal Extradition Treaty with trading partners to remove persons banned from business operations overseas but found setting up trusts in NZ or found connected to money laundering or operating businesses of any sort and so on to be extradited back to home country losing option for residency, citizenship or tourist visas. - Feminine Hygiene products , toilet paper and Nappies for children or adults ought to be Tax Exempt. - End tax on secondary or third jobs for low income persons. Persons having to work two or three jobs in low income bracket are overly taxed if work second job or other deemed necessary for decent income. Higher tax on secondary or third jobs negates benefit of working those extra jobs. Or if can't then tax at lower or same rate as first job. \[1\] 7 - Capital Gains Tax on all houses except family home. No land Tax for residential property or Stamp Duty. But Secondary properties must pay Capital Gains Tax , e.g investment properties and multiple properties. All persons to can benefit from Property value must be named and identified on Titles. - New Immigrants including Australians must build New and not be allowed to buy existing residential property but not subject to Land Tax. - Land Tax for developers and commercial properties and Overseas purchasers of NZ Land. - Flick Tax. Properties bought and on-sold on same day or on sold within 2 years must incur a Capital Gains Tax or Tax related to property bought for purposes of Flicking for profit and not for investment or habitation. - Fixed commission for real estate agents. Agents banned from buying properties themselves for profit from within real estate business dealings. Agent found in breach must pay Conflict of interest Tax. - Agent Tax for real estate agent buying properties for themselves from other options like shares or newspaper and private sales. - Employers paying employees On-Call should have to pay employees a low retainer , taxable as on-call is often insecure employment, random in occurrence and not enough to be declared income or it then becomes Casual Employment. A low retainer would keep persons off benefits , more loyal to employer and that rate such as $10 could be taxed. Actual Amount to be nominated of course. - Is there a way to have a tax-free threshold income for low income earners like in Australia but that is not subject to fraud or abuse? - Employer contribution to Kiwisaver should be separate to Employee wages so staff aren't using own money to assist employers with that compulsory saving like in Australia. - Would employers take on apprenticeships again if govt incentivised and in part tax deductible or given a rebate? explore. If wages for apprenticeships were higher than benefits and and minimum wage, workers would be more incentivised to take them on and more likely to remain loyal to company and not subject to taxation that was then a disincentive to remain in apprenticeships. - Subject Companies overseas seeking to use NZ as Tax haven to Tax. Call it a Welcome tax if they seek to set up trusts or companies based in NZ in order to launder money from overseas or avoid tax for company tax by setting up Trusts. Tax lawyers acting for such companies based in NZ, Lawyers, Estate Agents or whomever set up companies in NZ for overseas interests seeking to circumvent NZ Tax Law. Audit and apply penalties to Lawyers and relevant interests. Conflict of interest Tax could apply to Lawyers etc found involved in helping companies avoid tax. - Interpol Tax group to prevent tax fraud and avoidance - tighten up company tax deductibles. - Tighten Criteria for definition of Public Trusts and Charities To avoid business entities , lobby groups or political entities and so on can't claim Trust Status in order to avoid company tax. For Example Gloriavale and NZ First, Destiny Church and so on. - increase public trust tax. - Change Charities Tax so they can be tax free or given rebate but not both. -Enforce that Overseas Companies Operating in NZ must be subject to NZ Tax Laws. 8 - Family Trusts Tax must be moved from 33% to 36% All beneficiaries to be named . Trustees on more than one Trust be subject to Tax? Tax codes for Trusts Personal or otherwise must be disclosed. - Bribery Tax. Persons from overseas or NZ found to be donating for favour or in conflict on interest can be subject to Tax. If from Overseas can have their residency status or citizenship status revoked as well especially if seeking to influence unduly NZ Politics. - Overseas investors who do not live in NZ but have got residency through economic promise should have to pay Tax on Land and Business interests they have in NZ if are not resident for at least 6 months of every year. - Tourist Tax at border and Compulsory registration of Freedom Campers for safety reasons. Seasonal Workers must organise work in advance and Woofers tax at border. - GST Rise - Conduct Random Forensic Audits which is a requirement to agree to in want to do business in NZ. - Subject student visa and working visas to tax. Persons on tourist visas found working must pay tax on work done. Student visas? must be able to self-fund and not work while on student visa or must be subject to working student visa tax special code. - tourists found working as prostitutes while on holiday ought to pay tax? - Forensic auditing ought to have power to arrange investigation of persons suspected or known to be helping individuals or overseas entities from avoiding tax and lawyer etc subject to 'spotters' tax as well as possible criminal action. - limit Complete foreign ownership of NZ companies to share percentage but not full ownership. - no tax rebate for childcare for those in upper income brackets and no universal pension access for those in upper income bracket. - increase marginal tax , tax foreign shareholders more. - increase Company Tax 40% perhaps once into new tax bracket or across the board. - offer rebate for companies who adopt measurable 'Green' policies and practices in business situations. - offer Farmers a rebate for implementing environmental practices on farms measurable. - Toll bridges to have end date and barometer measure not to be used as on-going tax collections. Consider Company builds and tax rebates e.g Coke Bridge, McDonalds expressway but not on-going. -Persons evicted or deported to NZ must pay tax if have been working in NZ before leaving or face jail. - Tax bank deposits less to encourage saving and have interest rates on deposit subject to rate of inflation? more returns would see less persons accessing kiwi- saver early bec could earn savings in banks and other places earning more money for kiwsaver. - tax bitcoin and darkweb transactions. 9 - gangs can't set up charitable trusts and launder dodgy money through. - limit companies setting up to get charged company tax not income tax - Review Tax around Australians and access to NZ services in light of Australians removing privileges to NZ. tighten benefit access criteria. NZers must pay tax if working in Australia but cannot access Social welfare payments. Consider something equivalent. - maaori land should be subject to tax but low rate and not able to use trusts to avoid land tax. - number of employees based tax? anyway , as I said i have no tax knowledge but I hope that some of this is useful. Yours Sincerely, Miriam Marcon 10 From:Irene Johnson Sent: Saturday, 5 May 2018 4:03 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission To: The Tax Working Group From Irene Johnson I do not want to appear before the committee SUBMISSION 'Equity and fairness' should be the core value of tax policy. All policy should be judged against these words. comments; The tax working group should explore tax methods which will ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. I have read the Child Poverty Action submission and strongly support the aims: in particular: 'The future of tax should have a focus on children'. Our Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has stated that 'The Government is committed to supporting families and children'. The Child Poverty Action recommendations support this ideal. Housing: I support the recommendation that 'The Government should set up an expert group to design a net equity housing tax'. The Government should consider a tax (‘health levy’) on sugary drinks. That the tax scale be more progressive by increasing tax rates on high personal income, AND a more progressive system of personal tax thresholds, to help/ correct the current system where low income earners pay a disproportionate amount of their incomes in income tax, GST, fuel and other excise taxes. GST of 15% is applied comprehensively, this should be offset by Working for Families and other tax credits. (see- personal tax thresholds). ‘Māori and Pacific have a much younger age structure than the total New Zealand population’ Comment: Māori and Pacific people die at a younger age than non-Māori/Pacific people. Inequality: See comments re progressive taxes. Retirement Savings: New Zealand has KiwiSaver, however low income families find it difficult to impossible to save. See tax thresholds, Working for Families. Taxes and behaviour: Taxes that are intended to modify behaviour should be considered with extreme care. \[1\] \[1\] 11 Comment: The 2010 Law Commission Report and recommendations re 50% increase on alcohol was dismissed by the then government. The Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act, 2012 failed to address the issue. 12 From:Paul Gibson Sent: Wednesday, 2 May 2018 12:47 PM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Paul Gibson Subject: submission of Paul Gibson to Tax working Group focusing on levy for sustainable Disability Support System Kia ora, Summary: I recommend the Tax Working Group investigate a Levy (incorporating and building on the existing ACC levy system) to Sustainably Fund a Transformed Disability Support System, and initiates a national conversationon such a levy.. This brief submission is from Paul Gibson, Currently course leader at the Open polytechnic , and former Disability Rights Commissioner at the Human rights Commission. I have interest and expertise in transformation of the disability support system. I also refer you to the original Woodhouse report and work which led to the ACC Scheme, the work of the Australian Productivity Commission which lead to the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). And current research by Warren Forster on the funding of a sustainable disability support system. The original Woodhouse proposal was for a comprehensive scheme supporting all disabled people, independent of cause of impairment/ disability, through an independent fund from a specific levy rather than tax. The biggest policy and funding initiative in Australia in the last decade has been the NDIS, a scheme similar to that envisioned by Woodhouse. It was developed largely by the Productivity Commission, disabled people and their families, and actuaries. It responded to failing and unsustainable support systems run by the states, outdated and inefficient models of support that lacked focus on social capital and connectedness, an increasing proportion of the population being disabled driven largely by changing demographics and aging, a number of court cases lost by governments, fairness and increasing labour costs, a commitment to the recently developed Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, massive inequality of income between disabled and non-disabled people, an over-representation (by several times the non- disabled population) of disabled people not in employment, education or training (NEET), and an OECD report putting Australia at the bottom of countries on data on the employment of disabled people. Apart from separate state systems, all these factors exist in NZ, which was not included in the OECD report and did not supply data to the OECD at the time of the report. The NZ experience was comparable with Australia's on disability, some areas we had better outcomes (ACC funded disability, indigenous people, attitudes towards people with mental illness) and in some areas we were worse (outcomes for disabled children's support and poverty, disabled parents, housing, outcomes for non-indig enous non ACC funded people). Both nations do reasonably well in income support for older disabled people, through different funding systems. Our data collection was not as good as Australia's. It seems a major oversight that the biggest change in the tax/ revenue/ levy system in our nearest neighbour facing the same issues does not receive mention in the tax working group consultation document. Over a decade ago, New Zealand had developed a world leading national disability strategy, then positively led the development of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Then New Zealand had a limited national conversation on support system failure at the same time as Australia's, first centred around a failed NZ government project on the review of long term supports, then a Social Services Select committee Inquiry, which led again to little tangible change, and then a fur ther report commissioned by the health minister on support system failures and lack of safeguards. \[1\] 13 Prior to the NDIS, Australia part- funded its state health systems through a Medicare levy. Australia was able to generate a national conversation on the issue of disability support. A conference on potential national initiatives to benefit from Australia's economic boom a decade ago resulted in a recognition of prioritising support for people most likely to otherwise be left behind, and translating this financial support into investment Through an actuarially designed insurance scheme. It was recognised the downstream costs of not investing early in disabled people was excessive, and over time the scheme would become fiscally neutral. The Australian national conversation created the public support and political palatability for an increase in the Medicare levy targeted at disability support that otherwise did. not exist for general tax increases. The idea for the NDIS emerged from this process as the nation's number one new priority. The public also expressed cynicism that politicians would not prioritise and ensure sustainable ongoing funding for the support needs of disabled people through the general tax system, whether or not there were increases in tax rates or the total tax take. There was trust in a targeted levy. The Medicare levy part funding of state health systems has continued since the introduction of the NDIS, with an increase in the levy. The National Disability Insurance Agency runs at arm's length from government under a similar arrangement to NZ's ACC. The NDIS is progressively rolling out to the point of directly funding 460 thousand people ( providing information to other disabled people and community development)at a cost of $23B. 60 thousand People with psycho social disability (long term mental illness) are also directly supported in the community through the scheme. Successive NZ governments and parliamentary select committees have reviewed and pledged to transform our support system, making it more responsive, person centred, but this has never got beyond small scale pilots as there has been a lack of genuine willingness to address how to fund the system and make it sustainable. Generally global innovation in disability support under 65 has led to innovation being adopted for the disability age care system. The NDIS roll out is ambitious, and striking problems, particularly the development of the workforce is not keeping pace with the pace of funding roll out. However the basis of the scheme remains strong, with a cross party political consensus to support and sustain it. There are many lessons NZ could learn directly from the Australian experience. We have recently sign up to the UN sustainable development goals, the overarching drive being to "leave no one behind". If the government and Tax working group was to pro-actively look for who is most likely to be left behind, it would put a stronger emphasis on disabled people. AS Disability rights Commissioner, I had been a referee for funding applications by Warren Forster, and can confirm his track record of effectiveness. He is now exploring globally the options for building a sustainable funding system which may expand beyond Australia's current NDIS commitment to disabled people (including people with long term mental illness) under 65. He is also exploring if and how incentivisation can be built into a new scheme. . I recommend the working group meet and engage directly with him. Thank you for considering this submission. Paul Gibson \[1\] 14 From:Chasse Court Sent: Wednesday, 2 May 2018 2:44 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Re: Thank you: Future of tax submission Further to my previous suggestion regarding making those who buy property live in it for five years before being able to sell it or rent it out to stop foreign investors buying up all the property in NZ. My 2c worth about the fact that G.S.T will now be charged on foreign purchases... Firstly I buy locally where I can but you can't always get what you need locally because New Zealand retailers refuse to bring it in for one reason or another. Secondly if I am buying goods from overseas that I simply can not get in New Zealand because no one stocks them and/or an item is not produced in New Zealand it really cooks my goose that I am having to pay G.S.T on these items - I feel this is wrong. I understand that cheap Chinese goods are flooding the market - fine put a 15% tariff on those goods but charging G.S.T in a blanket manner is wrong. Thirdly - I note that retailers are saying it levels the playing field - this is wrong in a lot of cases except where those retailers are charging exorbitant markups on goods and believe me I have found goods marked up by 4500% - something that I can buy overseas for .33c but is sold here for $14.85 how is adding G.S.T to that going to level the playing field for retailers - the answer is it is not - this adding G.S.T is just the government being greedy. Fourth - our G.S.T is now at 15% the previous government lied to everyone and told us that this rate was to keep us in line with Australia's G.S.T and I don't understand how this is keeping us in line with Australia when G.S.T there is 10% how the hell does that work? From my perspective this is just the government being a bunch of greedy bastards and if they do this I can't wait to vote them out. \[1\] 15 From:sandra gilchrist Sent: Tuesday, 1 May 2018 7:53 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission In consider ing the tax system it is important that any changes made to what is taxed and how it is taxed are signalled well in advance of those changes being introduced and are not retrospective. To tax retrospectively means people would be hit by taxes they knew nothing about. They would have had no way to plan for this, to make provision, or to make different decisions armed with the knowledge of what that might mean to their savings. This would be unfair. There has been a lot of talk about a Capital Gains tax and if introduced, questions raised about how it should be administered. A gain or loss on capital is not realised until the asset is sold, until then it is just a paper gain or loss so how could it be taxed before the asset was sold? There was a suggestion in the working paper that gains could be taxed on an annual basis but what happens if there is a loss the following year, does the tax department refund tax paid in a previous year? How would this work for property which would need to be valued each year. Who would do this and how? How would you ensure this is a realistic valuation? Where would the money come from to pay the tax if the asset hasn’t been sold? Would a capital gains tax factor in the true cost of purchasing an asset e.g. the cost of borrowing to buy it? What about other costs incurred / investments made to a property that contributed to the gain and without which the gain would have been less? Not all second properties are rentals. What about the family Bach, a Kiwi tradition. Some of those properties have been in the family for many years and will be for many years to come. They may have cost almost nothing when they were bought / built by the family but may now be sitting on valuable land. Whilst the tax review needs to determine what is right for the country they must also consider what impact their decisions will have on behaviour. Surely it is good to encourage people to save for their future and their retirement. If you penalise this behaviour people may decide it is not worth it and spend for today and not think of tomorrow. Surely it is good to encourage all that can work into employment. Maybe making it worthwhile for people to work by giving them a private allowance before paying tax will increase the value to them of paid employment over benefits, thus making other savings for the government. Doesn’t the country need some rental accomodation to be provided by private investors? Whilst reducing the number of property investors may result in an increase in property available to first time buyers not everybody is in a position to buy or wants to buy. There are many situations where owning is not practical e.g. a student at university. Without private investors the government will have to make up the shortfall. \[1\] 16 From:Malcolm Reeves Sent: Tuesday, 1 May 2018 5:02 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: A woefully ill organised comment done in haste If I only had time ...... I would have loved to do a proper analysis. Tax Review Unfortunately I am too busy with running my business to comment in a balanced and rational way on tax changes. I wish I had more time to sensibly organise and develop my comments below. I have a lot more to say but I need better data on which to found it – not just gut feelings. For as Lord Kelvin said: I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind. I haven’t got the time nor the required date to comply with Lord Kelvin’s comment It seems quite possible that you will get many submissions that will basically say, tax “that” lot more heavily and tax “my lot” less heavily. Also I do not have a grip on the total tax situation – import taxes, GST, fuel taxes, excise taxes, income tax, business taxes, gift and so on. Then there is government income from fines of various types. I look at the British vote on Brexit. Did the public really understand the issues? It is way to complex for the average person and even the government’s economists have not got the total impact under control and analysed. There are some many complex interactions and the impact that changes will make on human behaviour will probably not be foreseen by those involved in policy changes resulting from Brexit. The same when it comes to taxation here. I include myself in that. I do not understand nor can I predict the ramifications of changes. Selective taxation – don’t go there apart from say tobacco, petrol/diesel and alcohol which are already firmly entrenched. Already fuel tax is too high. However recall the distortions selective tax on ice cream, toilet soap (deemed a luxury item), cars with large engines (i.e. over 2 L capacity!! – we got underpowered large cars. Today offset by turbo chargers), trailers and caravans (killed those industries off around the country for many years. The introduction of GST was great. I was paying a top rate of 65 c/$ prior to that. Even now with a lack of government support (i.e. support from my fellow taxpayers because apparently, I earn too much) for certain social services, my overall tax rate is still very high when one takes into account GST, medical costs, income tax etc. We don’t need to go back to the old English days of taxing windows, chimneys and pianos. Be careful with any blanket “tourist” tax. There are many fishhooks in that one too. New Zealand is already an expensive place to visit and unlike some other countries we do not return GST on significant purchases when they are taken out of the country. Don’t get me started on sugar tax. This is a very complex topic. I have been compiling a document for a long time now but unfortunately have not had time to complete it. I have been comforted by the response of both the previous government and the latest government that a sugar tax is not in their planning. If obesity is the target then we should be looking at the total quality of the nation’s diet. One only has to look at purchases by certain socio- economic groups in terms of meat for example – cheap fatty cuts and related products, deep fried takeaways, look at the amount of food consumed by obese people, look at what is in the supermarket trollies of many of the obese – it is not just soft drinks. The sugar in fruits and fruit juices is just as bad. What about people who take several teaspoons per day in coffee and tea. I have been searching for a reference that stated that in the UK about 12% of all sugar was consumed in the form of soft drinks. Will a 10% reduction in soft drink consumption cure obesity? Unlikely but a tax makes a variety of people – politicians and health “experts” feel as though they are doing something. Prior to GST I had business friends boasting about how their companies paid for a lt of their expenditure while “you poor PAYE suckers have no way of dodging tax.” They loved cash sales and subsequent cash purchases. They were annoyed when GST came in because they said it was hardly worth the effort to save just 10%. Be warned – once GST goes higher than it is now there will be increasing avoidance because the return for the risk is some much higher. \[1\] 17 The more fragmented the tax collection methods (types) become the less efficient they become. Every set of hands money passes through adds another cost and apart from adding to wealth/income of those in the handling system leaving less for the recipients or projects for whom or which the tax was collected. Capital gains (specifically on housing). Forget It. Australia as that and they have higher house prices in Melbourne and Sydney as well as sales taxes on housing. The taxation system needs to be simple and understandable. Making exemptions only creates distortions and a lack of fairness. Unfortunately I have not come across a definition of what is fair when it comes to taxation. When it comes to income tax because I trained hard (and forwent income during those years), worked hard as a PAYE taxpayer I have paid 2 to 3 times the income tax that the “average” NZ taxpayer has paid. Is that fair? What is fair. Where is the definition. But the tax system needs to be perceived to be fair. Unfortunately very few of us know exactly who is paying what let alone what we as individuals maybe paying in total taxes. Some years ago I looked at the IRD website – the data was then from the 2012 tx year. I haven’t had time to update it. Very few of my friends realised that; Some 50% of the taxpaying population, with a taxable income under $25,000 pays 9.9% of the total tax. The picture becomes more interesting when another income band is added in. Some 75% of taxpayers have a taxable income of under $50,000. This 75% pay under 29% of the total income tax collected. Those with incomes between$ 25 and $50,000 pay about 15% of the income as tax. Then 90% of people in New Zealand had taxable incomes of up to $76,000. The 15% of the population with incomes between 50 and 76,000 paid on average 24% of the total tax take. Of their income, tax amounts to almost 20%. You can take other stats out of the table but as a matter of interest in 2012 the 72,000 or 2.1% of taxpayers with incomes greater than $140,000 paid on average more than $72,000 in tax with an average tax rate of more than 29%. Overall those 2.1% of taxpayers are paying 21% of the 2012 total tax rate. I wish I was earning or had such oncomes – I don’t. Why do the analyses? Because I am trying to understand our system. I cannot work out a definition of “fair’. Is the above uneven tax distribution fair? It depends who you are and what is your income. Whatever we need a better 9whatever that means) system. I won’t say fairer for I don’t think anyone can create a definition that all will agree as to what is fair when it comes to tax. SO just as the general British population would have understood very poorly the issues about Brexit and been able to make an informed decision I consider the “average person” in NZ (whoever that is) also has a very poor understanding of tax. I have tracked aspects of our taxes for some 40years, I have taught statistics at university and I do not consider that I have a decent comprehension of what constitutes a good tax system.

Some measure of rebalancing of equity in NZ is essential. Currently such huge disparity exists between haves and have nots threatens the fabric of NZ society. Companies and self employed are able to unreasonably shelter from taxation through shifting costs onto business in a way that the waged or salaried are unable to do. For example an employee pays for their travel costs with taxed funds, whilst the business owner pays for travel with untaxed funds. The impact of GST upon lower income people is far greater (as a percentage of income) than upon the wealthy - this even without considering the wealthy’s ability to reclaim GST. I believe the Tax Working Group should consider application of some form of m oney transfer tax. I understand that a tax as small as 0.1% or less could replace much if not all of our current salary and wage taxation. The Taxation Working group should also consider the impact of Friedman’s neo-liberal economic philosophies and whether they have worked in NZ - or in any other country where they have been introduced since the 1980’s. A reversion to the economic principles promoted by Keynes should be seriously considered. One thing is certain. NZ cannot continue on the current inequitable trajectory. It is only a matter of time before social unrest and conflict becomes an increasingly visible scar with potential for violent uprising and general conflict. Kelvin & Julie \[1\] \[1\] 21 From:Neil Crombie Sent: Tuesday, 1 May 2018 12:00 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group To Tax Working Group Secretariat, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the "Future of Tax". My position on all taxation is that the current approach is badly misguided. Taxation has two purposes: (1) To redistribute income and wealth from those with more to those with less; and (2) To change the behaviour of taxpayers. However, both of these goals can be achieved without any taxation. I propose the elimination of all taxation, and direct intervention in the form of a universal basic income (UBI) and bonuses for "good" behaviour for all NZ citizens. The Government has the power to create money: It should use this power rather than taxation. This will eliminate the armies of accountants, lawyers and lobbyists that represent wealth taxpayers and corporations, whose sole purpose is to circumvent the tax system. International transfer pricing rules and large corporations paying minimal income tax are a case in point. Rising income inequality around the world highlights that the current approach to taxation (and trickle-down economics) does not work. The underlying argument is that a carrot is more effective and easier to administer than a stick. Taxation is a stick while UBI and bonuses are carrots. For example, healthy people that do not smoke, drink or overeat - as certified by their doctor - could receive a bonus from the Government. This would be far more effective than a sugar tax or tobacco tax. Similarly, people that drive electric cars should receive a bonus. The list could be quiet extensive. Corporations have known for the longest time that carrots are more effective than sticks. This is why bonuses are paid for "good" behaviour, rather than salary deductions for "bad" behaviour. Of course, the question you are thinking is: What about inflation? If the Government creates money and gives it to the average person, won't this fuel inflation? Not necessarily. Note that retail banks create money on a daily basis: Every time a new loan is made, money is created. This does not fuel inflation. I propose two ways in which inflation can be controlled: First, the Government would have a legislative limit on how much money it can create. This could be expressed as a percentage of GDP. Second, the right of retail banks to create money would be abolished. New loans would need to be tied directly to customer deposits. Customer deposits would need to be held in trust, rather than being recognised as a liability on the retail bank's balance sheet. Similarly interest paid on loans would be held in trust and then this would become interest received on deposits (less a small, regulated commission for the retail banks). As a result, retail banks would only receive fee-ba sed income, not interest income. Instead of trickle-down economics, I propose fountain (or trickle-up) economics. One further mechanism for fighting inflation and ensuring there is sufficient investment in long-term assets would be as follows: People would receive part of their UBI and bonuses in a chequing account and the balance in a untouchable (until retirement) savings account (e.g. Kiwisaver account). The split between spending and invested money would vary based on (1) the individual's total income with people on lower incomes receiving a high proportion as spending money, and (2) the economy's current and projected growth rate. A greater proportion of the money would be invested when the economy is growing, and vice-versa. I realise this is a rather radical proposal, but try to imagine the benefits: NZ would receive a massive influx of overseas investment as income tax rates are reduced to zero. Kiwibank and local banks (e.g. SBS and TSB) would gain customers en masse as the Australian banks would scale down their NZ operations (because their current, astronomical profits are largely based on the Government giving them the right to create money). The people of NZ would be happier and healthier as they gain control over their income and engage in "good" behaviours to earn bonuses. You must realise that money is different at the societal-level than the individual-level. At the individual-level, "balancing the budget" and "saving for the future" are important. However at the societal-level, money is not a resource that can be exhausted; it is a fluid that stimulates economic activity, i.e. people undertaking work or leisure, \[1\] 22 and the production and consumption of "stuff". One people's expenditure is another person's income. A government is different to a household: As it has the power to create money, it does not have to save money. And as a have argued above, inflation is not an issue if this power is kept in check.

Submission To Tax Working Group 2018 “.....it is important that we maintain the trust and confidence of all New Zealanders in the integrity of the tax system. In a democracy such as ours, the ability of the Government to raise revenue rests ultimately on the consent and acceptance of all New Zealanders. In order to maintain this acceptance, and fulfil the trust of New Zealanders, we must ensure that the tax system is fair, balanced, and administered well. This is the goal the Group is working towards. Your submissions will help us achieve it.” (Submissions Background Paper, Tax Working Group, 14 March, 2018 ) It is in the spirit of this goal for the Tax Working Group that I am writing to express my deep concern about the inconsistency in the revised foreign investment fund (FIF) rules enacted in 2007 in relation to a long standing tax treaty between New Zealand and the USA that assures no individual person reporting world wide income to both tax jurisdictions will be taxed on the same money by both countries. FIF Tax Is Inequitable With the passage of the revised FIF rules, all NZ tax residents who held more than $50,000 worth of foreign financial investments in previously exempted grey listed countries, were forced to suddenly change their investment strategy due to a change in taxation strategy. This left them with two choices; Sell (and repatriate your money to NZ where the property market incurred no tax) or hold (and pay FIF tax). New immigrants to NZ had four years to make their decision. Long term immigrants who were already invested prior to the law change had no such grace period in which to consider changes to their investment strategy. Non American New Zealanders were faced the same choice as their American counterparts, (sell or hold) but they did not face the same consequence of double taxation that American born NZ tax residents were faced with. Already obliged to pay capital gains tax to the US on any realised gains, American tax residents of New Zealand faced an additional tax - regardless of the choice they made. If they chose to exit from their foreign investments, the combined capital gains realised from those investments would potentially put them in a higher tax bracket for the year, thereby losing much of their life savings. If they chose to remain invested in foreign companies, they would be required to pay an FIF tax every year AND pay capital gains tax to the USA whenever shares were sold, based on whatever gains were realised over the entire time that they owned those shares. No other category of New Zealand tax resident bound by FIF law is obliged to pay tax on realised gains as well as on unrealised accrued value. The extra burden that this legislation places on American born Kiwis is a clear anomoly in a law whose stated purpose was to remove inconsistencies in the taxation of investments. FIF Tax is Unfair Shortly after the revised FIF rules came into effect on 1 April 2007, the global economic crisis of 2008 led to a catastrophic loss of years worth of growth in mine (and many other's) portfolios. By 2013 many investors had not even recouped their losses from the financial crisis. BUT, they would be taxed on any 'gain' in the value of their portfolio each year as they approached the zero point at which they started, even though their net position remained lower than at the time of the financial crisis. FIF Tax Encourages Speculative Investment “ Foreign tax, of the same nature as New Zealand income tax, can be used to reduce the NZ tax liability in relation to foreign-sourced income that results in assessable income.... Such foreign tax credits (for foreign tax paid on foreign investment income) can only be used to reduce the income tax payable on your FIF income.” (ird #461, May 2016) US federal income tax paid as a US citizen, in respect of dividend and capital gains income sourced in the US from investment in companies included under the FIF tax regime, can be applied as credit to offset FIF tax owing in NZ for that financial year only. “Generally these credits are forfeited (lost) if they are not used... You cannot carry forward unused foreign tax credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss.”(ird #461, May 2016) American New Zealanders who invest long term are disadvantaged as compared to those who speculate short term in a foreign securities market. • FIF tax is payable on an annual basis and there is no carry over tax credit for US tax paid on income sourced in the US from investment in companies included under the FIF tax regime • US capital gains tax is not payable until shares are sold and a gain is realised. If an American born tax resident of NZ is an active trader speculating in foreign financial investments, foreign tax credit is available for US tax paid on financial investment income (dividends and capital gains) that year. That credit can be applied against FIF tax owing that year. Any remaining credit is forfeited. If however, an American who is a New Zealand tax resident buys and holds foreign investments long term, there will be no US capital gains tax paid in the year that can be applied as credit against FIF tax owing to NZ for that year. The only available credit that can be applied against FIF owing will be from US tax paid on dividend income. Any residu FIF tax owing must be paid in full by the investor every year. When the investments are eventually sold, the investor must also pay US capital gains tax on gains that have accrued over the lifetime of each investment. In this way FIF encourages short term speculative behaviour in foreign investments and discourages more conservative buy and hold investment. FIF Tax Is Inconsistent With International Standard Means Of Calculating “Income”. Capital gain is not considered taxable “income” under NZ FIF legislation. Accrued value is not considered taxable “income” under US tax law. As a layperson this is confusing and complicated. FIF Tax Is Arbitrary And Unpredictable In Its Execution Based On Variable Prices And Exchange Rate Fluctuations Between March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, the value of my shares on the US stock market rose by USD $7,571. I neither bought nor sold any shares during that time. No gain was realized and no currency conversion was ever made between USD and NZD. However, because the exchange rate for the USD on March 31, 2015 happened to be.7470 and on March 31, 2016 it was .6909 my unrealized capital gain in NZD (Using the CV method) would be arbitrarily calculated at $60,447NZD! Using the FDR method, 5% of my opening value in NZD was $30,474NZD. Although the only actual income I made in the 2015/16 tax year (NZ Superannuation plus interest and dividends) was less than the FDR, I was required by FIF legislation to pay tax on an additional $30,474NZD “income” - that I never actually realized – and this put me in a higher tax bracket. WHAT I AM PROPOSING In honour of the tax treaty between NZ and USA, and in fairness to American citizens who have made New Zealand their home, I propose the introduction of a grandfather clause to the 2007 FIF amended legislation granting a retrospective exemption to US citizens who were NZ tax residents prior to the amendment coming into effect, and who were already invested in companies located in (then) tax exempt grey listed countries. The exemption that I propose would stand only for those investments already held in previously tax exempt grey listed countries prior to the legislation coming into effect in 2007. Any equities purchased after the 2007 amendment came into effect would be subject to FIF obligations. This minor change could take place on any remedial legislation review day. Precedence for making the change retrospective was established in 2006 when IRD exempted holders of Australian Super Funds from FIF obligations and backdated the exemption to 1993-94. No such consideration was given to how this law change would affect NZ tax residents with US citizenship, all of whom are already obliged to pay US tax when capital gains are realised.

Introduction The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (the Fund) invests money, on behalf of the Government, to help pay for the increased cost of universal superannuation entitlements in the future. The Fund is managed by a Crown entity, the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation (the Guardians). Pursuant to its legislation the Fund is unable to control an operating business. This restriction coupled with our limited internal infrastructure operational resource available to implement and manage investments, results in the Fund having to form like-minded consortia of infrastructure investors with operational expertise, experience and financial capacity to carry out any significant New Zealand direct infrastructure investment. Given the relatively small size and generalist nature of the resident investment funds in New Zealand and the need for co-investors with the Fund to have sufficient financial resources and similar long-term investment horizons and alignment, logical co-investors for the Fund are non- resident Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) and Global Pension Funds. In addition, the co-investors may have specific skills and experience not currently found in New Zealand. The recent unsolicited proposal to the Government by the Fund and its joint venture partner, the global Canadian pension and sovereign fund asset manager - Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ), in relation to the proposed Auckland Light Rail project is a case in point. CDPQ has net assets under management of US$238 billion and has extensive experience in infrastructure development, operation and ownership, in addition to investment, globally. It has directly relevant experience in light rail projects given its experience developing, and now building, Montreal’s 67 km light rail network. New Zealand requires significant new infrastructure to meet its growing population, repair its aging existing infrastructure and deliver the wider socio-economic benefits a fit-for-purpose infrastructure network should enable. To deliver this new infrastructure New Zealand will need significant new sources of capital and funding, construction skills and other operational resources and possible changes to current regulatory settings. International institutional investors are very interested in infrastructure assets as they look to match their long term liabilities. These investors have choices about where they invest and value certainty of the regulatory and tax environment, particularly as these tend to be very long duration assets. Other countries have been active in looking to provide that environment to attract long term investors, and New Zealand needs to make sure it is at least as attractive as those countries to attract the investment in infrastructure that we need. Other jurisdictions, most notably Australia (given its proximity to New Zealand and therefore competition for capital and resources), have dedicated tax regimes to support and incentivise nationally significant infrastructure projects (see the Appendix for details of the specific regimes offered in other countries). These jurisdictions provide long term certainty for investors and tax settings to encourage investors which ensure that the tax environment does not act as a barrier to investment. As the investor for such projects is really choosing between jurisdictions for its investment this suggests that the tax settings may need to be adjusted to ensure that expectations as to both the certainty of and the required return on investment are met. Similar outcomes are achieved in other jurisdictions either through a combination of a lower corporate tax rate or concessional entity taxation (e.g. sovereign immunity or full deductibility on non- recourse funding). Nationally significant infrastructure expertise established in New Zealand by the Fund will open opportunities internationally allowing the Fund to be part of offshore consortia and qualify for similar offshore SWF exemptions . Submission The TWG should consider recommending the implementation of a specific nationally significant infrastructure regime to provide certainty for investors and ensure New Zealand can compete with other jurisdictions in attracting long term capital that brings with it world-class expertise. We believe that such a regime is preferable over other options as it ensures that any regime is targeted to the specific issue, thus limiting the potential for unintended consequences. Specific criteria would be established in relation to Government project approval including but not limited to:  Project size i.e. a minimum spend is required.  Infrastructure projects that pass the “public utility test” and for which there is a specific agreement with the government such as public transit systems, large scale housing development, communication, energy and water reticulation assets etc .  Demonstrated capability to deliver world-class projects.  Commitment to contribute project expertise.  Alignment with the Treasury’s living standards framework. Subject to meeting required deliverables of approval, the project will receive:  A tax rate substantially less than the prevailing corporate tax rate, say half or less, set for a meaningful part of the life of the asset.  No further tax impost on profit distribution to both domestic and foreign investors.  Full deductibility of third party non-recourse funding.  If tax laws are changed prior to the expiry of the term of the concession, the tax conditions relating to Nationally Significant Infrastructure are grand-parented until the end of the concession term. For example, in the event that a capital gains tax was introduced in New Zealand, Nationally Significant Infrastructure would be eligible for a capital gains exemption on exit.  Ability to fast track other required regulatory approvals e.g. RMA approvals, the provision of foreign skilled labour to enable rapid construction.  Approval is project specific i.e. it survives any change of ownership. In designing a Nationally Significant Infrastructure regime we need to ensure international investors are provided with certainty in relation to their tax position prior to them investing and that complexity 1 is kept to a minimum. Please advise if the TWG requires any further information or clarification in relation to our submission. The Fund and its joint venture partner are available to discuss at a time deemed appropriate by the TWG. Yours sincerely Matt Whineray Chief Executive Officer John Payne Head of Tax 1 The Australian Nationally Significant Infrastructure regime is complex with the need to bifurcate an asset and allocate the income accordingly. \[1\] \[1\] Appendix Australia – National Significant Infrastructure Tax Regime (announced in March 2018) Purpose: to ensure Australia retains competitive tax settings for nationally significant infrastructure projects and providing increased certainty for businesses and investors.  Nationally significant infrastructure projects need to be specifically designated / approved as such by the Federal Government Treasurer following an application from an Australian Government Agency which can include a State Government or Territory.  Criteria: o The estimated capital expenditure on the asset is A$500 million or more o Asset is an economic infrastructure asset (defined as either transport, energy, communications or water infrastructure for public purposes) o Infrastructure for public purposes is either available for use by the public, used for the provision of services to the public or used to transport goods that are available for use by or sale to the public. Include roads, ports and electricity generation, transmission and distribution facilities. o In granting approval the Treasurer may consider whether the economic benefits resulting from the asset outweighs the economic costs and whether Infrastructure Australia agrees that the asset is nationally significant infrastructure under the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008. o Need to be new assets no recycling of current infrastructure.  Investment to facilitate productivity enhancing projects.  Effectively limits tax on the income from the asset to 15% for a 15 year period i . Thereafter the income will be taxed at the corporate tax rate (currently 30% but forecast to be reduced to 25%).  Capital gains tax on disposal is also limited to 15%. China  Key public infrastructure projects (such as construction of harbours, airports, highways, power plants or water conservation projects) are exempt from income tax in the first 3 years and taxed on 50% of the taxable income in the following 3 years (starting from the year in which the first amount of business revenue is generated).  Projects engaged in environmental protection, energy or water saving are exempt from income tax in the first 3 years and taxed on 50% of the taxable income in the following 3 years (starting from the year in which the first amount of business revenue is generated). Brazil  Purpose: To increase investment in new infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport, basic sanitation, irrigation and other areas deemed to be a high-priority by the Government. Existing projects may also be included in the event that an expansion takes place, if the expansion is treated as a new project and segregated in a specific purpose company.  Criteria: o Investments must be made through special purpose companies, either publicly traded or closed capital, and divided into shares. o The fund cannot have less than five unit holders, but each unit holder cannot hold more than 40% of its units or receive earnings exceeding 40% of the fund's total earnings. o They must at least adhere to the corporate governance practices established by the Brazil Securities and Exchange Commission for companies invested by equity interest investment funds. o Must participate in the decision-making process of the invested company, with effective influence in the definition of its strategic policies and management, notably through the appointment of members to the board of directors, the holding of shares that are part of the respective control block, the execution of a shareholders' agreement, the execution of an agreement of a different nature, or the adoption of a procedure that assures the fund effective influence in the definition of its strategic policy and management.  Incentives are granted for 5 years from the approval of the project. Income from redemption of quotas, including liquidation, is taxed at 15%. Any gain on disposal of the related fund’s quotas will be taxed (i) at 0% for individuals who carry out these operations on or outside the stock exchange; and (ii) at 15% for legal entities, whether in operations on or outside the stock exchange. United States – Qualified Foreign Pension Fund (QFPF) exemption (announced in December 2015) Purpose: To spur investments in US infrastructure and real estate by qualifying foreign pension funds by putting them on a similar footing from a tax perspective as domestic funds.  Criteria: o Meet the definition of a QFPF, which includes governmental and private pension funds. o Assets must be real property, which typically includes infrastructure and real estate assets. o Removes the requirement of owning a non-controlling stake in the asset.  Tax incentive: o Exempts capital gains. o Exempt real estate investment trusts (REITs) from withholding on REIT distributions. i Achieved via a stapled trust structure where asset ownership is separated from the operating entity and rent is levied by asset ownership trust on operating business resulting in the majority of the overall income from the business being taxed as passive rental income at the 15% managed investment trust rate.

G Berryman 29 th June 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Addendum to earlier submission on Capital Gains Tax Pages 22 and 23 of Mervyn King’s (the retired Governor of the Bank of England) book “The end of Alchemy” has the following excerpt. The point is low interest rates have transposed into high asset values. “....The bad was the rise in debt levels. Eliminating exchange rate flexibility in Europe and the emerging markets led to growing trade surpluses and deficits. Some countries saved a great deal while others had to borrow to finance their external deficit. The willingness of the former to save outweighed the willingness of the latter to spend, and so long-term interest rates in the integrated world capital market began to fall. The price of an asset, whether a house, shares in a company or any other claim on the future, is the value today of future expected returns (rents, the value of housing services from living in your own home, or dividends). To calculate that price one must convert future into current values by discounting them at an interest rate. The immediate effect of a fall in interest rates is to raise the prices of assets across the board. So as long-term interest rates in the world fell, the value of assets — especially of houses — rose. And as the values of assets increased, so did the amounts that had to be borrowed to enable people to buy them. Between 1986 and 2006, household debt rose from just under 70 per cent of total household income to almost 120 per cent in the United States and from 90 per cent to around 140 per cent in the United Kingdom.' The Ugly was the development of an extremely fragile banking system. In the USA, Federal banking regulators' increasingly lax interpretation of the provisions to separate commercial and investment banking introduced in the 1933 Banking Act (often known as Glass-Steagall, the two senators who led the passage of the legislation) reached its inevitable conclusion with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which swept away any remaining restrictions on the activities of banks. In the UK, the so-called Big Bang of 1986, which started as a measure to introduce competition into the Stock Exchange, led to takeovers of small stockbroking firms and mergers between commercial banks and securities houses. Banks diversified and expanded rapidly after deregulation. .......” \[1\] I have emboldened parts of the above which describes accurately what has occurred to date. I have reproduced my original submission below. It would be nice to get an official acknowledgement that you have received my thoughts and that they haven’t disappeared into the Wellington ether of already preconceived ideas. Regards Graeme Berryman Re CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION AND PROPERTY INVESTMENT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. There are no capital gains on property other than speculative gains at times of currency or interest rate arbitrage 2. The assumption that there is always Capital Gains and no Capital losses, on property assets is not supported by historical data. 3. Attention should be directed to the overseas owned, New Zealand based subdivision activities where the land is purchased by use of the New Zealand Companies resources, but immediately transferred to the overseas domiciled Directors of the Company. When subdivision is undertaken the profit is taken tax free, by transfer at a new price back to the New Zealand Company who undertake the subdivision. 4. An all-encompassing Capital Gains Tax already exists and is called rates, which is a tax for services provided. Above a copy of a ‘Mr Parker’s’ THE WIZARD OF ID ‘cartoon, which focuses on what is being discussed, the share to be paid and who receives the benefit of the present tax system. CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION I intend to address the field of Property ownership, Investment and taxation. \[1\] I have read numerous articles on Capital Gains Taxation together with the ‘The Future of Tax’ briefing paper, two features come to mind. A. Glossary – Capital Gains Tax (CGT): ‘A tax on the increase in the capital value of an asset.’ With respect this is not a definition of a Capital Gain. Unless you allow for the effect of inflation – which is a designed demand of Government, and the declining cost of borrowing for funding (see later), this is not a definition to create a new tax policy on. Inflation is not a Capital Gain and it appears that most of the present hysteria is associated with the activities of short term Investors who are only active on the periphery of the property market at limited times. Speculators are currently caught by the present taxation system, which has historically been poorly administered by the Inland Revenue Department. Around the period of the Global Financial Crises (GFC), there were wide spread reports of sharp declines in the value of property, with resultant mortgagee sales and with sale figures below initial purchase prices. Would it be the intention of a taxation system to provide a refund of the capital in this instance? B. If a Capital Gains tax is introduced and it is across the board of property, then tax losses on property should be allowed for crediting and not ring fenced to one property. The points I would like to make are as follows: 1. We already have in place a comprehensive and all-encompassing Capital Gains Tax on property. It is called RATES, which throughout New Zealand is levied on the CAPITAL VALUE of the entire property LAND and CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS and currently are increasing at above the rate of inflation throughout the country. 2. The fact that rates are devoted to local issues, rather than central government issues, is a process of income sharing or sharing of the taxation which has been in place for some time, Local Government undertake some of the activities of Central Government in any case. Social housing is an example. 3. Central Government and the activities of the Reserve Bank are central to what has caused so called Capital Gains in New Zealand. 3.1 Immigration is an acknowledged input to the CPI index and is an inflationary activity. Central government dictates the level of immigration into the country and leaves it to Local Government to cope without support to improve the needed infrastructure. Auckland is a prime example of underinvestment in roading, transport, utility services and social infrastructure required for a city of its size. 3.2 The Reserve Bank as a policy implementer of Central Government, are mandated to have a target of 1 - 3% inflation. The desire to have such a policy is to inflate away Government debt and to provide a sense of advancement in the community. Deflation has the opposite effect of greater political uncertainty and public disturbance i.e. Riots in Queen Street, Auckland during the Great Depression etc. 3.3 Over the last 30 years the Reserve Bank Act and its operations have been fiddled with. A. At one stage Central Government dictated the amount of funds to be placed by ‘Trading Banks’ later including ‘Community Banks’, with Central Government to finance Central Governments funding requirements. This was applied during periods of expansion – ‘Think Big Projects, electricity generation requirements in the 1950’s etc.’ and to control inflation and property price expansion. B. The Reserve Bank has allowed the easy importation of funding from overseas jurisdictions which have flowed directly into house mortgages, with the effect of boosting prices and subsidising the Australian owned banks. C. This policy has directly contributed to at least a 25% increase in so called Capital Values throughout New Zealand. Historically interest rates have been around 6.5% to 7% over the last 40 years. A drop to rates of around 4.5% equates to a 2 - 2.5% difference, which translated into Values is 20% to 25% in value terms. It could be argued that this is a low estimate of the effect of low interest rates. Our Country has never in the last 60 years had rates as low as currently available. 4. If property is viewed as a spread throughout the whole of New Zealand, what is actually taking place is as people leave country areas and move to the cities, demand for rural properties declines with the effect of a transfer of capital value from rural to urban centres. 5. No mention is ever made of application of a capital gains tax to Government and Local Body property. 6. Exemptions are normally proffered in regards to personal, ‘owner occupier held’ property; where in fact the real speculator element is prevalent in this group at bubble times in the market. I have no problems with couples buying a house and adding ‘sweat’ equity to increase their proprietorship in the property market, I do have a problem with silver spoon commentators, wanting to purchase property at the level attained by their parents 7. Property traders (speculators) pay tax presently on property gains if they are so classified, a similar tax charge is made for share traders, both where they are deemed to be earning their living from such activity. 8. Currently a claw back tax applies where property is disposed of and depreciation is claimed on the dwelling and chattels during ownership, which is a form of application of a capital gains tax. This is not consistent when the ultimate point of the chattels and the dwelling at some stage will be reach the end of their economic life and require replacement. 9. If such a tax was introduced and Government Policy was exempted, no real control would exist preventing the Government from printing currency similar to Zimbabwe and consequently destroying the intrinsic value of property ownership by over taxation. I remind the Committee that this occurred here in New Zealand in the 1970’s to 1980’s 10. Speculative gains have been taxed for some time. The Briefing paper refers to the taxation of property gains by means of Income Taxation. 11. Let me provide the following example by way of illustration. (See Reserve Bank printout attached) An associated Company of ours purchased in 1970, a domestic dwelling which has been rented on the rental market since purchase. Purchase Price - $9,500 (Nine Thousand Five Hundred Dollars), Current Rating Valuation $630,000. A so called Capital Gain of $620,500. Try selling the property at that figure and then having a change of heart and seek to buy it back at $9,500, if you can. The attached Reserve Bank CPI Inflation calculator for Housing comes out at $639,381.44, which shows that all of the so called Capital Gain has been by means of inflation, or the erosion of money value. I.e. in real terms over the 50 year odd years of ownership the value of the property has remained virtually constant. 12. The writer is aware of a sale of land in the Henderson area where overseas Owners/Directors sourced the land using their New Zealand Company, purchased the land and sold it back to the New Zealand Company, prior to development. The profit was taken prior to development and would no doubt be tax free. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP MATTERS The present coalition Government has to date adopted an anti-private landlord stance. In my opinion this is an unfortunate attitude to take. Successive Governments have provided Social Housing by means of the State Advances Corporation and now Housing Corporation. This policy has been in place since the 1930’s with recent Governments not greatly increasing the quality and quantity of housing provided. As a compromise and to allow the provision of housing, private landlords have been encouraged to meet the need. Changes to tenancy occupancy provisions placing greater liabilities and compliance burdens on landlords (e.g. rental W.O.F’s) and other proposed changes will reduce the rate of return, leading to landlords withdrawing properties from the market restricting supply and increasing the price of the remaining accommodation. It is well acknowledged that the returns on residential tenancy are in the order of 2% – 4 % net after expenses (at best). Hardly a great rate of return and reflective of why there are no listed Public Corporations providing such a service – contrasted to the Residential Care sector. Our company manages a number of properties for landlords. I would make the comment and it should be emphasised that good tenants get good landlords, with the corollary being that bad tenants normally get bad landlords. Previous New Zealand Government policies have been responsible for the creation of the climate where private individuals seek to provide for their own retirement by means of the purchase of investment properties. We have seen the rise and fall of the stock market in the 1980s aided and abetted by Government selling off public assets at discounted prices and in some cases the full funding by Government, providing a one-sided bet for inside operators/speculators. Then we have experienced the collapse of finance companies around the period of the GFC, where individuals (many of them retirees) sought higher rates of return than available at the time through the banking system with ultimately disastrous consequences. The attraction of property through the years has been a minor return, the provision of a social need and a protection of capital as well as having a secure asset when others have failed. Most of the owners of properties which we manage are small business people, retired people or family homes which are rented, whilst a surviving parent/owner is in care – does a CGT tax apply to the latter?. Again how popular does a Government want to be if this asset is Capital Gains Taxed. An ownership example (countless others are available), I can provide is where a parent has purchased a small unit which is let and provides an income for a Downs Syndrome child as a means of continuing support once the now surviving parent passes away. Taxation changes have been made over recent times which affect the attractiveness of property. 1) Depreciation has been removed as a deduction for taxation. This is despite the fact that a dwelling has a limited economic or useable life which is acknowledged as not more than 100 years. 2) Proposals have been made to the deduction of repairs and maintenance to a dwelling. How this will run to maintain adequate housing is questionable. 3) It is worth remembering that GST on expenditure is not offset against rent received on residential property. Mention has been made in the New Zealand Herald of the Reserve Bank introducing a charge on overseas sourced funds to stiffen the influence of the OCR rate assessed by them. This would be a more purposeful change, which could be made over time to tax the super profits generated as a benefit to banks and evident by the borrowing cheap money overseas and lending dear here in New Zealand. Additionally it is questionable why banking services are exempt from GST with an obvious huge subsidy being provided directly by central Government. OBVIOUS FAULTS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER Page 20 “Some people have more than one option for structuring their business affairs, whereas others do not. For example, an employee will always have tax deducted at source by their employer through the PAYE system. A contractor doing broadly equivalent work may be able to conduct their business as either a sole-trader, a partner in a partnership, through a company or through a trust. Such decisions can allow tax rate benefits as well as the ability to access work-related deductions this has implications for horizontal equity.” No explanation is provided as to what the benefits of such an operation is. Do the authors think that work related expenses i.e. provision of tools, travelling expenses do not relate to the earning of an income? Page 21 “As an example, consider a firm that can spend $9 to make $10 in revenue. If there is a 20% tax on profit then the firm will still have the incentive to make the investment as they will make a post-tax return of $0.80 (that is, 80% of the $1 profit). However, if instead the firm was not allowed to take deductions and there was a 20% tax on revenue, the firm will not make the investment because after tax they will make a $1 loss (they would be taxed $2 on the $10 revenue).” This presupposes that all business activity is profitable. This is clearly not the case and in most cases it is hard to determine the exact profitability of any business activity. Page 36 Wealth inequality This is a simple fact of life, we are all born with nothing, some people accumulate, others dissipate. It remains a choice for them as to how they wish to live their lives. In fact Governments want to see consumption, rather than saving as the activity provides employment – Income Tax and GST. TAXATION INCIDENCE Appended to this submission is a schedule displaying the effective tax rates including the effect of G.S.T. A rather low income incurs tax of roughly 25% a slightly higher income 30% and the top income threshold 40%. A more equitable basis would be to make the first $10,000 of any income tax free, to allow for the imposition of G.S.T on the lower income earners. Accident Compensation Commission levies are included in the above whilst Kiwi saver payments are additional taxes to the above. The submitter is available for interviewing if required. Yours faithfully Graeme Berryman De finitions: Sweat Equity: ‘an interest in a property earned by a tenant in return for labour towards upkeep or restoration’ Are we trying to fix a problem which does not exist? \[1\] \[1\]

So New Zealand should immediately do its part to end extreme poverty in all forms by 2030, beginning in New Zealand, where this is immediately possible. The path to this in New Zealand is by the institution of a universal basic income \[UBI\] for all adults in the country, employing Milton Friedman’s notion of a negative income tax. It is worth noting other suggestions to improve the situation of the poor in New Zealand, and Douglas and MacCulloch (2016) have suggested interesting reforms to the current tax system. The fresh ways of thinking about revisions to the welfare system could be looked at. However, the lasting issue that they offer, which the Tax Working Group \[TWG\] should certainly consider, is to extend the voluntary Kiwi-Saver scheme to a compulsory one. But, in the process, the current New Zealand Super Fund \[hereafter the Cullen Fund\] should be split and transferred into accounts tagged to individuals. Creating individual accounts would remove the temptation to any government wishing to appropriate the Fund for other purposes when hit by some inevitable national catastrophic crisis. The individual funds could be managed fairly by one public institution, perhaps by the inland revenue, rather than by private institutions whose current variable charges seem to cream administrative advantages for themselves. One consequence of an adequately designed UBI would be the elimination of discriminating regulations, all sorts of targeted hurdles, and means testing regimes, which are far from easy to police. The bureaucracies involved in administering and testing are too often the scene of acrimony and dissension which create tension for both administrator and recipient alike. The intention would be that an adequately designed UBI would eliminate the payment of unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, supported living payments, sole parent support, ACC salary compensation, and other working for families arrangements. A UBI coupled with a flat income tax rate would actually create a progressive tax regime on salaries. But the settings of the UBI and income tax rate might not prove high enough so the advantages of the Goods and Services Tax \[GST\] should be retained, and even extended. Clearly, any GST is regressive, falling harder on those with lower incomes. Nevertheless, the current broad-based approach is efficient and raising the rate to 17.5% would bring in a further $3.2b to the government’s revenues. And a 20% rate, matching some other OECD countries, would do even more. The offset in the elimination of poverty could be achieved by higher values of UBI and higher rates of personal income tax. Those receiving only the basic UBI as income would be returning a considerable portion of their grant to the government’s revenue through the GST they pay. In addition to the GST an assets tax levelled on wealth and capital gains would bring in some revenue, take some steps towards putting a brake on growing inequality and bring greater transparency. The improvement to transparency and a consequent understanding of the opportunities in the economy should bring an improvement to democratic participation. Improved democratic performance is necessary for facing problems in resource management issues, climate change, and infrastructure matters such as transport, water reticulation, energy generation, housing, the elimination of waste as well as in health and education. The other dominant issues for the tax system, once poverty and retirement are adequately dealt with, are providing for health and education. Of the two areas it is health demands which are the likelier to blow out. But the current arrangements make for a reasonable balance. However, in a small country like New Zealand there are impediments to universal provision in health with the moderating effects of different boards. A truly centralized system can be effective. Certainly, Douglas and MacCulloch speak highly of the Singapore system for containing health spending (a mere 4% of GDP in Singapore, against 9.5% or even 11% in NZ), but instituting their approach to individual health funds might be a step too far. Finally, there are further gains to be made towards transparency and efficiency, understanding, participation and consequent engagement in a democratic economy. These could be achieved by centralizing issues, and coordinating efforts in dealing with the challenges facing the country in health and education, resource management, climate change, and infrastructure matters such as transport, water reticulation, energy generation, housing and the elimination of waste. Consultation is always necessary but removing the impediments and lack of coordination in the disparate local body bailiwicks would be a good thing for the better directed use of resources. Consequently, this submission to the Tax Working Group \[TWG\] offers four recommendations: Recommendation 1 Set progressive income tax policy which includes the possibility of some form of guaranteed basic income involving a measure of negative income tax favouring the less advantaged. Recommendation 2 Convert the Cullen Fund into a scheme of individual retirement accounts into which compulsory contributions are added. These would be supervised centrally in the manner of an individual Kiwi- Saver fund coupled with the control of the Cullen Fund. Recommendation 3 A wealth tax recommendation of two parts: a Set an asset and wealth tax policy that strikes a correct balance between encouraging national economic growth while restricting the concentration of wealth in capital assets confined to the lockers of an economic elite. b Such an asset and wealth tax, which would also take account of capital gains: it would require and improve transparency, so that economic inequalities would be reduced; and it would recognize greater fairness between individuals, groups and generations. Recommendation 4 Recognize the opportunities of data processing technologies to eliminate layers of local government and so centralize democratic functions to adequately and fairly deal with health (obesity) and education, resource management issues, climate change (greenhouse gas emissions), and infrastructure matters such as transport, water reticulation, energy generation, housing and the elimination of waste (pollution). Submitter: N. Park \[1\] Introduction I would like to thank the Tax Working Group for their helpful Background Paper. This, along with the prods from the government to think again about New Zealand’s tax structure, is useful in stimulating thoughts about what is important to New Zealanders. For by devoting part of what is earned into the government’s coffers we think again about what those funds will support. In the 1970s and 1980s, along with the growth of managerialism, there was considerable questioning about the failures of the welfare state, and the extent of the taxes necessary to support it. Contempt was expressed in the soubriquet “nanny state”. Nevertheless as Pinker (2018, p. 109) points out in a recent volume: The economist Leandro Prados de la Escosura found a strong correlation between percentage of GDP that an OECD country allocated to social transfers as it developed between 1880and 2000 and its score on a composite measure of prosperity, health and education. And tellingly, the number of libertarian paradises in the world — developed countries without substantial social spending — is zero. Now the proportion of taxes collected as a proportion of its Gross Domestic Product \[GDP\] and the spending on its welfare state varies considerably between countries as Table 1 on the next page illustrates. There is only room on one page for some of the figures that the CIA have collected. Their World Fact Book has data from 156 of the world’s countries but only six \[New Zealand and five others\] are given space here. The CIA has taxes collected in NZ as 36.5% of the country’s GDP while the TWG’s figure of 32% is no doubt more correct. So something must be said about the accuracy of figures offered by the CIA and others, even those used in this submission. Any figures are likely to be only approximately correct. This will be true of other figures throughout this submission, for figures may be occasionally collected from dated sources, and, in addition, there can be differences among countries’ definitions of categories as well as problems in data collection. Consequently, in the construction of tables on a Universal Basic Income \[UBI\] for New Zealand later in this submission other figures rather than those from the CIA are employed. But in Table 1 there are five other countries to compare with New Zealand. They reveal that whatever talk there is of globalization there remains considerable variation among nations in their construction and their collection of taxes and other revenues. So on this record New Zealand collects $14,990 per person considerably less than the $38,650 in Norway. New Zealand, of course, records GDP per person at only 58% of Norway’s ($41,170/$70,650). But New Zealand’s collection of revenues per person is not 58% of Norway’s, rather it is considerably lower, only 39% ($14,990/$38,650). We might raise taxes to do better. But how is the table constructed overall? In addition to the limit of columns across the page there were also limits on the number of entries down. In that regard the choice has been to reveal a variety of well-being indicators, and, in particular, the spending choices on health and education. A first country to compare with New Zealand is near neighbour, Australia. At the other end we have two nations in different ways dominant on the world scene: there is the leading world economy, USA, and the most populous Asian giant, China. These are both countries with which New Zealand aspires to do business. Finland with the lowest GINI index for family income score in the CIA’s list, was a consideration but was rejected because there was only room for one European nation. Germany, France or England could have found a place or fourth placed European, Netherlands. Still, the progressive tax gathering and social spending in Scandinavian countries is often remarked upon so we have Norway with its population just a nudge closer to New Zealand’s. But why Benin?: a country so poor that the Fact Book points out that “\[a\]n estimated 4.4 million, more than 40%, of Beninese live abroad”, most in neighbouring Nigeria or Cote d’ Ivoire. The point is that Benin is not merely poor, it is also 91 st from top on the family GINI index list, actually one place ranked higher than New Zealand at 92nd. This reveals something about the scoring of inequality using GINI indices, and talk of inequality generally. Inequality in a nation is a matter of importance but it is even more difficult to make assumptions and deductions about inequality than it is to take measures of poverty. For as Pinker points out in a recent book: “Inequality is not the same as poverty, and it is not a fundamental dimension of human flourishing. In comparisons of well-being across countries, it pales in importance next to overall wealth. An increase in inequality is not necessarily bad; as societies escape from universal poverty, they are bound to become more unequal, and the uneven surge may be repeated when a society discovers new sources of wealth. (2018, p. 120). And while the family index has families in Benin more unequal than in New Zealand, that unfortunate country has more than 35% (almost 4 million) of its population below the poverty line. New Zealand is not so unfortunate, although New Zealand, perhaps like Australia and Norway, is too concerned about unfairness to make poverty line statistics available.

Most, but not all taken or estimated in the period 2015-2017. \* PPP = Purchasing power parity with $US /p = per person Now while the United Nations has a commendable aspiration to end extreme poverty in all its forms by 2030, and NZ has a part to play in that, there is still the issue of poverty in New Zealand. Eliminating poverty should be possible in New Zealand and should be the dominant concern of the TWG. Even the richest country in the world, the US with an average annual income of nearly $60,000 per person, has close on 50 million people below its poverty line in Table 1. But poverty shows a different face in different countries and New Zealand’s and the United States’ poverty will display differently from poverty in somewhere like Benin. Pinker puts the case: Together, technology and globalization have transformed what it means to be a poor person, at least in developed countries. The old stereotype of poverty was an emaciated pauper in rags. Today, the poor are as likely to be as overweight as their employers, and dressed in the same fleece, sneakers, and jeans. The poor used to be called the have-nots. In 2011, more than 95 percent of American households below the poverty line had electricity, running water, flush toilets, a refrigerator, a stove and a color TV. (2018, p. 117). And the poor may have been carrying a smart phone as well, or like the deprived young Baltimore blacks represented on the HBO series, The Wire, some of the poor may be quite conversant with operating a burner. Nevertheless, one of the important functions of the tax system everywhere is to efficiently provide the transfers which are necessary in a well functioning welfare state. The approach in this submission to eliminating poverty in New Zealand is through the introduction of a UBI. Douglas & MacCulloch (2016) in an approach with which the TWG is, no doubt, familiar is somewhat different. One aspect of their ideas survives in this submission. They would distribute the present Cullen Fund into individual retirement fund accounts into which it would be compulsory to accumulate funds replacing the current voluntary Kiwi-Saver schemes: For many people their contributions to the new proposed fund will simply replace their existing Kiwi-Saver contributions. Our new regime extends the retirement age from 65 to 70 years old over the next 20 years (i.e., by 3 months per year) and retains the current government pension, although its source of funding changes. (Douglas & MacCulloch, 2016, p. 21) This seems a good idea. But their recommendation for individual accounts to insure against catastrophes in employment or health are not supported in my submission. My submission suggests that the state is the most efficient insurer against catastrophic outcomes, indeed, such universal insurance is fundamental to the construction of the welfare functions in the modern state. However, there will always be complaints as to which events can be guarded against since “\[t\]he fundamental problem facing individuals and societies alike is the fact that our wants exceed our capacity for satisfying those wants.” (Rohlf, 1999, p. 4). Pinker makes the case for actuarial prudence: Social spending, like everything, has downsides. As with all insurance, it can create a “moral hazard” in which the insured slack off or take foolish risks, counting on the insurer to bail them out if they fail. And since the premiums have to cover the payouts, if the actuaries get the numbers wrong or the numbers change so that more money is taken out than put in, the system can collapse. In reality social spending is never exactly like insurance but is a combination of insurance, investment and charity. Its success thus depends on the degree to which the citizens of a country sense they are part of one community, and that fellow feeling can be strained when the beneficiaries are disproportionately the immigrants or ethnic minorities. These tensions are inherent to social spending and will always be politically contentious. Though there is no “correct amount,” all developed states have decided that the benefits of social transfers outweigh the costs and have settled on moderately large amounts, cushioned by their massive wealth.” (Pinker, 2018, p. 110). Douglas and MacCulloch’s proposal for risk cover and health funds are rejected in my submission because they point a path to private insurance schemes which don’t seem to provide better health outcomes for all. Privately administered health insurance schemes seem to be the bane of fair and universal health outcomes in the US. In Table 1 we see per person spending in the US at $10,316 against the NZ figure of $4,529. Devoting 17.1% of GDP to health may be favouring those who create health scares and panics, more than those improving physical and mental well-being. Certainly New Zealand’s health and obesity figures seem better than those in the US. Norway’s health spending , on the other hand, — much higher per person than New Zealand’s although a lower percentage figure of their GDP — seems to offer much reduced obesity rates. Is there some connection between that country’s much higher rate of tax collection and its corresponding high figure for GDP per person. Perhaps it has something to do with the way that tax spending is incorporated in GDP calculations. Anyway, my feeling is that Douglas and MacCulloch’s approach to reducing taxes will ultimately favour those who own more. Surely, simply cutting taxes is never without worries, as the CIA report in their World Fact Book: In December 2017, Congress passed and President Donald TRUMP signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among its various provisions, reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; lowers the individual tax rate for those with the highest incomes from 39.6% to 37%, and by lesser percentages for those at lower income levels; changes many deductions and credits used to calculate taxable income; and eliminates in 2019 the penalty imposed on taxpayers who do not obtain the minimum amount of health insurance required under the ACA. The new taxes took effect on 1 January 2018; the tax cut for corporations are permanent, but those for individuals are scheduled to expire after 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) under the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the new law will reduce tax revenues and increase the federal deficit by about $1.45 trillion over the 2018- 2027 period. (CIA, 2017) “No new taxes” rings a bell with any politician leader’s electoral tribe. And in a recent opinion piece speaking out for struggling middle class citizens coping with negative gearing and the threats of a capital gains tax Hannah McQueen writes “if your household’s total income is less than $200,000, you should be allowed to use the tax rebate today while you’re still making a loss, because that’s when you need it.” (2018, p. D12) Now Hannah McQueen is billed as a financial adviser but the struggles of a household with income close to $200,000 should not be too much of a concern to the TWG or to the politicians you must advise. The struggles of politicians, on the other hand, should be very much the concern of the TWG. For the TWG must be interested to help those politicians sell their reformed tax policies to their electorates. The position of politicians in a democracy is a curious one; a position to which Grayling (2017) has given some attention. The position of politicians and the better ways of operating a democracy were also given some attention in a strange little volume edited by Baron and Eisen (2004). The authors were promoting the idea of Binding Citizens’ Initiated Referenda \[BCIR\] and their hope that a BCIR might halt the introduction of genetically modified food products into this country. The virtue of their little volume was that they sort the opinions of a variety of politicians and thought leaders at the time, and recorded some opinions from the likes of Christine Fletcher, Roger Kerr, David Lange, Winston Peters, and Simon Upton. Lange explained that even the executive branch of government had many frustrations, while individual MPs were unable to introduce Bills which might have budget implications. Upton wrote: As a believer in limited government, I would be very concerned to see unlimited taxing and spending power handed over to a referendum-led auction. But of course, that is precisely what we have now except that it is conducted on our behalf by political parties in between elections. (Upton, 2004, p. 98) Fletcher mentioned her frustrations arising from the restrictions imposed on her by her party’s disciplines which she believed prevented her from adequately representing the wishes of her electorate’s voters. However, even she went on to suggest that much of the power to act was vested outside parliament when she wrote: Moreover, unelected bureaucrats still have even more power than the parties in national as well as local government. They are accountable to no one and their numbers and influence have increased over the years to the point where they both make and enforce the laws (“regulations”) with hardly any input from elected representatives, much less the people themselves. (Fletcher, 2004, p. 90) Perhaps she exaggerated a little, but maybe, from time to time, members of the TWG will find themselves serving those unelected bureaucrats. Grayling looks to some aspects of moderating the influence of the party discipline which apparently so irked Fletcher. I suppose Grayling had in mind the British experience which was fictionally illustrated in The House of Cards trilogy where Francis Urquhart would urge his party whip to put a bit of stick about. Grayling complains that the bullying of the whipping system which serves the interests of the party, prevents politicians from doing their proper job. That job is to consider, on balance, the interests of all their citizens. Grayling explains how democracy was long feared by political leaders as a vehicle which would lead to mob rule. The unruly mob is always a threat. It might be a mob of 4½ million Beninese in Nigeria or Cote d’Ivoire. It might be a mob displaced by war or climate change. It might be a mob displaced by unemployment or poverty. It might be a mob that a heartless, ruthless but machiavellian politician a Chavez, Salazar, Mussolini, Pinochet or even a Trump might coddle. A mob might still prevail in any given BCIR. Even inequality can be used to excite the mob : “In capitalizing on concerns about inequality, Trump has demonized immigrants and trade partners while ignoring the major disrupter of lower middle-class jobs, technological change. He has also opposed the measures that most successfully mitigate its harms, namely progressive taxation and social spending. (Pinker, 2018, p. 335). Grayling suggests that citizens should not expect an impossible perfection from their governing institutions. But it should not be impossible to organize a good enough government in a representative democracy. He insists that, ideally, electors should vote in representatives to go to their legislature to do a job of work. That work is of a nature that the electors themselves, so busy about their own lives, have too little time to attend to. Grayling insists that the job of those elected to the legislature is to seek out information, do due diligence, and listen to rational argument, based on evidence. It is their job to discuss and debate that evidence and the arguments presented. Consequently the elected should form considered judgments, enact laws, and supervise the outcomes of those laws, based upon their resulting, well-formed judgments. The job of a parliamentary member once elected is not, as Fletcher seemed to believe, to simply do the bidding of her electorate. They are not at the legislature, to act as delegates or as messengers, doing what is demanded of them from their electorate’s prejudiced or poorly formed points of view. Rather they are sent to the legislature to listen to experts and to form their judgments on issues in the interests of all the country’s population. Grayling has suggested three things which are absolutely necessary if a society is to get that good enough government: (1) transparency (which is absolutely key); (2) breaking the grip of the party machine’s whipping system, which is ultimately a system of bullying; and (3) controlling the amount of money that can be spent in an election. A limit on spending in the electoral process is particularly important. Lawrence Lessig (2011) has suggested that the United States government has become corrupted by its system of paid lobbying. Important issues like global warming, universal healthcare, and the elimination of poverty in a simplified tax system are hampered by the institutional inertia that lobbying imposes. Instead of dealing with such important problems the governors in the USA render a $90 billion payback a year to their parties’ donors through subsidies and regulatory protections. He points out one instance of the problem where the US government has passed a total of thirty-two laws in sixteen years in “vigorous defense of the copyright industries” (p. 57) while there have been no laws passed to deal with carbon pollution. Clearly, the problem of defying the pirates of copyright material is a problem beyond solving despite the continual attention given to it. Dependence corruption, Lessig claims, has riddled the party system in the US: the interests of big business conglomerates, such as media companies and others with their medical patents, conglomerates with an eye to their stock values and profits to their stock holders have bought out the government. Lessig’s contribution has been summarized on one Boston website: Lessig says that our political system is so corrupted by money that it hurts both causes on the left and the right. On the left, for instance, the failure to pass global warming legislation or universal healthcare, in the face of institutional inertia. While on the right, he says, issues like simplifying the tax code have fallen victim to the same forces resisting reform. “Our current tax system with all its complexities is in part designed to make it easier for candidates, in particular congressmen, to raise money to get back to congress,” Lessig said. “All sorts of special exceptions which expire after a limited period of time are just a reason to pick up the phone and call somebody and say ‘Your exception is about to expire, here’s a good reason for you to help us fight to get it to extend.’ And that gives them the opportunity to practice what is really a type of extortion – shaking the trees of money in the private sector into their campaign coffers so that they can run for congress again.” Those giveaways, tax breaks, and subsidies all corrupt and distort the free market, which should anger both sides of the political spectrum, he said. “ Businesses increasingly recognize that their highest return on investment comes not from inventing the next great widget, instead spending money on lobbyists who can get special deals built into the tax code or built into the government spending programs that give them a higher return than any of the investment that they would ever make by investing in genuine innovation.” (On Point: wbur, 2012) So the TWG’s task here is to recommend improvements to our representatives so they can carry out Grayling’s hopes for good enough government, good enough to have a tax system which avoids dependence corruption. Certainly, the tax system must provide against the externalities of New Zealand’s energy programs and deal with issues arising from climate change. But equally in the structure of the tax system the government must deal to eliminate poverty and for that perhaps the best tax system will include a negative income tax or universal basic income. A Universal Basic Income In Table 2 three representative take home salaries are given to demonstrate how a flat tax rate of 45% would actually prove to be effectively variable for different amounts of salary once a universal basic figure is employed. In this table a UBI of $18,000 is the basis for calculations. Table 2 Take home salaries and IRD gains from 3 representative salary earners given a universal basic income of $18,000 and a flat tax rate of 45% on their earnings. Personal income Personal income -45% tax Taxed income + UBI Effective tax rate IRD transfers \[-\]/ gains per salary earner $30,000 $16,500 $34,500 -15% -$4,500 $60,000 $33,000 $51,000 15% $9,000 $250,000 $137,500 $155,500 37.8% $94,500 The feasibility of a UBI is dealt with by using some representative numbers from an age structure table and some generous and loosely based assumptions to account for the numbers who may receive nothing more than a basic income from their government. The assumptions are used to derive a number for those who do not have to pay any income tax but receive nothing more than transfers. The assumptions are loose in the sense that the categories (particularly unproductive youth and elderly) do not represent the actual categories or the distribution of those actual categories, composed of those not earning, for one reason or another, in various age groups. The values from the CIA World Fact Book (2017) are adjusted , totalling up to the 4.9m NZ population, the larger population figure for New Zealand on a 2018 Wikipedia site. The number of people in the standard non- dependent range (between 15-64 years) in Table 3 would be 3,188,061. However, in some of the calculations below I apply a larger 5.8% unemployment rate to the 2,655,000 labour force figure rather than the CIA’s which was a lower 4.9%. Table 3 Age Structure of the NZ population and its dependency ratios Age groups Numbers Ratio 0-14 years 964,566 Youth dependency 30.3% 15-24 years 654,329 25-54 years 1,951,155 55-64 years 582,578 65 + years 747,373 Elderly dependency 23.4% Potential support ratio \[PSR\] 4.27 Total Population 4,900,000 Source: Numbers from CIA (2018) adjusted to total of Wikipedia’s (2018) estimated NZ population 4,900,000 Of course, it would be a matter of contention as to what the economy can bear. The flat tax rate could be set to 60% (which might approximate the highest income tax rate in Finland) but would amount to an effective tax rate of 52.8% on $250,000 and 30% on $60,000. However, it is likely that less difficult provisions would initially prevail. In Table 4 below the figure of more than 1 million people having no other income beyond a UBI of $18,000 is probably larger than in reality. Of course it is intended to cover those who would otherwise be offered unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, supported living payments, sole parent support, ACC, or some other working for families arrangements. The idea would be to make the UBI directly payable to everyone above the entitlement age, and consequently removing all the current variety of discriminating categories for transfer payments. The idea is to eliminate the acrimony and dissension that arises when bureaucracies have to be involved in deciding whether a particular payment is merited, or the conditions demanded of a suppliant for a payment have been met. Nor would the ACC be responsible for the salary of those out of work because of an accident. Instead of being paid 80% of previous salaries they would simply receive the UBI. ACC would still administer whatever lump sums are just. But people faced with the prospect of one day being paid no more than the UBI would find common cause ensuring that any UBI payment is fairly paid up to an amount sufficient to get by. Table 4.

(2018), p. 25, Figure 6) the NZ Super costs $13.7 billion while further social security demands nearly $11.6 billion. So the calculation here of a little more than $19 billion is considerably less than the current figure of $25 billion required for social security and welfare. Table 5 from the Tax Working Group paper p. 25 $ Millions % Gov. expenses Social security and welfare $25,294 33.1% NZ Super 13,700 17.9% Soc security less NZ Super 11,594 15.2% Here there is leeway for $6 billion further welfare payments being the difference from the figures in TWG’s figure 6. This $6b could make for more than 400,000 payments of $14,000. Perhaps the difference might be devoted to making up for loss of tax from other salary income once the UBI is offered. Left aside here is what the economy can stand, what the rates should be, or what other welfare provisions need making. Actually raising the rate of GST to 17.5% would bring in a further $3.2b to the government’s revenues and matching some other OECD countries with a 20% rate would do even more. Of course, the GST is regressive, falling harder on those with lower incomes. Nevertheless, the current broad-based approach is efficient. The offset in the elimination of poverty would be to offer higher values of UBI accompanied by a higher rate for taxing personal income. With a higher GST rating those receiving only a basic UBI would be returning a considerably higher portion of their income which has been transferred to them to the government’s revenue through the GST since they would no doubt be spending all their income on necessities. All in all, debates about levels in a UBI would alter our notions of fairness. Matters of fairness are always contentious as Harris (2010, p. 67) says: We will not agree about fairness in the same way that we will not agree about morality, good or bad. But this is true in all fields of knowledge. Total uniformity in the moral sphere—either interpersonally or intrapersonally—may be hopeless. So what? This is precisely the lack of closure we face in all areas of human knowledge. (Harris, 2010, p. 67) But would a UBI prove sufficient to eliminate poverty in New Zealand? It is considerably less than the $450 a week ($23,400 a year) before tax that a single elderly person might be currently awarded. For a person living alone who had to pay $500 a week rent then $18,000 is going to fall considerably short of the $26,000 required for rent alone. However, if there were a provision of shared accommodation say six people sharing a form of accommodation for which they combined to pay $800 a week rent then there would be $41,600 annually for rent and a modest, if not comfortable existence, from the $66,400 (about $11,000 each) left from their combined UBIs. For a household where there is a couple with two adult children and no income beyond the IRD transfer then an $18,000 UBI might be a stretch. The government may have more demands to accommodate those failing to profit from changing conditions as New Zealand faces a growing gig economy, greater mobility in labour, and perhaps further threats to employment prospects from automation technologies. In reply to such demands the government may need to respond by building more hostel accommodation and might consider subsidising communal living arrangements. But the aim should be to create a UBI sufficient to allow even the most financially disadvantaged some measure of choice in their living arrangements. Hence recommendation 1. Recommendation 1 Set progressive income tax policy which includes the possibility of some form of guaranteed basic income involving a measure of negative income tax favouring the less advantaged. Supplementary Provision for Retirement In New Zealand there is considerable disagreement about providing for retirement. Some say continue with a pay as you go (PAYG) scheme. Others, including Douglas and MacCulloch, suggest that some form of savings in a save as you go (SAYG) arrangement is preferable. As Michael Littlewood has long pointed out the outcome of any grant scheme comes from the wealth of the economy which exists when the grants are being paid out so any savings will amount to nothing if an economy tanks. Now, Andrew Coleman from the Treasury has been quoted by Susan Edmunds in the Sunday Star Times: “We’re currently paying $13b a year \[for pensions\]. If we had a system of SAYG for the last 40 years, the current taxpayers would be paying in $6.55b for exactly the same pensions. That’s really big numbers.” (Coleman in Edmunds, 2018, p D6) This is all well and good but the risks do not go away. We saw the previous government suspend payments into the Cullen Fund and should some crisis arise, as it almost certainly will, the amount in the fund might be raided by some future government to overcome that unplanned for contingency. A preferred way to overcome the risk of a raid on the Cullen Fund would be to convert that fund into individual accounts to be administered in the manner of Kiwi-Saver accounts. The Government Superannuation Fund Authority appears to have considerable experience and success in administering individual funds for its members so there should be little difficulty with a similar Authority administering a more widely universal scheme. In its first steps the individual accounts could be set up instituted for all qualifying adults other than the current elderly. The current $34.5billion in the Cullen Fund could be distributed among roughly the individually instituted savings accounts of 3.2 million individuals all those from 15 years of age but below the current retirement age. Any Kiwi-Saver accounts owned by individuals in the cohort given such accounts could be added to that individual’s account. People without a Kiwisaver account would simply get a kick-start to their account from their share of the distributed Cullen fund. The government could then add to those managed funds at the rate as the Labour government once did to the Cullen fund. But a different approach might be to encourage current voluntary contributions in the manner of current Kiwi-Saver schemes from individual earnings. Douglas and MacCulloch (2016) gave considerable thought to compulsory savings accounts. In addition to individual retirement savings accounts they, however, were advocating for saving to individual risk and health accounts as well. They originally wrote: The funds from the above tax cuts on incomes up to $50,000 for single tax-payers (and up to $65,000 for one-income families with dependent children) go directly into compulsory savings accounts for all employed workers. They are supplemented by an individual’s own, and their employer’s, contributions. Single tax-payers contribute 5% of earned income up to $50,000 (or up to $65,000 for one-income families with children). Their employer pays another 12½% of income up to $50,000. These contributions add up to total compulsory savings of $17,500 per year for those earning $50,000 or more (and $22,750 for a one- income family with children on $65,000 or more). (Douglas & MacCulloch, 2016, pp. 18- 19) Their first sentence in that piece should probably read “$6,125 from taxes gathered goes into each individual account of persons with ‘incomes up to $50,000 for single tax-payers (and up to $65,000 for one-income families with dependent children) go directly into compulsory savings accounts for all employed workers”. However, my recommendation here would be for something less complicated. For although they might be given different names any compulsory sequestering of earnings is nothing more than a differently arranged tax. MacCulloch does suggest, in a recent 2018 opinion piece in the NZ Herald that for those at the bottom of the wealth ladder “the Cullen tax review \[will not\] solve much”. He suggests that every Kiwi should have an individual savings account and “funding of the savings accounts would come from existing tax revenues”. The savings account he has in mind still has three parts (35% to super, 45% to health and 20% to risk cover). He goes on to write that “there should be no personal income tax until individuals and families can provide for themselves”. As a consequence the individual savings accounts: “would enable each person to build between $500,000 and $1 million of wealth over a 40-45 year working life. An income of over $30,000 per annum during retirement would become available, on top of the pension.” (MacCulloch, 2018, p. A18) Essentially, Douglas and MacCulloch were for extending their suggested flat tax by 12.25% and also added that employers would be paying 12.5% to the individual savings account of their employees. But to impose a further 12.25% tax on employers seems somewhat extreme. Rather, a progressive company tax, depending on a company’s number of employees and the size of its profit, might be better for growing business activity. Setting a “graduated” company tax rate where, at the low end, smaller firms might pay as little as 10% could stimulate business competition. Such an approach might prove better than instituting the complications which Douglas and MacCulloch suggest. As a consequence employers would have less to moan about whenever the minimum wage is set higher. Furthermore, they could be encouraged to improve their employees’ situations through more attractive wages. So I put adding to employers’ contributions aside and simply suggest a further 5%, for retirement savings, added to the 45% flat income tax. So this gives us Table 6 which incorporates this adjustment to Table 2. Table 6 Calculation of flat (45% + 5%individual savings) tax rate on income. with $18,000 UBI added Personal income Personal income – (45%+5%) tax Taxed income + UBI Effective tax rate IRD gains/gives Gain to indiv’s Savings $30,000 $15,000 $33,000 -1.00% -$4,500 $1,500 $60,000 $30,000 $48,000 22.0% $9,000 $3,000 $250,000 $125,000 $143,000 42.8% $94,500 $12,500 In the unlikely event of a constant income of $30,000 over 40 years a person’s $1,500 individual saving of $1,500 with annual interest rate of 3% would accumulate to over $116,000. If savings accumulated over 50 years the final total would be over $174,000 This is somewhat indicative of how at a constantly high rate of compulsory savings individual accounts might accumulate to supplement a UBI in retirement. Hence I suggest a compulsory system for accumulating a portion of income tax into an individual’s retirement savings accounts. Recommendation 2 Convert the Cullen Fund into a scheme of individual retirement accounts into which compulsory contributions are added. These would be supervised centrally in the manner of an individual Kiwi- Saver fund coupled with the control of the Cullen Fund. A Wealth Tax The conditions set for the TWG are that taxpayers’ family homes should be exempt of taxes, should any asset or wealth taxes be introduced. Perhaps citizens need not fear taxes on their family homes. They simply need reminding that rates are, in every instance, levied on a landowner’s holdings and in some cities, districts, or regions the rate is levied on the land’s improvements in addition to the land on which they sit: i.e. full capital value. Most ratepayers can manage the annual imposts which might usually run somewhere between 0.1% to 1.4% of an asset’s value. So we currently have asset taxes at the local government level and there could be mechanisms through the registration of land ownership to assess one category of assets. Cars and most transport vehicles (other than bicycles and electric bicycles), of course, are registered. The registration of other assets, such as yachts (registered for racing) and power boats (registered in association with trailers in some parts of the country), might be a bit patchy. The question is whether we should have any asset taxes and how much capital and in what form should taxes of that capital take shape. One view of those questions has been offered in 2014 by Nightingale who wrote in a NZ Herald piece that instituting a capital gains tax might do little but create problems. It was he thought, unlikely to add much to the Government’s coffers, or might even create a largesse which the government would be in a quandary to employ: The estimated annual revenue from a capital gains tax that exempts the family home could add around $2 billion to the Government’s coffers — although it may take 10 years to reach that point. What will governments do with this extra revenue? Will it be used as an opportunity to reduce personal income and company taxes to stimulate economic growth? Or do we risk it funding poor quality spending that will only impose greater compliance costs and tax burdens for little gain? (Nightingale, 2014) However, a little earlier a different commentator had pointed out that the aim of a capital gains tax need not necessarily be about raising more tax, rather it might be considered as a Pigouvian tax, and he made no show about exempting the family dwelling: The point of a capital gains tax need not be the raising of additional revenue; to the extent that it does increase the tax take, this could be offset by a corresponding reduction in the tax take elsewhere. The aim of a capital gains tax (which is, incidentally, a common feature of most regimes overseas) would be, in other words, to shift the tax burden rather than raise it, and to shift it to where it would be most effective in changing behaviours in areas like housing investment that are currently stoking inflation. (Gould, 2008, p. 118) And the TWG takes the same position: Capital assets are owned disproportionately by higher income households and so introducing a capital gains tax would make the tax system more progressive. A capital gains tax would allow for more government spending, or cutting of other taxes. (2018, p. 48) Then the TWG continue asking questions about certain issues that can arise: when in time should a gain be taxed; and what ruses might an owner of capital employ to delay any capital tax payments? But a capital gains tax — even one which considered all housing —might not be instituted to increase the tax take. Rather it could be targeted to modify behaviour, with the aim of directing investment into productive endeavours rather than into real estate. Instituting a wealth tax would be another area where increasing the tax take is less important than improving social arrangements and perceptions. The path to this would demand the sharing of more bank information with the Inland Revenue. This is not an easy matter and to reach such an ideal a number of hurdles might need to be removed. Piketty (2004) points out that France has had problems because of its difficulties in securing information from banks. As a result that country’s wealth tax has run into difficulties with too many loopholes contributing to inefficient collection. But without a wealth tax inequality will grow: \[I\]f the top thousandth enjoy a 6 percent rate of return on their wealth, while average global wealth grows at only 2 percent a year, then after thirty years the top thousandth’s share of global capital will have more than tripled. The top thousandth would then own 60 percent of global wealth, which is hard to imagine in the framework of existing political institutions unless there is a particularly effective system of repression or an extremely powerful apparatus of persuasion, or perhaps both. Even if the top thousandth’s capital returned only 4 percent a year, their share would still practically double in thirty years to nearly 40 percent. Once again, the force for divergence at the top of the wealth hierarchy would win out over the global forces of catch-up and convergence, so that the shares of the top decile and centile would increase significantly, with a large upward redistribution from the middle and upper-middle classes to the very rich. Such an impoverishment of the middle class would very likely trigger a violent political reaction. (Piketty 2014, p. 439) Wealth tax is not merely robbing the rich for only some of the wealth accumulated by the elites has been hard earned. The return on capital in quite a large number of cases comes from other sources: “\[not just\] true entrepreneurial labor (an absolutely indispensable force for economic development), \[but also\] pure luck (one happens at the right moment to buy a promising asset at a good price), and outright theft.” (Piketty 2014, p. 446) Piketty went on to argue a case for cooperation across the whole European community. He estimated the gross amount of capital across the whole community was five times its GDP. He rejected property taxes alone but suggested “the property tax rate is frequently just 0.5–1 percent of the value of real estate, or a tenth to a quarter of the rental value of the property (assuming an average rental return of 4 percent a year)” (p. 528). He suggested a progressive tax applying only to the top 2.5 percent of the population which would bring in revenues close to 2 percent of the community’s GDP. To do that his wealth tax would not start for wealth below 1 million euros but would levy “1 percent between 1 and 5 million euros, and 2 percent above 5 million euros.” One of Piketty’s main points is that in order to collect the wealth tax banking information must be shared at least with a government’s revenue collectors. . But without automatic sharing of bank information both inside and outside EU territory (starting with Switzerland among nonmember states) the risks of evasion would be very high. This partly explains why countries that have adopted a wealth tax (such as France, which employs a tax schedule similar to the one I am proposing) generally allow numerous exemptions, especially for “business assets” and, in practice, f Suppose that bank information is automatically shared and the tax authorities have accurate assessments of who owns what, which may happen some day. What would then be the ideal tax schedule? As usual, there is no mathematical formula for answering this question, which is a matter for democratic deliberation. It would make sense to tax net wealth below 200,000 euros at 0.1 percent and net wealth between 200,000 and 1 million euros at 0.5 percent. This would replace the property tax, which in most countries is tantamount to a wealth tax on the propertied middle class. The new system would be both more just and more efficient, because it targets all assets (not only real estate) and relies on transparent data and market values net of mortgage debt. To a large extent a tax of this sort could be readily implemented by individual countries acting alone. (2004, p. 529) Piketty outlines his utopian idea of a global tax on wealth. Such a tax he suggested would have two useful effects. The ultimate effect would be to halt the inevitable concentration of wealth among elites which is the result currently favoured by national regimes. And the second effect would be that the path towards that utopian ideal would demand transparent universal public recording and the reporting of an individuals’ assets and wealth. National governments, international organizations, and statistical offices around the world would at last be able to produce reliable data about the evolution of global wealth. . . The benefit to democracy would be considerable: it is very difficult to have a rational debate about the great challenges facing the world today—the future of the social state, the cost of the transition to new sources of energy, state-building in the developing world, and so on— because the global distribution of wealth remains so opaque. (2014, p. 518) Piketty’s point is that “truly democratic debate cannot proceed without reliable statistics.” This is true in so many areas. And it is a reason suggesting that New Zealand should play a part working towards Piketty’s utopian ideal. After all, the country is restricted in the path to a good enough government when its law makers (not to mention its citizens) lack information. Such a wealth tax would, as Piketty suggests, apply only to the wealthiest (he had the top 2.5% in mind) in the nation. So a wealth tax, progressive but commencing above a high level of wealth, would be additional to any general flat tax and UBI arrangements. Here then is our third recommendation: Recommendation 3 A wealth tax recommendation of two parts: a Set an asset and wealth tax policy that strikes a correct balance between encouraging national economic growth while restricting the concentration of wealth in capital assets confined to the lockers of an economic elite. b Such an asset and wealth tax, which would also take account of capital gains: it would require and improve transparency, so that economic inequalities would be reduced; and it would recognize greater fairness between individuals, groups and generations. Improving democracy and eliminating local body rates In a small country like New Zealand there is little real advantage to citizens with the division of the country into small local fiefdoms. To date the country has eliminated quite a raft of outcrops of locally elected bodies. Martin has described a little of the history: The formal structure of local government, including the health and education sectors, changed little in the 110 years following the abolition of the provinces in 1876. The anachronisms were highly visible: a pocket borough of Newmarket (among some sixty local authorities in the local Auckland region); five hospital boards in Otago (with hospitals said to be one coach road apart); a plethora of ad hoc authorities rabbit boards, catchment boards, harbour boards etc. The multiplication of ad hoc authorities underlines the point. Increasingly, central government by-passed the existing organs of local government and established new agencies to carry out new functions; (1991, p. 271) Martin went on to describe the reforms which saw the elimination of many of these ad hoc authorities. He then considered whether the reforms might continue, for there were people in New Zealand communities who were “unpersuaded of the virtues of ‘participation’ or ‘power sharing’ in a country of little more than three million people” (p. 292) and added “there is no universally held understanding of the relationship between central government and statutory authorities at the local and regional level” (p. 292). Bush (1990) was another who considered the local government reforms of the 1980s, and went on to point out that politicians, elected at local level, were hoping for new sources of revenue beyond rates. Even so he thought those reforms would serve the country to the turn of the century but “\[i\]n the nature of things \[the arrangements of local government\] will inevitably in its own turn be transformed and eventually superseded.” ( p. 248) Now may well be the time for further transformation. Education is largely a central administration. There seems to have been little advantage to education administration in the election of school boards, which were largely a return to the 19 th century situation. Some of the nonsense concerning definitions of governance and the boundaries imposed around governors has abated somewhat. It is hard to see how health administration is assisted through the operation of 20 district health boards. The funds for public education and for public health health are not collected at the local level. And the rating system for cities, districts and the regions which overlap them are seldom sufficient to meet local demands. Furthermore, rates vary unfairly. Most smaller districts are unable to meet the economies of scale sufficient to satisfy their area’s fundamental needs. Even a prosperous regional city will have considerably higher rates than a large metropolitan area like Auckland. Take the case of a regional city and the regional council surrounding it asking a landowner to pay a total of $2786 on land valued at $235,000, a levy of about 1.2% of the asset’s value. A decade later that landowner is rated $2,662 on land valued at $880,000 where the levy is only 0.3% of that asset’s value. Counts like this reveal there is little horizontal fairness throughout the country in the rating systems on land assets. But the Health vote is still mediated by various district health boards to no great advantage. Local body elections and their democratic outcomes are frequently little more than a dress rehearsal — or a retirement scheme — for national politicians. Presently one local authority, Auckland city, covers the aspirations of about one third of the country’s population. From time to time more and more amalgamations of local bodies are suggested, but these are usually resisted by incumbent local body politicians and their administrative employees. The result is that residents in smaller local body districts have difficulty meeting rate rises sufficient for some of their most basic necessities: adequate sewerage, infrastructure reticulation, and have little space to consider any larger issues that good enough government might demand. As we see health and education are largely centralized with some difficulties imposed by some local boards. Large issues such as resource management, climate change, as well as infrastructure matters such as transport, water reticulation, energy generation, housing and the elimination of waste are hardly well coordinated across the country. So the current tax of land and capital variously carried out across the country could be given over to a more uniform application while more co-ordinated management centres around the country could be financed from the central tax take. The country could hope there might be savings with administrative rationalization as well as the savings of local body election costs. So here is a fourth recommendation. Recommendation 4 Recognize the opportunities of data processing technologies to eliminate layers of local government and so centralize democratic functions to adequately and fairly deal with health (obesity) and education, resource management issues, climate change (greenhouse gas emissions), and infrastructure matters such as transport, water reticulation, energy generation, housing and the elimination of waste (pollution).

I seem to have been going in (internet) circles to find where to send a submission (e.g. I sent it to the TWG address but told the Future of Taxation one was closed). Please accept this one on ring fencing. PS: I have been away from Internet access these past two days while conducting remedial work at a property following abandonment and damage of a property (one of the many unbudgeted calamities that might befall an investor). I have been a property investor (i.e. landlord) for 30 years. For many years my properties were cashflow negative. I did not deliberately set our for this to happen, as to me running a property at a loss makes little sense. However in the late 1980s and early 1990s (following the share market crash, in which I lost money I had hoped to use to refinance my properties), interest rates rose. property prices dropped, rents dropped alarmingly and as it was a renter's market the tenants could demand concessions such as new drapes to match their furniture). In addition costs such as insurance and rates and water went up (they never go down). I made substantial losses. Unfortunately, these (unexpected) losses were ring fenced then with only $10,000 per annum being allowed. Within two years the legislation around this was reversed, as the (un)expected consequences included loss of rental properties. Even though ring fencing was reversed the rules re the previous losses stayed in place and I had to spread the loss over the next six years. This precluded me from making rational decisions about new investments. Since this time my properties have been cashflow positive, although I seem to have an unexpected large cost (and/or loss of income) on each property about once every ten years. i.e. I have around 10 investment properties with a 10% of a problem (these have included landslips, failure of a re-roof, replacement of a bathroom due to a hidden leak, a septic tank failure - it had to be replaced). I also have at times had a dud tenant who caused damage and/or failed to pay rent. As it takes a while to get a Tenancy Tribunal Hearing and more time to get it actioned (e.g. an eviction), there is often no income for several months, while the standard costs (insurance, rates, mortgage, body corporate fees etc) continue, then thousands may be spent remediating damage (which the current rules deem to be at the landlord's cost, not the tenant's), while the place still remains empty (I am facing this very predicament at present). So a stream of positive cashflow years may be followed by one with a loss, so it hardly seems fair to prevent this being claimed in a given year. Many expenses and cashflows are also predicted to be lumpy. e.g. my daughter is considering investing in a rental property and is looking at three different scenarios presented by a property consulting firm. In these, years of profits may be followed by a loss due to fixed interest rates going up at the end of the fixed term and increased maintenance being scheduled every few years. I also prepare Long Term Maintenance Plans for several body corporates (as required by law). Even though I try to spread the maintenance costs evenly over the years, this is impossible due to several costs being relatively high (e.g. a complete exterior repaint, replacing a shared driveway, renewing services). It makes economic sense to do some of these at the same time. e.g. replace stormwater, sewerage, phone, gas and power lines and then relay the driveway. So all the costs tend to be lumped. Other costs also arise for which the investor has little control. For instance, we are faced with putting in or upgrading insulation and smoke alarms with the former not being deductible. We do not yet know what will be required under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill recently passed. For instance if we have to provide heat pumps we bear costs of several thousand per property. If an individual investor had been making profits for some years and paying tax of these, then was faced with high body corporate fees for a given year, then it is hardly fair to ring fence this loss. If other costs are then deemed non-deductible on top of this, then landlords may be driven out of the business. The state would end up having to provide more accommodation (as occurred in the early 1990s, leading to the abandonment of ring fencing then). Such situations are not good for investors, tenants or the State. So think very carefully of the consequences and inequalities of ring fencing being applied to residential property investments (particularly as they are not applied to other forms of business). John Paynter MSc, BCom, JP I am happy to meet the Working Group to discuss this issue and provide documentation of practical examples where legitimate losses have occurred in the past or may occur in the future. \[1\] \[1\] 2

Yours sincerely Katherine Rich Chief Executive \[1\] \[1\] Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Submission by the New Zealand Food & Grocery Council 30 April 2018 Page 2 NEW ZEALAND FOOD & GROCERY COUNCIL 1. The New Zealand Food & Grocery Council (“NZFGC”) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. 2. NZFGC represents the major manufacturers and suppliers of food, beverage and grocery products in New Zealand. This sector generates over $34 billion in the New Zealand domestic retail food, beverage and grocery products market, and over $31 billion in export revenue from exports to 195 countries – some 72% of total merchandise exports. Food and beverage manufacturing is the largest manufacturing sector in New Zealand, representing 44% of total manufacturing income. Our members directly or indirectly employ more than 400,000 people – one in five of the workforce. OVERARCHING COMMENTS 3. As noted at the outset, NZFGC has chosen to submit on one aspect of the tax proposals and that concerns a ‘sugar tax’. We are confident our interests in other areas are adequately covered by submissions from the likes of Business New Zealand and the Chambers of Commerce. 4. This submission touches on several aspects of a sugar tax, focussing on what one report calls ‘real-world’ evidence to show:  sugar drink taxes demonstrate that demand for beverages tends to be inelastic making these products poor choices for control via taxes  consumers frequently substitute untaxed but equally caloric food and drink products for taxed items  real-world evidence from countries that have imposed soda taxes (US, Mexico, France, Hungary and Denmark) shows no discernible improvement in obesity rates.  such taxes are among the least cost-effective and are regressive. They disproportionately affect those on lowest incomes  they can cause unintended negative consequences  impacts are wide-ranging, highly uncertain and highly speculative. 5. The overall conclusion is that sugar taxes fail on the principles of good regulatory practice of equity, efficiency and necessity. 6. NZFGC considers more certain results are obtainable from the likes of reformulation being seen from the Health Star Rating scheme and that strong promotion of this by Government together with extensive and focussed education are more certain and better value for cost of implementation. DETAILED COMMENTS Sugar – essential building block 7. Sugar is essential for growth particularly in the form of complex carbohydrates such as those found in grains, starchy vegetables, breads and cereals, because they take longer to digest. Simple sugars, such as table sugar, honey and syrup, metabolise quickly and challenge blood sugar levels. Both complex and simple sugars provide energy. Why Sugar 8. Many opposing sugar in the food supply face a paradox that fruit is a high source of sugar but fruit and vegetables are part of the New Zealand ‘5 a day’ programme and recommended in dietary guidelines. Refining the target to ‘simple sugars’ is intended to address the paradox and narrow the target. However this ignores many other factors, Page 3 particularly economic factors about how taxes work and human behaviour in relation to them. 9. Parnell (2015) reports that “... New Zealanders are consuming a moderate level of sucrose that’s within the WHO recommendation for added sugars: below 10% of our total energy intake. Sucrose consumption can be used as a proxy for measuring added sugar intake, and sucrose intakes declined between 1997 and 2008/09, from a median of 53g/day to 48g/day. That’s about a teaspoon less per person a day - nearly 2kgs less a year ... The latest adult nutrition survey also indicates a reduction in the proportion of sucrose from non-alcoholic beverages and sweets, and an increase in the proportion of sucrose from fruit, compared with 1997.” 10. Since then, (Kibblewhite 2017) the data collected for the 2008-09 Adult nutrition survey has been reanalysed to estimate the free and added sugar intakes in New Zealand. This confirmed that even a decade ago, 42% of New Zealand adults consumed less than 10% of their energy intake (the level recommended by the WHO) from free sugars. The paradox is that sugar consumption has been declining at the same time as obesity rates have been rising. 11. In New Zealand, almost 1 in 2 beverages (non-dairy) available in the supermarket do not contain any added sugar. We estimate that figure to be an improvement on previous years but without historical data we cannot claim this is the case. What we do know is that:  a government survey (Ministry of Health, 2011) found that only 1.1% of an average child’s energy intake came from soft drinks  New Zealanders choose to drink water a third of the time while soft drinks are chosen less than 4% of the time (based on Neilsen data)  the consumption of water has grown by 21% since 2010 while the consumption of soft drink continues to trend down by 4.2% over the same period (NZ Beverage Council website)  manufacturers are responding to consumer demand for low sugar alternatives by reformulating their products, offering smaller pack sizes and promoting low and no calorie soft drinks. 12. These trends are replicated in Australia. Over 15 years, from 1997 to 2011, the sales of non-alcoholic, water-based beverages increased by 26% with an annual growth rate of 1.7%. This growth rate was driven by increasing sales of non-sugar beverages which increased by 73% with an annual growth rate of 4.9% (Levy and Shrapnel 2014). This can be seen in the graph opposite. 13. New Zealand may already have reached the tipping point where no-added sugar drinks dominate the market and, if milks are added in, most being unflavoured, New Zealand would certainly already be there. NZIER Report 14. The NZIER report Sugar taxes: a review of the evidence produced for the Ministry of Health in August 2017 and released earlier this year was intended to review any new evidence on the effectiveness of a sugar tax as a tool for improving health outcomes. NZIER said the Ministry was especially interested in the effect of taxes on sugar-sweetened non-alcoholic beverages and found the following:  “No study based on actual experience with sugar taxes has identified an impact on health outcomes.” Page 4  “Studies ... report reductions in \[sugar\] intake that are likely too small to generate health benefits and could easily be cancelled out by substitution of other sources of sugar or calories.” 15. NZIER found that earlier studies significantly overestimated the effect of sugar taxes on sugar consumption due to ‘fundamental methodological flaws,’ and these estimates had contaminated later modelling trying to assess the health benefits of sugar taxes. NZIER considered the evidence was weak that sugar taxes improved health. 16. The NZIER report shows that a tax on sugary beverages is not a contributing solution to reducing the complex issue of obesity and people cannot be taxed to slimness. 17. INC believes the Health Star Rating scheme is generating a level of reformulation that is leading to healthier choices and stronger Government support for the scheme would cement the good work to date. Complementing that, New Zealand needs to concentrate on education around healthy eating, good food choices and moderation, and how all that works alongside being more active. Mexican experience 18. NZFGC is concerned that while a sugar tax has proven to be an easy target for campaigners, it is not backed by evidence. This is particularly the case in Mexico where sales data NZFGC obtained from Nielsen’s Mexico showed that two years after the tax was introduced, sales had dropped by just 0.5% – amounting to not even one sip per person. Sales initially dropped by 3% but within a year were back to pre-tax levels. Diagram 1 Sales by Volume, Mexico 2013-2017 1 1 Based on Nielsen RMS data for Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) category (NZFGC defined) for the continuous 12-month periods from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 for the Mexican Total retail market (Copyright © 2017, Nielsen) Page 5 Diagram 2 Sales by value, Mexico 2013-2017 2 19. Mexico’s 10% tax raised a lot of money, particularly from the poor, but did nothing to improve health. The only success from that tax was a boost to Government revenue of 21 billion pesos (NZ$1.5 billion) in 2015, which itself proved there was little decline in consumption. 20. Andalon and Gibson (2017) found that estimates of health impacts (weight loss) of the Mexican soda tax ignored consumer responses on the quality margin and correlated measurement errors. The researchers used Mexican household budget survey data and city soda prices to model demand that showed an elasticity of quantity demand of just -0.2 to 0.3. This showed tax induced price increases might reduce average weights by less than a pound which is too small to improve health. 21. The lessons from Mexico are:  The excise tax has been absorbed by the consumer. Prices for sugar sweetened beverages have increased by 15.4% since the first year which is over three times higher than the increase reported in 2013  The tax has proved inflationary by directly affecting the price of the basic food basket in Mexico  The tax has been ineffective on consumption and the drinks category continues to grow at around 1.5-2% per annum. Initially there was a reaction to the price change but consumers quickly reverted to previous consumption rates. Our information suggests the following: Year Sales volume increase (decrease) 2014 (1.9%) 2015 0.0% 2016 1.6%  The tax has been ineffective for health purposes since the consumption of calories from soft drinks was not significantly reduced (it represents only 5.5% of total daily calorie intakes)  It is regressive with the poorest households being the most affected by the tax. According to CONEVAL (National Center for the Evaluation of Social Development Politics from Mexico), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) and KANTAR (Global Consumer Behaviour Specialist) 62% of the tax collected came from 2 Based on Nielsen RMS data for Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) category (NZFGC defined) for the continuous 12-month periods from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 for the Mexican Total retail market (Copyright © 2017, Nielsen) Page 6 the lowest income households. We understand that studies undertaken by UANL (Universidad Autonόma de Nuevo Leon), COLMEX (College of México) and ITAM (Instituto Technolόgico Autonόma de Mexico) confirm this.  The tax induced substitution for other taxed and non-taxed categories. Since the purchasing power of consumers did not increase, in order to continue the beverage category products, people appeared to reduce purchasing in home care and personal care items (according to Kantar and Nielsen).  The Mexican economy reflected a negative impact from the tax. According to INEGI, the country’s production fell in the equivalent of 0.04% of GDP during 2015 and, according to ANPEC (National Association of Small Businesses), 30,000 convenience stores closed in 2014. Australia 22. A study commissioned by the Menzies Research Centre Fat chance: why sugar taxes won’t work from Cadence Economics, asked the question about a causal relationship between aggregate soft-drink consumption and the prevalence of obesity and finds the evidence is very weak. Both sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption and sugar consumption are trending down in Australia with no particular impact on obesity. Europe 23. The European Commission engaged ECSIP (European Competitiveness and Sustainable Industrial Policy Consortium) to conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of food taxes. This involved a literature review, quantitative analysis interviews and case studies across the EU. While overall food taxes reduce consumption of taxed products, for food which is particularly inelastic, product substitution takes place both from cheaper brands and less or non-taxed products. As well, administrative burdens increase, employment may be negatively impacted and competitiveness can be impacted. 24. NZFGC refers to a study by the London Metropolitan University that estimated a 10% tax in the UK would reduce the average personal daily intake by 7.5ml, also less than a sip. 25. Similarly, an issues paper by the International Tax and Investment Center, Oxford Economics, Oxford University identified four main factors that influence the success of targeted food and drink taxes: extent to which taxes are passed on to consumers (noting that most manufacturers have a range of products over which commercial decisions on spreading costs can be made), responsiveness of demand for taxed goods to price rises (food and beverage purchases are largely unresponsive), consumer substitution of taxed products with others that are no less unhealthy, and increased trans-border purchasing. Canada 26. Canada has not implemented a sugar tax but as with many countries the debate continues. A recent discussion (Taylor 2017) showed the experience in countries and cities with soda taxes reveals demand for beverages tends to be inelastic, which makes these products poor choices for control via taxes. Consumers frequently substitute untaxed but equally caloric food and drink products for taxed items. Real-world evidence from countries that have imposed soda taxes (US, Mexico, France, Hungary and Denmark) shows no discernible improvement in obesity rates. Such taxes are among the least cost-effective, are regressive, disproportionately affect those on lowest incomes, and can cause unintended negative consequences. As a source of Government revenue a soda tax appeals to cash strapped economies. Other 27. Globally the McKinsey Global Institute considered 74 interventions and developed an initial assessment of their cost-effectiveness and the potential scale of their impact if applied at a national level. Of 16 of the key interventions, a tax was in the lowest quarter Page 7 of effectiveness (portion control and reformulation led the impact table). See Diagram 3 over. 28. Finally, in terms of unintended consequences, there is the potential growth of a black market in soft drinks of unknown quality estimated which, in France for example, is estimated as comprising around 5% of the market. A soft drink tax also has the potential to lead to an increased consumption of competing products such as those containing alcohol. According to research (Hanks et al 2013) when soft drinks are discriminately taxed, consumers will buy more alcohol and other higher caloric drinks underlining the inelasticity of the drinks market.

Executive Summary Coca-Cola 1 welcomes the opportunity to submit on the Tax Working Group’s (“the Group”) Future of Tax: Submissions Background paper (“submissions paper”). In particular, we would like to comment on the potential introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (“SSBs”). At its heart, a tax on SSBs is targeted at an increase in healthy eating and lifestyles, and a decrease in the incidences of obesity, diabetes, and other overconsumption / lifestyle related health issues. These are goals that Coca-Cola completely supports. We are devoted to ensuring that New Zealand’s future is a healthy one and this is part of our core business strategy. 2 However we believe that a tax on SSBs is unnecessary and should not be introduced as outlined in this submission. 1. The solution lies in more effective methods of combatting obesity A systematic response is required – no single intervention is likely to have a significant overall impact. Coca-Cola is committed to sugar reduction and is: a) Actively reducing the sugar in our beverages by reformulating our recipes to reduce sugar in our current beverage portfolio b) Developing new drinks with low or no sugar. c) Promoting smaller packs / sizes d) Encouraging informed choice by providing straight-forward, accessible ingredient information. 2. There is a lack of evidence that a SSB tax is effective There is insufficient evidence proving that a tax on SSBs is effective in reducing obesity, A New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Report to the Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence concluded that no study based on actual experience with sugar taxes has identified a positive impact on health outcomes. 3 For example, Hungary, France and Finland currently impose taxes on SSBs, but obesity has continued to rise in these countries. 4 1 In this submission “Coca-Cola” refers to Coca-Cola Oceania Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. 2 https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/cokes-way-forward-new-business-strategy-to-focus-on-choice- convenience-and-the-consumer 3 NZIER Report to Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence. 4 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Statistics Database. Accessed August 2016. Also: http://www.ncdrisc.org/bmi-mean-line.html Classified - Confidential 3. A sugar tax is regressive A sugar tax is a discriminatory tax as it will disproportionately affect low-income earners (as they are the most at risk of health related issues from overconsumption and lifestyle factors 5 ), without actually providing the benefits to these consumers as intended. 4. A SSB tax should not be introduced We at Coca-Cola ask the Tax Working Group to consider our submission and what is best for New Zealand. In our view any form of SSB tax would be an ineffective policy solution for combatting obesity and other health related issues. It would also be unnecessary given the sustained portfolio of more effective initiatives already put in place by the industry, targeting those at risk. We suggest that a broader use of alternative initiatives (such as those Coca-Cola has implemented) will be a significantly more effective method for increasing the health and wellbeing of New Zealand. The solution lies in more effective methods of combatting obesity A tax on SSBs is not the appropriate path towards a healthy future for New Zealanders. A systemic response is required, one that focuses on the most efficient and effective methods for improving the wellbeing of New Zealand. A systematic response is already in action We believe that a systematic response is required – no one single intervention is likely to have a significant positive overall impact. Obesity and like health issues are complex problems that do not have a single solution. Education and encouraging personal responsibility are necessary, but not sufficient. The McKinsey Global Institute in the UK analysed a wide range of interventions to tackle obesity and found that taxes fell outside the ten most effective interventions. 6 The report cited portion control, reformulation, parental education and weight-management programmes as some of the most effective policy measures to address this problem. A SSB tax is not the appropriate mechanism for bringing in change, what is required is a systemic and sustained portfolio of initiatives. Coca-Cola is committed to building a healthier future for New Zealanders and has already been implementing the systemic and sustained portfolio of initiatives that the McKinsey Global Institute recommended and that we believe are required. This is now part of our core business strategy. 7 We are focused on producing – and responsibly marketing – low and no sugar / kilojoule drinks. Currently our portfolio is made up of more than 120 products across 21 brands and all of our top selling brands offer a no sugar alternative. The average kilojoule content of beverages in our portfolio has reduced by 3% each year over the past three years. Today, one third of our sales are in either low or no sugar varieties – an increase of 13% since 2015. To achieve this, we have made significant changes within our product portfolio, packaging and marketing communication to help Kiwis consume less sugar from our beverages. We have expanded our product range, offering more low and no sugar/kilojoule options, reformulating some of our drinks with less sugar/kilojoules, reducing pack/portion sizes and actively marketing our low and no sugar/kilojoule drinks and responsibly marketing our sugar/kilojoule containing products. Our continued adoption of the Health Star Rating System’s integrated energy icon on our packs, our long-held and externally audited global Responsible Marketing to Children Policy, our voluntary commitment to the Advertising Standards Authority’s Codes and the 5 http://www.superu.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Obesity%20Summary%20Report.pdf 6 McKinsey Global Institute Overcoming obesity: An initial economic analysis.

Additionally, we have set ourselves a target to reduce sugar across our portfolio by 10% by 2020. To achieve this, we will continue our ambitious reformulation and new product innovation programme and harness our marketing capabilities to encourage more people to choose our lower kilojoule and no sugar options more often. All these initiatives highlight that a tax on SSBs is unnecessary as there are already actions in place to address the issues. This commitment is further evidenced through Coca-Cola ranking third out of 25 of New Zealand’s largest food companies for its nutrition commitments, in a study which assessed obesity prevention and nutrition related policies and commitments of these New Zealand food companies. 8 Coca-Cola would also welcome the opportunity to work with the Government on developing and implementing voluntary measures to reduce the sugar that people consume from food and beverages. We are committed to being visible in our actions, and our existing commitment to the Ministry of Health Healthy Kids Industry Pledge demonstrates our dedication to help Kiwis consume less sugar from our beverages. We refer you to our March 2018 Report Sugar Reduction: Our Actions in the New Zealand Marketplace for Coca Cola’s current initiatives for further details of the actions we are undertaking to support the wellbeing of New Zealand and New Zealanders. As an industry we are committed to ensuring we deliver change and continue to build on the progress we have already made. SSB consumption in New Zealand In 2016, only 3.5% of all drinks (excluding alcohol) consumed by New Zealanders were soft drinks, as a smaller subset of SSBs, (and a decrease from 2010), with 27.5% of drinks consumed being water, 45% coffee and tea. 9 Further, over the past decade sales of low and no kilojoule non-alcoholic beverages have grown by 66.7%. 10 These facts all suggest that the initiatives Coca-Cola and other industry members are undertaking are effective in changing behaviour. The introduction of a tax on SSBs is unnecessary because other more effective initiatives have already been successfully implemented. Despite the decrease in SSB consumption, obesity levels continue to rise. The child obesity rate has increased from 8% in 2006/07 to 12% in 2016/17 and the adult obesity rate has increased from 27% in 2006/07 to 32% in 2016-17. 11 SSBs (and sugar) are only a small part of the average diet. Soft drinks only account for 1.6% of an adult New Zealander’s average energy intake. The remainder is made up of 3.4% from other non-alcoholic beverages, 11% from bread, 10% from cakes, pies, muffins, pastries and biscuits, 7% from grains and pasta, 5% from milk, 5% from alcohol, 4% from sugars and sweets and then 53% of ‘other food’ (including cereals). 12 This highlights that taxing SSBs will not solve obesity issues in New Zealand as they are not the only (nor the main) problem. This is a situation where a wider response is required. 8 https://www.coca-colajourney.co.nz/stories/coca-cola-oceania-ranks-number-3-in-nz-for-commitment-to- nutrition 9 Frequency of Beverage Drinking; ‘Consumer and media insights service for YE Q1 2016’, The Neilsen Company. 10 Nielsen Scantrack Total Supermarlets MAT to 18/09/2106.. 11 Ministry of Health. 2017.

Classified - Confidential There is a lack of evidence that a SSB tax is effective in reducing health related issues from overconsumption We recognise the complex challenge of obesity and other health related issues in New Zealand and that there is scope to improve the outcomes we are seeing in this area. However, no single food or beverage alone is responsible for these issues. There is no conclusive evidence that imposing a tax on soft drinks helps people to lose weight. We are fully committed to actions that have been proven effective in reducing obesity and promoting healthier lifestyles such as sugar reduction reformulations, new low and no kilojoule and sugar products, providing smaller portions and responsible marketing. Problem definition The submissions paper does not actually specifically query whether there should be a sugar tax or a tax on SSBs, but asks whether there is scope for more behavioural taxes to be introduced into New Zealand. However, page 26 of the paper uses sugary drinks as an example where there have been calls for tax to discourage behaviour. We understand the concern is in relation to health issues such as obesity and diabetes. We have prepared this submission on the basis that this is the reason for the potential introduction of a SSB tax, and not for other reasons such as raising revenue. The problem definition must actually be set wider than merely that of overconsumption of sugar. The issue is not only overconsumption of sugar, but overconsumption of total energy / kilojoules from all sources (fat, starches, sugar, protein and alcohol) versus energy expended (i.e lack of daily physical activity, regular exercise and overall attention to wellbeing). In New Zealand, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, often viewed as the largest of the SSBs categories, is actually decreasing 13 , however obesity remains an issue. There is a wider matrix of factors to consider in relation to the cause of obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. Obesity is a complex problem that is related to all kilojoule-containing dietary inputs, genetic make-up, lifestyle factors and other less tangible considerations. Why a tax on SSBs? When it comes to a SSB tax, the underlying assumption is that there is a correlation between increased consumption of SSBs and obesity or that there is a correlation between increased tax and a reduction in obesity and other health issues. However, there is insufficient evidence to say with any certainty that either point is accurate. Studies have shown that reductions in intake are too small to generate health benefits – particularly given that consumers may just be substituting other sources of sugar or kilojoules in response to increased tax on SSBs. 14 The New Zealand position NZIER report The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Report to the Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence (the “NZIER report”) involved the study of a wide-range of evidence from overseas studies on SSB taxes, including where SSB taxes have actually been introduced (such as Mexico). The conclusion was that there is no clear evidence that imposing a SSB tax would meet a comprehensive cost-benefit test. This report is important because it involved an analysis of the New Zealand context and some key points to draw out from the report include: 13 NZ Beverage Council A look inside NZ fridges: Beverage consumption in New Zealand. 14 NZIER Report to Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence. Classified - Confidential • Estimates of reduced intake are often overstated due to methodological flaws and incomplete measurements. • There is insufficient evidence to judge whether consumers are substituting other sources of sugar or kilojoules in the face of taxes on sugar in drinks. • Studies report reductions in intake that are likely too small to generate health benefits and could easily be cancelled out by substitution of other sources of sugar or kilojoules. • No study based on actual experience with sugar taxes has identified a positive impact on health outcomes. 15 These outcomes reflect that sugar, including sugar from SSBs, is only one part of the kilojoules in diets and is therefore only part of the energy imbalance problem. In New Zealand, non-alcoholic sweetened beverages make up only 5% of an adult’s average kilojoule / energy intake. 16 The largest intake of energy is from fats (33.7%), starches (25%), sugar (21%), protein (16.5%) and alcohol (3.8%). 17 Consistent with the analysis in the NZIER report, a report by the New Zealand Initiative in April 2016 concluded that studies which analysed the effect of sugar taxes fail to prove that taxes will achieve their stated policy intention of reducing obesity. Its research noted that many studies focus on proxies (for example whether a tax will reduce consumption) but those studies did not consider whether people substitute with cheaper products or other kilojoule containing foods. 18 With regards to substitution, the NZIER report noted sugar / kilojoule substitution can easily occur and consumers will merely move (if they move on at all) to consuming other sugar / kilojoule containing foods or beverages. The vast array of alternative food and drinks means that a tax on SSBs will not have predictable outcomes and will have a complex relationship to health behaviours. 19 The same can even be said within the same product or type of SSB. A report by Ecorys (in conjunction with the European Competitiveness and Sustainable Industrial Policy Consortium) found that where an SSB or sugar tax had been introduced, some consumers favoured cheaper brands of the taxed product in order to maintain their current consumption. 20 The Kantar World Panel Mexico Report found that after the introduction of an SSB tax in Mexico many families turned to cheaper brands in more informal markets (i.e. street sales). 21 In Philadelphia consumers bought SSBs from outside the city. 22 What has been the experience of other countries? A small number of countries have implemented or tried to implement a SSB tax (or similar) with the stated aim of reducing obesity. The general experience from these countries is that there was no reduction in obesity. In fact, these real life examples found that kilojoule intake reduced very minimally, if at all, and that the health benefits of a sugar tax are uncertain. For example Hungary, France and Finland currently impose taxes on SSBs, but obesity has continued to rise in these countries. 23 15 NZIER Report to Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence. 16 University of Otago and Ministry of Health. 2011.

Accessed August 2016. Classified - Confidential The Ecorys report evaluated the impact of food taxes in Europe (including Hungary, France, Denmark and Finland) and found that there is no clear evidence that an observed reduction in SSB consumption has led to public health benefits. 24 We set out below the experience of some of the countries who have (or have tried to) introduce a tax on SSBs/ sugar. Mexico In 2014 Mexico imposed an excise tax on SSBs (at 1 peso per litre), in a bid to address the country’s growing obesity epidemic. However, the data obtained since 2014 has not been positive. In the first year of the SSB tax, SSB consumption only declined by a nominal amount (approximately 4 calories a day, from a diet of more than 3,000 calories a day). 25 This sort of calorie reduction is nominal and is, at most, a 0.13% reduction in calorie intake, which can hardly be said to be effective in improving the well-being and lifestyles of the Mexican people. Further, in 2015 SSB consumption levelled and in 2016 SSB consumption returned to growth. 26 There is no clear evidence that overall the Mexican people have improved their health following the introduction of the SSB tax. Government of Mexico data showed that obesity rates continued to rise despite the implementation of the SSB tax and a high calorie/kilojoule snack tax in 2014. From these statistics alone it is clear that the SSB tax in Mexico was unsuccessful in reducing calorie/kilojoule consumption and improving lifestyles. The greater issue here is the total daily calorie/kilojoule consumption, which tax has proven to be ineffective at solving. Despite the SSB tax in Mexico being successful in raising revenue (noting that the tax increased prices on SSBs by an average of 9%-18%) 27 , the tax had significant downsides. It cost tens of thousands of jobs, caused upwards of 30,000 mum & dad retailers to close and had a negative impact on Mexican GDP. 28 United States of America A number of cities in the United States have introduced or considered a SSB tax, including Philadelphia (Pennsylvania). Philadelphia introduced a 1.5 cent per ounce beverage tax and as a result of the tax the major beverage companies announced significant job losses in the industry, with layoffs of nearly 20 percent of the workforce in the city, as consumers found alternative ways to purchase SSBs. 29 Other major cities including Santa Fe (New Mexico) and Cook County (Illinois), have faced widespread rejection of beverage taxes. In May 2017 in Santa Fe, New Mexico voters decisively rejected a two-cent per ounce tax on SSBs, due to concerns that the tax would harm working class families and small businesses. In Cook County, Illinois a SSB tax was repealed only two months after enactment after public outcry over the resulting price hikes in stores. 30 Studies in the US of the already implemented taxes have found that despite soft drink consumption reducing steadily in recent years, research does not support the theory that soft drink taxes will reduce BMI meaningfully. 31 While soda consumption in the US has 24 European Competitiveness and Sustainable Industrial Policy Consortium Food taxes and their impact on competitiveness in the agri-food sector.

Classified - Confidential been in steady decline for many years, obesity has continued to increase. Similar examples are extant in Australia and many European countries. 32 A study of actual results of a SSB tax in Berkeley, California, showed an increase in calorie/kilojoule consumption as consumers switched from taxed beverages to higher calorie/kilojoule untaxed beverages like milkshakes. 33 France France’s SSB tax led to a decrease in soft drink consumption of 3-3.5 litres per year, per person. 34 However, this only equates to 8.2-9.6 fewer millilitres a day – which is about one sip of a SSB. France’s position illustrates that a tax on SSBs will not result in a meaningful reduction in consumption and that other, more targeted measures are more important in the fight against obesity. France’s SSB tax has been successful in raising revenue. However, a SSB tax is a behavioural tax, the effectiveness of which is not measured by revenue collection. In fact, it is arguable that a 100% successful behavioural tax collects no money at all. Hungary In 2011 Hungary introduced a tax on SSBs and a number of other food items. The sale of SSBs fell by 15.1% from 2011–2013, however in the period before the tax was introduced (2007-2011) sales had already fallen by 13.5%. 35 This highlights that the SSB tax as introduced had little effect and other factors were the driving force behind any decrease in consumption. A Hungarian study also illustrated that, of the total energy intake for adult women in Hungary, 2% comes from added sugars in taxed soft drinks. 36 The remaining intake comes from naturally occurring sugars in food or added sugars in other product groups. Again, this highlights that a SSB tax would only target a very small portion of energy intake and would do little to change overall consumption patterns. Denmark While not a sugar tax, in 2011 Denmark introduced a ‘fat tax’ with a similar goal to a SSB tax of increasing the health and wellbeing of its population (and to increase public revenue). This tax was levied on all products containing more than 2.3% of saturated fats (at 16 kroner per kilo). However, after a year the tax was repealed due to near universal opposition and widespread evasion. The ‘fat tax’ was responsible for 1,000 job losses, it increased the cost of some grocery staples by 20 per cent, involved $27 million in administrative costs to businesses, and didn’t have any significant impact on consumption patterns or dietary habits. Danish citizens largely evaded the tax by shopping across the border. 32 https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html / https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpao\_dtm/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DNPAO\_DTM.ExploreByTopic&islClass=OWS&islTopic =OWS1&go=GO 33 Popkin et al.

Classified - Confidential In addition, the government experienced an uptick in black market sales to avoid the tax. With this backdrop, the “fat” tax was quickly repealed, as was Denmark’s longstanding soft drink tax, and plans to introduce a wider sugar tax were dropped. 37 Over the period of Denmark’s tax (and following repeal), there was no discernible change in the rate of increase in BMI and obesity. Further, in 2015 and 2016 (after the tax was repealed), the rate of increase of BMI and obesity was negligible. 38 Colombia The legislature in Colombia rejected a SSB tax proposal in 2016 after economic concern was expressed from a number of parties, including small retailers and shopkeepers. It was noted that the tax could lead to hard times for small shopkeepers, potentially forcing them to close their businesses, because of the negative effects that the tax would have on their overall revenues and profit margins. 39 Iceland In Iceland a sugar tax on food and beverages was repealed in 2015 to benefit households and simplify the tax system. 40 It is also worth noting the International Monetary Fund conducted a report into modernising the Icelandic VAT system, concluding that it would be more efficient to raise the VAT rate than levy a commodity tax. 41 The IMF Report also noted that “If the goal of taxing sweet foods is to deter obesity, then taxing foods containing artificial sweeteners appears to make little sense, since these goods offer low- calorie/kilojoule substitutes for the foods whose consumption is being discouraged.” United Kingdom While only just implemented, the United Kingdom’s tax on SSBs raises the issue of substitution and alternative sugar consumption. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (UK) found that in the UK, 83% of sugar consumption comes from sources other than SSBs and that the effectiveness of a tax on SSBs will depend on the products people switch to. 42 The March 2018 Economic and Fiscal Outlook prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility 43 notes that the soft drinks industry levy had originally been forecast to raise £520 million in 2018-19 and progressively lower amounts in later years, as producers responded by lowering the sugar content in their drinks in order to reduce their tax liability. The Government had presented the soft drinks industry levy as a hypothecated tax, with revenue being applied to “pay for school sport”. At this stage it is unclear whether the receipts shortfall (due to an increase of inflation stemming from the soft drinks tax) will lead to a change in associated spending commitments. The experiences of these other countries have shown that behavioural taxes on food and drink are anything but straightforward. The NZIER report on sugar taxes notes that “Taxes are costly to administer and comply with and, especially in the case of people who are not the target of the intervention, come with deadweight losses that reduce their welfare. They should only be introduced if they are the best way to improve health.” 44 After considering the overseas’ experiences, it cannot be clearly said that a sugar tax would improve the health of New Zealanders. 37 ICBA submission on Bermuda’s Sugar Tax Consultation document. 20 February 2018. http://www.skm.dk/media/11579/faktaark\_afgiftsogkonkurrencepakke.pdf 38 http://www.ncdrisc.org/bmi-mean-line.html 39 ICBA: The Economic Impact of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxation. 40 https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IEA%20Sugar%20Taxes%20Briefing%20Jan%202016.pdf 41 https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14291.pdf 42 https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/bns/BN180.pdf 43 http://cdn.obr.uk/EFO-MaRch\_2018.pdf (refer to page 213-214 in respect of the soft drinks industry levy) 44 NZIER Report to Ministry of Health Sugar taxes: A review of the evidence. Classified - Confidential Comparison with other behavioural taxes and line-drawing The excise tax on tobacco in New Zealand has been extremely effective in raising revenue and since its introduction, the popularity of smoking has decreased significantly. At first glance, this is a situation where a behavioural tax has worked; however it is not quite as simple as this. Without going into a detailed analysis of the excise tax on tobacco, many other factors have played into this decrease, including education, responsible (or even zero) marketing, as well as the fact that tobacco has few substitutes. Also, at its base, a person cannot safely consume tobacco; it has adverse health consequences. These facts do not hold with SSBs, which can be consumed safely in moderation. If a broader sugar tax is proposed, there will be difficult questions to consider about where the line is drawn in order for the tax to be effective. Is it only added sugar products, is it only products with added or total sugar content over a certain percentage or is it some other measure? What about items such as biscuits, cakes and cereals, or what about milk and juices where there is naturally occurring sugar? Any distinction will be arbitrary and if the approach is not comprehensive, there is a risk of substitution with other products containing sugar (let alone kilojoule-containing high fat or starch alternatives). A sugar tax is regressive and will hurt the economy and the poorest communities A sugar tax will disproportionately affect low-income earners, meaning that it is a discriminatory tax. Those most at risk of health related issues from overconsumption and lifestyle factors are those in low-socio-economic households. 45 A sugar tax will penalise these particular consumers relatively more than others, without actually providing the benefits to these consumers as intended. There will also be other unintended and detrimental consequences to introducing a sugar tax and these must be considered. A tax on SSBs will not target those at risk (and will penalise them instead) A SSB tax will disproportionately affect low-income earners, discriminating against the very people it is targeted at. The Kantar Worldpanel Mexico Report found that 63.7% of the tax collected by Mexico’s sugar tax was from low-socio-economic households. 46 In this situation tax merely acts to penalise certain consumers, without actually aiding those same consumers in any way. Behavioural taxes are a blunt tool and a sugar tax is ineffective in actually targeting those at risk of obesity or other health issues. The primary outcome of the Mexican SSB tax has been to make consumers, and in particular lower socio-economic groups, poorer not thinner. This is because SSBs only account for a small share of kilojoule consumption. In New Zealand, children living in the most socio-economically deprived neighbourhoods are 2.5 times as likely to be obese as children living in the least deprived neighbourhoods (after adjusting for age, sex and ethnic differences). 47 The Mexican experience shows that a SSB tax will hit the households of these children the hardest. It is vital that instead of introducing a SSB tax (which will be ineffective in targeting those at risk) targeted measures are implemented to help these children. The International Council of Beverages Associations Report in response to the Government of Bermuda’s proposed SSB tariff noted that “By singling out sugar and / or SSBs for discriminatory tax treatment, governments are pursuing policies that have 45 http://www.superu.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Obesity%20Summary%20Report.pdf 46 Kantar Worldpanel Mexico Report (December 2014) 47 Ministry of Health. 2017.

Classified - Confidential disproportionate detrimental impact on the very populations they are supposed to help, and therefore may worsen health outcomes.” 48 A discriminatory SSB tax is poor tax policy, with the IMF – Tax Policy Handbook noting that it is best practice to limit discriminatory taxes to luxury goods, products that are inelastic or have few substitutes (e.g. tobacco or alcohol). None of these differentiators apply to SSBs. 49 A targeted response is important. Even if consumption decreases overall with the introduction of a tax on SSBs, the Ecorys Report noted that, it is not clear if an observed average consumption is largely driven by “consumers who eat the taxed products as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, or by consumers who overconsume the nutrient which is being targeted by the tax. If the consumption decrease occurs in the segment of the population that is consuming the products as part of a balanced diet, and does not affect consumption of those at risk (does not target excess consumption), it may be that the tax is ineffective in reducing obesity.” This highlights the bluntness of a SSB tax and its ineffectiveness at meaningfully targeting those at risk. Unintended consequences The introduction of a tax on SSBs will also have unintended consequences, to the detriment of New Zealand. In Mexico, there was a loss of jobs in the industry, as well as the closure of a significant number of small businesses (“tiendas”), given the reliance of these businesses on the sales of SSBs (even though within two years’ time SSB consumption was in growth. 50 While the cause for this is unclear, the return of SSB consumption would indicate that consumers have simply shifted their purchasing location away from smaller retailers. There are also concerns around the creation of a ‘black market’ for SSBs. While we do not think that there will be such extreme consequences for the New Zealand economy, there will be unintended consequences arising from a SSB tax and it is important to be aware of their potential impact. The United Kingdom recently began implementation of a SSB tax. The Government Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that the increase in price of soft drinks due to the tax will raise inflation. This food inflation in turn will raise the cost of interest payments on index-linked payments by the Government by about £1 billion in 2018-19. Net-net, the new soft drink may cost the Government about twice as much as it raises in revenues, and do even less for the taxpayers having to foot this bill. 51 There may also be other New Zealand specific consequences that will only become clear if a tax is implemented. The Ecorys report considered the effectiveness of food taxes and their impact on competitiveness. 52 On sector competitiveness, the study concluded “... we observe food taxes leading to an increase in administrative burdens, notably if the tax is levied on ingredients (specific tax) or the tax base is highly differentiated and complicated.” The study also found that employment may be negatively impacted by a food tax. A SSB tax will introduce deadweight costs, especially if the scheme is complex. These administrative costs will go to profit margins, for all those involved, but in particular small business who stock and sell SSBs (or other sugary products if a wider tax is implemented). Most notably the Ecorys report found “To what extent changes in consumption resulting from a food tax actually lead to public health improvements is still widely debated and 48 ICBA submission on Bermuda’s Sugar Tax Consultation document. 20 February 2018. 49 IMF Tax Policy Handbook, Washington, IMF, 1995. 50 ANPEC, Mexican “National Alliances of Small Businesses” 51 http://www.taxpayersalliance.com/unintended\_consequences\_of\_the\_sugar\_tax 52 European Competitiveness and Sustainable Industrial Policy Consortium Food taxes and their impact on competitiveness in the agri-food sector. July 2014. Classified - Confidential evidence from academic literature is inconclusive and sometimes contradictory.” 53 In Hungary the evidence was that consumers were able to substitute with products containing the ingredients targeted by the tax (i.e. sugar and salt). In Finland the sugar tax contributed to changes in consumer demand in different categories of products but not an overall reduction in the demand for sweet and sugary products. This highlights that it cannot be proven, and indeed based on evidence to date unlikely, that a tax on sugary drinks will achieve its intended aim. It would be inappropriate to introduce compliance costs and other deadweight costs when the supposed benefits are not likely to come to fruition. Concluding statement We contend the Tax Working Group should not recommend a SSB tax. Such a tax would only provide, at best, limited revenue benefits and would be even less likely to provide any health outcomes. Evidence globally suggests that, in reality, a SSB tax would do little to reduce the level of obesity or positively impact other health issues. It is unnecessary given the sustained portfolio of more effective initiatives already targeting those at risk. We at Coca-Cola look forward to partnering with Government and other members of civil society to develop and implement long-term solutions to obesity and other related health issues.

September 23, 2018 RE: Future of Tax Interim Report, 20 September 2018 Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission regarding the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report. I am a doctor from Wellington, currently practicing in Melbourne, Australia, although am in the process of building a home in Taranaki with the intent of repatriating with my family in the next two years. I have personally benefited from New Zealand’s high-quality public education and health systems and student loan scheme during my training, and hope to repay this investment with a long career in New Zealand. I have had the chance to experience first-hand both the New Zealand and Australian approaches to taxation and health care. I have seen the value of public healthcare in reducing inequality, and conversely the extreme inequality in both countries despite well- developed health and social welfare services. The Australian taxation scheme is heavily biased in favour of the wealthy. Although top marginal tax rates in Australia are much higher than those in New Zealand, and a number of social services are means tested, in practice there are a number of mechanisms promoting tax avoidance by the wealthy at the expense of lower income groups. These include income tax deductions for salaried employees, tax credits for superannuation, capital gains tax discounts on investment property and equities held for more than 12 months, and the widespread use of negative gearing on residential property investment. In addition, a number of tax incentives to invest in residential property and the availability of cheap credit as a result of stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis have proved inflationary and further shifted land into the hands of wealthy investors and speculators, who have land banked in and around the Australian capital cities, limiting access to the CBD for workers. This has created a housing bubble with significant risk to the Australian economy in the event of a credit withdrawal or external economic crisis. This has been recently demonstrated. Major banks have significantly tightened credit availability in response to the ongoing Financial Services Royal Commission with significant reversal of recent property price gains in Melbourne and Sydney in the first few months of this year. The highest risk is to over-leveraged low income earners who would have limited ability to cope with a mortgage interest rate increase on high LVR loans. The majority of jobs created in Australia in the last 5 years are within the capital cities, limiting the ability of lower income groups to seek cheaper housing in regional Australia. Real wage growth has stagnated while house prices and to a lesser extent rents have increased, reducing housing security for a generation of young workers. Overall the Australian system has benefited wealthy landowners, property developers and speculators, at the expense of the middle and lower classes, who have experienced wage stagnation and a decline in property affordability and housing security. As described by the Interim Report, a capital gains tax is progressive but has significant disadvantages. The most important is the disincentive to sell or dispose of property holdings due to the costs incurred on selling. Australian states also levy a stamp duty on property buyers, which further disincentivises the sale of property. I strongly oppose a capital gains tax for New Zealand, as I expect that overall this would have a similar inflationary effect and limit land supply as it has in Australia. The other significant drawback to the Crown in introducing a capital gains tax currently is that the current New Zealand property market cycle appears to have peaked, limiting revenue from this tax for several years. I do however support the planned “ring-fencing” of deductions for rental property losses against other income in New Zealand. The proposed risk-free return tax is more equitable and will not prevent a barrier to land transfer. However, it shares the flaw of targeting both unimproved land and improvements and will not provide a disincentive to land-bank high-value land in proximity to cities or productive farmland. I strongly support a land value tax. Taxation on the value of unimproved land as the most equitable and efficient tax on the means of production has been well-described. 1 The concept was most eloquently proposed nearly 140 years ago by Henry George. 2 He suggested that any other form of taxation would tend only to ever-increasing inequality as land and capital was concentrated by the wealthy. A land tax does not rely on constant increases in the value of land for revenue so is not inflationary. In fact, it is likely to be deflationary to land prices as the profit in land- banking will be reduced which will provide an incentive to reduce holdings. This could be considered a drawback, although this will increase the supply of land and decrease inequality which is a benefit. It is also likely to increase productivity and wages through greater utilisation of land, which should offset this effect on the broader economy. There should be little or no exemption for primary residences, as it is likely that these owners would benefit from reduced land cost and therefore lower mortgages, and the reductions in other taxes made possible by a land tax. The only large group who may require exemption or assistance would be retirees, however I would expect that superannuation (or even a universal income which may be possible given the increase in revenue) would account for this shortfall. It is also worth considering the impact on Māori land ownership more fully. A universally-applied land tax is a concrete implementation of the principle of stewardship of land rather than outright ownership. This is highly compatible with Māori concepts of communal ownership 3 and would provide some redress for the social inequality suffered by Māori as a direct consequence of land confiscation during and after the Treaty of Waitangi was signed. More recent return of lands to Māori provides an opportunity for productive use to fund a tax on these lands.

It is unfortunate that the TWG's terms of reference have constrained this excellent report and that these constraints have been repeated in the letter from Hon Grant Robertson to Hon Sir Michael Cullen dated 20th September 2018. I note, with appreciation, that the TWG will liaise with the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG). I believe this to be of the utmost importance because the analysis in this report is almost entirely limited to the financial effects of various options while the WEAG is charged with considering social and medical effects etc. The two matters are closely intertwined. For example, poverty begets stress, mental health problems, depression, physical violence and the like. There are then intergenerational effects. I, and many others, advocate Universal Basic Incomes as a way of ameliorating these problems. I have shown that there is at least one way of funding useful levels of UBI using an Asset Tax as an example of how to fund them. I will not elaborate here as my earlier submission has done so. However you have asked, on page 20 in number 3, to be told whether you had missed any important issues. Accordingly, I will give you my view on these. Also I suggest that, as an independent group, you are obliged in your final report to point out the contradiction between these constraints and the requirement in your terms of reference to report on a fair, balanced and equitable system of taxation. I made a submission on 3 April covering a number of these important, and other, issues. For convenience I will now append slightly modified remarks on some of these important issues. Taxation of Family Homes The idea of exempting family homes from various taxes, such as capital gains taxes, has an attractive emotional connotation but fails every test enumerated in the Submissions Background Paper - simplicity and efficiency, vertical equity, horizontal equity and fairness. Defining a family home for tax purposes is far from simple. Particularly with the evolving modern, complex, multiple marriages and associations. Witness the reports appendix B. This very complexity will be likely to lead to evasion, avoidance and inefficiency. It will be subject to many amendments and never-ending legal argument - particularly when dealing with family rearrangements, estates and bitter dissolutions. A tax dispensation for family homes will greatly reduce the tax base and result in reduced Government revenue. For any desired level of such revenue the burden will then fall on the homes that are not owned by the resident family. The burden will fall on the many who rent their homes. Those who have more get a dispensation which is not available to the less well off. Equity, both horizontal and vertical, is violated. Is this fair? Again, the value of properties varies enormously so any dispensation based on whether or not family homes are exempted has enormously different financial \[1\] 2 Treasury:4026978v1 effects. There are said to be “family homes” valued at some $20,000,000. For others their ‘family home” may be an old van. Vertical equity is violated by any taxation dispensation based on ownership of a family home. Is this fair? Anyone considering renting-out a property as a business investment rather than a speculation for capital gain will want to see a return on the investment. So taxes will have to be taken into account as part of the business plan. Taxes on housing will therefore affect rents or the maintenance and quality of the rental stock. This impacts the increasing proportion of those who rent and who may never be able to buy a home of their own. Retirement Savings. In my view there should be no discrimination between savings of various kinds. Why should calling something a retirement saving justify its being taxed differently from saving for a house or some unspecified purpose.? Especially as having one’s own house is so important for comfortable retirement? And if, as in the case of Kiwisaver, the retirement saving can be drawn upon to buy a house. Difficulties always arise from attempting to give something preference because it has a more, or less, appealing name but is predominately the same item or the same action. We are drowning in complexities and regulations attempting to target ever smaller manifestations of what are considered to be desirable or undesirable. There are many legal and taxation differences based on gender, marital or partnership arrangements, ethnicity, location, employment etc when the actions or events are, of themselves, identical. The results of this kind of differentiation can hardly be considered to be fair. Personal Tax System. There seems to me to be a great deal of confusion about our personal tax system. The letter referenced above reaffirms, on page 1, “...areas that are out of scope of the review .......increasing any income tax rate..........The adequacy of the personal tax system...” and, on page 2, “ We would like the Group to consider.....effective tax rates of individuals particular (sic) those in the top decile.” On page 7 of your interim report you say: ● The best mechanism to improve incomes for very low income households, for example, will be to increase welfare transfers. ● If the intention is to improve incomes for certain groups of low-to-middle- income earners (such as full-time workers on the minimum wage), then changes to the personal income rates and/ or thresholds will be more effective. So far as the first bullet point is concerned a better mechanism may be to simply make the benefits tax free. Applying the concepts of the second bullet point would further exacerbate inequality. In order to explain this I will here extract a part of the section "Why are the Poor poor?" of my main paper at https://perce.harpham.nz. Personal Income Tax A graph may help to understand what is a fairly complicated situation. 3 Treasury:4026978v1 Tax Rate versus Income On the left of the graph we have the percentage tax rate which applies for incomes as shown at the bottom. Thus, one can see that below 14,000 per year of income the tax rate is 10.5%. Between 14,000 and 48,000 it is 17.5%. Then another bracket with a rate of 30% and, finally, 33% applies regardless of how high the income may be. At first sight it is good to have lower rates for lower incomes. They are effectively exemptions from the top rate of 33%. But to get all the exemptions available one must have an income of $70,000/yr or above. Thus, I have shown on the graph above that if you only have an income of $14,000/yr then by paying 10.5% instead of the top rate of 33% you are better off by $3150/yr. And the reduction in the 17.5% bracket saves you a further $5270 per year with another $660/yr if you have an income of $70,000/yr or above. So, all the people on the top tax rate get a discount of a total of $9080/yr! What is demonstrated here is that with this sort of structure the more you have the more you get in the way of exemptions. The Poor get relatively poorer as in so many other ways. All the low tax exemptions that are given to the less well-off accrue to the better off also. I then go on to extoll the virtue of Universal Basic Incomes as a solution to this problem of a stepped level of Income Tax disadvantaging the poor in comparison to the wealthy. I also propose steps in the tax rate for higher incomes which apply to the whole income at each step so that the advantages at lower incomes do not propagate to the higher incomes. But whether or not my suggestions are thought to have merit for solutions to the problems of having a stepped Income tax rate the problem should not now be magnified further. Options for extending the taxation of capital income The discussion in the Interim Report and Appendix B is very valuable. Many of the matters discussed in Appendix B would be ameliorated by the risk-free rate of return approach. Largely for this reason that would be my choice. Always, as I note above, with the same treatment of all property – no exemptions for family homes. In this case risk- free is approaching my ( informed but inexpert) choice of an Asset Tax for my example of how to pay for Universal Basic Incomes. 4 Treasury:4026978v1 This Asset Tax would initially be based only on the improved value of property and collected with local body rates. I envisage no deduction for mortgages unless there is the complication of having the mortgagor pay their share – and, no doubt, recovering from the mortgagee. Otherwise there will be huge avoidance with owners possibly making investments in tax –havens or other entities which provide the mortgages. Moreover, the owner of the property is the user of the environmental resources that have gone into it. An advantage of the risk free system as enunciated is that the deemed income is treated as income so that those on a lower rate of income tax pay less. However, if my UBI ideas for most people to be on the same rate of income tax were to be adopted then their UBI would cover the same issue. This raises a more general matter. One person's tax or other exemption is anothers tax or penalty. I believe that a principle for a fair tax system must be that - When Government makes payments to people they must be the same for ALL people of the same age and taxes must be proportional to both the income and the wealth of individuals. Company Tax The report does not address one of the major reasons for increasing inequality. This is the difference in taxation for companies and individuals. Those who are sufficiently well-off or sufficiently knowledgable get the benefit of companies being taxed on profit whereas individuals are taxed on income. Apart from numerous smaller matters companies can deduct the costs of fulfilling their function and continuing to do so but ordinary workers cannot. To be on a comparable footing the worker should be able to deduct the "living wage" from their income for tax purposes. This is clearly financially impractical with conventional thinking but a Universal Basic Income can be afforded at a level to make a significant move in this direction. Greater Transparency and Accountability for Government. At 17.6 there is a call for " Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government." And in Appendix B, no 2 we have: "The Government’s objective is to have a tax system that:.......... • supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30% of GDP;" These two things seem to me to be in conflict because the practical relevance of the objective in the second statement is obscure. This statement deserves comment or explanation in order to maintain trust in the tax system and Government itself. My reasons for this disquiet are:  The recent historical level has been shown to lead to the run down and near collapse of many Government services.  GDP is itself a hotch-potch of many kinds of expenditure.  Countries, such as Denmark, run successfully with over 50% of GDP as Government expenditure.  The measure of Government expenditure is the collection of many items known as the OBEGAL. Capital expenditures or recoveries ( as by selling Housing Corporation or other assets) and SOEs are excluded. 5 Treasury:4026978v1  The OBEGAL also includes superannuation and other benefits totalling over 20% of the total. These Government costs are fundamentally different from the expenditures needed to run the Government administration and services. In order to pay benefits money is collected from some people and given to others to spend as they need or see fit. The spending of benefit monies is not under the control of Government departments but of the individual beneficiaries.  One of the consequences of mistakenly including benefit costs in the OBEGAL is that one way to give the appearance of good management by meeting the chosen measure is to reduce the payments to beneficiaries either overtly or covertly. It would be a simple matter to separate the cost of benefits from the OBEGAL and to report these separately as a percentage of GDP. To the extent that such percentages are meaningful transparency and accountability would be greatly improved.

First, it is good to note that common sense has generally overridden ideology in preparation of the report, but this is also no less than I would expect from such a group. This appropriate outcome can be reflected in the conclusions reached, for example, on GST, as well as the Tax Working Group dismissing other possibilities such as wealth and financial transaction taxes. Referencing my earlier submission, there remain two matters that I wish to provide additional comment upon under the following headings. • Capital Income Taxation • Kiwisaver and Taxation of Savings The submission content follows. Capital Income Taxation I am pleased to see that the interim report recognizes, among other things, the points raised in my first submission that a capital income tax fails to meet the generally acknowledged theoretical requirements supporting such a tax because: • There must be exemptions to gain political acceptance (e.g. the family residence, which will simply continue to exacerbate over-investment in housing) • The tax can only be applied on asset realisation, as an accruals basis is simply not practical on large value assets without forcing sale to meet the accrual tax • Roll over relief may be required for some assets • Taxation is generally (and inappropriately) applied to gains unadjusted for inflation • Assets may have to be periodically valued, increasing costs • Tax returns become more complicated, reducing the benefits of simplification already achieved in New Zealand I reiterate that, surely, this is the fundamental reason why New Zealand has not previously introduced such a tax and, I am sure, remains the fundamental reason why New Zealand should continue not to do so. While appreciating the equity or fairness questions posed around such a tax, emphasized in some recent public presentations, I request that the Tax Working Group not lose sight of the simplicity (compliance and administration costs and certainty) and efficiency standards that also need to be considered. 3 If this Tax Working Group, in contrast to previous such groups, does decide to recommend such a tax, my expectation is that the Tax Working Group will include appropriate analysis as to the simplicity and efficiency effects alongside analysis relating to fairness. Finally, you can note the second bullet point above outlining that such a tax can only realistically be applied on asset realisation to ensure cash flow is available to pay the tax. On this basis, the second RFRM option being considered by the Tax Working Group can be dismissed. I am therefore also surprised to see that the Tax Working Group is considering recommending retention of the FDR regime for foreign share investments. If a Capital Income Tax is introduced, I oppose retention of the FDR regime in that circumstance. KiwiSaver and Taxation of Savings I refer to the inequity and other negative issues around KiwiSaver identified by the Tax Working Group and the Chairman. I trust that you will recall the suggestion in my first submission that one solution to address this would be to scrap KiwiSaver. However, assuming that KiwiSaver remains, I am pleased to see that the Tax Working Group is proposing direct help to the lower income groups through, for example, suggesting removal of the tax impost on employer contributions for such groups. This is directly in line with my earlier submission comment that Government may need to provide some form of direct support to certain groups to assist in removing or reducing the inequity that the Chairman, in particular, has publicly expressed concern about. On the question of differential taxation of savings more broadly, I acknowledge the complexity and I look forward to the Tax Working Group continuing to focus on how to reduce such differentials, even while maintaining or enhancing, simplicity, fairness and efficiency.

To the people and the Political Party who promised NOT to increase Tax in a effort to win an Election! My name is Alan Hejl. living in Tuakau, Waikato I am a simple man trying to live within my means and prosper. With the limited resources I have (money) I am trying to get ahead in my life and working for my eventual retirement. I do not live a hedonistic life, only purchase items I can afford, meaning I never place items on credit. I do not drink alcohol, I do not buy over priced and over rated coffee from the various establishments profiting from a flavored drink. I eat very simply, I've not had a restaurant meal for a few years now. (True!) Simply put I save as much as possible, with no real luxury items, a humble home. The last few years I have focused all my time and money in purchasing a house and property which has the potential to sub-divide. This will be part of my "Retirement Fund" among other savings including "Kiwi Saver" In this capitalist country we live in, to make money you must have money in excess or work for it hard. I have and am working hard all my life and the government and local council try even harder to come up with new ways to take it off me to finance a Idealistic fantasy world in which New Zealand will save the world by employing environmental policy's Has members of the government not watched TV and read the reports from around the world where most Third World Countries and China burn huge amounts of coal and emit huge carbon emissions. Little New Zealand will never be able to off set this pollution. So why are we expected to be taxed with the various schemes to save the planet. I understand we need to help. A bit off topic but does force introduction of new and increased Taxes and a overall increase in all day to day necessities of life. With the future introduction off a high Capital Gains Tax in my case you are proposing to slash my future retirement fund by one third. 33%. As I labour to build up this retirement fund I pay Tax on my income to pay for my property, I pay Tax (GST) on all the materials to improve this property to a modern living standard with the basic necessities. I pay tax to the local council to live in it. Now you want me to pay another tax on my hard unpaid work and my unpaid labour when it comes to the time I am forced to sell the property to pay for my retirement and eventual death which will also be taxed after I am dead. With this system of wealth and taxes of course the wealthy are the least affected in any tax increase who are also very good at avoiding paying taxes! It is the relative poor and middle class who really finance the running of this country. So in summary, Live up to your PROMISES during the election in regard to NOT placing more tax burden on the public. I disagree with any new Taxes as it will slash my humble future life style. The Government must learn to live within it's means as all hard working New Zealander's must do. STOP pandering to the people profiteering from the enforced Maorification of New Zealand's European and non Maori immigrants and their descendants, which also force increased government expenditure "Increased Taxes" Make all entities; Maori owned companies, Iwi owned companies, It should not matter which race or who owns a profit making company. They all should pay the same taxes! It should not matter which race one identifies with. We all live in the same country and we all should be treated equally! \[1\] 2 W e should ALL be subjected to the same tax system! Fair and equatable! Regards Alan Hejl \[1\]

This is an edited version of the NZ Taxpayers Union template. This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Maori Authorities and charities \[1\] 2 New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I would like to see a full and final settlement of all treaty greivences instead of Maori being handed crumbs while we are forced to endure endless Maori cultural indoctrination at satuaration levels so they are alway in the spotlight and having to beg for money. Instead of 5 Iwi holding a 50 billion dollar purse between them I would like to see a fair distribution of money to all Maori who need a handup for education, health and housing purposes. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. It is the middle class who are the soft target here and who already by default pay most of the countries tax. In NZ it is almost impossible to live on the pension alone when one retires, so the challenge therefore is to work really hard like I have and buy an investment property to supplement ones pension and on that basis life will at least be comfortable although certainly not luxurious or expansive. The middle class already get hammered by tax bracket creep, whereby inflation pushes their incomes up and into a higher tax bracket which is a disincentive in itself, meaning why bother to work hard if you are only going to lose it in high taxation? The capital gains tax is potentially so punitive that it threatens to destroy the lives of those people who have aquired a single investment property as will force many of them to sell their properties which in turn will result in a sales glut and prices will drop like a stone so they will take a seriuos dou ble whammy hit. In my understanding as this is proposed, if I own an investment property and through no fault of my own its value rises by $120 thousand dollars in one year, which is not by any means unusual, I will have to pay about $40,000 in capital gains tax, which would be its entire rental income return for the year! There is no way I could pay this so I would have no choice but to sell it. There would be no point in owning it because it would give me no income at all after I paid this draconian tax. I have worked hard all my life and paid my tax by the due date every month and have never been part of any tax avoidance scheme. I had to rebuild my business five times due to big changes in government legislation such as tarrif changes, noise control, alcohol regulation changes and then the ACC amalamation that forced me to start again each time. The amagamtion cost us $150,000 in lost revenue! Further, due to a heart condition I have had to pay for private medica l insurance for as far back as I can remember and we put both our kids through a private school as our daughter was ruthlessly harrased at primary school. Neither of these expenses were tax deductible, so my burden on the government has been far less than zero. I have also collected and paid GST since it came into force on time every time. I submit that the Government should not implement such a draconian tax on people who are only using a single invrestment property to supplemnent their pension income. Taxes on savings 3 We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. I support the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, but no other form of additional tax on food products. I would like to see GST removed from basic food items that stimulate good health and webeing. I oppose varying GST for different products. I support an increases to tobacco excise. Beyond edited the points I have made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely,

Concerns in relation to the tentative direction of the TWG in relation to capital gains tax. • Section 6, para. 20 Identifies the lock in effect and economic efficiency costs in terms of the role a CGT may have in constraining (distorting) savings and investment. • Evidence that economic growth is not affected in any observable sense by the incidence or rate of CGT seems to place the theoretical burden on those linking CGT (or CGT rate increases) to costs in terms of savings, investment and lock in 1 . • In terms of qualifying Section 6, para. 20, I submit the following: • The lock in effect is overstated. It appears to have negligible implications. If it sets demand for marginally sub-optimal investments at a level higher than a frictionless, non-distortionary market would support, it might be expected to herd new investment into those higher risk, higher marginal return investments, and mitigating growth implications. Further, evidence of the lock-in effect is substantially US based. As the US re-sets the asset price of inherited capital to the fair value at the point of inheritance, this substantially aggravates the lock-in effect. Moreover, the US system historically has been quite unstable, subject to numerous rule and rate changes. This further elevates the likelihood of lock-in under certain conditions. It seems more compelling as evidence for system stability, rather than against CGT simpliciter. • Savings and investment: The theoretical link between CGT and the rate of CGT and investment must, presumably, have economic growth implications if it is to be presented as a substantial objection to the implementation of a CGT. As empirical evidence strongly supports the position that no such economic growth implications have been observed, we have to conclude that either a. other contributions to aggregate demand are uniformly supportive of economic growth or, more plausibly, a CGT has no implications for savings and investment. It is no less plausible that reduced investment returns will compel the taxpayer to save and invest more, to achieve a given level of future income. As the bog standard neo-classicalist runs the story, CGT reduces returns, reducing incentives to save, reducing investing, reducing capital accumulation, reducing productivity, reducing growth in salaries and wages. It has been such an intuitively compelling, ‘obviously logical’ argument that it is generally considered common sense. Importantly, it presupposes that the current net saver will, under a CGT, proceed to consume more currently, being satisfied with less future income, so not only do they save less, they get a lesser return on what they do save, and all to consume more than their already satisfactory (saving out of unallocated 1 Leonard Burman and David White “Taxing Capital gains in New Zealand: Assessment and Recommendations” A Paper prepared for the Tax Working Group 2009; K.

This runs counter to central theoretical tenants regarding economic agents inclination to smooth their income. In response to tentative proposals, please note the following concerns: • The problems associated with the RFRM method have been raised but not fully expounded. I am not going to detail those identified already except to observe that the lower indicated necessity for accurate valuation in relation to this method is not clearly argued for. Surely, the RFRM method would effectively tax the largest part of an asset’s value, assuming relatively stable asset prices but how does this translate into a benefit in terms of administrative or compliance costs? Equally, it is not clear how this lesser need would manifest practically. Would the asset-owning taxpayer be allowed to interpolate valuation changes, for example, 5 yearly valuations? It is not clear that the impost on valuation accuracy under RFRM is any lesser than, for example under an actual accruals’ based system. • Secondly, in light of the weight given in the Interim Report to economic efficiency effects, it seems likely that the uncritical acceptance of those efficiency concerns may have played too great a role in determining the RFRM preference. Beyond this, it makes the case for CGT per se less singularly sound than it actually is. I think the TWG should be more explicit in subsequent reports in stating that the overwhelming weight of equity and efficiency considerations lend their support to the taxation of capital gains. • Thirdly, RFRM does not tax all income. It is unclear why the tax system should tax other than the capital gain. Conceptually, this is equivalent to taxing labour income at the level of the minimum wage, allowing that incremental human capital acquisition should go untaxed. In this sense, it seems the TWG has been too sensitive to revenue volatility in relation to variable revenue flows over the business cycle. It would be considerably more practical to impose some prudential requirement on government to use CGT receipts counter-cyclically so that they could operate as an automatic stabiliser. The argument that the RFRM would deliver the same ‘risk-adjusted return’ as actual capital gains is not correct. This only arises if risk is viewed narrowly as volatility. Over extended periods, risky assets have higher yields. Allowing that the government will, de facto, have an extensively diversified portfolio of risky assets (in the taxpayer base), idiosyncratic risk is substantially mitigated. Only if we define the differential returns as the ‘rent’ associated with risk, do we achieve an equality. That is just one measure of risk. It really is the risk of a trader. • On the basis of these concerns it seems a realisation basis, based on actual values, is optimal. The risk free return method ignores a great portion of the capital gain, and provides two competing forces, one that prefers relatively lower risk income generating assets and one which favours very risky, high potential return assets. It’s not clear what the net effect will be of these competing incentives.

I am an accountant in public practice and a member of CPA Australia. Adam Smith wrote that taxation should be predictable, convenient and efficient and I would concur with that sentiment. A capital gains regime is unlikely to satisfy any of those criteria. A CGT levied on the sale of assets would likely be a very slow burn in terms of revenue received by the Government. The interim report makes this clear. This leaves the possibility of a tax on unrealised gains, the so called “risk-free return method”. Whilst this might make theoretical sense, in that inflows of revenue would be more certain and constant, I’m sure that there would be no political will to implement it. It would be neither convenient nor efficient to collect tax on a pay-as-you-go basis for capital gains. It would have perverse impacts on individual investors and investment generally. Assuming that a CGT on unrealised gains is rejected, any CGT would be a valuer’s dream. All assets would need to be valued once the scheme begins, although presumably legislation could be enacted that saw certain asset classes phased in. The cost involved in this for taxpayers would be significant. I cannot think of any other tax that would impose such entry costs. The alternative, to only consider assets purchased after any CGT was implemented, would not in anyway meet any objective standard of fairness and would impact younger generations. It is inevitable that residential rentals would rise with the introduction of a CGT. It is also likely that commercial rents would rise too. Both types of property would also likely increase in value. I’m certain that the Government’s intention in introducing a CGT would be to moderate residential property prices but there is absolutely no certainty that a CGT would achieve this. International experience suggests that the contrary may well be true. If de miminis exemptions are considered, I’m certain that would provide an even greater boon for my profession. I also harbour fears that shares and businesses will be hit hard with any CGT and will perversely decrease the appetite for risk. It is clear that any CGT would be complex and would not meet the test of convenience or efficiency. It is my contention that the Working Group should reject any form of CGT, as previous tax reform groups have. If there are issues of fairness to be addressed, this could be much better achieved through welfare, or by reducing the marginal tax rates for low income earners. Alternatively, rules along the lines of the bright line test could be extended to other asset classes.

Zealand \[1\] The EMA has considered the points raised in the interim report and wishes to make the following  comments:  Capital and Wealth  While not opposed to a capital gains tax, we do consider that any such tax must be fully balanced against  capital loss and should also take account of inflationary over  normal CPI growth within the economy. This  is effectively risk free rate of return however we do also understand that this may become unduly  complicated if implemented.  We also would point out that under existing tax law, where currently an investor is deliberately investing  for the purpose of capital gain  then that gain is already liable for income tax. Trading in shares for this  purpose does incur such a tax and historical tax cases post 1987, also show that losses that occurred when  tax had been paid were able to be claimed.  Under the current brightline test it is effectively a  capital gains tax on property unless the property is  held for an extended period to address the issue of speculation. The historical argument against capital  gain is that a rental property is acquired for rental income and that income is taxable. If capital gains is  applied to property then the  brightline test becomes irrelevant and should be repealed.  The EMA believes that if capital gains taxes are applied to investment tools such as shares then the  converse of losses must equally be applied when this occurs.  If such loss offsets are available across a wide capture capital gains tax, then it  must include property.   We accept this has significant ramifications to the tax base in the event of a major property crash such  as 1989 and given historically there are defined cycles to property price inflation and deflation.  We are however strongly opposed to the imposition of a continuous application of  the capital gain  obligation when assets have not been realised with that capital gain. Such application would impose an  unnecessary tax burden on business and investors. Application of the tax if imposed must only be at the  time the gain is realised.  Kiwisaver is by its nature a speculator for capital  gain on shares and other wealth creating tools and we  would see that if a capital gains tax is applied then there can be no exemptions as this could create an  uneven investing platform against non Kiwisaver managed funds and other investors.  Retirement Savings  We question why there should be  a cap on the Kiwisaver employer contribution in the recommendations  when that contribution is generally part of the total remuneration package negotiated with the employer  and higher earning individuals may choose to opt out of Kiwisaver to receive the equivalent amount  directly enabling them to focus other investments.  Housing Affordability  It  could be argued that this is no longer an issue due to the brighline test and that the current property  cycle appears to have peaked.  If we look to markets such as Australia where a capital gains tax has been applied for a considerable  period, we do not see capital  gains as having a significant effect on housing affordability compared to pure  supply and demand. We see the same type of cycles within the Australian capital cities as are seen within  New Zealand.  As such we do not believe this provides a strong argument for capital gains on property and other  arguments would need to be made for a capital gains tax.  Environmental  and Ecological Outcomes  It may be argued that we already have taxes in place with the ETS and Waste levy being applied. The  question should however be made that if such taxes are put in place, how would they actually alter the  outcomes in way that is desired.  The current  waste levy is under spent in spite of some exemptions being applied and has yet to  demonstrate significant outcomes that are beneficial to the environment. The intention that councils who  receive 50% of this levy would create new ecological projects and boost recycling has yet to be seen and  the lack  of deployment of the other 50% held by the Ministry raises significant question on whether any  other environmental taxes would have value.  The current ETS is in our opinion adequate and extension of it would harm significant parts of our economy  without benefits to New Zealand’s contribution to greenhouse gases  reduction. Simply it adds cost  without achieving change and places the viability of some significant businesses in jeopardy.  Corrective taxes  We do not take a position on corrective taxes but do note that such taxes can impact society by increasing  the willingness to undertake criminal activities in order to obtain cheaply  those products affected by them.  Such activities can place small business owners are significant personal risk of harm.  International Income Tax  We support a continued move to negotiated double taxation agreements as this does provide tax  certainty for New Zealand based business who choose to invest outside of New Zealand  in order to expand  their global footprint in taking New Zealand products and services to the world.  GST  The EMA endorses the groups recommendation that GST should remain on all goods and services as this  retains the integrity of the tax system and for business keeps it simple. The application of  exemptions as  applied in other markets such as Australia adds cost and complexity for businesses and can make it difficult  to establish where the line is drawn between some products.  We note that there is no current suggestion for the application of GST within Financial transactions,  however the point is  worth discussion. We believe that in the context of fees and other non‐interest  transactions, it would be possible to apply GST however, the offset would be to allow financial institutions  to recover GST on their inputs which may negate any potential gain.  The bigger issue is whether an effective replacement  for GST would be a financial transaction tax and if  so how such as tax might be applied. We believe there is value in discussion around this but are not of the  opinion it should be advanced at this point in time as such a tax may encourage a move  back to the cash  economy.  The application of GST for all cross border services regardless of value is supported however the method  currently proposed does raise concerns that some international players will reject New Zealand as too  small to bother complying with. We have already seen this applied in Australia with the Amazon decision.  We also  note that while major services like Netflix do comply with the existing law there are significant  numbers of smaller service and software providers that may cross the threshold but do not easily come  to the attention of IRD as they do not deliberately market into New Zealand.  We believe the  same may apply for goods once this change is applied and Customs will not have the  resources to effectively check and provide that data to IRD.  Personal Income and the Future of Work  The EMA does not support any increase in the top level of tax applied to personal income. New  Zealand  can struggle to attract top talent for positions and any increase would in the end either result in increased  cost or not getting the best person for key roles when recruiting in the global market place.  The current top level of tax comes into force a relatively low threshold  and therefore this tax level hits the  recruitment of trades people, educators and technical experts. An increase would provide an additional  challenge to New Zealand businesses and even government in trying to attract the best people.  The encouragement of full tax compliance by the self‐employed is endorsed however, we do  not accept  that this can be solved by adding withholding tax obligations on businesses who engage independent  contractors.   Such obligations could become a nightmare for a business who engages for example, a sole trader  electrician and then needs to obtain a tax number, pay GST on the invoice and perhaps  then hold and pay  withholding tax to IRD.  If this example were to become reality, then business might cease to engage a competitive sole trader in  favour of a larger registered company which would harm the sole traders opportunity to maintain a  working SME business.  We are also aware that the  majority of the Direct Selling industry which provides an FTE of 5000 people  under the independent contractor status would be significantly impacted if withholding tax was required  when there is no employment type relationship and in many cases a pure buy/sell activity. We believe  there will be other sectors who  may be equally impacted should such a change be mandated.  The EMA strongly rejects the suggestions to treat dependent contractors as employees as set out in points  13.5 and 13.6 of the recommendations. They are not employees and we see such as suggestion as implying  that employee obligations would then fall  on the business who engages them around holidays, ACC and  Kiwisaver.  Most dependent contractors have chosen to be a contractor for the purposes of personal flexibility around  children or other obligations fill a particular need for business. Removing GST for those contractors will  impact on their cost structure but will  in our opinion not result in any increase in GST revenue overall. For  those currently over the GST threshold, it will result in them sitting in a very grey area when they are  currently clearly defined as not being an employee but working for themselves.    Recommendation 13.5 also indicates a review should be taken on GST for dependent contractors. We  have seen a similar review undertaken in Australia around the ABN, which has seen for example graphic  designers who work from home on a project by project basis suddenly having their ABN revoked and  unable to  continue to work as a contractor.   We do not believe that a review of GST for dependent contractors should be allowed to have a similar  impact in New Zealand and the follow of this is the suggestion in 13.6 of employee obligations for the  business who engages them.  The Taxation  of Business  The EMA supports a reduction of company tax and we note this has not been supported by the Tax  Working Groups recommendations. We believe that for a country that engages globally the level of tax  applied should be internationally competitive in order to continue to attract international investment.  The  other points from 14.1 to 14.9 in the recommendations are accepted and we particularly support the  recommendation to lift the provisional tax thresholds.  The Integrity of the Tax System  The EMA strongly rejects the recommendation in 15.2 that, a shareholder should need to provide a  security to IRD for a  company related debt. This is an unjustified impost on the deployment of capital and  raises the question of what happens if the shareholder is unable or unwilling to provide that security. Does  the business then face liquidation by the IRD?  It also raises the question of who decides whether there is  a likelihood that the debt will not be paid in  order to require this security for the IRD?  The need to identify the hidden economy through better labour reporting is supported in principle  however, we recognise this may be difficult to achieve other than from proactive enforcement by IRD.  The  suggestions made in 15.5 are strongly rejected by the EMA. We do not believe that directors should  be made personally liable for arrears in PAYE or GST unless there is clear evidence in the case of a single  director company that the arrears are directly attributable that director and subject to  penalties under  the respective legislation.  We believe the application of this liability along with departure prohibition orders (travel ban) would have  serious implications for directors serving on a number of companies. In relation to a departure prohibition  order a director who has a legitimate purpose for travel on behalf of  another company, would effectively  be unable to act on behalf of that other business.  These suggestions negate the purpose of a limited liability company and will make directors reluctant to  take on smaller companies as independent directors.  The EMA has significant concern around the creation of a crown debt collection agency  and would  question why the use of commercial debt collectors are not used if collection is not currently effective  within the crown agencies.  Such a crown debt collection agency will undoubtedly be granted powers outside of commercial debt  collection and when for example a debt is applied by IRD to a director as suggested we believe this to  highly one sided.  We believe that the respective agencies do have sufficient ability to pursue debts  and should any no t then  the use of a licensed commercial agency operating under specific rules is more appropriate.                                Signed on the behalf on the EMA,      Kim Campbell / Chief Executive

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Federated Farmers welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback to the Tax Working Group (TWG) on its Future of Tax interim report. 1.2 Federated Farmers congratulates the working group on producing a very thoughtful and well-written document. The interim report sets out very clearly a number of key challenges to the tax system and discusses options in an objective, even-handed manner. 1.3 We support a number of the interim report’s recommendations, such as not to proceed with a wealth tax, land tax, exemptions from GST, change to the income tax and imputation structure, and a financial transactions tax. We are pleased that the Government has (in its 20 September 2018 letter) agreed that the TWG should not carry out any further work on those issues. 1.4 Federated Farmers acknowledges the interim report’s discussion on extending the taxation of capital income (chapter 6) and changes to the tax system to support better environmental and ecological outcomes (chapter 9). Our feedback will focus mainly on those two issues although we will also provide some brief comment on the recommendations for business taxation (chapter 14). 1.5 In particular (and this is not a comprehensive list of the suggestions in this document), we ask that further attention be given to:  Roll-over relief for capital gains tax (CGT);  Double taxation of capital gains, in particular where land is the major component of the company’s asset;  Compliance cost implications of a CGT; and  A wider, whole-of-government view of a framework for environmental questions. 1.6 Federated Farmers would welcome the opportunity to have further engagement with the TWG. 2. EXTENDING THE TAXATION OF CAPITAL INCOME 2.1 Chapter 6 of the interim report discusses capital and wealth. For the reasons set out in our submission to the background paper, Federated Farmers agrees with the TWG’s decision not to recommend either a land tax or a wealth tax. We welcome the Government’s direction to the TWG not to carry out any further work on those issues. 2.2 With regard to extending the taxation of capital income, two options have been put: 1. Extending the tax net – realised gains; and 2. Risk-free rate of return method. 2.3 We will discuss both options in turn, but before doing so we would like to remind the Group of the key points on capital gains tax from our earlier submission: (a) Federated Farmers supports the current taxation regime that provides the ability to tax the earnings of individuals and firms that are in the business of 3 trading property but we are opposed to a ‘comprehensive’ capital gains tax (CGT). Our opposition is both philosophical and pragmatic. There are considerable challenges in making a capital gains tax workable. These include:  How to deal with double taxation or double losses (caused by capital gains and losses in the company being reflected in the share price, which is also subject to CGT) \[this is particularly acute for farming companies, which are typically tightly held, and where land is a major component of farming companies’ assets (the other major asset is typically livestock – expanded on below)\];  How to deal with livestock Herd Scheme gains and losses which are currently regarded as being on capital account \[expanded on below\];  How to index gains so the inflation component is not taxed (the same issues currently exist with income tax on revenue account property and monies on deposit for interest) \[we understand that this might not be progressed\]; and  How to deal with roll-over relief for intra-family and intra-group company transactions and for transactions involving Maori land and its owners. (b) The ‘KISS’ (keep it simple ....) principle should apply. If there is a particular problem about ‘speculation’, then perhaps the bright-line test might be a better solution. (c) Without prejudice, we submit that no commitment to a CGT should be made until it has been established that the practical concerns can be addressed in a manner that is appropriate in the New Zealand context. This includes the need to keep compliance costs low. 2.4 These points have to a varying degree been touched upon in the interim report but are by no means resolved. Federated Farmers remains opposed to extending the taxation of capital income and we do not consider the interim report provides convincing reasons to alter our view. As it works towards its final report the TWG has much to do to resolve the points we have raised and raise below. Extending the tax net – realised gains What to Tax 2.5 Notwithstanding our opposition to extending the taxation of capital income, Federated Farmers agrees that ‘what to tax’ should be targeted in order to minimise the increase in the tax system’s complexity and in the costs of compliance and administration. That said, we remain concerned that any extension will increase complexity. The greater the extension beyond current boundaries the more complexity and cost there will be both for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 2.6 We note that Appendix B, which outlines more detailed design features, defines the ‘family home exclusion’. We note that on most farms there will be a ‘family home’ for the owner. The Interim Report suggests an exclusion applying to the land the house sits on, up to the greater of 4,500 m 2 or the amount required for the reasonable occupation and enjoyment of the house (i.e., house and curtilage). This threshold will probably be appropriate in most cases but working out the area and value of a farm’s ‘family home’ will increase complexity and compliance costs. We note the observation that some family homes will be owned by companies. This is particularly the case in the farming sector. 4 When to Tax 2.7 In terms of ‘when to tax’, Federated Farmers would be strongly opposed to an accrual- based tax where tax is payable at the end of a period even if the asset is not disposed of during that period. We agree with the discussion on valuation challenges, cash-flow pressures, and perceptions of unfairness raised in the interim report. These issues would be particularly acute for farming. 2.8 A realisation-based tax would be a better approach but as mentioned in the interim report, this runs the risk of encouraging ‘lock-in’ to postpone or avoid the tax liability on sale. Notwithstanding this, we agree that rollover relief would be necessary. As mentioned in our earlier submission, in the farming context rollover relief should be allowed for a ‘similar asset swap’ (for example selling a stepping stone farm and buying another farm to ‘trade up’) and for inter-generational farm sales (to assist with family farm succession). These forms of rollover relief would address two of our practical concerns with a capital gains tax. 2.9 A third concern is the double taxation that could occur when both the shares in a company and assets of the company are subject to CGT. This will be particularly stark for companies where land is the major component of the companies’ asset, which would include farming companies. A simple solution might be to exempt shares in such companies from a CGT, and rely on taxing the underlying assets. Alternatively, where there is a 100% change of shareholding the asset base in the company should be reset. Under this alternative the problem is where share parcels of less than 100% are sold. Livestock 2.10 We note the comments in the interim report about the rules for taxing livestock and how extending the taxation of capital income would apply to livestock taxed under the herd scheme. We agree that this needs very careful consideration. Some background and history on livestock taxation follows. 2.11 Livestock tax has always been a complex and fraught issue. Livestock is not like a shop’s trading stock which is valued at a fixed point of time and where changes in value over the year are taxable. While taking such an approach for livestock might on the face of it seem simple, doing so would neglect the biological nature of the business where animals have the qualities of both a capital ‘machine’ and the product of a machine. 2.12 Major economic reforms, including to tax, were undertaken in the mid-1980s, and livestock tax was no exception. In December 1985 the Government announced major changes which came into effect following the passage of a 1986 Tax Bill. These changes involved the introduction of a ‘herd scheme’ and a modified standard value system called the ‘trading stock scheme’. This has since been changed to a cost- based regime called ‘national standard cost. Livestock valued under the national standard cost regime are treated as ordinary trading stock. Accordingly, they are not further discussed. 2.13 For livestock in the herd scheme, changes in national average market value (herd scheme values) from year to year are treated as being on capital account and are not subject to tax. In a company net herd scheme gains are treated exactly the same as other capital profits/losses. The introduction of a general CGT on business assets changes this herd scheme capital profits dynamic. 5 2.14 Federated Farmers would like to be involved in addressing this issue. How to Tax 2.15 In terms of ‘how to tax’, in order to ‘keep it simple’, capital gains taxation should be calculated and collected in the same way as currently applies for disposals of revenue account property, with costs able to be deducted at the time of sale to arrive at a net capital gain. Compliance costs 2.16 Appendix B also discusses other design issues such as how to treat capital expenditure, capital losses, transitional rules, as well as issues around taxation of:  Shares in foreign companies;  Non-residents;  Partnerships and look-through companies;  Companies;  New Zealand shareholders in New Zealand tax resident companies;  Trusts;  KiwiSaver and other managed investment entities; and  Corporate groups. 2.17 The extensive discussion of these issues only serves to reinforce how complex it would be to extend the taxation of capital income. The question it poses is would the added complexity and administration and compliance costs be worth the extra revenue? Although Table 6.2 on page 41 suggests that annual revenue will rise over time to around $6 billion in 2030/31, the projections are (as stated in the commentary), heavily design and detail dependent. For example, they do not take into account rollover relief which is likely to be essential to its workability let alone acceptability. 2.18 Further, the compliance costs of the planned introduction, which requires all assets to be valued at the date of the introduction, is compliance cost intensive, and will lead to valuation debates. For land and improvements rateable values cannot be relied upon and these valuations are always subjective. The alternative to this compliance cost intensive and uncertain process is to apply a CGT to assets acquired after the introduction date at values of acquisition from third parties. This would ensure that the CGT cost base is correct and would significantly decrease the compliance costs of the introduction of a CGT. Risk-free rate of return method 2.19 Under the risk-free rate of return method, the taxable income would be calculated by applying a deemed ‘risk-free rate’ to the equity held by the owner in the asset (i.e., the value of the asset net of any borrowings) with the result then taxed against the taxpayer’s marginal rate. The tax would be paid every year as opposed to when the asset is sold. 2.20 As discussed above Federated Farmers would be strongly opposed to what would effectively be a ‘capital tax’. We agree with the difficulties outlined in the Interim Report. There are would be challenges (and costs) for farmers having to make annual asset valuations and for many farmers there would be serious cash flow difficulties, especially in years of low farmgate prices and/or adverse weather events, such as droughts, that impact on production. 6 3. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES 3.1 Federated Farmers agrees that New Zealanders’ wellbeing is inextricably linked to the wellbeing of our natural environment. With close to half of New Zealand’s land area in agriculture farmers are important stewards of our land and water resources. From a business perspective it is in farmers’ interest to manage these resources in a sustainable manner and it is also important to recognise that most farmers have strong social and cultural links to their land and care deeply for it. 3.2 A large and growing number of farmers have been taking action to address their environmental impacts and this has been driven by market demands and by stronger government policy and regulation in response to public perceptions. Progress is being made, as discussed in our earlier submission. Farmers, like all New Zealanders are realising that many of the practices of the past are no longer acceptable. 3.3 In saying this Federated Farmers is not downplaying the need for ongoing actions to improve environmental and ecological outcomes. As we said in our earlier submission we consider it inappropriate to consider tax in isolation as ‘the solution’ to environmental issues. Like the environment itself, consideration of how to care for the environment is complex and has a number of layers to it. Further, a number of environmental aspects, including those discussed in the background paper and elaborated on in the interim report, are being dealt with by other policy and regulation. 3.4 Federated Farmers is pleased the interim report’s discussion recognises these points. We agree with its comment on page 61 that ‘taxation is not necessarily be the best tool to change behaviour’ and that ‘sometimes it may be more effective for the Government to consider regulation or spending’. We endorse the approach that ‘the merits of tax as a policy instrument should be assessed together with the merits of other tools and approaches’. 3.5 Federated Farmers also agrees that a framework approach should be used for considering taxation of negative environmental externalities. However, in saying this there must be one whole-of-government framework that guides all consideration (whether it is tax or regulation or whatever) of the various responses to environmental issues. While the proposed draft framework in Box 9.1 on page 63 appears reasonable in a taxation context, a wider coordinated whole-of-government context is even more important. 3.6 It is also concerning that there is a lack of consideration in the framework of the need to minimise administration and compliance costs from the proposed tax framework is, we feel, a glaring omission. Box 9.2 contains principles for taxing natural resources use does include a principle on administrative complexity but that does not explicitly extend to compliance costs. ‘Opportunities’ for environmental taxation 3.7 Several ‘opportunities’ have been identified for environmental taxation. All have been or are currently subject to policy work that seek to improve environmental outcomes:  Greenhouse gas emissions; and  Water pollution;  Water abstraction; 7  Solid waste; and  Road transport. 3.8 On greenhouse gas emissions, there has been a particularly large amount of policy work, for example the Productivity Commission Inquiry into a Low Emissions Economy; the Zero Carbon Bill consultation; the work of the Interim Climate Change Committee on whether and if so how agricultural biological emissions should be included in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS); and reviews into Improvements to the ETS and Forestry and the ETS. It is likely that this work will result in New Zealand adopting an ambitious emissions reduction target and making changes to the ETS that delivers a much higher emissions price. 3.9 Water issues have also been subject to much work through the Land and Water Forum and policy work as set out in the Government’s 8 October 2018 ‘Essential Freshwater’ policy announcement. ‘Essential Freshwater’ is likely to result in stricter regulation on water quality and water allocation (e.g., an amended National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management and other regulation) as well as stricter compliance, monitoring and enforcement activity. 3.10 On water quality (i.e., pollution), Federated Farmers agrees with the Group’s assessment that ‘tax instruments are not well suited to all water pollution issues’. On water allocation (i.e., abstraction), we also agree that this ‘is a particularly challenging policy area in New Zealand, owing to a range of different interest in the resources’, including Maori rights and interests. Regulation, education, and support are likely to be more appropriate than taxes on both water pollution and water abstraction. 3.11 There is also a lot of work underway on solid waste, both in terms of regulation (e.g., the recently announced ban of supermarket plastic bags) and on the scope and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy. Caution is needed on substantially increasing the Levy. If it is raised to high too quickly it could result in more illegal dumping which would be a perverse outcome. 3.12 Road transport is already heavily taxed. Increases in fuel taxes have been a factor (along with increasing international oil prices, a falling exchange rate, and increasing margins for fuel companies) behind large increases in fuel prices to record highs. Although revenue from fuel excise duty, vehicle registration and licencing fees and road user charges is hypothecated to the National Land Transport Fund, the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport shows a growing proportion of that funding will be allocated to non-roading investments in public transport, rail freight, and walking and cycling. Environmental considerations have been very prominent in this growing proportion. Transport fuels are also subject to the ETS so as the emissions price rises, so will fuel prices. Tax concessions 3.13 With regard to agricultural concessions it is important to recognise that the level of government support for New Zealand farmers is miniscule by international standards. In 2017 New Zealand’s Producer Support Estimate was just 0.8% of gross farm receipts, compared to 1.7% for Australia, 9.6% for Canada, 9.9% for the United States, 18.3% for the European Union, 49.2% for Japan, 50.9% for Switzerland, 53.0% for Norway, 53.5% for Korea, and 55.7% for Iceland. 3.14 There are a range of tax concessions for agriculture in the Income Tax Act, mostly deducting types of expenditure which would normally be considered capital in nature. Much of this deductible expenditure has environmental benefits – for example: 8  Destruction of weeds or plants detrimental to the land;  Destruction of animal pests detrimental to the land;  Fencing, particularly when fencing off waterways from livestock; and  Planting trees or plants to prevent or combat erosion; provide shelter to the land; and prevent or mitigate detrimental effects on a waterway from the discharge of farming or agricultural contaminants. 3.15 There are others that, because they relate to improvements to the land for agricultural purposes, could be considered neutral or in some cases negative to the environment (for example, clearing land of scrub, stumps, and undergrowth; and re-grassing and fertilising pasture, and some fencing). We are not unsympathetic to the suggestion that concessions found to be ‘degrading natural capital’ should be removed but this should be subject to government support to manage any transition. We also agree with the suggestion that ‘there may also be a case to consider further incentives for activities that generate environmental ‘benefits’. 3.16 With this in mind, Federated Farmers strongly agrees with the TWG’s assessment that costs associated with the case of land subject to a QEII covenant should be treated as deductible expenses. Another example would be stock crossings of waterways and stock water reticulation which is necessary when a waterway is fenced-off from livestock for environmental purposes. Revenue recycling 3.16 Federated Farmers would support the recycling of revenue from environmental taxation, either through reducing other taxes or funding complimentary activities. We agree with the benefits of such an approach discussed on page 74 of the interim report. 4. THE TAXATION OF BUSINESS 4.1 Federated Farmers is a key representative of the business community, particularly of small enterprises. 4.2 Federated Farmers generally supports the interim report’s recommendations on business taxation. They are well thought through and logical. We agree with retaining the imputation system and not changing the 28% company tax rate or the 33% trust tax rate. We also agree with recommendations not to introduce a progressive company tax or an alternative basis of taxation for small businesses. Instead the TWG found reducing compliance costs through the tax system to be a better approach. 4.3 We agree that a focus on compliance cost reduction would be helpful. The question becomes what opportunities are available? Firstly, Federated Farmers believes that the government should not seek to increase compliance costs. Extending the taxation of capital income would certainly increase compliance costs and small businesses would be disproportionately impacted. The same can be said of environmental taxation, particularly if agricultural biological emissions are included in the ETS or if taxes are imposed on water pollution and/or water abstraction. 4.4 Secondly, initiatives should continue to reduce compliance costs for those transacting with Inland Revenue. Significant progress has been made, including the greater use of accounting and payroll software and the increased ability for users of such software to communicate and transact with Inland Revenue through the internet. Technology- based initiatives to reduce administration and compliance costs should certainly 9 continue but there are still taxpayers, especially in rural areas, who are unable to use technology (for example, due to lack of access to broadband internet or a lack of knowledge or confidence to embrace technology). Compliance with Inland Revenue requirements has become more difficult in recent years for businesses in isolated rural areas as the frequency of their postal service has fallen and a lack of access to reliable broadband has prevented them from shifting to internet based services. More funding should be made available to increase the coverage areas for broadband internet and to upskill people to use technology. 4.5 Thirdly, we agree that thresholds in the Income Tax Act that have not been reviewed for some time should be increased. This includes provisional tax and automatic deductions for certain types of expenditure. Although recognising concerns about fiscal costs we also consider it worth reviewing the thresholds for the write-offs for low value fixed assets. 4.6 Fourthly, we have one additional compliance cost suggestion not mentioned in the interim report. Charging resident withholding tax on interest and dividend transactions between family members and the family business is compliance cost intensive. Often this will be the only interaction with RWT that these family enterprises will have. From the perspective of these enterprises, the RWT is accounted for in an ad hoc way making it compliance cost intensive. The original objective of RWT on interest and dividends was to reduce evasion yet such evasion was not occurring in the family enterprise context. It should be removed for those enterprises. 4.7 Finally, the concern that originally prompted the promotion of a progressive company tax rate was not related to tax compliance. Our understanding is that the idea was promoted as a way to soften the cost impact for small businesses from the Government’s increases in the Minimum Wage. While it is not in the scope of the TWG to critique wider government policies, it should acknowledge that small businesses’ compliance costs concerns are far wider than just tax and that a whole-of-government approach is needed for addressing them. In this context Federated Farmers endorses the creation of the Small Business Council and of its mandate to take a strategic view as to how Government can best assist small business. 5.

Given the TWG has asked for feedback on the Interim Report, below is BusinessNZ’s response to those recommendations that have a direct relevance to the business community. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Kind regards, Vaughan Renner President BusinessNZ JacksonStone House 3-11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz \[1\] 2 Capital & Wealth Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment The Group is still forming its views on the best approach towards extending the taxation of capital income. Only once such an extension is designed can a meaningful comparison take place between different options and the status quo. Appendix B sets out the Group’s initial thinking on further design features of broad-based taxation of capital income. The Group will work toward its ultimate recommendations in the Final Report. Extension of Taxation of Capital Income (EOTOCI) In our original submission to the TWG, we said we did not have a formal position on a form of capital gains tax (CGT) (which in the context of the interim report is referred to as an EOTOCI). Our reason was because the form it would take would depend on the detail of any CGT regime chosen, such as who it would include, who it would affect and how it would be implemented. In essence, the devil would be in the detail of whatever might be proposed. The interim report has certainly provided more detail as to the when, how and what to tax for a CTG. However, after examining the pros and cons of the proposed CTG, on balance in its current form BusinessNZ does not recommend its introduction. We note that the TWG have been asked “In broad terms, will the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits from reform outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs, and efficiency costs that arise from the proposed additional capital income taxation?”. From BusinessNZ’s perspective, any change of this extent to New Zealand’s taxation landscape needs to clearly and comprehensively indicate a net economic benefit for the country. While we appreciate the depth of the TWG’s work in constructing a potential CTG, after analysing the potential costs and benefits, we have concluded it is far from clear that overall, the benefits will outweigh the costs. Our concerns include: • A query about the primary reason for introducing a CGT. If this is to decrease house prices, offshore evidence shows that does not happen. In fact, this is pointed out in paragraph 27 of chapter 6, with the TWG’s view that tax will not play a large role in fixing the current state of the housing market. • In essence, this is such a narrowly defined CGT that we would question its long-term ability to fit comfortably within New Zealand’s tax system. Also, there is a real risk of unintended consequences in the short to medium term. • It is ironic that while the CGT is narrowly focused, this will not, unfortunately, preclude it from becoming, potentially, overly complex. While accepting that certain calls will have to be made to establish how the CGT might fit with the rest of New Zealand’s tax system, the extensive discussion in the interim report’s appendix b provides more questions than answers. • There is the possibility that New Zealanders who purchase New Zealand shares directly will be taxed, while those owning shares through PIES will not. Should this happen due to a decision to use one or other of the two main options for CGT implementation, we question how things would play out from a fairness perspective. Also, how would this enhance New Zealand’s overall financial literacy through direct investing, or the potential impact on small start-up businesses attempting to obtain capital? 3 • There seems to be no balance when it comes to the likely costs of a CGT. Increased accommodation supplements for low income earners are discussed in paragraph 28 of chapter 6, and the issue of increased administrative work is addressed in appendix b. However, no attempt has been made to determine the net revenue (or cost) accruing to government. Given that in New Zealand other measures tax capital, how would the minimal returns from a CGT provide a better outcome? Risk-Free Rate of Return Method (RFRM) In line with the views expressed above, the discussion on the RFRM (either an alternative to or in conjunction with an EOTOCI) does not instil in us a sense that such changes will provide a clear, positive outcome for the New Zealand economy. But as with our general stance on CGT, BusinessNZ does not itself have a strong view on the RFRM concept. We note the 2009 TWG also examined this method, but as various questions were left unanswered at the time, we agreed further work would be required to understand the full implications. In short, the possible introduction of an RFRM requires further rigorous analysis which, given the tight TWG time frame, means that at this point, BusinessNZ does not recommend the introduction of an a RFRM. Roll-Over Relief Last, appendix b goes into some depth to discuss how roll- over relief within the context of a CGT might work for a number of cases, includin g dispositions of business assets. While we understand other submitters will provide more detailed analysis of this, overall we would favour a system that seeks to enhance business growth, not lock investment into low performing assets. Ultimately, we want to see every New Zealand business grow, which often means larger premises and/or more productive assets. Paragraph 71 of appendix b outlines the disadvantages of roll-over relief for voluntary disposition of business assets where proceeds are reinvested. However, in our view these potential disadvantages do not take into account the bigger picture. Instead, we believe the potential ongoing restrictive nature for all businesses if roll-over relief is not allowed in such areas is a far greater long-term concern. Next Steps Given the tight restrictions imposed by the TWG’s terms of reference, we believe the proposed options for CTG changes significantly hamper the TWG’s ability to create a realistic model that could effectively work for New Zealand’s economy. The existence of this impediment needs to be front and centre when it comes to the TWG’s ultimate recommendations. Overall, much of the TWG’s good work in other areas of tax policy could be undone if it recommends a CGT that causes more problems than offers solutions. Therefore, looking ahead to the final report, BusinessNZ believes the TWG should be bold enough to say it is not recommending any CGT or RFRM model if a majority considers these will not improve New Zealand’s 4 competitiveness but instead will have an adverse effect on the economy. Retirement Savings Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Remove ESCT on the employer’s matching contribution of 3% of salary to KiwiSaver for members earning up to $48,000 per year. Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points each. Consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). While BusinessNZ agrees with the general thrust of looking to lower the rates applying to savings in KiwiSaver accounts, there are two matters to which we would like to refer. First, any reduction and/or exemption that applies to one set of taxpayers and not the other moves New Zealand further away from its Broad Based Low Rate (BBLR) tax system, as the differential between the top level of tax paid and the lowest becomes larger. This increased differential can lead to employees choosing not to accept a pay increase or a new job that pays more, simply because having a full range of benefits below a certain pay level outweighs any additional income received. Given Working for Families currently has this very problem, the preferential treatment of retirement savings for certain groups may give some taxpayers cause for thought. In short, BusinessNZ believes the TWG needs to better understand the wider implications of any such policy adjustments across all government settings. Environmental & Ecological Outcomes Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment There is significant scope for the tax instruments to play a greater role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in New Zealand. Environmental tax instruments can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. Taxes are not well suited to all environmental problems and regulation will still be a better approach for dealing with some issues. The Group has prepared a draft framework identifies a range of criteria and design principles for environmental taxes to be effective. Environmental taxation and regulation should be considered together for positive outcomes. As a first port of call, BusinessNZ believes that any options around environmental tax instruments ought to be thoroughly assessed to ensure the desired outcome or purpose can be achieved relative to other available measures (policy or regulatory) to achieve those outcomes. It is also important to test the effectiveness of any proposed measures in a New Zealand context. BusinessNZ notes the Interim report considers that over the medium term, there could be benefits from the greater use of tax instruments to address challenges relating to both water pollution and abstraction. BusinessNZ acknowledges the complex nature of water pollution and abstraction issues and considers related policy changes need to be clearly thought through before any decisions, including decisions on taxation options, are made. Economic externality arguments are particularly relevant to the issue of water quality after the water has been used for various purposes e.g. in respect to the degradation of lakes and rivers as a result of non-point source pollution (waste run-off). Many of the environmental externalities associated with irrigation are complex and the links between sources (cause) and effect not well understood. It is often difficult to identify, observe and measure effects from individual sources and link them to resultant changes in environmental 5 conditions. It is important to set water quality standards at appropriate levels. If standards are too high, there may be wasteful over-investment in pollution control and a reduction of output and value from water use. But if standards are low or non- existent, environmental damage may result and cultural and recreational uses may suffer. Any mechanism for addressing environmental externalities needs to be appropriately targeted to location and scale as generally a one-size-fits-all approach will not be possible. Obviously this could include the possibility of a cap and trade on discharge which might be appropriate at a catchment level. A well- designed cap and trade regime could provide a mechanism for allocating discharge rights to landowners who value them most highly. However, it is accepted that there would probably be significant establishment and implementation costs in developing a discharge cap and trade for each region. There is a strong case for initially allocating existing rights to discharge point and non-point pollution relating to historical emissions, protecting the value of current investments. This is consistent with arguments for grandparenting rights to water and with the approach taken to the allocation of fisheries’ rights under the 1980’s ITQ framework. The ability to transfer (or trade) a right to take water is fundamental to ensuring an efficient longer-term allocation of resources. It may also help to minimise any possible conflict between existing and potential abstractive water users by ensuring water flows to its most highly valued uses (either through short or long-term lease arrangements or sale). That said, the environmental, social, and cultural considerations of transfers between different points within catchments or (especially) between catchments, must be taken into account. Overall, such mechanisms are early in their development in New Zealand. Therefore, a very deliberative approach needs to be taken before any proposals for water taxes are recommended, which would obviously require considerably more work if they are to be seriously considered as part of the tax framework. In the short term, there may be benefits in expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy, and for reassessing waste and landfill disposal externalities to see if higher rates are warranted. There could also be benefits from strengthening the ETS and advancing congestion charging. Over the medium term, there could be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. Addressing Maori rights and interests in fresh water should be central to any changes. In the longer term, new tools could allow for an expanded role for environmental taxes to address other challenges such as biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem BusinessNZ notes the interim report states there may be benefits in expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy, and for reassessing waste and landfill disposal externalities to see if higher rates are warranted. BusinessNZ would caution against making ad hoc decisions in this area for the reasons outlined below. A number of options are currently being considered by government and others to try and reduce waste going to landfill under the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. These include expanding the use of the levy (currently a minority of landfills are covered by the levy) and increasing it from its current $10 tonne to (some have suggested) $140 per tonne. 6 services. Do these proposals stand up to scrutiny? It is of fundamental importance to understand clearly that there is an “optimal” amount of waste, just as there is an optimal amount of resources that should be spent on crime prevention etc. Waste cannot be completely eliminated, at least not without great cost. As a general principle, individuals and companies should bear the full costs associated with their behaviour (i.e. costs should be internalised) or individuals will over-consume resources if they can shift costs on to third parties. Waste minimisation is no different. If individuals are to make rational decisions regarding waste minimisation, they should ideally bear the costs (and benefits) associated with specific options/outcomes. On the other hand, if individuals and companies are forced to pay a greater amount than the costs those individuals and businesses impose, the outcome will either be more expensive items, ultimately reflected in prices to consumers, and/or reduced choice for consumers to buy products which meet their unique preferences. It is equally important to recognise that before any regulatory approach to waste reduction is considered, it is first necessary to fully understand the nature of the problem, who is affected, the costs of taking action, and who bears those costs. Regulatory intervention, because of its cost, should generally be considered as a last resort, only to be undertaken when all other cost effective approaches have been exhausted. Currently, the waste levy of $10 per tonne brings in around $30 million per annum. Therefore is an increase justified and would it result in reduced waste or simply in added costs of little benefit? Expanding the levy to include most landfills would likely capture many which currently accept “clean fill” (inert material such as non-contained soil and concrete waste). This would simply add to the costs of construction, including housing, for little or no benefit. Increasing the levy could also result in greater use of opportunistic fly-tipping and increase potential harm as individuals and companies failed to dispose of material safely through managed landfills. Under the Waste Minimisation Act, 50% of waste levy income currently goes to local authorities while 50% goes into a contestable fund. It would appear that the figure of 50% for local authorities was just plucked out of the air, with the danger being that those paying the levy (those who dispose of waste), may not necessarily be the beneficiaries of the funding. There is no connection at all between the “payers” and the recipients of any benefits. Perhaps more importantly, it would be useful to understand what the economic returns have been from the current levies used within the contestable fund and the 50 percent used by Councils. Or have they simply been wasted on costly, ineffective, and economically irrational pet projects? Much more effort needs to be made to send households 7 economically transparent pricing signals for rubbish collection and disposal. Many Councils still fund these out of general rates so there is little apparent connection between the amount of rubbish disposed of and the costs faced by households. Significant improvement in pricing is required before considering costly and ad hoc interventions such as cranking up waste levies. Corrective Taxes Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Recommends that the Government review the rate structure of alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation. Recommends that the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate. BusinessNZ generally agrees that other measures to reduce the level of smoking should be investigated before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate but would point out the potential effects of which the TWG needs to be aware. First, paragraph 10 of chapter 10 notes that the excise raised was almost $1.7 billion in 2017 – an increase of over 50% since 2010. Given the purpose of the TWG is to ensure any changes are tax neutral, it should be recognised that the implementation of other measures to reduce smoking levels would also have the effect of reducing revenue. In relation to the point above, the TWG should as well take into account the possibility of substitution effects in the medium term, with those who currently smoke choosing e- cigarettes instead. A combination of existing smokers stopping smoking/turning to e-cigarettes, as well as potential new smokers taking the e-cigarette option may see a reduction in the total excise tax collected from tobacco. This would require revenue from elsewhere to meet the shortfall if the tobacco excise tax is earmarked for specific government expenditure. Recommends that the Government develop a clearer articulation of its goals with regard to sugar consumption and gambling activity. As stated in our original submission to the TWG, any taxes introduced for such purposes would need to go through a rigorous government policy process to ascertain whether they are required in the first place. This would include establishing whether substantive international evidence shows such taxes having a significant positive effect on behaviour without creating significant distortionary effects elsewhere in the tax system, as well as unintended negative behavioural consequences. While we agree that for government to develop a clearer articulation of its goals in the corrective taxes area is important, these should be bare minimum requirements, as the link between government goals and what turns out to be good policy can be very different. International Income Tax Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Supports New Zealand’s continued participation in OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. 8 Recommends that the Government be ready to implement an equalisation tax if a critical mass of other countries (including Australia) move in that direction. BusinessNZ supports consideration of an equalisation tax if a similar step is taken by a significant number of countries. Recommends that the Government ensure, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. GST Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Recognises the significant public concern regarding GST, but does not recommend a reduction in the rate of GST. This is because lowering the GST rate would not be as effective at targeting low- and middle-income families as either: • Welfare transfers (for low income households); or • Personal income tax changes (for low and middle income earners). BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation. The most recent changes to the GST rate in 2010 were part of a wider rebalancing of taxes, where decreases in personal tax rates were combined with increases in GST and welfare transfers. Any future change in the GST rate would most likely require a similar suite of changes. Does not recommend the removal of GST from certain products, such as food and drink, on the basis that the GST exceptions are complex, poorly targeted for achieving distributional goals, and generate large compliance costs. BusinessNZ thoroughly endorses this recommendation. We have long held the view that GST should remain a broad- based tax with few if any exemptions. Overseas evidence has consistently shown that exemptions often lead to gaming and the diverting of resources that could be used more productively. Believes there is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services, but there are significant impediments to a workable system. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation. Does not recommend the application of GST to explicit fees charged for financial services. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation. Recognises that there is active international debate on financial transaction taxes, which should be monitored, but does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation, but would like to see the recommendation going one step further to say the TWG does not recommend any form of financial transaction tax being introduced, now or in the future. Personal Work & the Future of Work Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Will provide recommendations regarding the rates and thresholds of income tax in the Final Report in February 2019. As we have stated previously, one of the most direct and effective ways in which SMEs in New Zealand can gain from tax policy changes is for a top personal rate or threshold change that would lead to a reduction in the level of tax paid. While we generally support measures to reduce tax compliance costs for businesses, changes via the top personal tax rate route would enable all SMEs to benefit, particularly when the recommended changes outlined in the taxation of business section below might not be relevant to certain businesses. We note the TWG is not considering a reduction in the top marginal tax rate of 33% because the rate is already low by international standards. While this may be the case when 9 putting OECD countries in order of their top marginal tax rate, it only tells half the story. New Zealand’s top marginal tax rate begins at $70,000, which is much lower than the top rate in countries we typically compare ourselves to. Therefore, at the very least we would expect the TWG to take this into account when making its final recommendations. In relation to the point above, paragraphs 13 and 14 in Chapter 13 discuss the issue of bracket creep. In particular, paragraph 14 states that “The Group believes that bracket creep is best dealt with through the periodic review of the rates and thresholds of income tax to ensure they remain appropriate rather than some form of indexation”. While in principle we would want to see a regular review of tax rates/brackets, we accept there are compliance costs involved. As a second best, we would strongly encourage the TWG to recommend: a) An initial adjustment of all personal tax brackets for the full impact of inflation since 2010, and b) A timeframe for future periodic reviews of both tax rates and brackets (say every 4 years). In association with the points above, we believe it is important the TWG is cognisant that any increase in tax thresholds would have flow-on effects for other potential changes. The outlined recommendations on retirement savings discussed above are one example. Supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly an expansion of the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers such as ride sharing companies. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation, insofar as it does not lead to a net compliance cost increase for SMEs. Supports the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of smart accounts or other technology based solutions. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Inland Revenue continues to use data analytics and matching information to specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. A review of the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Government seek to align the definition of employee and dependent contractor for tax and employment purposes. Recommends additional Government support for childcare costs, but believes this support is best provided outside the tax system. BusinessNZ supports these recommendations. The Taxation of Business Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Retain the imputation system. Not reduce the company tax rate at the present time. BusinessNZ supports the recommendation relating to the retention of the imputation system. However, we are very disappointed the TWG is not recommending a reduction in the company tax rate. In conjunction with personal tax rates/thresholds discussed below, changes in this area provide the most efficient and cross-business means of reducing costs and improving economic growth. 10 Also, the TWG should be very aware of company tax rate moves offshore. While table 14.2 shows the overall tax rate on dividend income, the headline rate is still the first port of call for businesses when deciding where to invest. We are somewhat perplexed by the views expressed by the TWG that on the one hand the general consensus for reducing the company tax rate is low, yet paragraph 26 in chapter 14 recognises the fact that a move downwards may be required if Australia adjusts its rate. We would argue that in some respects this has already begun via a gradual shift towards a 25% rate by 2026-27 for those with an aggregated turnover threshold of AUS$50 million. While BusinessNZ would not argue for a similar arrangement (as evidenced by our support below for not introducing a progressive company tax rate), Australia is still establishing a pathway for a lower rate for a large proportion of businesses, which will become more stark as the difference between New Zealand’s 28% rate and Australia’s 25% rate kicks in. Not introduce a progressive company tax. BusinessNZ strongly supports this recommendation. A progressive company tax would move New Zealand away from the BBLR system we support, and in our view would create the unintended consequences outlined by the TWG. Any change in the company tax rate should be a decrease that benefits all business. Not introduce an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as cashflow or turnover taxes. BusinessNZ has some sympathy for an alternative basis for taxation for smaller businesses, exemplified by the work CAANZ has undertaken over a number of years. While not recommended by the TWG’s report, alternatives should not simply be ignored if they provide SMEs with real compliance cost savings. Consider other measures to reduce compliance costs. Depending on the fiscal position, these measures could include: • Increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000-$10,000. • Increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000. • Increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees, and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of expenditure. BusinessNZ generally supports these recommendations. Over time, compliance around provisional tax has historically been one of the main tax compliance headaches for SMEs. Therefore, an increase in its threshold is welcome, although we would argue the final threshold figure should be closer to $10,000, than $5,000. In terms of other steps that could be taken to reduce the effective tax rate and compliance costs, BusinessNZ would welcome recommendations that sought to simplify various elements of the tax regime, including entertainment, fringe benefits and depreciation. For the latter, accelerated depreciation or changes to their thresholds would also be a positive step. Not change the thresholds around fixed assets. BusinessNZ also notes that the TWG is to provide recommendations on black hole expenditure and building depreciation deductions in its final report. As we pointed out in our initial submission, we support the reintroduction of depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings, as these depreciate faster than residential buildings. It was an unwise policy decision to remove this provision in 2012, and we welcome its restoration as part of good tax policy. We also note that issues around earthquake strengthening have not been addressed. As we noted in our previous submission, if the 11 government does not compensate for the regulatory taking imposed on building-owners, then the tax system should not add a further barrier. Last, businesses should be able to claim a tax deduction for all business expenditure – including black hole expenditure, either immediately or over time. The Integrity of the Tax System Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment A review of loss-trading, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. BusinessNZ strongly supports this recommendation. That Inland Revenue have the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to Inland Revenue if: (i) the company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; (ii) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and (iii) there is doubt as to the ability/and or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation. Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including: • An increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business). • A review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand. • The removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation although its support is strongly contingent on the point made in the second bullet point, that such actions do not impose unreasonable compliance costs on business. The overwhelming majority of businesses are law abiding and follow tax laws to the best of their abilities. We would not support heavy-handed and compliance-laden processes that produce some increase in government revenue but impose higher costs on the business community. That Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. BusinessNZ generally supports this recommendation, although not at the cost of opportunities to build capacity and resources for front-facing staff dealing with individuals and businesses on a daily basis. Further measures to improve collection and encourage compliance, including: • Making directors personally liable for arrears on employee GST and PAYE obligations (as long as there is an appropriate warning system). • Departure prohibition orders. • An alignment of the standard of proof for PAYE and GST offences. BusinessNZ believes the TWG needs to step very carefully when contemplating making directors personally liable for arrears on employee GST and PAYE obligations. We only have to go back to the 2010-2012 period when legislation was proposed that would have created a chilling effect on directors by criminalising breaches of certain directors’ duties. Thankfully this issue was rectified, but it highlighted how increased director liability can potentially affect not only the decision-making process but also whether people opt to become directors – and in a country with a relatively small pool to choose from. Therefore, as a bare minimum, this recommendation should envisage the implementation of some type of check and warning system. The establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. 12 The Administration of the Tax System Recommendation BusinessNZ Comment Strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available).The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Encourages Inland Revenue to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Statistics New Zealand. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Encourages Inland Revenue to collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. BusinessNZ’s support for this recommendation is contingent on a process that does not create additional compliance costs for the business community in trying to collect income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes. Recommends that any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise within the Office, and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new Crown debt collection agency proposed by the Group. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Recommends the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation. Recommends the use of the following principles in public engagement on tax policy: • Good faith engagement by all participants. • Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Maori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Crown/Maori Relations). • Earlier and more frequent engagement. • The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. • Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. Notes the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development, and the importance of Inland Revenue maintaining deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability. BusinessNZ generally supports these recommendations, although we note that engagement should not simply involve the greater engagement of one particular ethnic group. Projections by StatisticsNZ show the Asian ethnic population will be the second largest group in New Zealand by 2025. Therefore, we would rather see a focus on engagement that takes into account the actual future state of New Zealand’s population. Encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate and recommends the inclusion of an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. BusinessNZ supports this recommendation.

Response to the Tax Working Group Interim Report October 2018 Oxfam New Zealand (“Oxfam”) is a New Zealand registered Charitable Trust that is a legally autonomous member of the global Oxfam Confederation. Oxfam welcomes the opportunity to submit its views on the Tax Working Group Interim Report released 20 th September 2018. We look forward to discussing international taxation further, particularly at our meeting on the 1 November 2018. Oxfam’s contact for this work is our Advocacy and Campaigns Director, Jo Spratt: joanna.spratt@oxfam.org.nz Interim Report – Oxfam’s assessment We congratulate the Working Group on their hard work, bringing together thousands of submissions on tax. We were pleased to see so many people care about a fair tax system. Oxfam has been campaigning on unfair tax avoidance by multinational corporations for some time now, and we were pleased to see that the Working Group recognised that tax avoidance reduces the tax system’s integrity and undermines social capital. We welcome the Working Group’s aim to build a tax system that is founded on principles of wellbeing, manaakitanga/care and respect, kaitiakitanga/stewardship, whanaungatanga/relationships and ōhanga/prosperity, and that can protect our environment. We support the recommendations that the IRD’s investigatory capacity continues to be invested in, and that more information be placed into the public realm. Oxfam has also been asking for more public information to be made available. We note that one of the Working Group’s key guiding questions was whether or not the tax system minimised “opportunities for tax avoidance” (p. 23). Yet, while the Working Group agreed the IRD could make more information public and that our tax system benefits from participation from diverse stakeholders, the Working Group did not recommend that the New Zealand government require multinational corporations to publish the financial information we need to assess how much governments may be losing due to tax avoidance. Oxfam’s position is that the Interim Report fails to fully address a significant threat to the tax system’s integrity and fairness: multinational tax avoidance. We believe the Working Group has an opportunity to strengthen its final recommendations on transparency. We request that the Working Group: 1. recommend that the government consider enacting legislation that requires multinational companies to publish country-by-country reports of their key financial information 2. make stronger comment on transparency in the international tax chapter 3. rewrite recommendation 17.1 (p. 129, 134). As we read it, this recommendation currently states that the IRD should make available no more information than what is already publicly available. This does nothing to improve transparency or participation in the tax system. In fact, releasing the information in aggregate will potentially make it harder to understand what is happening. At the very least, the qualifier regarding individual and corporate information contained in brackets should be removed. OXFAM NEW ZEALAND | www.oxfam.org.nz | Ph: 09-3556500 2 Integrity and fairness through transparency The transparency facilitated through public disclosure upholds the integrity of our tax system and improves perceptions of fairness. The Working Group highlighted the importance of involving diverse societal groups in the design and administration of the tax system. Oxfam agrees. Requiring multinational corporations to publish key financial information will put the information we need in the public realm, to allow civil society, journalists, academics and other interested groups, to contribute their expertise and perspectives to the conversation about how to strengthen our tax system. The legal loopholes that allow multinationals to avoid paying tax deprive New Zealand (and other governments) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. This is unfair. It is also unfair that most other businesses pay their taxes, while multinational companies have the global reach and resources to manipulate the rules to avoid tax. Tax avoidance is inherently an issue of fairness and one that can be addressed with sufficient political will. Whanaungatanga and Manaakitanga As we stated in our original submission, Oxfam is concerned about the exclusion of international tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda. This is not a technical issue but goes to the heart of the principles the Working Group wishes to see integrated into our tax system. We note that the Group’s Chair, Sir Michael Cullen, stated in an interview with The Spinoff’s Duncan Greive (here, 8 April 2018) that in terms of the international tax environment, the Working Group was not “precluded from repeating” the BEPS work or from “considering the wider issues”. Oxfam suggests that our recommendation for greater transparency, specifically public country-by-country reporting, is a wider issue that the group could make a recommendation on. The New Zealand tax system is intertwined with the global tax system. It makes no sense to concentrate on some aspects of the system while excluding others. To fully ensure the integrity of the system, Oxfam suggests that the Working Group comment on the interactions between different parts, and the importance of understanding how they connect, rather than examining specific components in isolation. Focusing only on one area risks overlooking the interdependence and interfaces with other national and global tax systems. Countries must work collaboratively to remedy global tax avoidance. New Zealand needs to be part of a global solution if it is serious about tackling inequality domestically and globally. Public country-by-country reporting contributes to this effort. Further, the New Zealand Cabinet has agreed to five new Pacific diplomacy principles, one of which is “mutual benefit” (Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, ‘New Zealand in the Pacific Cabinet Paper’, 2018, pp. 6-7). To achieve mutual benefit, New Zealand “must actively identify win-win opportunities and avoid negative consequences” (Ibid.) when developing domestic and foreign policy. The principle is further articulated as, where appropriate, asking the question “how will this affect the Pacific Islands region” when making decisions. Consideration of public country-by- country reporting is consistent with this mandate, as public information in New Zealand can be used by other governments. To grow a tax system with integrity, based on fairness, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and ōhanga, and to have the public conversation we need to achieve this, governments like New Zealand need to demand greater transparency from multinational corporations.

Date 12.10.2018 To The Tax Working Group c/o Tax Working Group Secretariat P O Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Submission To The Tax Working Group I wish to make the submission outlined below concerning the proposed tax on unrealised capital for equity investments made through the New Zealand stock exchange. I do not wish to speak to my submission Background I am a trustee for a family trust which owns a portfolio of company shares, property shares and fixed interest investments. This portfolio is not large but forms an integral part of providing retirement income in addition to national superannuation entitlements for the beneficiaries of the trust. My understanding from the draft report recently produced, is that there is a proposal to introduce a variety of tax changes including the introduction of tax on different forms of capital gain. Within this area of taxation, there is a proposal to include a tax on shares and other financial entities where the tax is to be calculated on any increase in value for each entity over each financial year. That is, a tax on improved theoretical or book value rather than realised value. The portfolio I am talking about has been established to provide income, which is already taxed, and not particularly for capital gain. Any capital gain should and usually reflects inflation and this allows for changes to income levels (usually by way of dividends) and so provides some inflation proofing to the income received. Submission I am against any form of capital gains tax on unrealised capital of any form. While I am not averse to paying income tax on any capital realised on the sale of share equity, I feel that where a capital loss is made on the sale of share equity, there should equally be a tax claim on the loss value. \[1\] \[1\] Also there should be some allowances made for inflationary influences on money values so any tax should be made after adjustments for inflation. The share market has been reasonably buoyant over the last few years and many shares have gained in value but there are others that have lost value. For example, at present, the Reserve Bank has placed a firm CBL under administration and it looks likely that all shareholders will lose their investment. Could this result with a tax claim for the loss? A few years ago, the Commerce Commission carried out an exercise to try and determine what Chorus would be able to charge for its ultra fast broadband services. It’s first directive was fraught with errors and Chorus was placed in a financial crisis. As a consequence, the share value plummeted but eventually recovered. There are many examples of situations where businesses have had difficulties and the share price has plummeted and then in some cases recovered. Examples include Chorus, Fletcher Building, A2 Milk, Sky Television. Share values are also affected by exchange rates and global events. The value of a portfolio varies daily according to share market trading so to take an arbitrary date such as 31 st March to value a portfolio or each entity that makes up that portfolio for the purpose of determining any capital gain is very unfair if there is not a converse situation allowing tax claims for losses made as well. The only true way to determine capital gain is to take the sale price and subtract the purchase price taking into consideration charges and cost associated with the purchase and sale and inflation over the period between purchase and sale. If the tax working group is to target the share market and tax unrealised capital gains, then it should also target business balance sheets and tax their changes in book value of business assets. The government introduced legislation which disallows rental property to be depreciated. In my view, this contravenes long established accounting practices. Usually with depreciation on assets, any tax saved by way of this accounting entry must be paid back on sale of that asset. In the same way, I can see that once more, the government is considering screwing commonly accepted accounting principles that have been developed over many centuries by working on theoretical values rather than historical real values. Summary I am against any form of capital gains tax on unrealised capital of any form. Bill Cromwell \[1\]

I’d like to speak personally about my experience as an individual investor in direct shares. I was surprised when I read your interim report and the points made around a capital gains tax that excludes PIE funds, as I was sure you would have seen, as I have, that never before has there been so much enthusiasm and support for direct share investment amongst young people. I have been studying investments and researching and understanding NZ companies since I was 14, but in the past five years alone, the number of my peers who have become interested in shares has multiplied exponentially. You are no doubt aware of the fact that historically, NZ has had a problem with a lack of interest in investment via the domestic sharemarket. Our capital markets have always held less public interest than investment property. However, the rampant housing market over the past few years has led to a generation of young individuals who have not been scarred by the crash of ’87 and are open and willing to seek alternatives. This is a gift. Property investment (in existing homes) is not a productive use of capital. It does not help our GDP, it does not increase productivity in our economy, unlike the businesses we could be investing in. Instead, property investment dries up supply in the residential housing market, making it harder and harder for young people to own their first homes. I know many friends who are active in the stockmarket as a way to reach their first property, and along the way gaining skills and knowledge that will benefit them and their children far into the future. This is also a gift. I genuinely believe that we are on the cusp of a generation of kiwis who are more financially literate than ever before. And the more of us who are given an opportunity to learn and practice investment in the stockmarket, the better. As a group, we want to support k iwi businesses who are trying to make a change in the world. And who will go on to employ thousands upon thousands in their local communities. The rise of ethical investing demonstrates that we do care about the common good, and can change the actions of big corporates like no other time in history. Let us help and encourage small companies to list, and expand into new markets. Let us build a thriving capital market driven by those of us who live and work here, who want nothing more than to see NZ success here and abroad. The implication of a capital gains tax is huge for us. We are just gaining momentum on this path, and a capital gains tax will stop us in our tracks. It will simply become too onerous for an individual investor to do their own research, learn about the markets and make a decision (accumulating valuable, life-altering knowledge along the way). All we will become is sheep. Marketed to/at by PIE funds. Choose this fund, choose that fund. The tax benefit will be worth us throwing our hands in the air and just picking a fund. It would be grossly unfair to tax the individual, but not the sophisticated corporate. Who will benefit? What will happen? - Not the individual, who is no longer incentivised to learn about different NZ companies & financial literacy \[1\] 2 - Not the listed company, who would have had a greater diversity of investor, but must pander to huge, slow, behemoth funds instead. - More funds will be introduced. More managers who get a cut of an ever-growing pie, coming directly out of the small investor’s pocket. - Less transparency. Greater bureaucracy. More fees. Less financial literacy. More advertising. Less interest. Less trust.... - And who knows? Maybe a flight back to property investment? I completely agree that a capital gains tax on property makes sense, and I will gladly pay it. It does not benefit the economy and does not grow our productivity or wealth as a nation (except in dollar terms). But the investing environment now for a young, individual investor has never been better. Our future as a generation of educated investors is so bright, but far from certain and still fragile in its early stages. I fear the changes you have highlighted in your interim report will put this in jeopardy. To summarize: 1. Huge interest in stockmarket investment among young people – fantastic for the economy and our future as a nation. 2. Investment in companies is better than investment in property – provides employment, productivity gain, technological advances, improvement in standard of living & GDP per capita. 3. The future of NZ could be a generation of educated, interested individuals and transparent, knowledgeable capital markets, but this is at risk. 4. We should encourage active thinking & investment, not just picking a fund! 5. Absolutely go ahead and tax property investment. Please consider us small individual investors when you make your final decision. We don’t have massive coffers hidden away, we just want to learn as much as we can, support the businesses we love and choose our own path. Best regards, Margaret Bei

Christchurch Progressive Network Response to interim Tax Working Group report 10 October 2018 Tax Working Group members c/o Andrea Black Ki a ora koutou, A bleak document which reinforces the existing wrong-headed narrative on tax The TWG interim report is a bleak document. It acknowledges some of the most serious issues with growing inequality but dismisses in a seemingly perfunctory fashion the suggestions to tackle the obscene levels of wealth and poverty at the point of gathering taxation. It proposes just a modest nod to inequality with a broader capital gains tax alongside a possible recommendation for the first $7000 of income to be tax free. The structural inequalities in our broken tax-gathering system remain unquantified and unchallenged and the dominant, wrong-headed public understanding of tax remains firmly in place. Dominant narrative The dominant narrative has it that those on high and middle incomes pay the highest tax rates while those on low incomes pay virtually no tax but receive vastly more in transfers than they pay in tax. This narrative suggests the rich deserve their wealth while beneficiaries and feckless families on low- incomes are a burden the middle class and the wealthy must shoulder. The interim report reinforces this dominant narrative by failing to spell out the regressive nature of GST while telling the public in detail that high-income earners pay the highest rates and amounts of income tax and that the net tax situation is negative for beneficiaries and families on low incomes. This paints those on the lowest incomes as passive recipients of the generosity of the wealthy. It makes them lesser citizens because we are told again and again (by politicians and now the TWG) that their tax contribution is negative, building more resentment. This dominant narrative is reinforced daily by cynical politicians and a tax-illiterate media who swamp us with messages that top income earners pay the most tax. Our recommendations for the final report Rather than build on this dominant, wrong-headed narrative we ask the TWG to challenge it directly in its final report: 1. A robust presentation comparing the tax paid by individuals and companies 40 years ago with what is paid today (ie pre and post neoliberalism) 2. A discussion of the deeply regressive nature of GST and that this be presented simply and singly in graphical form. In the interim report is merely stated in passing and its influence buried in other data. 3. A graph which shows GST and income tax levels paid by different deciles as a proportion of their income. A further graph could include imputed capital gains added to the picture. 4. An emphasis on the fact beneficiaries and workers pay tax on every dollar they earn and every dollar they spend – unlike business owners and the wealthy who have myriad ways to \[1\] avoid tax. Some of the ways tax may be avoided by business owners and the rich should be spelt out clearly. 5. Include a discussion of Lisa Marriot’s work at Victoria University which compares the crown approach to welfare fraudsters to that of tax evaders. 6. We strongly support a single crown debt agency which should remove the sickening disparity between the treatment of tax and benefit fraud. 7. Remove the comment (sorry I don’t have the reference) to the effect that Kiwisaver is geared towards more help for people on low-incomes. As far as I’m aware this is misleading at best and should be removed. Not only do many resist joining because they can’t afford the deductions from their meagre incomes but the percentage contributions from employers and government incentives mean those on the highest incomes get the greatest benefits. If there is an opportunity to discuss these ideas further with the TWG we would be keen to do so. Na, John Minto Convenor Christchurch Progressive Network \[1\]

From Dr Murray Horn CNZM 15 October 2018 A CGT will end up adding relatively little revenue and lots of cost and complexity The interim report is starting to highlight just how much arbitrariness, complexity and cost is involved in introducing a comprehensive capital gains tax (CGT) and why countries that have one have tended to erode the CGT base over time as they try and deal with some its inherent problems. A tax system should aim to raise the required revenue while minimising the associated economic, administrative and compliance costs. Distributive issues are better managed through targeted welfare and social spending. Introducing a CGT in NZ is likely to involve more additional compliance and administrative cost than in most other countries because a much larger number of taxpayers who are not required to file a return pre-CGT, would have to do so if a CGT was introduced. Transition costs are also likely to be exaggerated by the suggested timing of introduction. 1 It is not surprising that the two recent independent NZ tax reviews 2 both recommended against introducing a CGT that excluded the family home. Instead they recommended we should continue with the current practice of including particular capital gains in the income tax base as and when issues arise. There is nothing in the current review that justifies a different conclusion. However, if the TWG decides to recommend introducing a comprehensive capital gains tax, then: • The base value of assets subject to a CGT should be uplifted to current market value at time of death, so there is no capital gain at death and successors only pay CGT on any subsequent gain. Absent this value uplift, the CGT would act as an inheritance tax and that is explicitly ruled outside the scope of the TWG’s review by its Terms of Reference (an inheritance tax is a tax levied on money or property acquired by inheritance or a tax on the estate of the deceased). • Death should not be treated as a realisation event. If a CGT is not to become a backdoor inheritance tax, then “uplift” should occur at death and no gain recognised for CGT purposes (as above). While allowing roll-over at death imposes an inheritance tax on the gain in value of inherited assets, it also allows payment of this inheritance tax to be deferred. While still outside the TWGs Terms of Reference, this deferral would be better than not allowing either value uplift or roll-over on death. Moreover, as noted in the interim report, death does not involve the receipt of any consideration by the deceased and so fails the core definition of a realisation event. The arguments for taxing on death are also weak. 3 1 The Finance Minister is quoted on Stuff.co as saying “We will undertake the work and we will take it through to legislation. But no outcomes from the TWG will come into force until the 2021 tax year: i.e., 1 April 2021.” The last date for an election is November 2020 and, given the likely controversy around a CGT, it is hard to see taxpayers (or even IRD) making the necessary investments to be ready for a CGT until after the results of the election are known. This timeframe is unlikely to allow for a smooth transition. 2 The 2001 (McLeod) and 2010 (VUW) reviews of the NZ tax system. 3 Basically to discourage lock-in (something that, if a serious concern, should discourage the introduction of a CGT in the first place) and raising more revenue (and if this is an issue then the current tax base is a better place to look to raise revenue without significant additional compliance and administrative costs). 2 • If the tax is to be levied at the taxpayer’s income tax rate, rather than at a lower rate of say 15%, then a 50% discount should be applied as I understand is the case in Australia and Canada (i.e., in countries that also levy the tax at the taxpayer’s income tax rate). This also provides a relatively simple way of adjusting for inflation, without incurring the lock-in or adverse selection problems of applying the discount after a fixed asset holding period. • The only fair and accurate way to establish an opening capital value for assets to be taxed, at least illiquid assets, is to only apply a CGT on assets acquired on or after the passage of the CGT legislation (being the approach that Australia adopted when it introduced a CGT). Rateable values are not good enough for this purpose. 4 However, if the TWG decides to recommend against value uplift on death an in favour of applying selective roll-over relief on death, then roll-over relief should apply: • to assets left to both the partner and the children of the deceased on the basis that it is hard to distinguish between the former and the latter on the basis of an “... in substance economic unit in terms of their ownership and enjoyment of their assets and income from those assets.” (p.145) This is also consistent with the approach to ownership changes on page 144 including that “Under tikanga concepts property can be often seen as being held for others, including future generations, and these interests should be accommodated by the tax rules.” Family Trusts set up to hold assets for future generations should be treated on the same basis and so also “be accommodated by the tax rules”. • to property that is illiquid, including farms, because, as the interim report notes, it is undesirable that the imposition of the tax would result in a forced sale to fund the tax liability. Even land that could be sold, or a mortgage raised against it, should be excluded when this would effectively force a sale to pay for the tax. It is unfair for the government to take advantage of a realisation event it has forced to occur and then charge tax on the gain. This principle is acknowledged in applying roll-over relief to compulsory acquisitions and a common sense view of fairness suggests that this principle should be applied broadly. In considering the position of Trusts, then: • If an inheritance tax is to be avoided by allowing a value uplift on death, then this value uplift should also apply to Trust assets when the settlor dies: i.e., beneficiaries (or the Trust) should only pay CGT on any capital gains made subsequent to the settlor’s death. • There should be no deemed realisation events for trust assets because no consideration has been received at that time and no change of ownership has occurred. Forcing tax to be paid when there is no cash flow available from a sale could well force a sale, which the TWG seems to recognise as being both undesirable and unfair. Moreover, Trusts pay the highest 4 Rateable values are only an estimate of the value that a willing buyer and seller would strike (an estimate that is likely to contain more error in rural areas where “like” transactions are less frequent). The valuation error implicit in rateable value does not matter a great deal when valuations are only used to assess the share of rates that are paid by different landowners. They matter a great deal more when valuations are used to establish a taxable base. 3 rate of tax on each taxable dollar, which, if the Trust tax rate is used for assessing CGT, significantly offsets the benefits of any delay in paying a CGT by having assets in a trust. 5 However, if the TWG decides there is a need to impose a deemed realisation event on trust assets, then: • Deemed realisation should only apply to those trust assets not otherwise eligible for value uplift or roll-over relief on death, and only on assets transferred to a trust after a capital gains tax is introduced, because the only argument for imposing deemed realisation on trust assets is that it prevents avoidance of CGT on death (i.e., asset transfers to trusts to avoid tax on gain on death). Clearly assets already held in trust were not transferred to avoid a CGT because no CGT existed when the assets were transferred. If setting a deeming date for Trust assets ineligible for value uplift or roll-over relief, then: • The interim report notes that deeming realisation when the settlor dies “... would be most consistent with the rationale behind denying roll-over relief on death... ”. • When there is more than one settlor, roll-over relief should apply until the last settlor dies (after which capital gains are only taxed again when the trust expires). The alternative of trying to identify which current assets were contributed by which settlor would require an arbitrary set of rules (e.g., when the original assets were no longer held in their original form or when assets were contributed jointly by a husband and wife (who are deemed as an economic unit for other purposes (p. 145))). Roll-over relief should also apply if the asset is transferred to a tax resident beneficiary of the Trust prior to the deeming date. • Roll-over relief should be granted when the trust would otherwise be forced to sell illiquid or indivisible assets in order to pay the tax for the same reasons as outlined above. However, if the TWG decides that a Canadian type of fixed “deeming date” should be considered then: • We should also allow roll-over relief if the asset is transferred to a tax resident beneficiary of the Trust prior to the end of the fixed period, as the Canadians do. • If the fixed period is supposed to represent “a generation”, rather than just an arbitrary date, then the average age of a mothers giving birth to their first child in New Zealand was about 28 years in 2011, so the date should be no shorter than 28 years after the introduction of a CGT. • Roll-over relief should be granted when the trust would otherwise be forced to sell illiquid or indivisible assets in order to pay the tax for the same reasons as outlined above. • Given the great variation in the circumstances applying to different trusts, the Trustees should be able to make an election (at any time either prior to a fixed deeming date or immediately following the death of the first living settlor) if the deeming date should be when the last settlor dies or after a fixed period. 5 For example, at a post-tax interest rate of 3%, the cost to a trust of the higher average rate of tax (33%) offsets the benefit of any delayed payment for about 27 years compared to most personal taxpayers (the highest average tax rate of those with taxable income under $48,000 is 15.4%).

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Response to the Tax Working Group interim report October 15 th 2018 Comments on Chpt7: Retirement savings It is good to see that the Retirement income policy objectives set out are clearly focused on the individual and not on national saving: The overall objective of retirement income policy is to minimise economic insecurity in old age. New Zealand achieves this objective through three main tools:  New Zealand Superannuation alleviates the risk of old age poverty by providing a universal benefit to all New Zealand citizens and residents 65 and over (subject to some residency restrictions).  The KiwiSaver scheme supports private saving to maintain a standard of living in retirement over and above the level guaranteed by New Zealand Superannuation.  Private decision-making on retirement saving is supported by measures to improve the financial literacy of New Zealanders. (TWG) National saving is a secondary consideration in pension design. It is unlikely funded schemes increase saving but even if they did, that is not the issue. If an increase in National saving is to have desirable effects on the economy, there must be links between the scheme and increased saving, and between more saving and more investment. There are no necessary links. Moreover, more investment does not of itself mean more quality and sustainable growth. “ an increase in saving does not necessarily increase output” (Barr, 2001). Many pension experts believe that pensions policy should primarily have equity objectives: ensuring equitable shares of future output between working age cohorts and pensioners. KiwiSaver is a very small part of overall wealth and a small, albeit growing, part of total managed funds. It is dubious if growth in KiwiSaver is anything more than offsets to other forms of saving. Such offsets may be good to divert for example from overinvestment in housing but the main purpose of KiwiSaver is to provide a low-cost mechanism for low/middle income earners to acquire a relatively secure savings pot. The TWG say “A greater pool of domestic savings could deepen domestic capital markets and enhance the ability of local firms to secure capital to grow.” This was an argument for KiwiSaver in 2005 but we have not seen the evidence of this so far—in fact the opposite. The issue in NZ is not the lack of capital. There is a lack of mechanisms to allocate capital to its highest use. There is a problem of lack of NZ listings on the stock and much of NZSF and KiwiSaver is invested overseas and exchange (See for exmaple NZ Herald -Breaking the capital drought. October 5 th 2018). It is important for the TWG not to be diverted into arguments about national saving- it should not be the focus of retirement saving. The achievement of less inequality in retirement outcomes should be paramount. The TWG say, “Higher saving rates could, in principle, reduce the cost of capital and increase incentives to invest.” and “Higher national saving could also support export growth by reducing pressure on interest rates and exchange rates”. While these maybe theoretical possibilities, in the real world, interest rates are driven by many other factors. Moreover it could equally be argued that more saving depresses the economy and reduces the confidence to invest. Saving does not cause investment. When the TWG say “Savings policy may also affect the allocation of investment, for example by reducing distortions in the treatment of different asset classes.’ they hint at what follows which appears to be in the direction of making KiwiSaver more tax-advantaged to level the playing field. The RPRC strongly disagrees with this direction, preferring that distortions in housing are removed. The Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime The RPRC is alarmed by the suggestion that the PIE regime should be made more generous. It is already very generous as the TWG point out. It would be much better for the top PIE rate to be raised to 33%. This would help moderate income inequality (one of the goals for TWG) and reduce avenues of tax avoidance. A much better approach to levelling the playing field is to adopt the RFRM for net equity in real estate. The treatment of inflation The RPRC agrees that the MTC can be viewed as compensation for tax on nominal interest income in KiwiSaver in times of inflation. But notes in a world where nominal interest in the bank is taxed and capital gains are vastly undertaxed, taxing nominal returns in KiwiSaver is at least consistent. International comparisons NZ should be proud of this: ” New Zealand has the lowest tax subsidy for retirement savings relative to its general system for taxing investment income” (TWG). Other countries find it very difficult to reign in their expensive, regressive tax breaks for retirement saving. Not being able to unwind tax breaks as NZ did in the late 1980s has meant countries like Ireland are struggling to bring in generic auto enrolment DC programmes (St John, 2016) 1 . RPRC agrees with the TWG when they say “a poorly-designed regime, which only slightly increases private saving and significantly reduces public saving, might actually have a net negative impact on national saving.” Incentives to save The Group considered a range of options for encouraging greater saving through the KiwiSaver scheme and favours:  The removal of ESCT for employees earning up to $48,000 per annum.  A five percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates, applying to savings in KiwiSaver accounts. (The Government could also take the opportunity to simplify the PIE rate schedule, which is somewhat complex.) The RPRC comments: If everyone has the ESCT on the first $48,000 removed it is of most benefit for those earning $48,000 or more and is expensive without helping those on low incomes much. However, if it is only for employees earning up to $48,000 as appears to be the case, there are troublesome notch problems. Would someone on $49,000 to lose all the advantage of the removal of ESCT?. How will either of these options work for people with two or more employers? How will the self-employed be treated? Would the reduction on PIE rates apply to all PIE funds? This is again not the best way to help low income earners and does not fix the problem of the top PIE rate being less than the top income tax rate. High income people who disguise their real income are likely to be able to take advantage of this lower PIE tax regime. Other ways to make policy more progressive and to actually deliver more to low income people need to be considered. For example, the reinstatement of the $1000 kick start for new KiwiSaver members over 18. This would be far more progressive than the options TWG favour as it does not depend on what is earned, it would be good for very low income earners, and women, many of whom may not start KiwiSaver until later in life. The kickstart offers protection for small savers in the initial phases who otherwise may see their balances become negative after fees and poor returns. Women The TWG say “Saving patterns also differ by gender. Women’s adult lives often involve periods outside the paid workforce or in part time employment, which can result in lower 1 see also St John (2016) Time for Ireland to bite the bullet, Irish Times 1 November 2016 and St John, S (2016) We really don't know how lucky we are, New Zealand Herald, October 12th, 2016 government contributions to KiwiSaver and lower KiwiSaver balances than would otherwise be the case.\[21\] The TWG appear to justify this in the footnote: “\[21\]The Group notes, however, that women also tend to receive New Zealand Superannuation for a longer period than men because of average life expectancy for women is higher.” This justification is inappropriate. On average women no matter how long they live, begin retirement with lower savings and hence may have a reduced standard of living compared to men for all the years they actually live. Living longer suggests they need to be even more prepared than men instead of vastly less. But averages are distasteful- we distinguish longevity on the basis of gender because we can see gender. There is a huge overlap in the mortality curves suggesting that a true marker is probably some kind of longevity gene. Gender is a very second-best characteristic for longevity projections. Retirement policy issues are far broader than just tax. The RPRC would to see any recommendations on tax as part of the Retirement Commissioner’s three- year annual report in 2019. Barr, N. (2001).

Submission to the Tax Working Group Secretariat Response to Interim Report Abstract The interim report indicates that the idea of a Financial Transaction Tax appears to be not well understood by the Tax Working Group. Sothat it can be considered before the final report, I intend to explain why a type of FTT should be considered as a far simpler, more practical and fairer type of tax than we currently have. Many of the best ideas are the simplest ones.New Zealand likes to think of itself as innovative and pioneering so it should be willing to consider a radical shake up to its taxation system. The mention of the Financial Transaction Tax was an improvement onthe last one a decade or so ago which failed to mention FTT apart from a brief reference to a Tobin tax. However, it’s still only a fleeting reference and made no reference to the various forms of FTT, referring to only one form which, I agree, would not be worth consideration in New Zealand. The form of FTT I propose is the Automated Payment Transaction tax (APT). No investigation into the tax system is complete without showing why an APT should be dismissed. Automated Payment Transaction tax explained To understand how APT would work, a good starting place is the New York Times articleON THE CONTRARY; Dreaming Out Loud: One Tiny Little Tax 1 by Daniel Akst from 2003. It describes what was proposed as a simple and fairtax suggested by Edgar L. Feige, a retired economist from the University of Wisconsin. The article is copyright and thus it’s not appropriate for me to includeit in this submission, but it will still be available either directly from the New YorkTimes website, or via a library service. Form of APT for New Zealand environment That article describes a USA environment and so not every detail is applicable to a New Zealand environment. I would suggest some small changes to what Dr Feige proposed: 1. The tax would eliminate GST in addition to income and corporate tax. 2. Dr Feige suggests that 0.6% would be sufficient to cover what is nowcovered by other taxes. It would be levied equally on the payer and the payee. Isuggest levying it all on the payer as explained in paragraph 4 of the sectionSome of the benefits of an APTbelow. (a) To compensate for the loss of tax on cash transactions Dr Feige also sug- gests levying a higher tax rate on cash withdrawals and deposits. I suggest that wouldn’t be necessary given the huge decrease in the number of cash transactions in the last decade, and there’s no indication that wouldreverse. 1 https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/business/on-the-contrary-dreaming-out-loud-one-tiny- little-tax.html – 1 of 5 – The current incentive to avoid GST is far greater. It would be preferable to keep the system as simple as possible. However, if cash again becamemore common, a specific higher rate could be introduced in response. Were that to happen, in that case, itwouldbe appropriate to charge it on deposits as well as withdrawals. 3. The APT would not eliminate excise duties. There is good reason to levy specific taxes on activity that involves undesirable consequences but are impractical to outlaw, such as alcohol, nicotine, sugar and cannabis. Just how those would be levied are separate discussions. How it would work For the purposes of explaining the principle, say the APT rate is 1% and an account holder makes a purchase of $100. 1. The payer’s bank pays $100 to the payee, and an additional payment of $1 to IRD. 2. The payee’s account receives a deposit of $100 where it can earninterest until it is spent. It would incur an APT of $1 at that time. 3. Tax would be levied on every transaction that passes through a bank, or entity that acts in the manner of a bank servicing payments. The only way to avoid it would be to use cash or attempt to set up a payment system outsidethe New Zealand banking system. 4. Banks make payments to IRD at intervals to be decided accordingto the size of the individual accounts and could be as frequently as daily for large ones or even in real time. There is a view that banks should be recompensed for their tax-collecting tasks. Those are minimal in the computerised systemthat is well- developed already, and banks already have access to substantialover-night short- term interest-free loans. That’s not likely to change, but if it does,banks can be compensated by adjusting the size of the payment intervals. 5. Inequities brought about would be eleviated or eliminated by specific payments such as the present housing allowance payable to beneficiaries. (a) For example, donations to registered charities would also incur tax which would be considered unfair. That can be offset simply by IRD paying the amount of tax (simply calculated) to the charity. The net result is that the charity receives the amount that the donor’s account has deducted from it. To make it more like the net result of the present system in which IRD effectively subsides the charity by the amount of the tax deduction, IRD could pay a multiple of the APT it collects from donors. That multiple could be calculated, using simple arithmetic, to have a similar net result. – 2 of 5 – Some of the benefits of an APT Using a system as radically different from what tax experts are familiar with could appear daunting. It would be necessary to phase in the change over a number of years, beginning with a very low rate of APT while lowering and eventually eliminating GST, income tax, etc. When the change is complete a large number of benefits would arise. 1. Very simple to set up and cheap to administer. Banks are already set up to do nearly everything necessary so scarcely any new investment willbe required. Whatever is required will be several orders of magnitude less complicated than what is required with the way tax is structured at present. (a) Tax law would become immeasurably simpler. I could envision it getting to the stage whereby it would all fit into a single volume. Businesses couldget on with business instead of being concerned about whether it is structured to make best use of tax laws. 2. GST has become popular with governments as a form of revenue-raising because it is relatively simple to arrange, and not easy to avoid. APT is even simpler and fairer than GST – to the extent of eliminating the need for a return to be filled in. Hence the term “automated”. An APT would also constitute a much lower rate than GST and so there would be less incentive to attempt to avoid or evade it. 3. Gone will be the incentive to invest in housing that has no capital gains tax in preference to services or products that benefit the economy. The result will be less investment speculating in the housing market and more in productiveindustries. (a) A CGT is not effective at reducing that speculation and resulting instability. Trying to devise a fair form of CGT is fraught with problems as can be seen by the complicated regulations in Australia. Even professional accountants cannot tell how the Australian Tax Office will rule on rather simple cases. The ATO even reserves the right to change its ruling at a later date. 4. Payments for purchases abroad would incur the same tax as those made in New Zealand. As well as eliminating unfair competition for NZ businesses, itwould eliminate the need for offshore supplier registration, and also collecttax on pur- chases less than $400. Levying all the tax on the payer instead of splitting it with the payee eliminates the problem that would otherwise arise collectingtax from an offshore supplier. That might be considered unfair but it would affect everyone equally and is an insignificant price to pay for the simplicity it provides. 5. Because everyone spending money will be paying tax, and at the same rate, there will be less inequality. The more money spent by a taxable entity, the more tax it will pay. Dr Feige has been quoted 2 as describing an APT as “. . . a public brokerage fee accessed by the government to pay for the provision of themonetary, legal and political institutions that protect private property rights and facilitate market trade and commerce.” Whether or not the attribution to Dr Feige is correct, I consider it to be an apt description. 2 http://blog.heartland.org/2014/05/rethinking-taxation-the-automated-payment-transaction-tax/ – 3 of 5 – 6. Though not (yet) an issue in New Zealand, high-frequency trading of financial instruments would never get started. That’s to be applauded sinceit would mean that New Zealand would not get into the legal wrangling over the question as to whether high-frequency trading constitutes insider trading. There are others with large amounts of initial capital who don’t require ultra fast network cabling and computer algorithms designed to change market positions at millisecond or even microsecond intervals. It is still possible to “make”money by exploiting arbitrage margins that are available on forex and futuresmarkets. But it requires what is considered “work” which can result in money for the trader but produces no benefit to the economy. If APT were charged on those trades, there would be no profit, sothe market would cease. (a) People who make money from that type of business produce no benefit to the tax-payer yet they’re able to consume large amounts of what isproduced by the “real” businesses. That is part of the reason why there is insufficient money to pay aged-care and other low-paid workers an income thatis able to keep pace with inflation. (b) In a recent discussion about daylight saving on BBC World Serviceradio, a view was expressed that because of the disruption to body clocks when the clocks are changed, millions of dollars are “lost” on the financial markets. By a “loss”, it was meant a potential profit that was not taken advantage of, though nothing was actually lost. Removing such a distortion from the economy would have a not insignificant benefit. 7. Trans-national corporations which currently avoid income tax by shifting profits to their low-tax country affiliates through an accounting fiction would be paying APT on those transfers. The benefit to them would be substantiallyreduced or eliminated, while IRD would receive an APT as well as on each transfer within New Zealand. It would not be receiving income tax on the salaries of staff, but those are small in magnitude compared with the turnover of the businesses. 8. An APR would be very difficult to avoid. Using cash would avoid the APT but that would be a very small proportion of the transactions. Cash has to pass through the banking system at some stage, at which point, measures can be taken if it becomes necessary to respond to large amounts of tax evasionthrough the use of cash. Such measures were described in paragraph 2 (a) of the sectionForm of APT for New Zealand environmentabove. The Pushback A small but influential number of people who are doing well out of the current system will resist the idea of an APT tax. They will have substantial resources of finance and skilled staff or consultants who would make strenuous measures to avoid it. Trans-national Corporations In recent years, attention has been drawn to the fact that largetrans-national businesses typically pay minimal tax by virtue of the accounting practice of charging internal – 4 of 5 – “fees” resulting in movements of money from high tax countries to low tax countries. Fictitiously high profits are made in low tax countries and fictiously low ones in high tax countries. It’s completely legal but it’s unfair competion for local businesses. 1. Expect such businesses to resist the introduction of an APT since they would be less profitable. They would prefer the current system partly because it is difficult to make rules that can be adopted internationally that can curtail those practices. (a) Expect them to lobby against a change to an APT tax. They already have supporters such as Ireland which even disagreed with a European Union Commission decision that Apple had under-paid its tax to the tune of¤13.2 billion. (b) Expect them to devise new methods of transferring money within their or- ganisations that are separate from the banking system, such as block chain technology. Taxation Consultants Businesses in New Zealand that make their income by advising tax-payers how to avoid tax are operating entirely legally. So too, are those who structure their business to incorporate that advice. It’s important for them to limit expenditure wherever legally possible or at least keep abreast of what techniques their competitors use. While tax consultants benefit their clients’ profitability, the tax avoidance industry does not ac- tually produce anything for the economy. 1. Expect them also to be opposed to an APT. IRD staff are also not likely to be in favour of making the tax system so simple it will require far fewer people to run it. (a) It is very difficult to make a radical change such as an APT when a substan- tial industry has the ear of government. Conclusion An APT would not be a perfect solution to every problem encountered in devising a fair tax system, but it obviates many of them and comes close to a fair resolution for nearly all of the rest of them. Though there would be a very strong lobby against the idea of APT, that’s no reason not to consider it. There was strong opposition to women’s suffrage, same-sex marriage and even MMP, yet change did happen. No change will happen if the subject isn’t discussed. I make this submission with the aim of starting that discussion. Patrick Connolly 22nd October 2018 – 5 of 5 – \[1\]

Tax Justice Aotearoa New Zealand Submission to the Tax working Group on Future of Tax: the Interim Report Introduction Tax Justice Aotearoa New Zealand (TJANZ) was formed recently (August 2018) to provide information, analysis and advocacy on national and international tax policy and law. Many of our constituent members made submissions on earlier TWG consultation documents. TJANZ is a partner of the international Tax Justice Network. We acknowledge the extremely hard work that has gone into the IR, its conscientious consideration of submissions, and the wealth of material and research that sits behind it. We are also impressed with the sustained engagement of the TWG with a wide range of stakeholder groups. Many of the concerns that underlie the Report are also central to those of the TJANZ. Our focus is the need for a tax system that is: fair; efficient; transparent; enables inequalities to be reduced to the greatest extent possible; produces enough revenue (in conjunction with an effective transfer system) to ensure world-class provision of public services (i.e. health, education, housing transport, etc); ensures the health of the environment for the present and the future; and interfaces with the international tax system in a way that reduces tax evasion, tax avoidance, and global inequalities. Support Capital gains tax 1 We strongly endorse an extended capital gains tax (also termed extension of taxation of capital income) on the grounds of increased progressivity, improved equity, improved efficiency, and increased revenue. While we do not have any comments on design principles such as the issue of ‘when to tax’, we consider that taxation of capital income should apply to as wide a group of assets as possible. We have however reservations about excluding the family home, and propose that design principles (a) ensure that the purpose of extended taxation of capital income is not defeated by ‘hiding’ assets in trusts; and (b) ensure that criteria for the concept of ‘family home’ includes a monetary limit. That is, the exclusion would not apply to very expensive houses valued from $2 million upwards. Transparency principle We endorse the TWG statement on p 9 that ‘there is a need for greater public access to data and information about the tax system...’; but further strategies are required to ensuring such greater access. We suggest two illustrative examples: 1.Public access is needed to information on beneficial ownership of all entities (this is particularly relevant to chapter 4). We realise that MBIE is undertaking work in this area, but at present MBIE has confined their proposals to beneficial ownership of companies. Public access is just as relevant and needed for beneficial ownership of trusts. 2.Chapter eleven notes that international tax reforms are outside the terms of reference, although this chapter does discuss cross border revenues from digital services – presumably because this affects the New Zealand system. Similarly we consider that the principle of transparency should apply to all cross-border activities where they may have impact in New Zealand. Currently there is a move towards ‘country-by-country reporting’ where multinational companies are obliged to report on their activities within all countries where they operate. 2 Information gained from country-by-country reporting should be publicly accessible. We also note the need to amend the sentence after the phrase ‘about the tax system’ (4 th line in the second para, p 9.) It makes little sense to affirm the need for greater public access to data about information that is already publicly available. Limitations 1.The work of the TWG (and the IR) is significantly restricted by its terms of reference. Consequently, the IR does not consider (given the terms of reference) taxation in conjunction with welfare/benefit/transfer issues. This is a major impediment to sensible and meaningful recommendations, a difficulty which is implied at several points in the IR, for example: a.The IR recommends ‘additional Government support for childcare costs, but ... this support is best provided outside the tax system’ (13.7). b.On p 94, para 10-11, it is stated that reductions to lower tax rates would assist low and middle income earners through the tax system; whereas incomes for very low income households would be best achieved through welfare transfers. The choice between these options is left nowhere between the tax working group and the expert advisory group on welfare, with neither in a position to recommend a decision either way. 2.Given the immense resources that have already been devoted to the project, we strongly urge that the Final Report includes ideas, options and quantitative data that go beyond the terms of reference, even while acknowledging that they can’t be reflected in recommendations. These would form the basis for future consideration and research by government and groups with an interest in these issues. We suggest that the Final Report includes a section or appendix “ideas for future consideration”; or ‘ideas for the long-term’. 3 Recommendations Our recommendations fall into four categories: general, specific, the need for modelling of the impact of recommendation ‘packages’ in relation to inequalities; and the need for further work. 1General We propose that: 1.Four principles are added to the conventional principles of tax design (efficiency, equity, predictability, certainty etc): (this would involve amending p 13 of the final report): a.Reducing inequalities: this should be recognised as an explicit purpose of taxation systems. The purpose of tax in reducing inequalities would be consistent with Te Ao Maori, a worldview which has meaning and context in Aotearoa New Zealand but which otherwise in the TWG is not given any substantive meaning. Reducing inequalities may be seen by some as inherent in the notion of equity/fairness, but this broad meaning is far from explicit or accepted. b.Transparency (which in many instances means public access to information). The need for transparency is consistent with international moves in this direction. Further strategies than those referred to in the IR are needed to ensure such greater access, including public access to information on beneficial ownership of trusts, and public access to information on multinational country-by-country reporting. c.Adequacy in terms of producing enough revenue to enable government to achieve societal goals. d.Role of taxation in promoting financial and economic stability. The Interim Report makes no mention of the role of taxation in this area. 2.It is recognised in the text (if not recommendations) that reducing inequalities and poverty, and providing good quality public services, requires: 4 a. increased tax revenue; that is, a greater proportion of GDP than the current level of 30 percent; a more progressive system of income tax than appears to be recommended in the Interim Report; and b.a greater proportion of the tax revenue from wealth/assets (rather than income or consumption). 2. Specific recommendations 1.As noted above, we recommend implementation of an extended capital gains tax on the grounds of increased progressivity, improved equity, improved efficiency, and increased revenue; and urge that mechanisms are put in place to ensure that trusts are not used to evade such taxes, and that the concept of ‘family home’, if retained, has a meaningful financial cut-off. 2.Financial services and financial transactions: We recommend that recommendation 17.1 (p. 124, 132) be rewritten in relation to financial services and financial transactions. The Interim Report rejects the application of GST to financial services through a financial activities tax (FAT) or other means and also rejects a Financial Transactions Tax. In so doing the TWG is missing a golden opportunity to widen the tax base and strengthen the future sustainability of the tax system. The current trend towards financialisation of the economic system cries out for tax methods that directly address the enormous flows of cash, services and profits that are created in this area. The TWG is making no substantive recommendations in this crucial area. We consider that this is not good enough. Hence we recommend: a.GST on Financial Services The TWG recognised the "in-principle" case for including financial services in GST but does not recommend doing this because it sees no feasible options for doing so. But the discussion in the Report suggests otherwise, with several options presented that appear to be quite feasible. One of the options is a FAT, which taxes 5 financial institutions on the sum of their cash flow profit and wages, as a proxy for GST (p.90) b.Financial Transactions Tax: The TWG should review its decision not to recommend more work be done on options for introducing a financial transactions tax (FTT) in New Zealand. Such taxes raise reasonable amounts of revenue in other countries, and the TWG itself notes that the overall impact of an FTT would be progressive because groups that regularly trade financial assets will pay a high share of the tax. Hence we recommend further investigation of the feasibility of an FTT for NZ. 3.Corrective taxes: The chapter on ‘corrective taxes’ is lightweight and superficial in contrast to the more in-depth and conceptually-based chapter on “environmental and ecological taxes”. We see the concept of ‘corrective’ taxes as having negative connotations (associated with ‘correctional facilities’ and an old-fashioned somewhat negative ‘schoolmasterly’ approach). Taxation relevant to tobacco, for instance, has quite simply saved millions of lives which can only be seen as positive from a common good perspective. Taxes termed as ‘correctional’ should be recognised for what they are: “health-promoting taxes” or “health and wellbeing taxes”. Generally, this chapter frames health taxes in a less than positive way, with a focus on regressivity, reduced efficacy, and associated crime. We therefore endorse the ASPIRE submission with its proposals for a framework for health taxes, and suggested rewording. 4.International income tax. We recommend, in relation to chapter 11 on ‘international income tax’ that the Final Report recommends that further work be done on issues that go beyond the terms of reference and the material in this chapter. In particular, further work should analyse the 6 implications of the interface between Aotearoa New Zealand'ss domestic taxation system and international cross-border flows with respect to: the extent to which the tax system enables or facilitates tax evasion/avoidance; and the need for further transparency, in particular the need for public country by country reporting. 5.Environmental taxes: We support the proposal for a framework for helping decide whether and when environmental taxes are appropriate. We do not agree that all of the proposed criteria in Box 9.1 be regarded as essential prerequisites. Instead the criteria should be applied in nuanced way, recognising that there are degrees of, for example, responsiveness and risk tolerance, to be balanced against a range of other criteria such as the significance of the issue and the degree of efficacy of the proposed tax. We also consider that an important criterion has been missed and should be included: the degree to which a possible tax would assist in ensuring that New Zealand is able to fulfil its international commitments (including both legal and policy commitments). 3.Recommendations on modelling required to assess the impact of proposed changes We recommend that the final report include modelling and analysis of the impact of the TWG recommendations, if accepted and implemented. We understand that the government has indicated its commitment to a package that would reduce inequalities in this country. We need to see how implementation of the current recommendations as broadly framed would affect, one way or another, the extent of inequalities in New Zealand. If implementation does little to improve the status quo it is not clear what purpose is being served. We understand that such modelling is a difficult 7 process, but some estimates are appropriate and should be provided. We believe that New Zealand should aim at being one of the top five most equal societies in the world, nothing less. Hence, at the very least, information in the TWG final report should include projections demonstrating whether adoption of its recommendations would in fact reduce inequalities, and to what extent. We recommend, as noted above, that a legitimate use of the Final Report would be inclusion of ideas and options that go beyond the terms of reference even if they cannot be included in TWG recommendations. These ideas, options and materials would form the basis for future consideration by government (and groups with an interest in these issues). The report could include a section or appendix “ideas for future consideration”; or ‘ideas for the long-term’. We further recommend, as an example of the above approach, that whether as an appendix or working paper, the report include modelling of the impact of other possible packages of measures on inequalities with the ultimate question being: what package of measures would be necessary to ensure that NZ is the most equal of OECD societies (or the least unequal). What would it take for New Zealand to be as equal as the top five OECD countries? Setting out the implications of a range of such measures would enable informed discussion in the future. We recommend that the Final Report includes, again perhaps as an appendix, a more comprehensive analysis of the potential of wealth taxes (conceptualised broadly as including capital) for reducing inequalities. The paragraphs on p 43 are skimpy to say the least, and are broadly devoted to listing disadvantages such as difficulty of application and likelihood of evasion/avoidance. The possible advantages of wealth taxes in reducing inequalities are not mentioned. 8 4Recommendations on other work required We recommend that the TWG include, as a recommendation for further work, the need for research on the interface between the tax and welfare/transfer system. By February the Welfare Group should also have reported. The Government should be urged to ensure that further work is carried out that would integrate ideas and options from both the existing group in a way that allows real choices to be made on policies that would reduce inequalities and poverty. This further work should outline the interface issues between the taxation and welfare/transfer systems, with examples of how they impact on each other. This section could include details on the interface is managed in other countries – for example, the effects on poorer people of continued (relatively) high income taxes can be offset by greater and more universal provision of public services (health, education, child care, housing), with consequent implications for inequality reduction. 9

Some discussion points on the real issues Appendices A. Op-ed on the recommendations of this submission. B. Press release on this submission. Abstract The Tax Working Group’s recommendations on the tax treatment of KiwiSaver are not evidence- led. We have no real idea whether KiwiSaver is ‘working’ because we do not know what impact KiwiSaver is having on a household’s other financial assets. The current (2019/20) cost of KiwiSaver tax breaks ($840 million) will, the TWG estimates, increase to $1.05 billion. It is likely that the current tax expenditure is wasted. The extra $215 million will also be wasted because, before KiwiSaver, New Zealanders were, on average, probably saving enough for retirement, as the TWG itself acknowledges. New Zealand needs a first-principles, evidence-based look at the tax treatment of all ‘collective investment vehicles’ of the kind that New Zealanders might use for retirement saving. The TWG’s report does not do that. Favouring KiwiSaver alone distorts the tax playing field for no explained reason. Such a proper review will likely also undermine the TWG’s interest in a full Capital Gains Tax and should provoke significant changes to the ‘Fair Dividend Return’ or FDR approach for calculating taxable income. The FDR regime should be either abolished or extended to local investments to remove a current major distortion in the tax playing field. 3 About the submitters: Michael Chamberlain Actuary & Consultant, MCA NZ Limited Auckland E michael@mcanz.co.nz Michael is an actuarial pension and investment consultant with over 38 years’ experience in the UK and New Zealand.

The purpose of tax incentives for retirement saving 1.1 The Tax Working Group (TWG) issued its report Future of Tax – Interim Report (TWG report) on 20 September 2018. 1.2 After stating what the TWG describes as ‘goals and interests’ with respect to retirement saving, paragraph 7.5 of the TWG report then states: “There is some evidence to suggest that most New Zealanders are saving enough to provide an ‘adequate’ income in retirement. However, this judgement is conditional on the assumption that future generations remain eligible for New Zealand Superannuation under existing policy settings. This condition may not hold if long-term fiscal pressures require change to the scheme. Falling rates of homeownership will also affect the adequacy of savings for retirement.” TWG report, page 46 1.3 We think this is probably the first occasion we have ever seen any official acknowledgement (unattributed in the TWG’s report) to work done by a number of researchers in the last 15 years on what New Zealanders are actually doing about their retirement saving needs. 1.4 There are three key statements in the quote that we will analyse separately: - “...most New Zealanders are saving enough to provide an ‘adequate’ income in retirement.” - “...conditional on the assumption that future generations remain eligible for New Zealand Superannuation under existing policy settings.” - “Falling rates of homeownership may also affect the adequacy of savings for retirement.” 1.5 To be complete, the TWG report actually says “There is some evidence that New Zealanders are saving enough...” (our emphasis). It might be more accurate, but perhaps less helpful for what follows in the TWG report, to turn the statement around and say there is no evidence that New Zealanders, as a whole, are under-saving for retirement. 1.6 With that introduction, the TWG then offers its recommendations: - Remove ‘employer superannuation contribution tax’ on the 3% mandatory contributions to KiwiSaver for employees’ earning up to $48,000 a year; - A five-percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates but only for savings in KiwiSaver; - Simplify the way PIE rates are applied for KiwiSaver members. TWG report, page 54 1.7 So what exactly is the case for directly subsidising returns to KiwiSaver contributions by raising the taxes paid by other taxpayers, including non-KiwiSaver members? How can the TWG report move from acknowledging that New Zealanders are saving enough to helping them to save more, but only in a particular way? How can the TWG justify the suggested tax changes in the face of a desired objective not to distort capital markets? 1.8 We will shortly analyse the three ‘conditions’ that the TWG uses to qualify its ‘saving enough’ statement. But first, we will offer the evidence that seemingly led the TWG to make that statement (or should have). 5 2. Retirement saving – the evidence 2.1 Our report The Missing 2016 Review – building trust for life beyond work (2017) 1 laid out everything that we currently know about New Zealanders’ retirement saving habits. Section 14 of our report here gives links to all the relevant reports. For completeness, we repeat them here 2 : - New Zealanders were probably slightly over-saving for retirement before KiwiSaver started in 2007 (Treasury reports from 2004 3 , March 2007 4 and from 2009 5 ); - Of KiwiSaver contributions, about one-third was ‘new’ savings, the rest being effectively transferred from other financial assets (Treasury report 2011 6 ); - KiwiSaver members seemed to have accumulated less net wealth than non- members (Treasury report 2014 7 ); - Poverty levels amongst the over-65s are the lowest of any of the groups in New Zealand society (MSD reports from 2007 to 2013 8 ) and are among the lowest of over-65s in any country (OECD 2008 9 ) and also by comparison with 27 EU and other European countries (2009) 10 ; - The overall cost to taxpayers of retirement income policies (public and private) is amongst the lowest in the developed world (OECD 2015 11 ); 1 The full report is posted online (and by section) at www.alt-review.com. 2 The summary and links were also included in Michael Littlewood’s submission to the TWG of 30 April 2018, accessible here so presumably they helped the TWG to make its ‘saving enough’ statement. 3 Saving for Retirement: New Evidence for New Zealand, Grant Scobie, John Gibson and Trinh Le, New Zealand Treasury, 2004, accessible here. 4 Are Kiwis saving enough for retirement?

By 2008, however, the income-based measure had worsened from 7% in 2004 to 14% (see Household Incomes in New Zealand - trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2008 (2009), Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development (accessible here). By 2012, the position had improved again: to 6% of all over age 65 in “low income households” – see Household Incomes in New Zealand - trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2012 (2013) Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development (accessible here). That volatility illustrates the close relationship between the 60% of income ‘poverty’ measure and the annual amount of New Zealand Superannuation; also that many old people have little private income. We should expect less volatility in deprivation- based measures of poverty. 9 Growing Unequal? Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries, OECD (2008). New Zealand was one of the three countries that show an overall incidence of poverty in the “mid 2000s” amongst all people “of retirement age” of about 2% (rounded up from 1.53% in New Zealand’s case). The other two countries were the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. The report itself is not accessible online but was looked at in the RPRC’s PensionBriefing, 2009-1, International comparison of poverty amongst the elderly – accessible here. 10 See The material wellbeing of New Zealand households: trends and relativities using non-income measures, with international comparisons, Bryan Perry (Ministry of Social Development) 2016, accessible here, at page 19. 11 Pensions at a Glance 2015, OECD (accessible here) at page 181. Of 34 OECD countries, the net cost of NZS is 7 th lowest. However, that ignores compulsory ‘private’ schemes and also the cost of tax breaks for private provision. Australia, for example, spends about two-thirds as much on tax breaks for retirement saving as it does on the Age Pension itself (2016 Tax Expenditures Statement, Australian Government, accessible here). 6 - A StatsNZ survey in 2014 found that 71% of over-65s reported having “enough or more than enough money” and 86% reported having “high life satisfaction (7-10 on 11-point scale)” 12 . 2.2 The TWG report offered no evidence to even raise a doubt about the findings in the reports referred to in paragraph 2.1. So, we suggest that not only is there “some evidence” that “most New Zealanders are saving enough to provide an ‘adequate’ income in retirement”, as the TWG report states but also that there is no evidence of New Zealanders’ generally under-saving for retirement. 2.3 Submissions: 2.3.1 We make the following three observations on this fundamental issue: 1. Based on all the evidence we have, there are no grounds for the government to intervene in the decisions that individuals make on: - Whether to save for retirement; - When to save for retirement or - How to save for retirement. If we are right that the TWG’s own three qualifications to the ‘saving enough’ statement are insufficient grounds to set aside the evidence detailed above (more on this in sections 3-5 below), what other evidence does the TWG have to justify its proposed tax-driven interventions? 2. Far from reducing tax on, particularly KiwiSaver schemes, we strongly urge the TWG to focus its attention on levelling the tax playing field so that, in the words of the Inland Revenue’s 2005 Consultative Document: “...it is important that the tax rules for investment income operate efficiently and that investors’ decisions are not distorted by different tax treatments for income from investments that are similar in nature...... “The proposals outlined in this discussion document aim to resolve these inconsistencies and the distorting effect they have on investor decision- making.” 13 We have more to say on this in section 6 below. 3. We urge the TWG to put each of its recommendations with respect to KiwiSaver through a basic test: “Will this recommendation, if implemented, distort a saver’s decision, whether to use KiwiSaver rather than another investment that is ‘similar in nature’?” If the answer to that is ‘yes’ (as will assuredly be the case) what is the TWG’s rationale for preferring KiwiSaver over other investment arrangements that are ‘similar in nature’? 12 New Zealand General Social Survey, Statistics New Zealand (2014) accessible here. 13 Taxation of investment income - The treatment of collective investment vehicles and offshore portfolio investments in shares (2005) Inland Revenue Department, accessible here. 7 3. The future of New Zealand Superannuation – the evidence 3.1 The TWG report questioned the robustness of the ‘saving enough’ evidence summarised in section 2 above by saying it was “...conditional on the assumption that future generations remain eligible for New Zealand Superannuation under existing policy settings.” 3.2 Given that the reports cited above were founded on a ‘total retirement income’ concept (public + private) then it follows the findings of retirement saving adequacy are dependent on a continuation of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) in something like its current form 14 . 3.3 So, if it were possible to show that the current benefit structure of NZS was sustainable into the future then that particular doubt on the ‘saving enough’ statement would presumably be resolved. 3.4 In our 2017 report, The Missing 2016 Review, we analysed the evidence on: - The likely future costs of NZS – see section 4 of our report here; - Whether NZS in its current format was unsustainable – see section 5 of our report here. 3.5 We acknowledged that it would be a good time to review every part of the benefit design of NZS (see section 6 of our report here) and, importantly, that review was not driven by a concern about the sustainability of NZS as it is. Rather, the review is needed because NZS had developed haphazardly over the last 40+ years and it was now time to undertake an evidence-led discussion about all 13 benefit design features of the most expensive single item of government expenditure. 3.6 In summary, we concluded that, based on the Treasury’s regular estimates of the net cost of NZS stretching out over the next 40+ years and based on today’s experience of other OECD countries, NZS in its current form is sustainable and did not have to change on that ground alone. 3.7 As a marker of our confidence, the latest (2018) Treasury estimates suggest that NZS will cost taxpayers of 2060 a net 6.7% of GDP, compared with a net 4.0% today 15 . By comparison, OECD countries were paying an average net 7.3% of GDP for public pensions in 2011 16 . 3.8 Submissions 3.8.1 The TWG’s ‘saving enough’ statement was, among other things, “...conditional on the assumption that future generations remain eligible for New Zealand Superannuation under existing policy settings.” 14 The findings of the ‘saving enough’ reports were also based first, on New Zealanders’ continuing to do what they were doing; next on savings earning a net real rate of return; thirdly on everyone who reaches retirement sopping work at age 65 and having post-retirement spending that is equal to their pre-retirement standard of living with that continuing until their death and lastly on the assumption that the family home passed intact to the next generation. Taken together, these were fairly conservative assumptions. 15 These latest estimates are from the Treasury’s ‘nzsf-model-BEFU’, 2018 and showed a 6% reduction in estimated 2060 costs from the 2016 Statement on the Long-term Fiscal Position of 7.1% 16 Pensions at a Glance 2015, OECD and G20 Indicators at page 179. 8 3.8.2 While today’s government cannot bind future governments to ‘no future change’, we submit there is no evidence to suggest that future generations of superannuitants need receive any less than today’s. We therefore suggest that condition 2 of the TWG’s ‘saving enough’ statement is satisfied. 3.8.3 If the TWG disagrees with this conclusion, we must assume it has other evidence that undermines the future sustainability of NZS. The TWG should produce that evidence and work with Treasury to help it improve its model and assumption basis. 3.8.4 The possibility that a future government might change NZS is, of itself, no justification to change other public policy aspects of New Zealand’s retirement income framework today. As a country, we must however acknowledge future uncertainty and that justifies the exploration of issues associated with possible changes to the size and shape of NZS. 9 4. Are home-ownership rates actually falling? – The evidence 4.1 The TWG report also questioned the robustness of the ‘saving enough’ evidence summarised in section 2 above by saying that “Falling rates of homeownership may also affect the adequacy of savings for retirement.” 4.2 One key condition of the ‘saving enough’ reports cited in section 2 above was that New Zealanders kept doing the things they were already doing in the 2000s. One of those was that most New Zealanders reached age 65 with a debt-free home or, alternatively, sufficient income to pay rent. 4.3 So, we agree that long-term home-ownership patterns are an important part of the ‘saving enough’ framework. 4.4 The TWG’s ‘saving enough’ statement assumes falling home-ownership rates as though that was an evidence-based fact. 4.5 In our report The Missing 2016 Review, we summarised what is currently known about this contentious issue – see section 12 here. 4.6 Census-data over the past 30 years have shown a seeming decline in home-ownership since an apparent peak in 1991. However, those ‘headline’ numbers disguise a disturbing trend in response rates to questions about the tenure of dwellings on Census night. 4.7 There are too many gaps in the questions asked in the 2013 Census (and earlier equivalent questions) for us to be certain about any recent trends in home-ownership rates. The gaps mean that, in 2013, we have no ownership information for about 362,000 of all dwellings; that’s 20.7% of all 1.76 million dwellings. 4.8 There are two main holes in the data. First, we have no information about who owns the 185,448 dwellings that were unoccupied on Census night in 2013 (10.6% of all dwellings). Neither do we know why they were unoccupied. They might be holiday homes, between tenants, on the market, under renovation or the usual occupiers (owners or renters) may have been away on holiday or business. We just don’t know and that affects our understanding of the owner/occupier status for more than one tenth of all dwellings in 2013. 4.9 The other major hole is the occupiers who didn’t answer the question or who gave an unclear answer. That was another 176,835 dwellings or 10.1% of all dwellings in 2013. 4.10 These two major data gaps have been growing in total since the 1986 Census – the total 2013 gap (20.7%) was 19.4% in 2006. Part of that is probably caused by the rise in family trust ownerships, though the Census questions tried to capture these. Gaps in the questions also contributed. 4.11 Based on what we saw of the questions in the 2018 Census, we expect that these data gaps will be somewhat larger than in 2013 (and earlier Censuses). 4.12 An alternative rental-based measure (the alternative to ‘ownership’) suggests that there has been no significant change to ownership patterns in recent decades. Rent-payers, who have to specify the amount they pay in rent, have been less than 30% of all occupied 10 dwellings since 1956 (simple average of the 12 censuses was 25.3%). In 2013, it was slightly higher than the 57 year average at 29.2%. But that implies the other 70.8% of occupied dwellings had some type of ownership connection with the dwelling in 2013. 4.13 None of this is good enough. No-one really knows whether home-ownership rates are currently falling and, in the context of New Zealanders’ financial preparation for retirement, we need better information. We cannot even start a discussion about issues that are affected by home-ownership rates without answers to some fairly basic questions. 4.14 Submission 4.14.1 It is simply not possible to state with certainty that home-ownership rates are falling. Any recommendations the TWG makes on that premise need to be heavily qualified. So, without better data, no-one can say whether the TWG’s condition #3 on the ‘saving enough’ statement raises sufficient of a red flag about New Zealanders’ saving behaviour that state intervention is needed. Therefore, no one can conclude that the proposed tax changes improve fairness. 4.14.2 We do, however, recommend that the TWG qualifies its presumption about ‘falling home ownership’ and urges the government to find out what is really happening on this. We need that information for other public policy reasons, not just about financial preparation for retirement and tax reasons. What information we have is just not good enough. 11 5. Do tax incentives increase retirement saving? The evidence 5.1 So far, we have established that the three conditions made to the TWG’s ‘saving enough’ statement on page 46 of its report seem not to undermine the overall ‘saving enough’ thesis. Specifically: - There is no evidence that New Zealanders are under-saving for retirement; - NZS seems to be sustainable over the next 40 years or so, without the need to change its benefit structure for this reason; - Home-ownership rates may be changing but the only evidence we have on this is, to say the least, ‘difficult’. 5.2 The TWG report then makes a logical leap – despite the evidence we have cited and its original proposition, the only three options the TWG recommends to ‘fix’ an otherwise unidentified ‘problem’ are three additional tax-based initiatives for retirement saving, but only if that is done through KiwiSaver. Even locked-in workplace savings schemes do not have the opportunity to qualify for the new concessions. 5.3 For the next part of our analysis, we have to assume for a moment that there is a ‘problem’ to ‘fix’ (under-saving for retirement). The question we want to consider now is whether tax breaks specifically for retirement saving actually increase retirement saving. What is the evidence on this question? 5.4 The TWG report assumes that the current tax breaks for KiwiSaver are working. We concede that any evidence on this is not as clear as we would prefer. However, what we have (as mentioned in section 2 above) suggests a less-than-resounding ‘success’: - Of KiwiSaver contributions, about one-third was ‘new’ savings, the rest being effectively transferred from other financial assets (Treasury report 2011); - KiwiSaver members seemed to have accumulated less net wealth than non- members (Treasury report 2014); - After 11 years, the average KiwiSaver balance is just $17,130 17 . 5.5 In addition, KiwiSaver is likely to increase post-retirement inequality, introduce new inequalities, shift savings from less-favoured saving vehicles and, together, reduce the re- distributional effect of NZS itself 18 . 5.6 However, as described in our 2017 report The Missing 2016 Review, it isn’t possible to measure the impact of an initiative like KiwiSaver, nor even the utility of tax incentives on either KiwiSaver itself or, more importantly, on overall saving behaviour without a longitudinal household financial survey 19 . Without that evidence, we simply do not know whether anything needs ‘fixing’ nor whether any suggested initiatives, such as those suggested in the TWG report, might help, or make things worse. 17 KiwiSaver Annual Report 2018, Financial Markets Authority accessible here. 18 The Distributional Impact of KiwiSaver Incentives (2008) by Chris Hector, John Gibson and Trinh Le accessible here. To be fair, this report was published when the amounts of the then new tax incentives were at their peak. However, any savings scheme that is linked so closely to work and pay, such as KiwiSaver, will of itself have those effects. The tax incentives exacerbate those tendencies. 19 Section 15 of our 2017 report here described the somewhat limited information that we have received from the Survey of Family Income and Employment (SoFIE). We strongly recommended that New Zealand start a proper longitudinal survey, aimed specifically at the assets/liabilities and income/expenditure of households. Otherwise we do not know what is really happening, nor whether anything needs ‘fixing’. 12 5.7 Importantly however, the TWG itself has produced no evidence that the existing tax breaks for KiwiSaver have increased the amounts that New Zealanders are saving for retirement. 5.8 The only evidence seemed driven by the fact that, for tax purposes, New Zealand treats retirement saving less generously than other equivalent countries. So what might the international evidence be on tax breaks for retirement saving; do they work in other countries? 5.9 The first point to note is that, despite the universally generous tax treatment that retirement savings receive in other jurisdictions over other savings, there has been remarkably little work done on whether they actually ‘work’ (improve overall savings, including saving for retirement). It’s very difficult, perhaps impossible, to work out because we do not know what might have happened in the absence of the incentives; what economists call the ‘counter-factual’ 20 . Some studies suggest the overall impact on the quantum of savings and national saving rates is doubtful 21 . 5.10 In fact, if households as a whole were perfectly rational, they would allow for the value of tax concessions when setting target retirement saving levels. The annual amounts required to meet a given target are less if those savings are subsidised through favourable tax treatment. We should therefore expect lower annual levels of household saving in a tax- favoured environment, like KiwiSaver than under the income tax-neutral model TTE because of the value of the concessions given by taxpayers to the saver’s lifetime saving project. Given that tax breaks seem not to ‘improve’ the quantum of savings (along with the other difficulties described above), the expensive, complex concessions in the EET environment common overseas arguably become pointless. 5.11 As we pointed out in section 2 above, before KiwiSaver started in 2007, New Zealanders were on average probably saving enough for retirement. That was after nearly 20 years of no tax incentives or other ‘signals’ that we should be saving for retirement in a particular way (such as KiwiSaver itself, auto-enrolment, employer match and tax incentives). This experience might have led us to conclude that KiwiSaver itself was unnecessary because New Zealanders seemed to be behaving rationally without the presumed help that KiwiSaver now offers. 5.12 Instead, we got KiwiSaver, along with relatively generous tax breaks on the members’ and employer’s contributions (subsequently reduced). 20 Spain introduced tax incentives for retirement saving in 1988. A report on household behaviour across their introduction concludes that “at most” only one quarter of the contributions were ‘new’ savings: see The Effects of the Introduction of Tax Incentives on Retirement Savings (2007), Juan Ayuso, Juan Jimeno and Ernesto Villanueva, Banco de España (accessible here). That analysis took no account of the cost to the tax system of lost revenue. 21 Alicia Munnell in Current taxation of qualified pension plans: has the time come? (1992) Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (accessible here) suggests that the costs of deferring tax on pension accumulations aren’t justified. Instead, the “taxation of benefit accruals should be shifted to a current basis.” In Tax Incentives to Saving and Borrowing (2003), Tullio Jappelli and Luigi Pistaferri (accessible here) say “...there is considerable empirical debate as to the effectiveness of tax incentives in promoting saving: most studies conclude that tax incentives affect the allocation of household portfolios, but the effect on the amount saved is less clear-cut.” In The Effects of 401(k) Plans on Household Wealth (2000 – accessible here), Eric Engen and William Gale suggest that, without regard for the fiscal and regulatory costs, “between 0 and 30 percent of 401(k) balances represent net additions to private savings.” If the fiscal and regulatory costs were also included, we think those percentages might turn negative. 13 5.13 Since it started in 2007, we taxpayers will have spent about $10 billion on KiwiSaver tax incentives to 30 June 2019 and expect to spend another $840 million on existing incentives in 2019/20 22 . No-one, including the TWG, seems prepared to address the question: is what we have (KiwiSaver generally or, specifically, tax incentives for KiwiSaver) actually working? And yet, the TWG proposes spending another $215 million a year (at least) 23 on improving the after-tax returns for some KiwiSaver members. 5.14 So what specific problem is the TWG’s recommendations addressing? There isn’t a retirement saving problem that we know of; we don’t even know whether KiwiSaver is helping to lift overall savings, never mind retirement saving, even retirement saving amongst the group originally targeted in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 24 . If KiwiSaver is not working, that might lead us to think about getting rid of the current annual $800 million concession rather than spending an extra $200 million, as suggested by the TWG. 5.15 Given that the two new tax breaks (removing ESCT on employers’ contributions for members’ earning less than $48,000; lowering the PIE rates on the lowest marginal tax rates) are aimed at the lowest earners, we must assume that the TWG’s objective is to reduce the overall tax burden for the lowest income-earners but only if those earners behave in an ‘approved’ way (save for retirement in KiwiSaver). This recommendation is made despite the TWG’s own acknowledgement that: “...the tax system is limited in the extent to which it can encourage additional retirement saving by low- and middle-income earners. This is because low- and middle-income earners face income constraints in their ability to take advantage of tax concessions for saving.” (page 51) 5.16 In other words, many of these earners cannot afford to save to take advantage of the existing concessions, never mind be encouraged by the TWG’s new suggestions. At best, the TWG’s recommendations will be a gift to existing low-paid KiwiSaver members and will have limited to no effect on those who cannot afford to save for retirement. 5.17 So, in the best traditions of New Zealand’s public policy initiatives on retirement saving, we don’t know if there’s a problem, but we will put a bit extra into the pot because it seems the right thing to do. We think that’s not good enough and does not improve fairness. 5.18 Submissions 5.18.1. The TWG proposes to increase the tax subsidies given to KiwiSaver members from $840 million a year in 2019/20 to $1.05 billion. We think the TWG should be obliged to provide evidence that, firstly, the current tax breaks increase retirement saving; secondly that the proposed new incentives will improve retirement saving in the targeted group, and thirdly that the new tax incentives increase fairness across the tax system as a whole. 22 Estimate from the Treasury’s long-term fiscal model, 2016. 23 TWG report at page 51. 24 KiwiSaver’s purpose, as stated in section 3(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is “...to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement” (our emphasis). Any evaluation of KiwiSaver should address the extent to which KiwiSaver has achieved its stated purpose but the TWG’s report does not even attempt that analysis. In fact, KiwiSaver is regressive, poorly targeted, inefficient and ineffective. 14 5.18.2. We know of no evidence to support any of these three propositions. 5.18.3 The TWG also proposes that this special treatment (and the proposed simplification of the way PIE rates are administered) should apply only to KiwiSaver schemes. The fact that the current Member Tax Credit applies just to KiwiSaver is no justification to extend KiwiSaver’s special tax treatment. We therefore recommend that the new favours/treatment, if introduced, should apply to any ‘collective investment vehicle’ that a saver might use to accumulate financial assets for retirement. 15 6. Some discussion points on the real issues – on what should really matter 6.1 Tax incentives for retirement saving are complex, expensive, distortionary, regressive, inequitable and inevitably create rising regulatory walls around the favoured vehicles. But, worst of all, they probably don’t work. Given that a saver’s tax break is another’s tax cost and also allowing for the deadweight cost of collecting that tax, they probably don’t raise overall savings. 6.2 In our 2017 report The Missing 2016 Review, we summarised New Zealand’s TTE tax- treatment of ‘collective investment vehicles’ (CIVs) here. We then summarised the key issues that New Zealand needs to discuss on definitions of ‘income’ and the need for consistent treatment across the different investment options, including the direct ownership of investments. We also pointed out the significance of ‘income’ for income- tested aspects of the state’s welfare system 25 . 6.3 Without repeating those points, we concluded that there is or should be a ‘gold standard’ for the measurement of any policy (or changes) that affects retirement saving: (a) The choice of CIV (KiwiSaver, superannuation scheme, PIE, unit trust, group investment fund, life insurance fund or company) should not drive the tax treatment of ‘income’; (b) Where the CIV is based should not affect the ultimate tax treatment of ‘income’ for the individual investor; (c) The saver should pay the appropriate amount of tax on all ‘income’, including from a CIV. 6.4 We have already suggested that the TWG’s proposals for KiwiSaver fail tests (a) and (b). KiwiSaver already fails test (c) so there is no change there, though we say there should be. 6.5 Some specific notes on the TWG’s proposals: 6.5.1 ‘Fair Dividend Return’ (FDR): (a) The FDR tax treatment of shares outside Australasia distorts the ordinary definition of ‘income’ and needs review. (b) We think it would be better to get rid of FDR on overseas assets so that ‘income’ and capital gains can be taxed consistently. Without removing the FDR regime, it is virtually impossible to create fairness across the tax system. (c) The current tax treatment distorts a taxpayer’s decision. Any attempt to reduce the level of distortion will create unmanageable complexity. (d) If FDR is to stay on overseas assets, then FDR should also apply to other assets, including New Zealand-based assets though this will create a wider range of issues relating to assets (e.g. the family bach that produces no income). (e) The goal must be that all assets would be taxed consistently. That is not the case now. 25 Based on our 2010 report Towards a more rational tax treatment of collective investment vehicles and their investors, Working Paper for the Retirement Policy and Research Centre accessible here. 16 6.5.2 Capital Gains Tax (CGT): (a) While we think that a CGT will create more inequities than it is capable of solving, if a CGT is introduced it should also apply within a CIV as well as to directly held assets and be applied consistently. (b) Any CGT regime should be as robust as possible. (c) The corporate rate could be zero, particularly if the CGT is based on an accruals regime. (d) On the other hand, if the CGT is an ‘end tax’, it could be triggered when the saver ‘retires’. On this, there are no issues with managed funds and managed funds with PIE status in reserving for CGT – that is what they used to do before the current favoured regime for Australasian shares under the PIE regime was introduced. A CIV would have to reserve for future CGT payments on a disclosed basis. 6.5.3 PIE rates: (a) Rather than reduce the lowest PIE rates by 5%, as proposed by the TWG, it would be better to put the 28% rate up to 33%. That would make the top PIE rate, top PAYE rate and the tax paid by trusts the same. (b) Ideally, the corporate tax rate should also be the same 33% or the top rate lowered to 28% in all cases. Given that it could be based on income and capital growth, having a 28% combined rate (versus 33% on income and 0% on growth as is now) may make sense and improve fairness. 6.5.4 Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT): (a) If ESCT is excluded on the employer’s KiwiSaver contributions for employees who earn less than $48,000, then many people will start to earn less than $48,000 to capture the concession. (b) Trusts and family companies will have a tax-based incentive to employ family members. (c) The introduction of an exemption of ESCT for an employee, favours employees over the self-employed and employees over volunteer workers and beneficiaries. The exemption also disadvantages a family unit where the average income is below $48,000 but one partner is above and one below the $48,000 threshold. 17 Appendix A – Op-ed The TWG’s recommendations on retirement saving lack evidence Michael Littlewood Former Co-director, Retirement Policy and Research Centre University of Auckland The Tax Working Group’s report Future of Tax – Interim Report made three recommendations on the tax treatment of retirement savings: - Remove ‘employer superannuation contribution tax’ on the 3% mandatory contributions by employers to KiwiSaver for employees’ earning up to $48,000 a year. - A five-percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE tax rates but only for savings in KiwiSaver. - Simplify the way PIE rates are applied for KiwiSaver members. The TWG’s focus on KiwiSaver suggests that New Zealanders, particularly those on lower incomes, aren’t saving enough for retirement. The TWG also seems to think that KiwiSaver is the only, or the main way, that New Zealanders should be saving for retirement. In a startling contradictory admission, however, the TWG acknowledges that New Zealanders might be saving enough for retirement. The truth is that no-one knows whether that’s actually the case. The TWG offered no evidence on this but there have been several relatively recent reports to suggest that New Zealanders seem to be rational about their financial preparations for retirement. That should not be surprising. By the end of this financial year, we taxpayers will have spent more than $10 billion since 2007 on taxpayer-funded subsidies for KiwiSaver. In 2019/20, another $840 million will head in the same direction, on current rules. The TWG thinks its suggested changes will add a further $215 million to that making a total annual spend of more than $1 billion. Here’s the thing: we don’t know whether KiwiSaver is working (raising overall savings); nor do we know whether the billions spent so far on KiwiSaver have changed anything overall. But now the TWG proposes spending even more of our money; to achieve what, exactly? KiwiSaver was Michael Cullen’s baby and he understandably takes a great deal of interest in its ‘success’, however he measures that. However, I hope that other TWG members can stand back and ask themselves some key questions: - Is KiwiSaver really working? The number of members, contributions and assets are only a small part of the answer to this. What really matters is whether KiwiSaver has lifted overall savings. - Are New Zealanders saving enough for retirement? Even if they aren’t, should that justify direct intervention through public policy initiatives? - Have the $10 billion tax subsidies to date and the expected annual $1 billion tax spend actually changed things? - Why is it that only KiwiSaver qualifies for this special tax treatment? 18 Where is the evidence for the TWG’s proposals on KiwiSaver? There is none but there should be if we taxpayers are to spend more than $1 billion a year. If the TWG’s objective is really to make the “tax treatment of retirement savings fairer” (page 6), how can it possibly support enhancing the already special treatment of KiwiSaver? In this context, what does the TWG really mean by ‘fairer’? International evidence suggests that tax breaks for retirement saving are very expensive, distortionary, inequitable, regressive and demand high, growing regulatory walls around affected assets to ensure the incentives are not ‘misused’. But worst of all, tax incentives seem not to work (raise overall savings). That’s also likely to be the case for KiwiSaver but we need to find out. Public policy settings should not overtly favour one form of saving over another. Instead, the TWG should be levelling the tax playing field for all savings and savings-related collective investment vehicles so that everyone pays their appropriate amount of tax. That’s what a ‘fair’ tax system should look like. 604 words 19 Appendix B – press release The TWG’s recommendations on retirement saving lack evidence and substance Pension researchers Michael Chamberlain and Michael Littlewood have today released a scathing submission on the Tax Working Group’s KiwiSaver recommendations. The TWG has recommended that taxpayers spend an extra $215 million a year on further tax incentives for retirement saving, aimed at the lowest-paid KiwiSaver members. Chamberlain and Littlewood published a report last year (The Missing 2016 Review) that raised many questions about New Zealand’s retirement income framework, including about whether taxpayers should be subsidising KiwiSaver. Michael Littlewood says that we taxpayers will have spent more than $10 billion since 2007 on taxpayer-funded subsidies for KiwiSaver. In 2019/20, another $840 million will head in the same direction. The TWG suggests its changes will add a further $215 million to that making a total annual spend of more than $1 billion just on KiwiSaver subsidies. “But they haven’t asked the question – is KiwiSaver actually working? Where is the evidence that New Zealanders are saving more since 2007, when KiwiSaver started? The TWG actually acknowledged that we all might be saving enough for retirement but then didn’t connect the dots. If that’s really true, why are we taxpayers spending anything on KiwiSaver, never mind an extra $215 million?” Littlewood says that the international evidence doesn’t support the case for tax-based subsidies to retirement saving. “They are very expensive, distortionary, inequitable, regressive and demand high, growing regulatory walls around affected assets to ensure the incentives are not ‘misused’. But worst of all, tax incentives seem not to work (raise overall savings). That’s also likely to be the case for KiwiSaver but we need to find out.” The TWG says it wants to make the overall tax system ‘fairer’. Littlewood says that the TWG’s definition of ‘fair’ misses the mark on KiwiSaver. He says that New Zealanders save for retirement in lots of different ways. After 11 years, the average KiwiSaver member’s balance is just $17,130, so that’s only one way they save. The job of a ‘fair’ tax system is to let New Zealanders decide what’s best for them, not to point them into any particular way of saving. Littlewood says that it’s fundamentally wrong for KiwiSaver to have a tax advantage over, for example, a workplace savings scheme. “Tax settings should not overtly favour one form of saving over another. If the TWG’s recommended capital gains tax happens, the rational saver will shift savings into international shares. Tax will be driving behaviour even more strongly than now. “Instead, the TWG should be levelling the tax playing field for all savings and savings-related collective investment vehicles so that everyone pays their appropriate amount of tax. That’s what a ‘fair’ tax system should look like.” 451 words

Through our three membership brands, the Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Business Central and ExportNZ, our organisation represents around 3,000 businesses across the central and lower North Island. Our organisation is one of the four regional organisations that make up the Business New Zealand family and is also accredited through the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce network. The Wellington Chamber of Commerce has been the voice of business in the Wellington region since 1856 and advocates policies that reflect the interest of Wellington’s business community, and the development of the Wellington economy as a whole. Business Central represents employers and provides employment, health and safety, and human resources advice, and advocates policies that reflect the interest of the business community. As a member of Business NZ, we support their work on the working group and the policy issues they have already highlighted in their letter. Below we have picked out some of the key aspects of Business NZ’s positions that are particularly important to our members. Capital gains tax The introduction of a capital gains tax as described in the report is not supported by the evidence provided and, like Business NZ, we do not support it. Particularly as the Tax Working Group states it will not move the dial significantly in the housing market – the very reason many proponents advance a CGT. We note no calculation of the net revenue to the government has been made nor an assessment of alternative methods to provide better outcomes. KiwiSaver The policy proposals affecting KiwiSaver and retirement savings require greater consideration of the consequences. Any moves which increase the differential employees experience, and effectively increases their marginal tax rates, will lead people to make different choices. An overall strategic goal of the tax system should be to make clearer the link between effort and rewards; not introduce greater complexity which takes money away from people as they make marginal increases through pay rises or promotion. We agree with Business NZ’s observation that Working for Families already has enough of these threshold triggers and the government should avoid introducing more. International OECD-led tax policy discussions to develop an international framework is the best way forward and we fully support New Zealand’s involvement in this process. We support Business NZ’s position that New Zealand should be consider an equalisation tax if a critical mass of other countries (including Australia) move in that direction. Double tax and free trade agreements should not restrict our tax policy options. GST We support all the policy recommendations regarding GST. Our simple, comprehensive system is the envy of the world and should not be lightly sacrificed to meet tangential policy goals that are best addressed directly through other policy areas. This position has been clearly and consistently held by the business community for many years. Furthermore, we consider financial transactions taxes to be poorly designed and distortionary; and urge the working group to definitely state this policy idea is not recommended at all. Future of work Support the recommendations in this section to improve technology uptake, reduce compliance costs, and increase integrity. We also support the comments of Business NZ regarding a reassessment of personal income tax rates and thresholds. Such an assessment taking into account inflation or bracket creep is important to maintain the support of the tax system and provide SMEs with effective relief. Business tax In addition to supporting tax relief for SMEs as stated above, we also support a reduction in the company tax rate. Continued inaction on the company rate means New Zealand is further falling behind other countries as they reduce their headline rate, particularly Australia. Integrity We support all the actions to improve the integrity of the tax system, while ensuring compliance costs – particularly for SMEs – does not increase. Business NZ specifically notes some actions are worthwhile pursuing as long as they do not result in burdensome processes which add costs to taxpayers or reduces the available pool of directors. Administration We support the recommendations aiming to improve administration of the tax system that also reduce compliance costs. Yours sincerely, John Milford Chief Executive Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Business Central \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Submission to Tax Working Group Interim Report From Huia Private Reserve Ltd Huia Private Reserve Ltd (HPR) is a family owned company incorporated in 1939 for the purposes of holding in open space, land at Little Huia, Auckland that has a strong connection with the Turner family, as shown in the following extract from the constitution. Edward and Maude Turner first settled at Little Huia in the 1890s after emigrating from England in 1885. The constitution also requires that shareholders must be descendants of the Edward and Maude Turner and there are now 115 family shareholders. The land is predominantly covered in native bush with some small paddocks that are grazed by adjacent landowners. The paddocks are not an economic farming unit and generate net costs not net revenue. The land is adjacent to and within the Auckland Waitakere Ranges Regional Park. Over the past 50 years, family members have gifted additional adjacent parcels to the regional park. Auckland Council, under the aegis of the Waitakere Ranges Heritage Area Act, has placed multiple zoning restrictions on the HPR property which essentially prohibits any alternative uses of the property which might generate revenue. Restrictions are so severe that even replacing a fence requires resource consent. The land is part of a heritage landscape protected by the Waitakere Ranges Heritage Area Act. By retaining the land in private ownership, Auckland residents benefit from the rates that are paid, avoiding public costs of maintenance and realize ecological and visual benefits from the land being kept in native bush and open space at no cost to them. Should the land become publicly owned, significant capital improvements would be required before it could be open for public use. Council would have to assume maintenance and improvement costs with no revenues from the land to cover them. HPR does not have any significant revenue source and currently its primary source of revenue is interest on bank deposits. The company does not pay dividends. What little revenue HPR has is used to cover Auckland Council rates, secretarial, legal and financial compliance expenses and a modest amount of maintenance on the land. The majority of maintenance work and upkeep of the bush such as pest and weed control is done voluntarily by family members. In fact, HPR has 2 such little cash resources that directors are presently considering making a share issue to raise funds from shareholders to cover the cost of removing some dangerous pine trees on the land. Some of the proposals contained in the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report 20 September 2018 would have such a serious impact on HPR that the company could no longer survive. This would be unacceptable from both a family and a public perspective given that the main purpose of HPR is to protect Jacky’s Peak, a significant Auckland landmark at Huia on the Manukau Harbour, and its surrounding native bush and paddocks as open space. The following are HPR’s views on relevant clauses in the interim report. Huia Private Reserve Ltd Comments on the TWG Interim Report HPR would argue that there be no tax on asset gains for companies and properties such as ours, that are proven and responsible long-term property reserve holders, whose stated objectives, confirmed by their track record, are to retain the reserve in its current state, care for it and to not produce a financial return for its shareholders. The purpose of HPR is to hold the land indefinitely for environmental and sentimental reasons, not for gain in monetary value, and indeed Council zoning restricts HPR from any such monetary gain. Page 6 of the TWG Executive Summary includes the following statement: “The Group is currently considering two main options: an extension of the existing tax net (through the taxation of gains on assets that are not already taxed); and the taxation of deemed returns from certain assets (known as the risk-free rate of return method of taxation). The Group is not recommending a wealth tax or a land tax.” Page 30 Para 2 states: “The Group is considering two main options for extending the taxation of capital income. These are taxing realised gains not already taxed from specific assets and taxing certain assets on a deemed return basis (a risk-free rate of return method, as an example). After consideration, the Group is not recommending either a general wealth tax or a land tax for the reasons given at the end of this chapter.” Page 154 Para 94 states: The Group proposes that gains on all land other than the family home be included in the tax base. This raises an issue as to the deductibility of expenses incurred in relation to such land where it is not used for revenue-producing purposes HPR strongly opposes application of a wealth tax or land tax. HPR also strongly opposes any taxation on deemed returns of company assets (the risk-free rate of return method). In all these cases HPR would have no ability to pay such taxes and our company would not be able to continue. The land owned by HPR is not used for revenue-producing purposes, but purely is being kept indefinitely as a natural reserve, as it has been for almost 130 years. If capital income is to be taxed, then the only workable option for HPR could be a tax on realised gains. Page 156 Para 109 states: As noted, a valuation day approach does mean there is a need to value all assets that are to be subject to the new rules as at a given day. This will impose a significant cost on many taxpayers for certain asset types. For listed shares and other market traded assets this should be relatively 3 straightforward in most cases, but it will impose compliance costs, and may be unreliable, for other assets The introduction of asset taxation on a realisation basis would possibly still require HPR to value the land at the date of implementation of the new tax regime to fulfil any possible future tax obligations. This would be an additional cost to HPR for which we have no revenues. Being land held as a natural reserve, the HPR land would be difficult to value. The value of the land is presently recorded in the company’s accounts at the rateable value. HPR would propose that the initial value be based on a low-cost option such as the Auckland Council rateable value or a value indexed to the rateable value. Page 148 Para 63 states: Alternatively, excessive deferral through trusts could be avoided if a family trust were deemed to sell its assets on a more periodic basis, e.g. every 20 years (possibly with some roll-over relief if appropriate). The Group understands Canada has a provision of this kind. Whilst this paragraph refers to trusts, it raises the possibility that a time limit could be placed on deferral of tax on gains in asset value. HPR’s constitution requires that it hold the land over a long and indefinite time with no intention of sale. As stated previously, HPR has no income from which to pay any form of asset tax within any time frame unless the land is actually sold, which would be contrary to HPR’s constitution and the public good. HPR submits that should this mechanism be employed, there should be no deemed time limit on holding assets before incurring tax on the increasing value. HPR believes other privately held land in the Waitakere Ranges Heritage Area (and which is similarly restricted from economic use) and conservation land across New Zealand could be similarly affected. Has the Tax Working Group analyzed the effect of these proposed additional taxes on conservation land held privately or by charitable trusts? HPR submits that for the net overall benefit for New Zealanders and our environment, the effect of any tax proposals on such properties and their benefit to New Zealand’s environment overall, should be fully analyzed and no additional taxation should be applied to any of our properties.

Such a tax will continue to reward those who buy and flick their family home in a continuous cycle of purchase and sales, and instead the tax would be a significant burden on people who own more than one property for other reasons than a simple property speculation. In the mid 1980’s as a student at the University of Auckland my friends and I not only wondered how we could ever afford to purchase a home in Auckland but also saw the problems finding alternative accomodation as rentals were sold by speculative owners or property “developers” rushing to make their fortunes. After graduation from university I left Auckland ultimately settling in Taranaki. My wife and I purchased a small rural property that was affordable and close to work. As we repaid the mortgage we realised that in the future the property was likely to be insufficient to provide a significant retirement fund. To partially address this potential future short-fall we purchased a small near-by run-off property running both pro perties as a single rural unit. The purchase was in many ways a strict savings scheme increasing potential future funds. The government did receive in the process significant taxes in the form of GST, duties, and continues to receive the GST on any purchases, rates, fire levies, etc. Eight years ago we purchased a small home in Ohakune that we use year round, and in particular in winter as our son enjoys skiing on Mount Ruapehu. Our Ohakune home is less valuable that many the cars and mobile homes that come to Ohakune. Indeed the government valuation has declined significantly over the period we have owned it. We do not rent the property as when we purchased the home it was in a holiday home rental scheme and we quickly realised that the costs associated with scheme far outweighed any potential income. Again the government gets its cut in taxes for any purchases, repairs, rates, and insurances on the small property, and we directly support the local economy all year round. Several of our Ohakune neighbours have sold their primary homes and retired to Ohakune living permanently in what was their secondary home; a move not even considered when their secondary home was purchased. A ‘deemed’ tax will destroy this option of a secondary home and the option for those residents who work elsewhere in summer returning to Ruapehu District each winter. I hope that in mentioning our situation you many realise that having a secondary home or property is not by default a luxury, or speculative thing, but simply part of saving and planning for life, or even finding a solution to make a living and contributing to society. I do not think you should be taxing people into obliteration for attempting to secure their future well being. I think that you should consider taxing signi ficant capital gain on the family home using a decreasing sliding scale for the duration the home has been owned. A ten year window for the potential taxation is inline with the time people are expected to keep financial records, and a reasonable time people should keep records of significant expenses related to their property. This I expect would cool the speculative circle of selling and buying the “family” home not only by property owners but also builders in a similar circle of build and occupy until the home can be sold without incurring tax. These people are using these properties as a \[1\] 2 speculative tool and short-term accomodation with no intention of long-term residence; until you address that issue it will not change and the property spiral will continue akin to a pyramid scheme. The real estate industry also has a vested interest in promoting the property speculation as it directly benefits though the percentage commission on property sales. People have to work long and hard to generate the income needed to pay the real estate commission. When property prices were low the commission system worked, but now it is part of the problem and needs an overhaul. Yours sincerely, Donald Donald Murray \[1\]
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document February 2019 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report There are serious defects in the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) Interim Report. If implemented, the recommendations • will exacerbate the already existing mansion effect in housing • will disadvantage low-income residential renters • will raise a small amount of revenue relative to current government revenue. • are unnecessarily complex. These complexities will impose high administration costs on taxpayers and tax collectors, and will invite tax avoidance The Mansion Effect I note that the report largely plays this down, most unwisely. The mansion effect already exists and will become worse if the family home is exempt from a capital gains tax (CGT). In my earlier submission, I describe the subdivision in Carterton, in which I live, as dominated by elderly couples and singles living in family-sized houses. To date, their investment choice has been vindicated. Recently the subdivision was extended with larger sections that sold like hot cakes. The houses built thus far are also larger and again are occupied by a disproportionate number of elderly couples. Already, some sections and houses have been resold at good tax-free profits. This overinvestment in housing will only get worse if the family home becomes the sole source of tax-free capital gains. The TWG report goes someway to recognising the problem by quietly floating a pro rata threshold of $5m. This is absurdly high. The most valuable house in Carterton, which truly is a mansion, sold for $3.05m in 2016. I suggest a threshold that excludes pro rata the top one-third of residential houses by value in every council district. Problems for Renters At present, the most tax advantaged house occupiers are the mortgage-free house owners. Those with mortgages indirectly pay tax through the interest paid to the mortgagee. The renters indirectly pay tax through the taxation on the rents they pay to their landlord. You advise (p.33 sec.27) that ‘housing market impacts are unlikely to be large, but it may be expected that rents will rise over time and house prices will be lower, relative to the status quo...’ (p.36, sec 28) that in the event of increased taxation on rental accommodation, ‘rents should be monitored and should they rise, government should compensate the renters.’ I can see no reason for house prices to fall, especially as the family home will become the final refuge for tax-free capital gains, but rents will rise as surely as night follows day. It is an axiom of economics that price equals cost. Tax is a cost on business. If the government imposes an additional tax on landlords, rents will rise, over time, to the extent of the increased taxation. The TWG solution is for the government to collect the tax from the landlord and hand it to low-income renters as social welfare. This is socially unsatisfactory and administratively expensive. Social welfare should be minimised because it allows some to game the system while others are unjustly denied assistance. Furthermore, many find applying for social welfare humiliating. I do not see any other reason for the inclusion of rental accommodation in the CGT net other than a desire to nail the landlords. Landlords in NZ have been unjustly demonised. These landlords are more often than not hard-working Kiwis: ordinary people who want to get ahead; people who spend their weekends mowing lawns, repairing and improving the rentals they own. Corporates cannot compete with these home handymen/women landlords which explains the rarity of corporate ownership of residential rentals in NZ. Furthermore, owning a rental has been a productive avenue for hard working Kiwis to get ahead. In recent years, successive governments have instituted measures to clip the wings of these allegedly rapacious landlords. Have the tenants benefitted from these government measures? On the contrary, the result has been a reduced supply of rentals and increased rents. 1 The CGT as outlined in the preliminary report will exacerbate inequality. The current home owners will become richer as the mansion effect causes further escalation in house prices. The renters will suffer higher rents as extra taxation is collected from landlords. While social welfare payments may lessen the effects of the rent increases, rising house prices will put home ownership further out of reach for low income people. The Revenue Problem I am surprised at the modest amount of revenues arising from the comprehensive taxation of capital gains. To persuade the voters to accept a CGT, a political party will need to offer significant off-setting tax cuts. The projected CGT revenue, especially in the initial years, falls well short of that required for significant tax cuts. Table 6.2 (p.41) shows projected revenue of $290m in the first year to rising to $5.9b in the 10 th year post implementation. In the context of current government revenue of $75b, the revenue arising from the CGT is hardly compelling, especially as the largest contribution comes from residential rentals. If this impels an equivalent transfer of compensatory payments to the renters, then the capacity to reduce other taxes to offset the CGT revenues will be ever more constrained. 1 Please note, I do not own a rental, never have and never will. The Complexity Problem The complexity of the TWG’s interim recommendations is starkly evident in Appendix B: a 43-page explanation of how the CGT might be implemented. Despite the 43 pages, the explanation is incomplete. There are problems in defining a family (excluded) home, especially if owned by a trust. Why the TWG proposes such lenient and contradictory exemptions for trusts is startling. Usually, trusts are established to avoid taxes, creditors, and/or belligerent spouses. It is in the interests of other taxpayers, creditors and aggrieved spouses that trusts be discouraged. I suspect that the reason behind the acceptance of trust ownership is that John Key spectacularly tripped David Cunliffe on this question in a televised 2014 pre-election debate. Only a home owned by a natural person should qualify as an excluded property. If trustees of house-owning trusts are unhappy about this, they can always transfer the house to the ownership of the beneficiary-occupant. The limitation of the family home to a single dwelling sounds reasonable until the term family bach/beach house enters the conversation. The family home is excluded from the CGT but not the family bach/beach house. Many see the family bach/beach house as part of the family home. It seems ironic that a mansion far larger and more valuable than a combination of a typical family and bach/beach house should be entirely exempt while the humble family bach/beach house is subject to the CGT. Then there is the problem of allowing rollovers, that is deferring the CGT in certain circumstances. For example, application of a CGT on the death the asset owner could force a spouse to sell the farm or business, so the option is to carry the CGT forward (rollover) until the next change of ownership. This seems reasonable but what if the spouse is a generation or two younger than the deceased? That would create a large deferment of the tax to the benefit of the asset-owning family. There is also the suggestion that a farmer who sells a farm to buy another farm should be able to defer the tax until the farmer ceases to own a farm. The same would apply to a business. This seems like a good plan to ease the transfer for a young farmer moving from an entry level farm to an economic unit; the same for an up and coming young business person. But, what is the difference between a farmer selling a farm to buy a better farm and a shareholder selling shares in company A to buy better shares in company B? The farmer can defer the tax, but the shareholder cannot. Why? The TWG proposes applying CGT to goodwill to include businesses in the taxation net. Most business assets depreciate; land and buildings excepted, but these often comprise a small proportion of business assets. The increase in value of a business in excess of tangible asset value is generally recorded as goodwill. From a taxation perspective goodwill is problematic because it is notoriously malleable. In 2013, the listed company PGW excised all $321m of the goodwill from its balance in one fell swoop. The previous year, the $321m of goodwill had been signed off by the auditors KPMG. Suddenly, the goodwill was zero; it was said that the company was not growing as fast as anticipated. In subsequent years, the company did quite well, but the goodwill was not reinstated. Goodwill is easy to assess when a business is sold: it is the difference between sale price and the book value of the business assets. But it can be arbitrary when a business is transferred within a family. Should the IRD identify a similar business transaction on the open market, it could be argued that the buyer paid too much. This leads to the problem that it will be relatively easy for a family to minimise CGTs when transferring a business to the next generation, but much harder for farmers, whose main assets of land and livestock are easily valued. I note that when assessing the sources and estimating CGT revenues (pp.41&136), businesses are absent while rural land is prominent. This suggests that CGTs will be collected from businesses in theory only? The suggested favourable treatment of PIE investment funds is another problem. While I acknowledge that there are difficulties in applying the CGT to PIEs, it would be grossly unfair to private investors if the PIE funds were advantaged. Should this cause private investors to switch to managed funds, the integrity of the sharemarket will suffer from less shareholder scrutiny. What’s worse is that much of the taxation advantage the PIEs might receive will be captured by the fund managers in higher fees. High fund management fees are already a recognised problem within the industry. The difficulties for PIES that the TWG have identified are indicative of the complexities of the CGT that is proposed. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to present an interim report when key issues such as a level field for taxpayers have not been resolved. Summary The CGT as outlined is complex, will not raise much revenue but will widen the wealth gap between homeowners and renters. D.J.T. Kinnell \[1\]

I have one very straight forward proposal. Rather than give tax cuts off the upper levels of taxation that really only benefit high income earners (which has happened many times during my adult life) - why not flip things and give every one exactly the same tax break by allowing the first $x,000 of everybody’s income to be tax exempt - with the tax exempt quantum being adjusted upwards as and when appropriate. I ask this in the name of equity and fairness, and also as a matter of transparency. Historically almost all tax cuts have gone to the already comfortably well off - effectively transferring even more of the nation’s wealth to them at the expense of the majority who get little or nothing (the so-called “block of cheese” tax cuts). Ideally, the tax exempt income level should be based on the minimum level of disposable income calculated to meet basic costs of necessities such as food, accomodation, etc. This is probably of the order of at least $10,000 for an individual adult (is this in fact correct? This is the sort of number that was used when I studied economics a long time go - it is probably quite a bit more these days). In the first years of such a scheme I would expect the quantum to be set considerably lower as it was phased in at an affordable level for the government and then increased over several years to reach whatever level is deemed appropriate (this might mean for example that the sum is set at say $3,000 in year 1, quickly increasing to $6,000 in year 2 and $10,000 in year 3, after which it would become inflation-linked with much smaller increments - apart from those years when a tax cut was deemed appropriate, it which case it could be stepped up by a decent notch. The various steps in the income tax schedules could then be modified as required to ensure that overall tax income for the state was maintained at an appropriate level to compensate for the significant amount forgone to allow a universal tax free portion of their income. If and when it was felt advisable to have tax cuts these could largely be achieved by appropriate increases in the level of tax free income. I would argue that such a scheme would be considerably easier to implement, manage and administer than the alternative which some are proposing - i.e. The UBI (Universal Basic Income) or similar scheme which would actually pay everyone a common level of basic income and hence (largely or even totally) replace the benefit system . Although I understand that several countries are already trialing this concept (eg. Kenya at just $1,000 per person per annum whereas Switzerland is considering $2,600 per month), perhaps we should just wait a few years and see how the theory actually works out in practice. Cheers and good luck with your task. Graeme Easte \[1\] \[1\] 2 \[1\]

We wish to submit comments in respect of the Report’s comments on building depreciation deductions contained in paragraphs 68 through to 72, Chapter 14. As a consultancy providing corporate finance and advice services to government, institutional and corporate clients in the property and infrastructure sectors we have extensive experience in the behaviour and valuation of assets in this sector. Our comments follow: 1. Our experience is that nearly all structures, including buildings, experience both physical and economic obsolescence irrespective of their history of repairs and maintenance. 2. The case of seismic strengthening cited in the Report is but one example of a much larger set of regulatory, market and environmental factors that cause physical and economic obsolescence of buildings. 3. In the case of residential buildings our opinion is that multi-unit residential buildings have a much higher risk of obsolescence than stand-alone dwellings. This is because, compared to a stand-alone dwelling, multi-unit residential buildings: a. have significantly higher building standard regulatory risk b. are more likely to occupy land that develops higher-value uses c. are more likely to be constructed with materials and in locations that create high costs of re-tasking or significantly altering the building to meet new requirements 4. The decision to abolish depreciation deductions for buildings with effect from 2012 was a pragmatic response to the issues that the government faced at the time. However the abolition has affected the neutrality of the tax system and in particular in the case of housing directs investment away from development of multi-unit residential rental buildings, that are likely to provide the lowest cost accommodation in metropolitan centres for New Zealanders unable to afford to own their home. 5. We believe there is a strong case for the reinstatement of depreciation deductions on multi-unit residential, commercial and industrial buildings.

I am a former Tax Consultant with Deloitte, and Tax Solicitor with Russell McVeagh. I support much of the Tax Working Group's work, particularly on behavioural taxes like increasing tax on sugar and cigarettes and other anti-social products that cause huge costs to the health system, and salute the Group's dedication and diligence on their enormous task. In my submission, I focus on Capital Taxation. Whilst I strongly disagree with the introduction of a capital gains tax, conversely I do support a capital income tax with an extension of the brightline test to 10 years and simplifying subpart CB on land taxation in the Income Tax Act 2007. Capital taxation - submission against a capital gains tax Currently New Zealand has one of the higher company tax rates in the OECD. This doesn't help businesses get money to reinvest for growth, resulting in a low-investment, low-productivity economy. We would like to see our Government commit to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes through tax policy. Tax is punitive by definition as it takes money from those who created it. The Tax Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand is far far more than just the Government, it is the people. He aha a te mea nui. He tangata. He tangata. He tangata. We, New Zealand people, will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. Jason Clemens, Charles Lammam, and Matthew Lo for the independent Canadian research group the Fraser Institute note: "Capital gains taxes, of course, raise revenues for government but they do so with considerable economic costs. Capital gains taxes impose costs on the economy because they reduce returns on investment and thereby distort decision making by individuals and businesses. This can have a substantial impact on the reallocation of capital, the available stock of capital, and the level of entrepreneurship". There are many reasons why the capital gains tax harms economic performance. Clemens, Lammam and Lo explain the "lock-in effect." "Capital gains are taxed on a realization basis. This means that the tax is only imposed when an investor opts to withdraw his or her investment from the market and realize the capital gain. One of the most significant economic effects is the incentive this creates for owners of capital to retain their current investments even if more profitable and productive opportunities are available. Economists refer to this result as the "lock-in" effect. Capital that is locked into suboptimal investments and not reallocated to more profitable opportunities hinders economic output. ...Peter Kugler and Carlos Lenz (2001)...examined the experience of regional governments ("cantons") in Switzerland that eliminated their capital gains taxes. The authors’ statistical analysis showed that the elimination of capital gains taxes had a positive and economically significant effect on the long-term level of real income in seven of 2 the eight cantons studied. Specifically, the increase in t he long-term level of real income ranged between 1.1 percent and 3.0 percent, meaning that the size of the economy was 1 percent to 3 percent larger due to the elimination of capital gains taxes." Clemens, Lammam and Lo further analyse the impact of capital gains taxes on the "user cost" of capital investment. "Capital gains taxes make capital investments more expensive and therefore less investment occurs. ...Several studies have investigated the link between the supply and cost of venture capital financing and capital gains taxation, and found theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting a direct causality between a lower tax rate and a greater supply of venture capital. ...Kevin Milligan, Jack Mintz, and Thomas Wilson (1999) sought to estimate the sensitivity of investment to changes in the user cost of capital...and found that decreasing capital gains taxes by 4.0 percentage points leads to a 1.0 to 2.0 percent increase in investment". Next, they investigate the impact on entrepreneurship. "Capital gains taxes reduce the return that entrepreneurs and investors receive from the sale of a business. This diminishes the reward for entrepreneurial risk-taking and reduces the number of entrepreneurs and the investors that support them. The result is lower levels of economic growth and job creation. ...Analysing the stock of venture capital and tax rates on capital gains from 1972 to 1994, Gompers and Lerner found that a one percentage point increase in the rate of the capital gains tax was associated with a 3.8 percent reduction in venture capital funding". Last but not least, the authors also discuss the impact of capital gains taxation on compliance costs, administrative costs, and tax avoidance. They also look at the marginal efficiency cost of capital gains taxation and report on some of the research in that area. "Dale Jorgensen and Kun-Young Yun (1991)...estimate the marginal efficiency costs of select US taxes and find that capital-based taxes (such as capital gains taxes) impose a marginal cost of $0.92 for one additional dollar of revenue compared to $0.26 for consumption taxes. ...Baylor and Beausejour find that a $1 decrease in personal income taxes on capital (such as capital gains, dividends, and interest income) increases society’s well- being by $1.30; by comparison, a similar decrease in consumption taxes only produces a $0.10 benefit. ...the Quebec government’s Ministry of Finance...found that a reduction in capital gains taxes yields more economic benefits than a reduction in other types of taxes such as sales taxes. Reducing the capital gains tax by $1 would yield a $1.21 increase in the GDP". Therefore I strongly submit against imposition of a Capital Gains Tax in New Zealand. Simplifying taxation of capital income from land sales Currently you are taxed for capital income from the sales of land (real property) if you:  buy and sell a property within five years from 29 March 2018 and onwards;  within two years if the property was purchased between 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive;  within ten years if you were a property dealer or developer at the time you bought the property. This is regardless of whether the purchase was part of your property business or not;  within ten years if you sell a property that had building work being completed on the property, and you were a builder or in the building business at the time you bought the property. This is regardless of whether the purchase was part of your building business or not; 3  any time from any properties you sell, which were bought as part of your property or building business; and  If you're associated with someone in the property industry - you're an "associated person". This means you may have to pay tax on all or some of your property transactions, even if you're not personally a property dealer, developer or builder. These transactions include tax on the sale of a property if you had an association with: - a property dealer or developer when you brought the property, - a builder when significant improvements started on a property.  any time when a property has been bought with the firm intention of resale you'll have to pay tax on any profit from the sale. The intention to sell does not need to be the main reason for buying the property - it could be one of a number of reasons for buying. I submit that these rules are confusing and should be simplified. Sections CB6A to CB23B of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be altered to provide that any sale within a ten (10) year period be subject to capital income tax on land with the exception of home owners and business owners (irrespective of the entity they choose to own the land in), provided there are no more than two sales in any two year period and no more than five sales in any ten year period. This means the brightline test would be ten years, the builder/trader/developer and associated persons test go to be ten years, and the firm intention is difficult to prove, and negligible revenue is collected from land sales over ten years. The goal is to ensure speculators and traders are taxed, and to ensure a genuine creation of long term housing stock in New Zealand. Holding property for ten years is fantastic and lets New Zealanders provide for both their retirement and also New Zealande rs accommodation needs. Therefore the beauty is the simplicity. I submit that every land sale is subject to capital income within 10 years, with the sole exception being sales by home-owners and business owners, who may have no more than two sales in any two year period, and no more than five sales in any ten year period. I wish the Tax Working Group all the best in their consideration of my submissions to have a ten year capital income tax on land sales, and not to implement any Capital Gains Tax. Yours sincerely, David Whitburn

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. \[1\] 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Personal re-submission due to non acknowledgement of original: RE: The Future of Tax Submissions from the Public Dear Sir/Madam 3 This Submission is made in good faith as collective suggestions as to how the future tax system may be made “Fairer” and more equitable in New Zealand. I do sincerely trust that you listen, and act on this notwithstanding the fact that you may have already pre- prescribed the working Group’s Policy Statement recommendations in readiness for September 2018, and this “public” forum is in all probability simply a public “PR” exercise? I have read, understood and accepted your Privacy policy. You have my permission to publish this entire document and my name on your website, but not my email or street address ( both of the latter for obvious privacy and security reasons) other than that, I have no issue with disclosing any thing in this submission from a privacy point of view and there is nothing commercially sensitive disclosed here, just the truth from a concerned taxpayer. How to use this document: Because of the contextual and technical nature of much of this Tax Policy statement I have decided to respond primarily and directly to the https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm- bgrd-paper-mar18.pdf - “ TWG\_bgrd”, this means my response can be read in the context of your proposals and hopefully have more contextual meaning to you as a reader, so that I do not have to repeat any statements you have already made in the TWG\_bgrd. By reference to: My notation ref Ann ( Alpha , number number ) Section Snn Page Number Pnn Heading Head ( where appropriate) Paragraph Pann (if appropriate ) A1 Executive Summary P5 There are a lot of misrepresentations in your TWG\_bgrd document: The Current tax system does not have “Horizontal Equity “ and does not treat “...the same treatment for people in the same circumstances....” Rather, the NZ Tax Base is a Socialist Transfer System that seeks to reward the unproductive, or incapacitated members of society by taking much higher amounts of tax from those who have tried to save and “get ahead” whether that be by saving, or starting a business and handing that over to the more ‘needy’ members of Society, and done on a fiscal yearly spend as you collect basis. 4 That is fine and moral as far as it goes but is certainly NOT horizontal Equity “ The current NZ Tax system DOES modify behaviour, individuals use legal vehicles like Companies, Trusts, Partnerships, etc to minimise tax obligations, for example if they see or incur losses on the Stock Market they will buy property ( “safe” bricks and Mortar – though not in Christchurch!) An anecdotal personal example: I have never bought or sold a Company share or stock market share in my life - Why>? During 1987 I decided to informally study the share market behaviour, and taught myself some basic “charting” principles. In February 1987 there was an inverted “head and shoulders” in the share market. At the time I told my wife to get her super savings out of a managed fund her employer had originally set up for her, she lost 10% of it then, but if she had waited until October she would have lost the entire savings. We invested the along with some further savings into a second property ( to live in, with a very hefty mortgage) and last year that property sold for not a bad risk averse return for going into debt heavily. I knew of others who lost everything in 1987. That is why New Zealanders love property, it is SAFE, you will not lose in a share market crash. On the subject of New Zealand Tax Policy “NOT” being used to Modify Behaviour - I disagree. TAX POLICY MODIFIES BEHAVIOUR PUBLIC TAX POLICY STATEMENTS BY THE MINSTER OF FINANCE MODIFIES BEHAVIOUR Another Anecdotal Personal Example that the now Hon Sir Michael Cullen may well remember from his days as Minister of Finance 2003-2004 please ask him – it is materially relevant to what you are trying to do now in this Taxation Review process: And what follows, is a factual historical outcome submitted here as evidence of previous tax “policy” mis- applied via faulty legislation: Timeline> \[1\] \[1\] 5 2/7/2004 - Media Statement by Minister of Finance (Hon M Cullen) 5/7/2004 – Letter from John W Andrews to Michael Cullen – Minister of Finance Objecting to his provocative and inflammatory media statement of Friday 2/7/2004 that ....”on the Death of a Taxpayer...there would be a deemed sale at date of death” I have the physical newspaper article still, along with the Hon Michael Cullen’s press release, and personal reply.  Michael Cullen refused to answer my questions and issues raised re death and sale, or explain himself. All he replied was to give a depreciation policy 5/7/2004 – Letter from JWA to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Stating my objection to the word “death “ being a “deemed Sale” by Hon Michael Cullen, I advise IRD directly that I am –re-structuring my taxation position based on the advice of my solicitor  IRD do not reply To cut a very very long story short, the outcome of Hon M. Cullen’s tax “policy” statement ( read intention) was that I was hounded by IRD for some years over a “deemed”value of a property transfer that was not a “sale”. In 2010 I was taxed according to the Revenue’s “interpretation” of their Rule of Law and charged penalty interest retrospectively. I then did considerable research into the Revenue’s respective pieces of legislation. After some years of dialogue, communications and meetings they refused to accept my interpretation of the legislation. This culminated in my initiating court action against them (please see John Wayne Andrews v CIR TRA 001/2014 ) because my evidence exposed their mis-application of the law they quickly refunded the tax with interest to prevent the action going further in Court which would have exposed them to a class action from thousands of taxpayers who had been abused in exactly the same manner as I was. So, to the reader of this document - if nothing else is gleaned from this submission please be aware that your proposed Tax Policy changes will have embedded mistakes, your changes will be open to interpretation, arbitrage and the fair principles of legal tax minimisation because luckily there are unqualified people like me out on the street who will stand up to your “authoritarian” edicts and win legal cases with the truth. The full 350 pages of evidential legal submission, angst and personal cost can be presented and discussed with you – if you choose! 6 Please JUST GET IT RIGHT and do not put members of the public through what I had to go through. Because you ( the then Finance Minister - Hon Michael Cullen ) got a few words of “Policy” wrong. A2 Executive Summary P6 Thinking outside the Current system Why would you as a tax policy working group want to suggest raising extra taxes based on ...” international debate about income and wealth inequality...” ? Please explain your ‘waffly’ and ‘woolley’ thinking ? Income and wealth inequality is based on a huge number of factors: Government policy : Immigration - admitting new migrants with lesser skills, or greater skills that displace existing workers. Political decisions not based on Cost benefit Analyses – eg. No further Oil and Gas Exploration to please the Green political party with a loss of 11,000 jobs Student Debt that hampers a whole generation of youths because the Government want to “feed the Education sausage machine” and make money out of foreign Students. Government Housing Policy that makes homes unaffordable, high bank indebtedness, inflated house valuations by QV. Those who have become “wealthy” have usually done so because of Hard Work, those who have not become “wealthy” are usually “poorer” because they have not worked hard or have not dared to go into business because the business climate or cost structure is too harsh, academic education is not necessarily a precursor to income or wealth creation. And you want to intervene into Human Choice ? and then tax some and not others ? because they have tried harder ? 7 Unfortunately the Tax Working Group is not “God” and nor can you play at being “Gods” and intervene with an Orwellian Utopia feel good “policy”. I am sorry but you are beginning to sound like the Hon Michael Cullen in 2004 with his re-defining the legal meaning of Death. You will always have income and wealth inequality under Socialism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Fascism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Communism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Totalitarianism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Capitalism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Trumpism You will always have income and wealth inequality under AngelaMerklism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Leftism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Rightism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Globalism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Patriotism You will always have income and wealth inequality under Nanny Statism Any “......ism” you can think of – New Zealand is actually an amalgam of some of the above ...”ism’s” And the same for all these I haven’t thought of : https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List\_of\_forms\_of\_government You cannot change Human Nature – please be realistic! Your statement on Page 6 .....” Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform....” Sorry, but is a total LIE : Differential Entity tax rates of 17.5%, 28%, 33% IS NOT “quite uniform”. 8 With regards to the taxing of online sales – yes I think that is a good idea, by all means charge GST on imported small value items –all this is going to do is force small New Zealand companies out of business because they are uncompetitive in this globalised commodities market – the result is and will be very simple and straightforward, NZ consumers buys overseas because the “cost” and “profit” structure in NZ is too high because we are so small and the compliance costs so high, that GST impact is, and will be minimal because the online sales are still cheaper relatively speaking. Another anecdotal example : I can buy a book from the Book Depository in the UK with free shipping across the world at half the price that local NZ book sellers will sell it at, it is courier delivered to my letterbox, then straight to my study. Also you might want to consider introducing a foreign workers company payroll tax – by this I mean all the large NZ corporates who take NZ jobs away from New Zealanders and award them to workers offshore ( outsourcing, etc) and to be “Fair” those companies should be taxed heavily for destroying New Zealand’s economic base. I can guarantee you will be too scared to implement that ? That is why Trump’s Patriotic sentiment is so popular – i.e to bring the US jobs back home and fight Globalisation, and this is why the trade ‘wars’ will continue for some years. There is no ‘Left’ or ‘Right’ any more in world politics – it simply comes down to Globalisation vs Patriotism. A2 Executive Summary P7 Specific Challenges Capital Gains tax: CGT Is simply a wealth tax and is already in place. What further taxes are to be introduced ? In any event the family home including those held by Trusts should be exempt. It will be political suicide for the party who tries to implement it , because of the overseas experience that it does nothing to alleviate the problem of housing affordability. People invest in their homes for SAFETY and security – the minute you start attacking that, and or introduce death duties on the family home or even investments then you will have a tax revolt on your hands as that is the height of unfairness and in all honesty is just a tax grab aimed at taxing the people in society who have worked and saved hard to buy a home or provide for themselves and families in later life . 9 Instead of a blanket CGT why not tax the change in equity a Borrower makes when borrowing heavily to acquire an investment? Presently Savers are penalised in that they are taxed on savings income with NO allowance for inflation whereas Borrowers get off “scott free” and pocket the capital gain generated by their borrowing. A “Change in Equity” tax could apply to other asset classes as well like farms, or businesses that have to borrow heavily, but would only accrue when the farm or business is finally sold and where no other asset of the same class is purchased ( or exchanged) in its place. In short, if you are going to introduce tax “Fairness” then you need to balance the Saver – Borrower imbalance. If a person or tax entity is a Commodities trader, e.g. in stocks or shares, or fine art, collectibles etc then the capital gains made are ALREADY being taxed, as are the profits of traders in Property via the Bright Line rule. See www.ird.govt.nz/campaigns/2018/brightline.html You have already introduced the Capital Gains tax so please stop trying to mislead the public by this form of misrepresentation. Please acknowledge the facts of the current ACTUAL situation. I strongly suspect there is a further hidden agenda here ? that has not been published in your background paper?. Would it be fair comment to suggest that you are in fact putting forward a “wealth” or “death tax”? Even though that is not directly alluded to in the paper ? If you do, or intend to, then I suggest you set a tax free threshold of at least two million dollars, simply because if a taxpayer is an Aucklander and has saved or invested for their retirement then that figure is probably the only realistic benchmark for self responsibility. But on reflection I am not sure that the tax working group rewards or wishes to promote “taxpayer” Self Responsibility? Taxes collected should be fiscally neutral, 30% of GDP is actually quite high, from your statement, I interpret this to mean that for every dollar generated in the economy the government takes thirty cents in tax? You would do well to look at how prosperous are other countries who have adopted much lower rates e.g. Hong Kong at 16.5% - this actually supports my recommendation of a single tier flat 17.5% tax across all taxation entities mentioned below. You would do well to adopt a single tier tax system like Hong Kong: 10 https://www.guidemehongkong.com/business-guides/supporting-a-business/hong-kong-tax-rates-and- income-tax-system Progressive Company tax: Taxes for all entities (Companies, Trusts, Maori entities etc ) should be set at 17.5 % (but not including the rate for GST) then there will be no unfairness, no arbitrage etc. Environmental taxation: You have NO right to Tax the air we breathe or the water we drink, you already tax food . You ( the government ) do NOT own the air or the water of the land – the people do, all of us – all ethnic groups and not just the Maori who originally murdered all the original Maoriori inhabitants and drove them off to the Chathams. By all means take a water tax off the bottlers selling the Canterbury Aquifer waters overseas – that water theft is criminal and I understand there already is a huge public outcry against it. You already have a carbon emissions scheme- deal with it , all that scheme is doing is making private organisations in Europe, and Eastern Europe especially, wealthy at the cost of the New Zealand taxpayer. Have the Tax working group really understood what is really going on with the ETS ? you need to open your eyes. Please excuse the analogy but .... https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/can-t-see-the-wood-for-the-trees Likewise, introducing “behaviour taxes” is quite intrusive and does overstep a basic human fundamental of the “Right to Choose”. The choice to (further ) tax fossil fuel vehicles has not been though through, by far the bulk of New Zealanders cannot afford to buy an Electric Vehicle (EV) , you could provide a tax incentive towards their purchase and like the German Republic you could provide tax incentives to convert to Solar or other forms of fossil free energy use. But current and past governments have refused to do this why? GST Exemptions: Will be costly to implement, but NZ has already the highest paying GST ( VAT ) rate in the entire OECD simply give the low income earners relief directly. 11 B1 S2 P10 The Future Changing Demographics: Increasing Taxes on Capital Income and reducing PAYE income tax creates a deferential tax bias that penalises older taxpayers who have already spent the bulk of their lives paying taxes – that is extremely unfair. Tax has already been paid on the earnings of their usually fixed incomes. That sort of generational tax bias is not acceptable, and would be political suicide for whomever implements it. Raising taxes on spending i.e. by raising GST will affect low to middle income families much more than for retirees for example. Please see this crude but interesting analysis of generational spending shown below. I would add in New Zealand’s case for the age tranche of say 18 years to early thirties years of age that section of taxpayers are spending ( or borrowing ) money to purchase :- Education, Travel, High tech gadgets, Rent, and living cost consumables including entertainment Cars, Fashion and clothes, With the exception of retirement travel ( for those who can afford it ) by far the bulk of this spending is made by the age tranche 18-35 12 Vis - ” Harry Dent Aged Demographic Spending Curve” Excerpt Credit and Copyright acknowledgment for review purposes is accredited to Harry Dent. Retirees do not spend like young families or young singles do. Older Generations have ALREADY contributed to their future health care by the taxes they have already paid in their youth as New Zealanders for 40 or 50 years previously. The Major problem that all Governments of all generations face is that they do not Actuarially set aside taxes paid on a user or generational base to provide for their future drawdown - much like the ACC model or the original Cullen Super Fund that was stopped by a later Government. Governments “of the Day” spend all the taxes fiscally gained in one year on whatever they choose with no thought for the future use or who should actuarially benefit from the original Taxation Contribution. How about introducing a tax and savings policy that is CONTRIBUTORY based ? like the ACC model where taxes collected are ringfenced into areas of PRESENT and FUTURE use. E.g. current and future road use, a well made road has a life expectancy of over 50 years – amortise the tax over the life of the road, the same with taxes collected for future superannuation, and future health requirements. The “Spend as you Go” policy is foolhardy to say the least and quite irresponsible. You are correct, the tax system does NOT encourage saving for retirement and instead penalises savers or investors for attempting to provide for themselves and not rely on a so-called “Nanny State” ( which in all truth is a Transfer Payment Socialist State, not even capitalist, oh... never mention the “C” word in a tax policy working group J they’re so “evil” ) Savings are made from TAX PAID PAYE or business income 13 The savings or investment income during its life is TAX PAID ( deducted at source) Why on earth would a Government be so greedy and inequitable as to TRIPLE tax retirement savings on drawdown when they are needed most? I don’t think even Robin Hood would see the “fairness” in that ? King John may have though J C1 S3 Page 19 Equity and Fairness You go to great lengths in this section and in many other areas of the TWG\_bgrd document stating that that the tax system is fair and should continue to be “fair” in the future. I would suggest that your version of “Fairness” is very subjective and the tax structure is basically UNFAIR. What is “Fair” about granting a Concessionary tax rate of 17.5 % to Maori owned businesses where the “pakeha” Company rate is 28 %, the Trust rate is 33% and the top personal rate is 33% with the average personal rate being somewhere between 20% and 25% depending on the weighting of the tranche being observed. And finally what is fair about the rort of the AIL by Foreign interest bearing investors ( Approved Issuer Levy ) Rate of 2% that has the effect of cheating all New Zealanders when they are forced to pay the full NRWT tax rate ? The AIL an unfairness that falsely uses lack of savings in NZ as the excuse to get supposedly cheaper funding from overseas. IT systems and processes do exist to ensure NZ savers have a chance to invest with an equivalent of AIL level tax regime. Can you please consider a tax law which insists that Corporates, Government and Individual businesses first seek ANY debt to be satisfied internally within New Zealand, and kick starting a virtual cycle of retention of interest flows within NZ and further investment of these returns taxed fairly i.e. no more or no less than overseas funders? Many years before the Panama Papers were published ( 9/5/2016) I had alerted a number of NZ Finance / Revenue Ministers ( Bill English, Peter Dunne, Todd McCLay and even PM John Key) of the Rort of Foreign owned trusts not paying tax in New Zealand, but as usual no listened to a very small resident taxpayer voice. So the question is raised are you really prepared to introduce “Fairness” 14 From experience I actually doubt your ability to do this? On the subject of Foreign Owned companies the Chinese own a good portion of our sovereign debt, and have intentionally infiltrated a lot of our commercial and wealth creation vehicles, do you understand that you are allowing New Zealand to be ‘sold out under our feet’ ? What tax policy are you introducing to safeguard sovereign ownership of our assets for our own future generations? Do you understand what is about to happen when the tap of financing cheap money supply is turned off? I don’t think so? If you want to PROMOTE FAIRNESS why don’t you propose setting the tax rate for all companies, trusts, Foreign owned trusts and Partnerships at 17.5% especially new businesses for the first two years. Furthermore why is it that you penalise NZ Family trusts at a rate of 33%? These sorts of trusts are set up by self responsible settlors wishing to provide for their spouses and families? Instead of relying on the interference of a “Nanny State” these trusts are distributing Capital and Income without relying on taxpayer funding or engineered Socialist meddling. So why does the current and future proposed system actively penalise self responsibility so harshly? The Maori owned business concession tax rate is blatantly racist against all other ethnic groups in NZ except Maori, and contravenes the Bill of Rights Act and the Human Right Act by this overt discrimination. PLEASE CORRECT THIS anomaly that is really Intentional Political discrimination aimed at “placating” Maori even after they have been granted Billions of Taxpayer assets, income and tax transfers at the cost of all other ethnic groups in New Zealand. As an afterthought you might want to investigate why those tax breaks and resulting prejudiced profits are not filtering down to the iwi children who really need the financial help the most? 15 With regard to the discussion over ...”vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax)..” I recommend that for Sickness Beneficiaries, war Veterans, Students and Superannuitants that there should be a tax free beginning threshold of say $10,000 (possibly 15,000) meaning that from 0-15,000 is not taxed, and tax accrues only after that level. New Zealand does not treat these areas of society particularly well. NZ is a low wage high cost economy and in case you haven’t tried it, try living on a student allowance or pension, it is not easy ! C2 S3 P20 last paragraph This statement in your paper does not make grammatical sense ....”This is because a tax on profits (i.e. after allowing deductions for costs) will generally lead to firms continuing to make similar businesses decisions with a tax that they would without the tax....” Please explain? If you adopted my single tier flat tax all of the problems referred to on this page would go away. The tax Working Group needs to do a lot more research , and I mean a lot, before you can even consider introducing “Social Cost “ taxation, at the moment the logic you demonstrate is incomplete and not fully thought through, and your background paper does not go any where near addressing the issues and considerations with this form of a new “tax grab”. D1 S4 Page 24 Sources of Taxation Revenue After allowing for GST and sundries it is interesting to see that approximately 70 -74% of all taxes collected comes from individuals with only 26-30 % coming from Company taxes. You will have the exact breakdown, but what I have stated here is pretty close to the truth. So roughly three quarters of all revenue is paid for BY the people and hopefully USED by the people? For mostly Education, Health and Welfare etc. Time does not permit research of that here but I will investigate, if you can confirm that, then the balance appears fair, if it is not true then then you have an issue that you have not addressed? 16 It would be an interesting calculation to establish how much of the NZ Generated GDP is repatriated offshore to the parent companies who own the 30% of GDP profits that is not benefiting New Zealanders? I would challenge you to publish those statistics? And establish “fairness” in that context? i.e. WHERE ARE THE PROFITS of New Zealand GDP are actually ending up ? D1 S4 P26 Taxes and Behaviour Again I totally disagree with you mis-representation of the Taxed – Taxed – Exempt argument concerning retirement savings ( TTE) : You statement is a total lie 1. Retirement savings are saved from tax paid income originally 2. The income from the savings is taxed through out its life 3. On drawdown the retirement savings income cashed are cumulatively added to the owners taxpayer’s liability for the year realised This is TAXED, TAXED , TAXED ( TTT) You are SUCH LIARS and yet you think you can table a background document like this and go un- noticed ? And just for the record the KiwiSaver PIE incomes are Taxed , most providers simply offset some of the earnings for the year to offset the tax due, again another one of your lies! S5 P28 Individual Income tax All that figure 7 shows is that New Zealanders pay amongst the highest of all OECD countries in terms of top personal income tax rates – that is hardly an award winning precedence and totally inequitable when read in context with a fixed corporate rate, concessionary Maori rate and AIL levy? 33% is NOT a low personal tax rate! 17 D2 S4 P28 Taxes and Behaviour Your statement that Corporates only contribute 4.6% of GDP in terms of Tax take, displays the extent of your tax base IN-EQUITY. By default the remaining 95.4% is generated from private individuals or private partnership businesses and of course government spending, which in NZ has always been traditionally over 40% of every dollar spent in the economy! (The GDP formula (Y) is personal consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports - Y = C + I + G + X ) If you cannot see the in-equity displayed by your own statistics then you do not deserve to be on the Tax working group panel. S5 P30 Company Income tax and GST Figure 8 Company income tax rates and revenues – simply shows that NZ companies are the best in the OECD at minimising tax payable – hardly equitable is it? Figure 9 Value-added taxes as a percentage of GDP on page 30 shows clearly that New Zealand has the HIGHEST rate of GST ( per GDP ) in the entire OECD THAT is APPALLING ! GST in New Zealand SHOULD BE REDUCED back to a more equitable 10-12 % but of course you will not do that as your brief is NOT really about equity is it? Let’s be honest? Figure 10 on page 31 is not properly explained – the deciles are not annotated as to what they mean, i.e the deciles are meaningless unless you show the weightings of that decile in terms of actual population taken numbers from the cohort. Again, a little ‘sleight of hand’ misrepresentation by the TWG 18 On page 34 – the “targeted approach” has the effect of stifling any effort a low income household (i.e receiving benefits) will make to earn more because any income they earn above their benefit will accrue tax at 80 cents in the dollar – that is hardly equitable and the main reason why it is not worth them trying to work and get ahead. Please consider the reality of many New Zealanders Figure 11 similarly ? The statistics on page 36 are particularly damming, and EVIDENCE of the FAILURE OF YOUR TAX POLICY TO DATE Please learn from your past mistakes (also you should have defined ‘Gini’ in your document I couldn’t find any explanation there) But see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini\_coefficient It is now 11:25 pm 30/4/2018 and I have run out of submission time , so the document is now sent unfinished. So in conclusion my suggested tax policy I submit to you is summarised as : 1.Tax should be Contributory and Actuarially based so that the original contributors of the tax benefit from the tax as and when they come to use it in the present and in the future. 2.Tax across all commercial business vehicles and individuals should be equal. 3. There should be no Tax bias based on Ethnic preference or factional Favouritism. 4. Sickness Beneficiaries , Students , Veterans and Superannuitants should be granted a minimum tax- free threshold that supports a basic humanitarian living standard (i.e living wage). 5 Foreign entities should pay the same level of tax as New Zealanders with no political favouritism. Let us see if you can measure up, Fairly? And I hope you listen and take action second time around 19 Yours faithfully John Wayne Andrews

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 From:jason clarke <action@campaignnow.co> Sent: Tuesday, 30 October 2018 2:49 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Reply submission to Tax Working Group's interim report and proposals Dear Michael Cullen and Tax Working Group, Has A actual benifit and assesment been done to know if we are actually saving more money???? As far as i know Kiwis savings are not increasing. Kiwisaver is a the pet project of Cullen. Why put more tax money into subsidising savings when we dont actually know if its working. Many other countries have done this and failed miserably in the past. How can there be a recommendation to subsidise savings when you the tax working group havnt done the necessary assesments and cannot back it up by evidence.?? I am STRONGLY apposed to the Capital gains tax suggestions. Iam stringly opposed to the wealth tax suggestion - Re taxing the family bach. This is absoulutely Rediculous and i will march the streets to oppose this. This is a submission in reply to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Interim Report. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. 2 If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. 3 I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely,

Between my wife and I was are paying close to in Tax. What you need to look at is- after assisting with Tax paid dollars our daughter through University doing Med. Our only child (Daughter) will then hit the work force, being a valuable member of the community and paying tax. So you have in one Generateration gone from two well paid but also very highly taxed parents to one Tax paying individual. On the other side of town we have two parents on Welfare who have had 9 children, and these nine children will most likely be dependants on the state. So think very carefully how much you expect to bleed the working via taxes before they say enough and loose the desire to get into substantial debt, then work their arses off to help pay for the larger and every increasing welfare dependant in this country. This is a submission in reply to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Interim Report. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation \[1\] 2 New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. 3 Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely,

I regret not having the hours needed to carefully study and give a detailed response to this Interim Report and the Taxpayers' Union submission. Nonetheless I feel compelled to say two things you must already know. 1) Like most of the Western world, New Zealanders are overtaxed. 2) This tax burden falls disproportionally on low and fixed-income taxpayers. For example, National raised prescription costs from $3 per item to $5. The coalition government hasn't brought this back down to $3. Reducing prescription costs could have been funded (largely if not entirely) by NOT donating millions this year to The Clinton Foundation. What have the Clintons or their shonky foundation ever done for New Zealand taxpayers? Yes, if people choose a healthy diet and lifestyle they might need less prescriptions. But what about people who simply can't afford a healthy diet? Budget white bread and tomato sauce sandwiches are filling and far cheaper than 1 kg apples. Cheap, carbohydrate-high foods predispose to health problems like diabetes. 'Grow your own fruit and vegetables' isn't an option for the homeless, or invalids, or time-pressed workers doing long hours in low-paid jobs. The government had the chance to lift some pressure off low and fixed income Kiwis at a time when incomes are further cut by illness. Instead? It donated millions to The Clinton Foundation. The point: government already has ample tax revenue pouring in. The state does not need a capital gains tax. You can guarantee when capital gains tax is extended to family homes - and it will be - politicians will mockingly justify it to 'them out there' as fairness. What we need is more accountability to taxpayers and saner spending of New Zealand taxes to directly benefit New Zealanders. No foreign foundations. No ridiculously high pay to arrogant pub lic 'servants'. No upping the numbers of overpaid government employees and their strangulating red tape. No corporate welfare. No overseas aid thrown away on corrupt foreign bureaucracies. No taxes blown on thousands of elderly, sick and criminal migrants who come here to leach and contribute nothing. Tax spending decisions are made by career politicians so short on low-income Kiwi experience, they have no insight into what it's like to be too poor to meet someone for a coffee. They have no idea of what it's like to choose between paying for petrol to get to work, or pay for the power, or pay the doctor. They do not know what it's like to limp from low payday to low payday. Or how it feels to hear a well-fed, flashly- dressed and heavily-bejewelled Winz case manager - usual public 'servant' lifestyle courtesy of other's taxes - lecture you about budgeting. I suggest a wide-ranging royal commission to call for ideas to cut mismanagement of state spending. To encourage high public participation it should hold hearings in the main centres. I also suggest it be chaired by an honest but astute individual heading a similar committee. One without a hidden agenda to change tax rules to increase voter dependency on and hence votes for any political party. 2 Dream on, guess.

OUTLINE OF SUBMISSION In general I was very pleased by the Interim Report from the group and feel that the final report is highly likely to have a positive outcome for NZ as a whole. However I do feel that the suggested options for broadening the tax base and building a fairer system through the inclusion of a CGT and other measures will largely fail to address the issue of vertically integrated multi-national businesses paying very little tax in NZ. I also have concerns over the time lag that is likely to occur between implementing a CGT and realizing significant revenue gains from it. I fear that this lag will hamstring the swift implementation of significant changes to the lowest income tax rate and other reforms the government may desire to implement. I therefore propose a variation outlined below. It may seem a little radical at first glance but I believe it will be relatively easy to implement and legislate. PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE - Implement a CGT tax largely as outlined in the interim report. - Gradually re-introduce the ability for companies (not individuals or trusts) to claim depreciation on buildings, both commercial and domestic, excluding the first 5 years after construction is completed. - Continue to exclude individual property owners and trusts from claiming depreciation on buildings (both commercial and residential). - Introduce a new annual tax applying to the capital value of all commercial and residential b uildings owned by companies. This could be assessed on the rateable value of improvements and collected by councils via their rates notices. Exempt all new buildings for the first 5 years following completion of construction. - Reduce the company tax rate to 26% (or some similar figure) to offset the additional tax burden imposed by the new tax on capital value. RATIONALE At present vertically integrated companies and corporations can avoid paying company tax in NZ by selling goods to overseas subsidiaries or related companies at the equivalent cost of production. Whilst there is some benefit to NZ from their operations it is glaringly unfair that they bear a lesser share of the infrastructure and environmental cost of their activities, relative to equivalent exclusively NZ based companies. Whilst my proposal will not solve the problem entirely it will help lessen the disparity. The other advantage of implementing this additional tax is that it will generate some additional revenue far sooner than a CGT, therefore allowing government more flexibility to implement other policy changes. NZ based companies should by and large be supportive of it too (I would hope). DETAILS, ISSUES, PROS AND CONS \[1\] 2 I have not proposed a rate for the suggested tax because I have not been able to estimate the capital value of buildings held by companies. However I would imagine that a rate of around 0.1% would offset the reduction in the company tax rate. Timing the changes and setting the tax rates will require some detailed analysis. Some consideration will need to be given to avoiding imposing an excessive burden on the owners of properties with fixed long term lease or rental income, and clarifying whether a lease holder who normally pays the council rates would be liable for the capital value tax (CVT). The purpose of the 5 year exclusion for new buildings is to avoid penalising new ventures which often have little profit in their initial stages and to avoid creating a disincentive for new commercial and industrial construction and investment. Some businesses that are currently marginally profitable and that own the buildings they occupy may be placed under some distress by a CVT. All taxes have some degree of unfairness to some group and any business that is endangered by a relatively small tax increase should be considering restructuring eg. sell and lease back the property. A significant change in interest rates will have considerably more impact than a reasonably modest CVT. An additional advantage of introducing a CVT is that it adds flexibility for future governments should technological advances rapidly start to impact on income tax revenues. In your interim report it was concluded that taxing plant and equipment is currently not necessary, however with the rapid advancement of AI technology I feel it is important that the new tax framework proposed have the capacity if necessary to tax technological advances which replace their human equivalents. In your interim report you noted that widening the gap between the highest personal income tax bracket and the company tax rate would be a disincentive for business to declare full dividends. I do not believe that a modest reduction in the company tax rate in conjunction with a CVT will have this effect, and if it does then that will make greater capital available for businesses to either reinvest or reduce outstanding debt. SUMMARY This is not as complete a submission as I would have liked to make but time constraints have limited its content. Given the importance of the Tax Working Group's final report for our future as a nation, if more time is needed to achieve the most desirable outcome then the government should grant an extension to their self imposed deadline. Introducing a CVT tax in conjunction with a CGT will future proof our tax base, partially address some multi-national tax avoidance, increase government revenue in a shorter time frame than a CGT alone will achieve (particularly as property values may well flatline for a considerable time to come), allow the government to modestly reduce the company tax rate and re-introduce claims for depreciation to commercial buildings and residential housing held by companies. It will be readily collected via council rates notices, though consideration might be given to allowing publicly listed companies to pay based on the declared asset value of their buildings, if that were deemed preferable. I strongly urge you to give this proposal serious consideration. By all means identify any logical fallacies in my suggestion and dismiss it on those grounds but please do not discard it out of hand. Yours sincerely, Dan Tohill. 3

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, i.e. fiscal drag meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayer’s years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” this is not working as New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. This is especially hard on young people I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. I don’t agree with a capital gains tax as it seems to clumsy to try to implement and while I understand that there are some who have benefitted from an economy with no tax on capital I think the extension of the bright line test is good and could be added to other areas such as share portfolios. Business already pays tax so to further tax them on sale seems unfair. Where farms sell for a huge amount then perhaps CGT could be only charged where the gain is above say 2 million. \[1\] 2 If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form of capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommends against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes.

Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. But the costs of spirits are ridiculously cheap and our young people drink high levels of alcohol - spirits because it’s so cheap. I think Excise tax should be much higher on any product that is above 10% in alcohol. Sugar taxes should be made at source, i.e. on the sugar refining company or as import duty if producers import sugar so they catch all uses of sugar not just fizzy drinks. Apart from the poor research that doesn’t really state whether there is any effect on reducing obesity common sense tells us that more highly processed carbohydrate like refined sugar will increase obesity. To avoid just hitting low income households 3 there should be a subsidy on fresh milk that is equivalent to the revenue gained from the sugar tax. This will mean milk is cheaper for families and children, teenaged girls and young women especially will get the calcium they need for good bones. This will reduce future health costs. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend any further increases on cig arettes but should move the sale of these to pharmacies and people are able to only get them on prescription. The sale of synthetic marijuana should have the same excise tax as cigarettes. The harm this is doing is something that needs urgent attention. Yours sincerely, Dr Flora Gilkison \[1\]

Personal Income Tax: No tax on low personal incomes Bring back an initial zero tax on the first, say, $18k per anum per person. Readjust income tax rates on higher income to balance. Tax free income for the low paid is common in other countries. Children and students will not be subjected to tax. More importantly, beneficiaries and those on low fixed income will be able to utilise their full incomes to make ends meet. It is wrong to give meagre support to those in need and then take back some of that assistance to pay tax. All state support to the needy should be tax free. Working For Families: Abolish Transfers such as WFF have been valued by recipients but they favour families in need rather than everyone in need. Other fairer means of assistance should be adopted to supplement real income. GST: Remove Food from GST Removal would clearly benefit the low paid who pay a much higher percentage of their total income on food gst than the wealthy whose food gst is a much lower percentage of total income. (The interim report is missing comparative graphs relating food spending percentages to total income - not total spend. The published graphs are misleading in that they show the wealthy paying more gst but neglecting to show that it is much less when considering it as a percentage of their total income) Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different.
