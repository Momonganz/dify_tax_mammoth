The change follows a review of gift duty which revealed that the compliance costs far outweigh the revenue it collects and the limited protections it has provided to creditors and to social assistance integrity. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 October 2011. Key features The definition of a “gift” in section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 is being amended so that the term refers only to dispositions of property before 1 October 2011. The bill also amends section 61 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 to ensure that gift duty is payable only for gifts made from the Act’s commencement until 1 October 2011. The effect is that the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 will no longer apply to gifting of property on or after 1 October 2011. The Act remains effective with respect to dispositions of property before this date. Background Gift duty has existed in New Zealand since 1885. 1 Its purpose was to protect the estate duty base (by discouraging the gifting of assets before death) and to raise revenue. However, when estate duty was abolished in 1992, the government of the day decided to retain gift duty to protect against income tax avoidance and social assistance targeting until alternative protection measures could be introduced. In light of the increasing number of requests for exemptions from gift duty, a review was initiated. Options considered included: • narrowing the scope of gift duty to apply only to gifts between individuals, trusts and closely held companies; • raising the thresholds at which gift duty applies; 1 The legislative provisions at that time were contained in the Deceased Persons’ Estates Duties Act 1885 and are now contained in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. 4 • removing the requirement to file gift statements for non-liable gifts; • introducing electronic systems for the filing of gift statements and payment of gift duty; and • updating life-expectancy tables for valuing annuities under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. As the review progressed, a strong case for outright abolition emerged. Some of the concerns which existed in 1992 have been addressed or reduced by the strengthening of existing legislative provisions. Remaining areas of concern were scrutinised in consultation with the Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development, and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these agencies opposed gift duty abolition. The review concluded that gift duty no longer raises any significant revenue and imposes a high level of compliance costs on the private sector. The protections offered by gift duty in the areas of income tax, creditors and social assistance have been incidental rather than intended policy goals. The analysis undertaken across government revealed that the protection gift duty offers is inefficient and limited and is outweighed by the significant compliance costs it imposes on the private sector. The bill abolishes gift duty with effect from 1 October 2011. The government agencies mentioned above will monitor the effects of gift duty abolition and Inland Revenue will initiate a post-implementation review to ensure there are no unintended consequences. 5 TAX ADMINISTRATION MATTERS 6 7 Changes to the secrecy and information-sharing rules 8 9 OVERVIEW In June 2010, the discussion document, Making Tax Easier, was released for consultation, alongside an online forum seeking feedback on a range of proposals aimed at making the tax system easier and more efficient for taxpayers to interact with. Included were proposals concerning the operation of Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy rules. Inland Revenue is subject to a strict obligation of secrecy in relation to the information it collects and holds. The general rule, contained in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act, requires all employees of Inland Revenue to keep secret all matters that come to their knowledge relating to the Acts administered by Inland Revenue. This is subject to a number of exceptions, for purposes both related, and unrelated, to the administration of the tax system. The New Zealand tax system relies heavily on taxpayers voluntarily complying with their obligations. For taxpayers to be willing to comply with their obligations, it is critical that they trust Inland Revenue. Appropriate treatment of taxpayer information is an important aspect of building and maintaining this trust. Inland Revenue does, however, need to be able to disclose information to taxpayers and third parties in certain circumstances, in order to efficiently operate the tax system. There are also some situations when disclosure, while not directly related to the operation of the tax system, has been considered important enough by Government that a specific exception to the secrecy rule has had to be enacted. The changes proposed in the bill will help to overcome problems caused by the very narrow circumstances in which Inland Revenue can currently share information with other government agencies, thereby improving the quality of information across government. The bill also extends the ability of the Commissioner to release taxpayer- specific information for the purposes of administering the tax system, subject to certain criteria. 10 RELAXING THE TAXPAYER SECRECY RULES FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION PURPOSES (Clause 58) Summary of proposed amendment The secrecy rules contained in Part 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being amended to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue greater discretion to release taxpayer information for the purpose of administering the tax system more efficiently. This information may include, for example, releasing information to a friend or family member a taxpayer has nominated to deal with their personal tax affairs. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Inland Revenue will issue a Standard Practice Statement setting out how the new rules will apply. Key features The current rule allowing the Commissioner to release taxpayer information under the Inland Revenue Acts is being repealed. The rule is being replaced with the discretion to release taxpayer information in executing or performing (or supporting executing or performing) the powers, duties and responsibilities of the Commissioner to administer, implement, improve, research and reform the tax system. The change is intended to allow the Commissioner more flexibility to release taxpayer information. In deciding whether to exercise the discretion to release, the Commissioner must consider the integrity of the tax system, the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, the resources available to him, the personal or commercial interest or sensitivity of the taxpayer concerned, and whether the information is currently in the public domain. Following consideration of these factors, the Commissioner may release information if the communication is considered reasonable, whether or not it is also necessary. This is intended to relax the current “reasonably necessary” threshold for disclosure. A Standard Practice Statement will be developed, setting out how the new rules will be administered in different situations. The Statement will categorise disclosures according to the type of information and the recipient of the information. It will outline the process for disclosure and the level at which different types of disclosure are signed off. The Statement will be published on the date the new rules come into effect. 11 The requirement to obtain Ministerial authorisation for the release of aggregate or process information will be removed. The release of this information will be at the discretion of the Commissioner while weighing the criteria set out above. Background Inland Revenue can currently only release taxpayer information to a third party when it is “reasonably necessary” to administer the tax laws. This does not provide Inland Revenue with sufficient flexibility to administer the tax system in the most efficient way. The conservative interpretation currently taken can prevent Inland Revenue from making disclosures in the course of administering the tax legislation, even when disclosures would provide benefits such as greater efficiency or compliance that would outweigh the costs. There is a range of potential initiatives involving disclosure of taxpayer information related to administering the tax system that would have benefits, but which may not be necessary to administer the tax system, and therefore cannot be progressed without legislative amendment. In the past, when the benefits of disclosure for a particular initiative have been sufficiently high, legislative uncertainty has been resolved by adding a specific disclosure exception to the legislation. This is inflexible, administratively inefficient and will potentially hamper or delay future initiatives to administer the tax system more efficiently. The proposed new rules are intended to increase the Commissioner’s ability to disclose taxpayer information for purposes relating to administering, improving and reforming the tax system. The criteria the Commissioner must consider in deciding whether to make a disclosure will include those already set out in section 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act. For example, under the new rules information would be able to be released under the following conditions: • it is already in the public domain and not subject to criminal sanctions; • it is generic information using generic statistical data (and does not identify an individual taxpayer); or • in some circumstances it is information the taxpayer has consented to being released – for example, when a deaf or non-English speaking taxpayer authorises a friend or family member to make telephone queries about their tax affairs, or a constituent asks a Member of Parliament to make enquiries of Inland Revenue about an issue in relation to that constituent. It is not clear under the current rules whether these disclosures would be permitted. 12 The new rules also allow the Commissioner to respond when taxpayers make incorrect statements to the media about Inland Revenue, or about their dealings with Inland Revenue. Such statements can be highly damaging to the integrity of the tax system, and in particular to other taxpayers’ perceptions of that integrity. A further type of disclosure to be permitted under the new rules is the provision of information to The Treasury for the purposes of tax policy development. Currently there is an express exemption to the secrecy rules which allows Inland Revenue to disclose information to The Treasury for the purposes of tax revenue forecasting. The Treasury has requested that it also has access to information for the development of tax policy. Disclosure of information for this purpose falls within the Commissioner’s discretion under the new rules and does not therefore require an extension to the specific forecasting exception. Allowing Treasury employees access to Inland Revenue information for the purposes of tax policy development will improve the quality of policy advice available to the Government. Naturally, appropriate secrecy conditions will apply. 13 SHARING TAX INFORMATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES (Clause 59) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to facilitate the sharing of tax information between Inland Revenue and other government agencies. This will allow more efficient use of information collected by Inland Revenue and reduce the need for individuals to provide duplicated information to multiple government agencies. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. No information sharing will occur until an agreement has been entered between Inland Revenue and the requesting agency, Cabinet approval has been obtained, and an Order in Council has been made, authorising the disclosure. Key features The changes will allow an Order in Council to be made, authorising the sharing of Inland Revenue information with another government agency, provided certain criteria are met. The government agency seeking access to the information must have the ability and authority to collect the information in its own right, and the information must be available and already collected by Inland Revenue. Information will only be shared if it is not so sensitive that it would inhibit individuals from providing accurate information in the future. Finally, it must be economically inefficient for the agency seeking access to collect the information itself, or there must be clear compliance benefits to individuals for the information to be shared rather than collected separately. The final decision on whether information should be shared with another agency will be made by Cabinet. Before recommending a sharing arrangement to Cabinet the Minister must consult with the Privacy Commissioner, the agencies that may be affected by the proposed order, and any organisations considered by the Minister to represent the interests of those likely to be substantially affected by the proposed information-sharing arrangement. The changes include provision for a review after five years of operation to consider any impact on the privacy of individuals, the impact on the tax system, and whether any further amendments to the law are necessary. 14 Background Government agencies currently exchange information with other government agencies using the information-matching rules set out in the Privacy Act 1993. Information- matching is often used by agencies as an auditing and verification function. Generally, this involves comparing personal information from one set of records against another set of records to produce or verify information (usually a name) about an individual, with the aim of finding records in both sets that belong to the same person. The information matches to which Inland Revenue is currently a party only allow for the transfer of particular information for the specific purposes set out in the relevant legislative provision. Any information exchanged under these provisions must be provided for in a written agreement between Inland Revenue and the other agency. For Inland Revenue, these agreements are generally prescriptive and focussed on enforcement matters. Inland Revenue currently has eight information-matching agreements with the Ministry of Social Development. In several of these matches Inland Revenue cannot provide any information until the Ministry of Social Development has sent information to Inland Revenue on selected individuals and a match has been found for that individual by Inland Revenue. The changes will enable wider use of Inland Revenue’s information and provide better value for money across the public service with improved speed, accuracy and certainty of information. The changes seek to strike an appropriate balance between individuals’ privacy rights and a more efficient and effective government service. Several privacy safeguards are built into the legislative framework, such as the requirement that information shared must be information that the requesting agency is authorised and able to collect in its own right. Before information is shared with another agency, the specific purposes for which it will be shared will be stated publicly, and individuals will be advised of these when information is collected from them. The purposes will also be listed in the Order in Council authorising the particular sharing agreement. The purpose for which Inland Revenue collects information that will subsequently be shared will become a joint agency purpose. When it is possible that an adverse outcome may arise for an individual, information-sharing will be limited to information collected after the joint purposes are set. Over time, it is likely that information-sharing agreements will supersede many, if not all, of Inland Revenue’s existing information-matching agreements. However, these existing arrangements will continue to operate for some time as the new arrangements are negotiated and come into force, and therefore the provisions authorising Inland Revenue’s existing information-matching and information exchange arrangements will remain in place. 15 Disputes 16 17 OVERVIEW The current tax disputes system, which involves a number of communications on disputed matters between a taxpayer and Inland Revenue before a case may go to court, has been in effect from 1996 and results from the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department by the Richardson Committee. The objective of the process as recommended by the Committee is that there should be an “all cards on the table” approach to disputes resolution so that if Inland Revenue issues an amended assessment it will have the best possible opportunity to be right first time. The recommendations of the Richardson Committee were subject to a post-implementation review in 2003. In August 2008 the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue received a joint submission from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) and the New Zealand Law Society summarising their members’ concerns about the disputes process. The submission did not advocate a fundamental shift from the Richardson objectives. The submission opened a dialogue between the submitting organisations and Inland Revenue. Discussions resolved a number of concerns about the administration of the process. However, differences of opinion remained around exactly which phases of the disputes process should be governed by legislation and, where it is so governed, to what extent. In July 2010, Inland Revenue released an officials’ issues paper and two draft standard practice statements (SPSs) on the disputes process. The SPSs set out a series of important changes to the way that Inland Revenue administers certain parts of the disputes process. In particular: • The Commissioner’s notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA), which is the first document of the disputes process, should be proportionate in size to the dispute and subject to a more rigorous quality-control process to ensure that only the best arguments are put forward. • A taxpayer entering the conference phase of the process is now offered the opportunity for the conference to be facilitated by a senior Inland Revenue employee who has not previously been involved in the dispute. • Guidelines have been provided on when the Commissioner would be prepared to agree with the taxpayer to opt out of the disputes process (the opt-out guidelines). After the conference phase, the Commissioner will generally agree to opt out if the core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less, the dispute turns on its facts, the same issue is being considered by the courts, or the Commissioner has previously considered the issue and will not be altering that view. The issues paper set out a number of areas in which legislative change was considered to be warranted. Legislative changes sought by NZICA and the Law Society, but which are not proposed in this bill include: • a statutory right for taxpayers to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process after the conference phase; and • imposing statutory timeframes on the Commissioner for various phases of the disputes process. 18 Legislation is not considered necessary to cover these points as it is anticipated that the administrative changes set out in the SPSs, and currently being implemented by Inland Revenue, will address the main concerns expressed by NZICA and the Law Society. However, the Minister of Revenue has agreed to a review of the position in approximately two years time. If significant taxpayer concerns remain, legislative solutions could be considered at that time. The process The current disputes process for a dispute initiated by the Commissioner is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: the disputes process Taxpayer who is required to file return must make an assessment CIR issues NOPA May elect small claims jurisdiction of TRA Taxpayer issues NOR rejecting NOPA CIR accepts NOR?

However, in that process, the Commissioner has a two-month timeframe in which to issue a notice of response (NOR) and the taxpayer currently has the right to effectively opt out of the process and proceed straight to court at any time after the Commissioner has issued the NOR. 20 REMOVAL OF THE SMALL CLAIMS JURISDICTION OF THE TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY (Clauses 43(6), 63, 73, 74, 90–92, 94, 98, 99 and 101–108) Summary of proposed amendments The small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) has been used infrequently and is not adequately fulfilling its policy intention, most probably because it does not provide a right of appeal. The general jurisdiction of the TRA is suitably flexible to deal with the any specific requirements of a dispute related to a small amount of tax. As a result, the small claims jurisdiction is being removed. Application date The amendments will apply for disputes when no election to the small claims jurisdiction has been made before the date of enactment. Key features The small claims jurisdiction of the TRA was established in 1996. A taxpayer can elect to have a dispute heard in the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction if certain criteria are met (including that the proposed adjustment is $30,000 or less). This election can be made in the taxpayer’s Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) (for a taxpayer-initiated dispute) or their Notice of Response (NOR) (for a Commissioner- initiated dispute). If the taxpayer makes this election, it is irrevocable. The election effectively circumvents the remainder of the disputes process and allows the dispute to progress straight to the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction. Because a dispute has to exhibit certain characteristics before a taxpayer can elect to use the small claims jurisdiction, and there is no right of appeal from the TRA acting in that capacity, fewer than 10 cases have been heard since its establishment. Under new administrative changes to the disputes process, if the core tax in dispute is less than $75,000, the taxpayer will generally be given the right to opt out of the disputes process after the conference phase. This ability to truncate the process eliminates the need for a specific taxpayer election to the small claims jurisdiction, because they will be able to begin a dispute at the earlier stage in the general jurisdiction of the TRA. The TRA acting in its general jurisdiction is able to deal with small claims. Disputants can represent themselves and the TRA, as a commission of enquiry, has a large degree of flexibility in the formality or otherwise of hearings. This bill therefore proposes to remove the small claims jurisdiction. 21 EVIDENCE EXCLUSION RULE (Clause 72) Summary of proposed amendments The evidence exclusion rule (EER) is to be relaxed so that it limits the parties only to the issues and propositions of law disclosed in their Statement of Position (SOP). Application date The amendments will apply to disputes for which the disclosure notice is issued after the date of enactment. Key features In the event that a dispute reaches court, section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (known as the EER) applies. The EER currently limits the Commissioner and the taxpayer to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that are disclosed in their respective SOPs. The EER aims to ensure that the SOP contains all of the best arguments for each party to eliminate the possibility of “trial by ambush”. It also helps to make sure that all relevant information is brought forward at the SOP stage (at the latest) to increase the possibility that the Commissioner’s assessment will be correct. The EER has been criticised for encouraging a “kitchen sink” approach to SOP preparation, meaning that it encourages disputants to include every fact, piece of evidence, issue and proposition of law to avoid the risk of something being deemed to be inadmissible in court. Overly long documents can have the effect both of unnecessarily increasing compliance costs for disputants and also of obscuring the real issue to be resolved. The EER is to be amended so that it limits the parties only to the issues and propositions of law contained in the SOP and not the facts and evidence. This change should mean that the parties still have considerable certainty on the scope of the dispute, while eliminating the pressure to include every fact and piece of evidence in the SOP for fear of not being able to raise them at a later date. The SOP will still need to contain “an outline” of the facts and evidence to be relied upon. The amended EER, as with the current version, applies to both taxpayer- and Commissioner-initiated disputes when a disclosure notice has been issued (and, therefore, SOPs have been exchanged). No exclusion rule will apply for truncated disputes, such as when the parties agree to opt out of the process. 22 EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (Clauses 43(3), 64, 65, 68 and 69) Summary of proposed amendments A late notice from a taxpayer can be accepted by the Commissioner if exceptional circumstances exist. This rule is being expanded to allow the Commissioner to accept late documents if the taxpayer has a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process. If the Commissioner does not exercise the discretion to accept late documents, that decision will be able to be challenged in the Taxation Review Authority. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Although statutory timeframes are considered essential to ensure that the disputes process is navigated in a timely and efficient manner, there will be situations when a late response is justified and the party to the dispute should not be unduly penalised for failing to meet a deadline. This is particularly the case for tax disputes, when it is considered that the consequence of late filing is that the party is deemed to accept the position of the other disputant. A new rule will allow the Commissioner a discretion to accept disputes documents delivered outside of the statutory response period if the Commissioner considers that the disputant has a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process. This new rule is based on a previous common law notion of an “intention to dispute”. 2 In order to avoid a situation where taxpayers can extend the process indefinitely by continually asserting an intention to dispute without actually acting on that intention, the existing requirements in section 89K(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will remain. That section requires the disputant to send the relevant notice to the Commissioner as soon as practicable after becoming aware of their failure to respond in time. Therefore, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has either been subject to exceptional circumstances (under the current legislation) or has a demonstrable intention to dispute (and the other requirements of section 89K are met), a late notice will be treated as having been received on time. If neither of those features are present, the late submission of documents will not have met the statutory requirements and the taxpayer will be deemed to accept the Commissioner’s position. 2 Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. 23 In the event that the Commissioner decides not to accept late documents, and the taxpayer disagrees with that decision, the taxpayer will be able to challenge that decision in the Taxation Review Authority. To avoid a situation when a procedural matter jeopardises a substantive dispute, a new provision is being added to sections 108 and 108A so that the timebar for the substantive dispute is suspended while the appropriateness or otherwise of the Commissioner’s exercise of his discretion is considered by the courts. 24 TAXPAYER OPT-OUT RIGHT AND COMPLETING THE PROCESS (Clauses 43(4), 66, 67 and 70) Summary of proposed amendments A new rule is being introduced to remove the current right taxpayers have to opt out of the disputes process during disputes they have initiated. This change is to ensure there is consistency in the process between disputes initiated by the Commissioner and those initiated by taxpayers. Complementary changes are being introduced to ensure that the full process is followed by both parties unless a truncated process is agreed upon. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Under section 138B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, taxpayers have a right to take a dispute they have initiated to court at any time after the Commissioner has issued the NOR. This ability means that a dispute can be fast-tracked to court without having the benefit of a conference between the parties. There is also a significant information deficit in taxpayer-initiated disputes. These disputes, by their nature, often come as a surprise to the Commissioner. The Commissioner has two months to issue the NOR after which the challenge can commence. The period between the receipt of the NOPA and the issuing of the NOR will not always be long enough for the Commissioner to form a definitive view on the issues raised, particularly in the limited cases where the taxpayer is uncooperative. This process has the potential for disputes to reach court without the issues being properly defined and debated between the parties – therefore defeating a key objective of the disputes process. The proposed new rule will retain the taxpayer’s challenge right, but only in circumstances when the Commissioner has issued a “challenge notice” (as introduced in the bill) in respect of the dispute. This notice is the Commissioner’s final view that the assessment will not be amended in the way proposed by the taxpayer. It is anticipated that these notices will generally be issued by Inland Revenue once the dispute has been fully considered in the adjudication process. Changes are also being made to sections 89M and 89N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify that the SOPs must be exchanged before the Commissioner issues an amended assessment or challenge notice. These changes ensure that, unless an exception applies (such as when the parties agree to opt out), the full process must be followed in both taxpayer- and Commissioner-initiated disputes. They also resolve an existing technical argument that the Commissioner does not have to issue a SOP in a taxpayer-initiated dispute. 25 Finally, a rule is being added to section 138B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow a fast-track procedure for taxpayer-initiated disputes that are ancillary to other substantive disputes. The disputes in question are those when the taxpayer has adopted a position across numerous tax periods or when a taxpayer is affected by a position taken by another taxpayer (such as when a loss-making company transfers its losses to a profitable company in the same group). In these circumstances, the Commissioner can issue a challenge notice immediately and the taxpayer can challenge the assessment in court. 26 TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY REGULATIONS (Clauses 100 and 103) Summary of proposed amendments The Taxation Review Authority Regulations are being updated to make them consistent with the District Court and High Court Rules. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features In addition to the changes necessary to remove the small claims jurisdiction, two changes are being made to the TRA regulations. The District Court Rules, through Regulation 4 of the Taxation Review Authority Regulations, operate when they are not directly over-ridden by the Taxation Review Authority Act or Tax Administration Act 1994. Currently the regulations refer to the District Court Rules 1992. This reference is being updated so that the revised District Court Rules 2009 apply instead. There is currently an inconsistency between the time the Commissioner has to file a notice of response in the TRA and the filing times for a standard track hearing of the High Court. As both the TRA and the High Court can be the initial hearing authority for tax disputes, this distinction is being removed. The timing for filing a notice of defence in the TRA is therefore being reduced from 40 to 25 days. 27 MINOR REMEDIAL CHANGES (Clauses 43(7), 62 and 71) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being made to: • ensure that the Commissioner can make a consequential adjustment to a taxpayer’s assessment when all or part of the taxpayer’s loss has been extinguished under section 177C(5) of the Taxation Administration Act 1994; and • clarify that the issue of a dispute document by the Commissioner, or decisions surrounding the bilateral opt-out are not “disputable”. This is because the disputes process itself already provides taxpayers with an opportunity to respond to these decisions. Application date The new rules will apply from the date of enactment. 28 29 Changes to the tax pooling rules 30 31 CHANGES TO THE TAX POOLING RULES (Clauses 33, 34, 35 and 79) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the provisional tax pooling rules to ensure the legislation is simpler, fairer and is consistent in its application to different tax types. A number of these amendments either legislate operational concessions that previously applied to the provisional tax pooling rules or more correctly reflect the policy intent of the rules than they do currently. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New 75- day time limit to meet provisional or terminal tax liabilities Taxpayers who want to access funds held by a tax pooling intermediary to meet their provisional or terminal tax liabilities must do so within 60 days of their terminal tax date to use the funds at backdated credit dates. For some taxpayers the 60-day time limit means that the last day to use tax credits from a tax pooling account falls before the date when the tax returns are due to be filed, and potentially before tax liabilities have been determined by the taxpayer. This is particularly a problem for those with a December balance date. New section RP 17B(4)(a) provides that all taxpayers using a provisional tax pooling facility will have 75 days from the terminal tax date to access funds held by a tax pooling intermediary to meet their provisional or terminal tax liabilities at backdated effective dates. This will provide more time for taxpayers with a December balance date to request a transfer from a pool before filing a return, in order to access pooling funds with a backdated effective date. Time limit to no longer apply to own funds New section RP 17B(4)(b) provides that the time limit will no longer apply for “own funds” provided the taxpayer is not overdue in filing their return for the tax year. New section RP 17B(7) will provide limits to the amount a taxpayer may request an intermediary to transfer. This restriction will not apply to taxpayers who use their own funds, except when the funds are used to meet an increased obligation or deferred tax. 32 Clarification of effective date of transfer where section 157 Tax Administration notice applied An amendment is being made to section 157 of the Tax Administration Act which allows the Commissioner to seize tax pooling deposits by way of a deduction notice. The amendment clarifies that when a taxpayer has made a deposit and fails to instruct their tax pooling intermediary to transfer the deposit to meet their tax obligations, the concessions available for using tax pooling funds voluntarily will not apply. The amendment will provide that when a deduction notice is applied the effective date is the date the tax pooling intermediary pays the funds to the Commissioner. Previously it could have been argued that the deposit date of the funds was the effective date. Use of purchased funds when obligations cannot be quantified Currently the tax pooling rules only permit tax pooling funds to be used to meet an actual tax obligation. Consistent with the policy intent the funds transferred from the pool to a taxpayer’s own account is limited to the amount of tax actually owing. However, sometimes a taxpayer may wish to purchase tax pooling funds before they file their return for the relevant year because they expect to have an obligation that they cannot quantify at that time. New section RP19B allows taxpayers to use funds in a tax pooling account towards the payment of a future tax liability if certain criteria are met. This section only limits the use of acquired funds; taxpayers who use their own deposited funds will not be subject to this limit. Extending the use of pooling funds to voluntary disclosures where there has been no previous assessment The provisional tax pooling rules were extended to taxpayers who have additional tax to pay following a reassessment (including those resulting from voluntary disclosures, and the resolution of a dispute). However, the use of tax pooling funds is currently limited to situations when there has been a previous assessment. In addition, the use of tax pooling funds does not extend to such cases where a tax liability exists without the need for an assessment (because the amount due is an obligation not assessed taxes) such as for resident withholding tax and fringe benefit tax. New section RP 17B(3)(ab) will allow pooling funds to be used for a voluntary disclosure when there has not been a previous assessment, provided the relevant return has previously been filed for that year. Because not all adjustments will arise from a voluntary disclosure, new section RP 17B(3)(ac) will allow pooling funds to be used when the Commissioner makes an assessment or adjustment increasing an amount previously payable, provided the relevant return has previously been filed for that year or period. Any original amounts payable will not be able to be paid with tax pooling funds. Tax pooling funds can only be used for the adjustment resulting from the difference between the return filed and the increased amount owing. This is consistent with the treatment of additional amounts owing resulting from amended assessments. If second or subsequent adjustments are made that result in more tax to pay, this amendment will also allow tax pooling to be used, provided each subsequent adjustment results in an increased amount of tax to pay than the immediately preceding adjustment. 33 Correcting the use of tax pooling to eliminate imputation account debit closing balances The provisional tax pooling rules currently include an unintended ability to use tax pooling funds to eliminate imputation account debit closing balances. This occurs when a taxpayer purchases or otherwise acquires pooling funds at an effective date that falls before the tax year in which the tax pooling funds are to be used to meet an income tax obligation. This effectively allows a company to receive a backdated effective date for imputation purposes while paying a current provisional or terminal tax obligation. This circumvents the imputation rules, and does not reflect the original policy intent. The bill introduces an amendment to section RP19(3) so that all taxpayers purchasing funds must nominate an effective date that is no earlier than the original due date (or the first provisional tax due date, in income tax cases) of the applicable year or period in which the tax pooling funds are used. Extending the definition of increased “amount of tax” to reflect the policy intent Currently tax pooling can be used to pay an increased amount of tax only when there has been a prior assessment. It does not allow tax pooling to be used when an increased amount of tax results from an increase in an obligation that does not result from an assessment. Additionally, “amount of tax” is a defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act which has resulted in an unintended limiting of tax pooling to withholding taxes as defined in “amount of tax” following an amended assessment. New section RP 17B(8) is intended to achieve two policy outcomes. First, to extend the revenue types that tax pooling can be used for, so it also includes income tax, FBT, GST and imputation tax. Secondly, it will also bring the withholding taxes defined in “amount of tax” in the section YA 1 definition into the tax pooling rules. These measures better reflect the policy intent of which revenues and in what circumstances tax pooling can be used. The 10% imputation penalty tax can also be met using tax pooling to the extent that this relates to an increased amount of further income tax payable following an assessment by the Commissioner. This concession is a pragmatic way to deal with this unique penalty provision for imputation. Background A review of the legislation applying to tax pooling intermediaries was undertaken to ensure the rules were working as intended. As a result a number of amendments were made to tax pooling legislation in 2009 including removal of a number of Inland Revenue’s administrative practices. The tax pooling rules are now perceived by some intermediaries and stakeholders as being less flexible than previously. The proposed amendments aim to address this problem while still reflecting the original policy intent of the tax pooling rules. 34 35 Authority for the Commissioner to impose fees for credit card payments 36 37 AUTHORITY FOR THE COMMISSIONER TO IMPOSE FEES FOR CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS (Clause 80) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces changes that will allow Inland Revenue to offer a credit card facility for payment of all tax and social liabilities subject to an appropriate credit card transaction fee if taxpayers choose to use this facility. The bill establishes the Commissioner’s authority to apply a transaction fee to offset the current bank fee Inland Revenue is charged for this facility. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2011. Key features Section 226B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will allow the Commissioner to charge taxpayers a fee, if they choose to pay their tax and social liabilities by credit card. The fee will be set at 1.42% of the total transaction and can be changed by Order in Council in the future. This fee will not apply to overseas-based student loan borrowers and overseas-based child support liable parents who choose to make their payments by credit card. Background Since 2004, the Commissioner has accepted credit card payments from student loan borrowers and child support liable parents who are based overseas. The bill extends this facility to all payments of tax and social liabilities. For this to be practical, a legislative change is required to give the Commissioner authority to charge taxpayers a credit card transaction fee. The overall benefit of extending this facility is that it will provide taxpayers with another payment option to meet their tax and social liabilities. Inland Revenue will continue to absorb the fee for credit payments made by overseas liable parents and overseas-based student loan borrowers to encourage compliance. 38 39 OTHER POLICY MATTERS 40 41 APPLICATIONS FOR OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 41) Summary of proposed amendments The bill adds seven new charitable organisations to Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will allow donors to obtain tax credits on their donations to the following organisations whose activities are largely focussed overseas. • Jasmine Charitable Trust No.2 • New Zealand Good Samaritan Heart Mission to Samoa Trust • NZ-Iraqi Relief Charitable Trust • RNZWCS Limited • Ruel Foundation • The Cambodia Charitable Trust • The Unions Aotearoa International Development Trust Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Background Charities that apply some or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for charitable donee status by Parliament. These organisations are listed in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donations to listed organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a tax credit of 33 1/3 % of the amount donated, up to their taxable income. Companies and Māori Authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. The seven charitable organisations being added to Schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: • Jasmine Charitable Trust No.2 funds experienced social entrepreneurs developing sustainable models to provide healthcare, education and improved livelihoods to the world’s most disadvantaged. • New Zealand Good Samaritan Heart Mission to Samoa Trust performs voluntary heart surgery in Samoa for patients with life-threatening heart disease who otherwise cannot afford treatment. 42 • NZ-Iraqi Relief Charitable Trust works for the relief of needy people in Iraq. The Trust works together with TEAR Fund New Zealand to help sick Iraqi children. Projects have included building a new Thalassemia unit for blood disorders in Basra and providing medical consumables and New Zealand doctors to educate local doctors working in hospitals in Basra and Baghdad. • RNZWCS Limited (Rotary New Zealand) is the international humanitarian arm of the New Zealand Rotary club network whose aim is to encourage, assist and foster projects worldwide by Rotarians, Rotary Clubs and Districts in New Zealand and the South Pacific. This includes emergency response activities in the Pacific and elsewhere. Rotary already has a related organisation listed in Schedule 32 – The New Zealand Rotary Clubs Charitable Trust. • Ruel Foundation provides assistance and support for children living in poverty in developing nations within the Pacific Basin. The Foundation provides free medical aid, including surgery for children with deformities such as cleft lip and palate. It also runs a crisis centre in the Philippine Islands for children living in poverty and local government-approved courses in mid-wifery and child care for poor communities. • The Cambodia Charitable Trust aims to raise educational standards, strengthen economic community development, improve social accountability and uphold human rights and improve health in Cambodia. • The Unions Aotearoa International Development Trust is an independent international aid and development Trust established by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions – Te Kauae Kaimahi. It provides a channel for New Zealand workers to contribute to international development through support for programmes which help unions, workers and their families in developing countries. 43 DIVIDENDS PAID WITHIN A WHOLLY OWNED GROUP (Clause 4) Summary of proposed amendment Section CW 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 treats as exempt income, dividends paid between New Zealand-resident companies that are in the same wholly owned group. However, this exemption does not apply if common balance date requirements are not satisfied. This distorts the original purpose of the rules, which is to allow the movement of capital within a wholly owned group of companies, and imposes an unnecessary compliance cost upon those companies. The amendment therefore removes the common balance date requirements from section CW 10. Application date The amendment will apply to dividends derived by a company on or after the first day of that company’s 2010–11 income year. Key features The repeal of the common balance date requirement removes an inappropriate restriction on the dividend exemption for New Zealand-resident wholly owned companies. Background The purpose of the wholly owned group intra-group dividend exemption is to facilitate the movement of capital around a wholly owned group, without taxation being a distortionary or inhibiting factor. At present, if the paying and receiving companies do not have a common balance date, and the differences in the balance dates are not supported by commercial reasons, the dividend is not exempt. In practice, the provision will normally not apply because companies in a wholly owned group not meeting the common balance date requirement will use non-dividend methods to move capital around the wholly owned group company. This effect unnecessarily increases compliance costs for taxpayers, which is inconsistent with the purpose of the rule. 44 45 REMEDIAL MATTERS 46 47 SHAREHOLDER CONTINUITY: DIRECTORS’ KNOWLEDGE PROVISION (Clauses 38 and 87) Summary of proposed amendment Section YC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to exclude from its scope minor “off-market” share transactions. The amendment will remove current uncertainty about how the section applies to off-market transactions and should reduce compliance costs. Application date The amendment will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2005. Key features The bill amends section YC 15 to exclude the following transactions from its scope: • off-market transactions between a company and its shareholders which in aggregate are less than 5 percent of the shareholding in a company in the income year; and • off-market transactions between shareholders who have a less than 5 percent shareholding in a company in the income year. “Off-market transactions” are share transactions that occur outside of a recognised stock exchange and include employee share schemes, dividend reinvestment plans and small private sales between shareholders. Background The shareholder continuity and tracing rules govern the carry-forward of tax losses and imputation credits to ensure that the benefits from these are returned, in general, to the same shareholders when they were incurred or derived. The standard tracing rules require tracing the ownership of shares in a company through to underlying shareholders who are “natural persons”. There are a few concessions that simplify the standard tracing rules particularly in relation to listed companies. These concessionary rules are subject to section YC 15, under which shareholder continuity is considered to be breached if the directors of a company know or could reasonably be expected to know, that the requirements of any continuity provision would not have been satisfied. 48 The issue is that the current section can be interpreted to mean that directors are presumed to be aware of all off-market transactions for the purposes of applying the provision. The frequency with which some minor off-market transactions occur (for example, employee share schemes) means the application of section YC 15 under this interpretation may limit access to tracing concessions for at least some listed companies. The effect is that these companies may be required to undertake full tracing of all transactions, which would be onerous. Given that section YC 15 is an anti-avoidance rule, when applying the provision, companies should only have to include in their continuity calculation transactions which their directors would know of or that it would be reasonable to expect them to know of. Since it is unlikely that company directors would have knowledge of minor off-market transactions, these transactions should not be taken into account when applying section YC 15. The amendment will apply retrospectively (from income years beginning on or after 1 April 2005) as it reflects the way officials understand the law is currently being applied by the majority of taxpayers. 49 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO TAX STATUS OF NEW ZEALAND SUPERANNUATION FUND (Clauses 21, 39, 40 and 88) Summary of proposed amendments The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) is a Government investment fund that was set up in 2001 to pre-fund a portion of New Zealand’s future superannuation requirements. The NZSF is not a separate legal entity, but a pool of funds owned by the New Zealand Government. Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 (NZSRIA 2001) will better reflect that the NZSF is an integral part of the Crown, and not a separate entity. Under the new legislation tax on income derived by the Crown through the NZSF will continue to be calculated in the same way that it is now. Amendments will also clarify that the NZSF, as part of the New Zealand Government, is a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Section 76 of the NZSRIA 2001 will be repealed. A transitional provision in the bill will ensure that the effect of this amendment does not result in the liquidation or creation of any entity or person. Section HR 4B will clarify that, although the NZSF is part of the Crown, the amount of tax on the Crown’s income relating to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund will be calculated using the company tax rules. Because the provision specifies that the company tax rules apply to the amount of income to be calculated, this means that rules such as the basic tax rate that applies to companies applies to Crown income derived through the NZSF. It will also apply to provisions such as section DB 7, which provides that no nexus with income is needed for interest incurred by most companies to be deductible. Because the fund is not deemed to be a body corporate, the obligations that are specifically imposed on companies, such as the obligation to maintain an imputation credit account, do not apply. Schedule 1 is being amended to ensure that the tax rate applicable to the fund is the same as the company tax rate. 50 Section YD 3B clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Crown is a resident of New Zealand. Background The New Zealand Superannuation Fund was set up in 2001 to pre-fund a portion of New Zealand’s future superannuation requirements. The NZSF is intended to smooth the future amount spent on New Zealand superannuation on a 40-year rolling horizon. Part 2 of the NZSRIA 2001 governs the operation of the NZSF. The NZSF is not (and never has been) a separate legal entity. Rather, it is a pool of funds that remains the property of the Crown (section 40 of the NZSRIA 2001). Earnings from the NZSF are taxed using the company tax rate. The NZSRIA 2001 is generally clear on this point. The Guardians of the NZSF are charged with managing and administering the NZSF, in accordance with the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. However, the Guardians are not a trustee of the NZSF (section 51(2) of the NZSRIA 2001), and the legal owner of the NZSF is the Crown, not the Guardians of the Fund or any other entity. The NZSRIA 2001 and the Income Tax Act 2007 are being amended to better reflect the status of the NZSF – that the NZSF is a pool of funds owned by the Crown and is not a separate legal entity. An amendment will also clarify that the Crown is a resident of New Zealand. This will ensure that domestic law is consistent with the position under New Zealand’s tax treaties. Double tax agreements (DTAs) usually specify that the Government is to be treated as a resident for the purposes of the DTAs. This ensures the Crown, including its various pools of funds (such as NZSF) obtain the benefits of these DTAs, including lower withholding rates. 51 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE PIE RULES (Clauses 15–20, 36(3) and 86) Summary of proposed amendments The bill makes five remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules to ensure the rules operate as they were intended. Application date The amendment to allow a PIE to derive significant amounts of income from life insurance policies will apply from the beginning of the PIE regime, 1 October 2007. The other amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The amendments will have the following effect: • allow a PIE to derive more than 10 percent of its income from life insurance policies; • for a person who has recently become a New Zealand tax resident, require that they take their worldwide income into account when calculating their prescribed investor rate (PIR). This should result in rates that better reflect the person’s actual income and marginal personal tax rate; • ensure that a person’s taxable income is not double-counted in certain situations when calculating their prescribed investor rate; • provide that income from conditional employer contributions to superannuation funds on behalf of an employee are to be taxed at the employee’s tax rate if the employee will become entitled to the contribution within five years; and • clarify that, when calculating the income to be attributed to an investor, a PIE is able to deduct fees for the ongoing management or ongoing administration of the fund. Detailed analysis Life insurance income PIEs are restricted to earning 90 percent or more of their income from the types of income listed in section HM 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of this restriction is to ensure that PIEs generally earn only passive income, as PIEs are intended to be passive investment vehicles. Income from life insurance policies was inadvertently not included in this list. Accordingly, the bill amends section HM 12 to include income derived from life insurance policies, with effect from the beginning of the PIE regime. 52 Prescribed investor rates for recent migrants Prescribed investor rates are the tax rates that should apply to investors in a PIE. As a result of the way these are currently defined, it is possible for individuals who have recently become New Zealand tax residents to use the lowest available PIR (10.5%) for the first three income years that they are a resident, regardless of their actual income. To remedy this, the bill introduces new section HM 57B which will require the PIRs for recent migrants to be calculated using their worldwide income, not their New Zealand taxable income. The change will ensure that PIRs more closely reflect a new resident’s actual income and marginal personal tax rate. Double counting of income In certain situations, it is currently possible for some of an individual’s taxable income to be counted twice when calculating their PIR. This occurs if a person has informed a PIE of a rate that is too low, and can result in inappropriately high PIRs. Accordingly, the bill amends section HM 56 to ensure that this does not occur. Conditional entitlements Section HM 38 sets out the appropriate tax treatment of conditional employer contributions to superannuation funds. These are contributions made on behalf of employees, but where the employee only becomes entitled to them after a vesting period, which is normally a minimum period of employment. At present, the interest earned on a conditional employer contribution is taxed at the employee’s rate if the vesting period is no longer than five years. If it is longer, the interest is taxed at the PIE’s tax rate until the vesting period is over. The bill amends section HM 38 so that, if a vesting period is within the five-year period, the interest earned on conditional employer contributions is taxed at the employee’s tax rate. This removes the current tax disadvantage of having a vesting period longer than five years. Fees for management and administration Section HM 36 currently provides that, when calculating the income that should be attributed to an investor, a PIE can deduct fees for the “ongoing management and administration” of the fund. This wording has caused some confusion amongst taxpayers. The bill re-words this section to clarify that fees for the ongoing management or the ongoing administration of the fund should be able to be deducted. 53 LISTED PIES – GROUPING OF TAX LOSSES (Clause 22) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the loss grouping tax rules in order to close off a potential loophole that could allow New Zealand companies with tax losses to avoid paying tax by setting up structures using listed PIEs. To counter this practice the change will restrict a listed PIE (a type of portfolio investment entity that is a listed company) to grouping only with its own wholly owned subsidiaries. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section IC 3(1) is being amended to exclude a listed PIE from the phrase “a group of companies”. New section IC 3(2C) will provide that a listed PIE can only group with its own wholly owned subsidiaries. Background Under the tax rules for grouping tax losses and credits, a listed PIE is currently allowed to use its parent company’s tax losses to offset its taxable income. There is concern about the potential for New Zealand companies with tax losses that would otherwise be difficult to use, to establish structures involving the use of listed PIEs in order to use these losses. For example, a loss-making New Zealand company that wanted to raise capital from the retail sector could establish a listed PIE that would raise funds, in the form of preference shares, from retail investors. It would then lend these funds to its loss-making parent – with the parent paying interest to the listed PIE. This structure raises policy concerns as it undermines the company tax and imputation system. Under the current tax grouping rules, the listed PIE would be able to offset the interest income it received against its parent’s losses and thereby eliminate its tax liability. Under the PIE rules, this would provide the PIE investors with a tax-free return and would provide the parent with a mechanism to use its tax losses. The amendment ensures that listed PIEs will be treated in a similar manner to multi-rate PIEs under the loss grouping rules, which are confined to grouping tax losses with land- owning subsidiaries or other multi-rate PIEs. 54 IFRS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS (Clauses 8, 9 and 10) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces several technical changes to clarify the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial arrangement rules in relation to integral fees when the modified fair value method applies, the timing of the base price adjustment when changing from the fair value method to another method, and anti-arbitrage rules around the use of the fair value method. Application date The amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Key features • Integral fees where the modified fair value method applies: The modified fair value spreading method is based on the fair value method. The consideration of the fair value method is defined to ignore non-integral fees (which is an accountant’s term). The consideration for the modified fair value method should also ignore non-integral fees, but this was inadvertently not specified in the original legislation. The amendment corrects the omission. • Timing of base price adjustment when changing from fair value method to another method: When taxpayers change from the fair value method to another spreading method they are required to perform a base price adjustment (BPA). The current rules state that this BPA is to be performed when the change of method occurs. The intended meaning of this is for taxpayers to perform the BPA at the end of the relevant income year; however, the current wording does not make this clear. Accordingly, the rule is being clarified by explicitly stating that the BPA calculation is to be performed at the end of the income year in which the change of method occurs. • Anti-arbitrage rules for the use of the fair value method: Several amendments were made last year to the anti-arbitrage rules. These rules are intended to prevent income and expenditure from being deferred or advanced on two financial arrangements which are in a designated hedging relationship. However, in amending the rules the ability to use the fair value method for financial arrangements that are used to hedge other financial arrangements (being agreements for the sale and purchase of property in foreign currency subject to a determination method) was inadvertently denied. The amendment allows the fair value method to be used in such circumstances. 55 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE METHOD: QUICK SALE GAIN AMOUNT (Clauses 11 and 12) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules to ensure that an adjusted formula for “average cost” can be used when calculating the “quick sale gain amount” under section EX 52(12) following a share reorganisation. This is to ensure that the “average cost” calculation is accurate following a share reorganisation. Application date The amendments will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. Key features The fair dividend rate (FDR) rules will be amended to ensure that an adjusted formula for average cost can be used when calculating the “quick sale gain amount” under section EX 52(12) following a share reorganisation. Detailed analysis Under section EX 52(7) of the FDR rules, a quick sale adjustment is the lesser of two amounts – the “peak holding method amount” and the “quick sale gain amount”. The formulas for each use “average cost” as a component. For the peak holding method, an adjusted calculation of “average cost” is used if a share reorganisation occurs. In such cases, average cost is calculated under section EX 54. However, the rules do not currently provide an equivalent adjusted calculation of “average cost” when determining the quick sale gain amount in the event of a share reorganisation. This means that the calculation of “average cost” under the quick sale gain amount formula may not be accurate following a share reorganisation. The bill amends section EX 52(13) so the adjusted “average cost” definition available under section EX 54 can be used to determine the quick sale gain amount, if a share reorganisation occurs. Additionally, section EX 54(1)(b) is being amended to cross-reference with section EX 52(12). 56 UPDATING THE DEFINITION OF “BOOK AND DOCUMENT” (Clauses 43(2), 43(5), 44 to 57, 58(3)(b), 58(4)(b) and (d), 60, 61, 75 to 78, 93 and 109) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “book and document” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being updated to remove references to redundant technology and future-proof the definition. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The definition of “book and document” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being updated. The new definition of “document” covers the medium on which information is stored, the information itself and any device associated with the medium which allows the information to be communicated. The words “book and document” throughout the Inland Revenue Acts are being replaced with the new term “document”. Background Section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 defines “book and document” and “book or document” as including: “all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers, papers, and other documents and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels, perforated rolls, or any other type of record whatever” The current definition has not been updated since 1974 and therefore does not reflect changes in technology since then. For example, some of the terminology refers to out- of-date technology such as computer reels and perforated rolls. In a recent Court of Appeal decision it was decided that computer hard drives are a “book or document” under the Tax Administration Act 1994, as the definition already includes “or any type of record whatever”. 3 Therefore, the new definition does not extend the current definition but instead updates it – for example, by removing references to redundant technology. 3 Avowal Administrative Attorneys Ltd & Ors v The District Court at North Shore & the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 57 Updating the definition will not affect departmental practice because it is Inland Revenue’s view that the current definition includes any records in electronic form. Inland Revenue’s practice is to use cloning technology to copy computer records on site whenever practicable rather than remove computers from premises, thereby minimising any impact on taxpayers’ activities. 58 DEDUCTIBILITY OF USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST (Clauses 5, 6, 82, 83, 96 and 97) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies that use-of-money interest (UOMI) payable to Inland Revenue is deductible for tax purposes. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively from the 1997–98 income year (the start of the UOMI rules) to taxpayers for deductions that have been claimed in returns filed before the date of introduction of the amending legislation. Key features The amendment clarifies that UOMI is deductible for tax purposes. The amendment will ensure consistency, in particular between companies (for whom interest is frequently deductible) and individuals. The amendment also ensures symmetry in treatment for tax purposes so that UOMI is both taxable and deductible. Background The current penalty and interest rules have applied since the 1997–98 income year. The policy intention of the interest rules was that interest paid on overpayments of tax would be taxable, and interest charged on underpayments of tax would be deductible under the normal income tax rules. This approach provided consistency with the treatment of interest generally, removed the need to convert rates to after-tax rates and distinguished between penalties and interest. Furthermore, the discussion documents released before the introduction of the rules noted interest would be deemed to be interest on money lent for the purposes of determining whether a deduction was available under the Income Tax Act. This was, however, never specified in the legislation. Over time questions have been raised over whether UOMI is in fact deductible. This has led to a number of taxpayers seeking case-specific rulings from Inland Revenue on this issue. There appears to be some inconsistency over whether interest is deductible for companies and individuals. Generally companies are automatically entitled to deduct interest, but other taxpayers (specifically individuals) must satisfy a nexus requirement – meaning that interest may not be deductible. This inconsistency has arisen as a result of a lack of clarity over what Parliament’s intention was on the nexus requirement and has resulted in calls for legislative clarity on the deductibility of UOMI. 59 REFUNDS FROM INLAND REVENUE KIWISAVER HOLDING ACCOUNT (Clause 89) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretion to reallocate or make necessary refunds to members or employers from the KiwiSaver holding account, in circumstances when the monies cannot be passed on to the designated KiwiSaver scheme provider. It will apply in circumstances where the monies cannot be forwarded to the provider, because the member’s account has closed. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment will create a discretionary power for the Commissioner to efficiently refund a member’s contributions to members, or to reallocate or refund overpayments of compulsory employer contributions to employers from the holding account. Background Section 72 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires the Commissioner to establish the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account into which contributions are received before being passed on to the designated KiwiSaver provider. The KiwiSaver Act prescribes specific circumstances in which the Commissioner can refund monies in the holding account back to the member – for example, a refund can be made when: • there is an invalid enrolment, which is not later validated (section 59D); • the individual opts out following automatic enrolment (section 80); and • the member makes an application on grounds of serious illness or significant financial hardship (section 113). As KiwiSaver has become more established, the Commissioner is identifying other circumstances when funds should be repaid from the holding account. 60 Members’ refunds predominantly involve refunds following the member’s death. Upon notification of death the provider pays out to the estate and closes down the member’s account. This means that Inland Revenue cannot forward the funds from the holding account to the member’s provider. Other examples include administrative error or delays such as credits or interest appearing late in the holding account after a member has withdrawn funds following their emigration, and the provider has closed their account. A further example is when overpayments of compulsory employer contributions occur, usually following a reassessment of an employer’s monthly return. Section 81(2) of the KiwiSaver Act specifically requires Inland Revenue to refund overpaid compulsory employer contributions (CECs) which are returned from the provider. However there is no specific provision for when the CECs have not been passed to the provider, but are still in the holding account. So the employer could face a delay in obtaining a refund or reallocation while the CECs are sent to, and then returned by, the provider. 61 PAYMENT OF MEMBER TAX CREDITS TO KIWISAVER PROVIDER WHEN MEMBER CHANGES PROVIDER (Clause 26) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may pay a member’s tax credits directly to the member’s new provider when the member is in the process of transferring or has recently transferred to the new provider. This ensures that the credits are available to the new fund for the member’s benefit as quickly as possible. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features When a member chooses to transfer to another KiwiSaver provider, the Commissioner receives an electronic transfer notice from the new provider. The amendment will ensure that any member tax credit amount that is due can be paid to the new provider, rather than to the member’s previous provider who would then be obliged to transfer it to the member’s new provider. The amendment clarifies the present system of automatic electronic transfers between the Commissioner and providers to allow a more efficient process for both providers and members. 62 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel following its consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Act. The Panel monitors the working of the 2007 Income Tax Act and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Application dates Unless otherwise stated all the amendments will apply retrospectively, with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Disposal of petroleum mining assets to related parties (Clauses 7 and 84) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment to section DT 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Income Tax Act 2004 addresses two drafting matters identified by the Rewrite Advisory Panel: • an ambiguity, which under one interpretation would be an unintended change in outcome from the corresponding provisions of the 2004 Act; and • an incorrect cross-reference. Detailed analysis Section DT 9 applies when a petroleum mining asset is disposed of by a petroleum miner to a related party, and unamortised development expenditure forms a part of the cost of the asset. Under the petroleum mining rules, the full amount of development expenditure that is an allowable deduction is taken into account in calculating taxable income over a seven- year period, under an amortisation rule. However, if a petroleum mining asset is disposed of before the end of that seven-year amortisation period, the balance of the unamortised deduction for the development expenditure forming part of the cost of the asset is allocated to the year of sale. However, if a petroleum mining asset is disposed of to a related party within the seven- year amortisation period, section DT 9 limits how much of the unamortised deduction for development expenditure can be allocated to the year of sale. That amount is limited to no more than the profit on the sale of the asset, to prevent a group of companies creating a deductible loss from the disposal of a petroleum mining asset to a related party. The Panel concluded that the provisions of section DT 9 in the 2007 Act contained an ambiguity that could result in the petroleum miner selling the petroleum mining asset having a lower amount of deduction allocated to the year of disposal than would have occurred under the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. 63 Section DT 9 is being amended to restore the effect of the corresponding provisions in the 1994 Act. As this amendment relates to both the 2007 and 2004 Acts, the amendment has retrospective effect to the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Thin capitalisation debt-equity ratio and concession for on-lending (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment Section FE 12(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that a financial institution is able to utilise the on-lending concession in determining whether the thin capitalisation rules apply. Detailed analysis The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered that the on-lending concession in the thin capitalisation rules in the 2007 Act relating to the statutory debt equity ratio incorrectly applies only to natural persons. Under the thin capitalisation rules, a company controlled by non-residents has its interest deductions reduced if the group debt levels exceed 75% of total group assets. However, a concession applies to allow financial institutions to borrow beyond the 75% threshold if borrowings are on-lent to either: • a person who is not associated with the taxpayer; or • a non-resident who also does not operate a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. The concession treats borrowings by the entity as being first used in making advances to other entities. The effect of the rule is that the debt ratio is calculated against mainly fixed assets. In the 2004 Act, the on-lending concession applied to all classes of taxpayers, not just natural persons, as intimated in section FE 12(1). Foreign tax credits and income with multiple sources (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendment Section LJ 1(2)(a) is being amended to permit a foreign tax credit to be available for foreign tax paid on income sourced outside New Zealand. 64 Detailed analysis The Panel concluded that, in the 2007 Act, the foreign tax credit rule in section LJ 1(2) incorrectly prevents the New Zealand resident receiving a foreign tax credit for withholding tax paid in the country from which the dividends are paid. Under section LC 1 of the 2004 Act, it was possible for one stream of income to be sourced in New Zealand and outside New Zealand, and if foreign tax was paid on that income, a foreign tax credit would be allowed. An example where this may arise is in relation to a New Zealand resident with an investment business in New Zealand that receives dividends paid from a foreign company (as part of that investment business). Under the source rules (and associated case law) this dividend is: • sourced in the country in which the company paying the dividend is resident; and • sourced in New Zealand as the country in which the business is carried on. Under the 2004 Act, despite the source rules providing that the dividend is sourced in two different countries, the foreign tax credit rules allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign tax paid on income derived from a country or territory outside New Zealand. Section LJ 1(2)(a) will be amended to restore the effect of section LC 1 of the 2004 Act. Foreign tax credits – calculation of New Zealand tax payable on foreign income (Clause 24) Summary of proposed amendment Section LJ 5 of the 2007 Act is being amended to ensure that if the total of the maximum foreign tax credits calculated under section LJ 5(2) for each segment of foreign-sourced income exceeds a person’s notional income tax liability: • a pro-rating down of the maximum amount of foreign tax credit is required; and • the pro-rating down ensures that deductions for expenditure incurred in deriving income in excess of that income are spread across all segments of income, wherever that income is sourced. Detailed analysis The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that the formula in section LJ 5(4) of the 2007 Act incorrectly takes into account deductions that are not attributable to any particular income source, resulting in an incorrect adjustment. However, the Panel considered this arose from a drafting error in a remedial amendment to section LJ 5(4), in 2009. 65 Section LJ 5(4), (4B) adjusts a person’s foreign tax credit if the aggregate of New Zealand tax payable calculated under section LJ 5(2) for each amount of foreign income exceeds the taxpayer’s notional income tax liability. This ensures that foreign tax credits cannot exceed the notional income tax liability and also that excess deductions incurred in deriving income are spread across all foreign tax credit calculations. The amendments to section LJ 5 ensure that: • The calculation, under section LJ 5(2), of the maximum foreign tax credit allowed for each segment of foreign-sourced income is explicitly placed on an income year approach. • The result of the calculation in section LJ 5(2) cannot be a negative result. • If the maximum amount of foreign tax credit calculated under section LJ 5(2) exceeds a person’s notional income tax liability, the person must apply section LJ 5(4B) to adjust downward each maximum amount of foreign tax credit calculated. • In the adjustment formula in section LJ 5(4B), the meaning of the parameter “New Zealand tax” is being amended in section LJ 5(4C) to: – include all segments of income, wherever sourced; and – exclude expenditure that does not satisfy the nexus test under section DA 1, for each segment of income (for example, a deduction under section DB 3 for expenditure incurred in preparing an income tax return). Residence requirement for family scheme (Clause 25) Summary of proposed amendment Section MC 5(2)(a) and (3) is being amended to clarify that the residence requirement is determined by the defined term “New Zealand resident”. Overpaid provisional tax transferred within a group and imputation (Clause 27) Summary of proposed amendment Section OB 4 is being amended to clarify that an imputation credit arises for a company on the transfer of overpaid provisional tax by one company within a wholly owned group of companies to another company in the same group on the date the transfer is notified to the Commissioner. 66 Detailed analysis Section MB 33 of the 2004 Act provided that when a company transfers the benefit of its overpaid provisional tax to another company in the same wholly owned group of companies, the transferring company receives a debit to its imputation credit account for the amount of the transferred tax, and the recipient company is treated as having paid the tax and receives a credit for the same amount. Under the 2004 Act, the date of the debit and credit for this transfer of overpaid provisional tax within a wholly owned group of companies was the date the notice of the transfer was given to the Commissioner. Section OB 4 is being amended to restore the effect of the 2004 Act in relation to the timing of an imputation credit arising for a company receiving the benefit of the transfer of overpaid provisional tax from another company in the same wholly owned group of companies. Further income tax payable for debit balance in imputation credit account (Clause 28) Summary of proposed amendment Section OB 67 is being amended to ensure that a debit balance of a company’s imputation credit account at the end of one tax year, on which further income tax has already been paid, does not give rise to double taxation if the imputation credit account (ICA) also has a debit balance at the end of the next tax year. Detailed analysis The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered that section OB 67 of the 2007 Act contains an unintended change to the imputation rules, by allowing a company to incorrectly reduce the amount of the debit balance in the company ICA at the end of a tax year. This can result in a lower amount of further income tax being charged than under the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act. Under sections OB 65 and OB 66, further income tax is charged on the debit balance of a company’s ICA at 31 March. If the ICA remains in debit throughout the next year, section ME 9(7)–(9) of the 2004 Act (which corresponds to section OB 67 of the 2007 Act) ensured that the first year’s debit balance is not counted again at the end of the second year, resulting in double taxation through further income tax being paid on the same amount of debit balance. The amendment restores the effect of section ME 9(7)–(9) of the 2004 Act. 67 BETA debit rules: sections OE 7, OE 8, OP 101 and OP 102 (Clauses 29 to 32) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments correct an unintended change in law in sections OE 8 and OP 102 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and clarify sections OE 7 and OP 101. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features The amendments correct an unintended change in law relating to sections OE 7, OE 8, OP 101 and OP 102 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that apply to a company that elects to use branch equivalent tax account (BETA) debits to satisfy its income tax liability in relation to attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) income. These provisions convert to a tax loss component, the amount of any unused portion of those BETA debits the company has elected to use to satisfy the income tax liability relating to attributed CFC income. This would occur where the company’s actual income tax liability is less than the income tax liability calculated for that attributed CFC income because of, for example, domestic losses from current year transactions. Minor drafting improvements are also being made to sections OE 7 and OP 101. Background An unintended change in law in sections OE 8 and OP 102 incorrectly provides for an automatic conversion to a tax loss component of the entire debit balance in a company’s branch equivalent tax account. Under the 2004 Act (section MF 5), a conversion of BETA debits to a tax loss component occurred only if all of the following requirements were met: • a company has BETA debits available in its BETA account; • that company (or a group company) has attributed income (CFC income) under the controlled foreign company rules; • that taxpayer has elected for their BETA debits to be applied against the income tax liability of the company (or the group company’s income tax liability); and • the amount of the income tax liability relating to the CFC income is less than the amount of the BETA debits elected to be applied against that income tax liability. 68 Tracing of shareholder interests (Clause 37) Summary of proposed amendment Section YC 11(3) is being amended to clarify that the market value interest referred to is the market value interest in the issuing company. Detailed analysis In the 2007 Act, a number of rules for two or more companies depend on whether there are the same ultimate shareholders of those companies. Examples of these rules include the loss carry-forward provisions and the loss grouping provisions, among many others. To determine who the ultimate shareholders of a company are, tracing rules look through a chain of companies interposed between the company of interest and the ultimate shareholders. However, if the company holding the shares is a limited attribution company, that company is treated as the ultimate shareholder if: • the shareholder company’s voting interest or market value interest (without tracing to its shareholders) in the underlying company is less than 50%; or • the shareholder company is not associated with the issuing company and has an interest of less than 10%. As it is possible that section YC 11(3) may refer to more than one limited attribution company, the provision is being amended to clarify that the market value interest referred to in the section are the interests of the issuing company. 69 REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO THIN CAPITALISATION RULES (Clause 13(2)) Summary of proposed amendments A remedial amendment is being made to a minimum threshold exemption in the thin capitalisation rules to ensure it operates as originally intended. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The proposed rule provides relief from interest denial when the total interest deductions of the New Zealand group, in the absence of the thin capitalisation rules, would be less than $2 million in the year. If the deductions would be less than $1 million, relief is total. If not, relief is only partial. Example There are two members in the New Zealand group, X Co and Y Co. X Co has a “total deduction” amount under section FE 6(3)(a) of $0.7 million and Y Co has a total deduction amount of $0.5 million. The group finance cost is $1.2 million. Since this is between $1 million and $2 million, proposed subparagraph (iii) applies. $800,000 is the amount by which $2 million exceeds the group finance cost. For XCo, the ratio of the member finance cost to the group finance cost is $0.7m ÷ $1.2m = 7/12. The amount “adjust” in the formula in section FE 6(2) is therefore 7/12 × $800,000 = $466,667. For YCo, “adjust” is $333,333. Background The exemption, enacted in 2009, applies to taxpayers with less than $2 million of interest deductions. It replaced another, less generous exemption that was proposed in 2008 (and never enacted). The originally proposed exemption was to apply to the entire group of a New Zealand-based multinational, with a hard limit – groups below the limit would have no interest denial, while groups above would have no relief from denial. 70 The enacted exemption, in contrast, had a soft limit. Taxpayers with less than $1 million of deductions would have no interest denied under the thin capitalisation rules, but taxpayers with deductions between $1 million and $2 million would have partial relief from denial. This abating treatment required a different legislative approach, and in particular required incorporating the relief into the core thin capitalisation calculation. An unintended consequence of this different approach was that the threshold applied to individual taxpayers rather than entire groups. This poses significant risks to the tax base, prompting the proposed change in this bill.

The Government recognises that the tax system should not hinder this expansion overseas and that it is important that New Zealand businesses can compete on an even footing with other foreign competitors in the same country. 1.2 New Zealand-based businesses have previously raised concerns that New Zealand’s international tax rules could impose higher tax or compliance costs on offshore operations than those faced by competing businesses operating in the same country. This was because a New Zealand business that operated in a foreign country had to comply with the tax rules of that country and also attribute income (and potentially pay further tax in New Zealand). 1.3 To address these concerns the Government began a review of the international tax rules in 2006. A series of consultation documents were published (December 2006, October 2007 and December 2007) to consult on a new approach to the taxation of foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand investors. The main feature of this new approach was the introduction of an active income exemption – an exemption from New Zealand tax on income earned through controlled foreign companies (CFCs) that carry on an active business (for example, manufacturing, distribution or sales activity). Legislation giving effect to these changes was introduced in the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill in July 2008 and enacted in October 2009, with application for all income years from 1 July 2009. 1.4 However, the tax system also needs to reflect the commercial reality that direct investment overseas by New Zealand companies is not always channelled through controlled subsidiaries. When entering new markets, New Zealand firms frequently opt to establish links with a partner in the host country and set up a jointly owned entity. Although the New Zealand firm may not control the entity, it will generally have significant input in areas such as management, technical or marketing expertise. There are clear benefits to New Zealand from this kind of outbound foreign direct investment. These include access to new markets, the further development of New Zealand’s skill base and the development of effective and profitable synergies (for example, when New Zealand’s design or technological expertise is complemented by efficient and low-cost production facilities overseas). 2 1.5 This issues paper sets out a suggested approach to the taxation of non- controlling interests in foreign companies. It considers how the active income exemption might be extended to some interests in foreign companies that are not controlled by New Zealand residents, referred to as foreign investment funds (FIFs), and whether any rationalisation of the various methods for calculating FIF income is appropriate. One of the main objectives of the reform is that the FIF rules should be easy for taxpayers and advisors to understand and operate. 1.6 We are seeking the views of companies that have offshore operations or are contemplating offshore expansion on how these proposals may affect their business. The next step will be to analyse submissions on the suggestions presented here and make formal recommendations to the Government on changes to the FIF rules. The aim is to introduce a bill in August that gives effect to the reform. 1.7 The changes suggested in this issues paper should play a significant part in facilitating the expansion of New Zealand companies and ensuring the overall coherence of the tax rules for New Zealand investment in foreign companies. SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED CHANGES Active income exemption for interests of 20 percent or more in foreign companies • No income will be taxable from income interests of more than 20 percent in FIFs that have passive income of less than 5 percent of their total gross income. This is the active business test and is the same test that applies to CFCs. • If a person who has an interest of 20 percent or more in a FIF fails the active business test, only passive income will be taxable using branch equivalent calculations. • To reflect the extension of the active income exemption to interests in FIFs, the remaining exemption for non-portfolio investments in grey list jurisdictions will be repealed. However, in line with the treatment proposed for CFCs, an exemption for greater than 20 percent interests in FIFs resident in Australia will be introduced. • It is anticipated that most New Zealand investors with interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF should be able to perform the active business test and, if this test is failed, be able to accurately attribute the passive income arising from the FIF. In rare cases when investors cannot do the necessary calculations, they will be able, subject to certain restrictions on the choice of method, to use one of the attribution methods available for FIF interests of less than 20 percent to work out their tax liability. 3 • Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) will be prevented from holding income interests of 10 percent or more in a CFC (except if the CFC is a foreign PIE equivalent). Investors with a less than 20 percent interest in a foreign company • The active income exemption will not be available to investors with interests of less than 20 percent in a FIF (although investors with a 10 percent or greater interest in a CFC will still be able to access the active income exemption). Instead, a single harmonised regime will apply to all FIF interests of less than 20 percent. • The methods available for attribution of interests of less than 20 percent will be: – fair dividend rate; – cost; – comparative value; and – deemed rate of return. • There will be some restrictions on the choice of method, similar to those currently in force for FIF interests of less than 10 percent, to prevent manipulation of the attribution methods. • The accounting profits method will be repealed completely and the branch equivalent method will not be available for FIF interests of less than 20 percent. • The existing exemptions from the FIF rules for Australian companies listed on the ASX and certain venture capital investments made through grey list companies will be modified to apply to less than 20 percent interests in FIFs. Dividends paid from such FIFs will be subject to income tax. • Portfolio shares that escape attribution under the $50,000 minimum threshold because they were inherited at nil value, will be subject to a deemed sale and reacquisition at market value.

This is illustrated by figure 1, which shows the stock of outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) product as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). 1,2 Figure 1: Outbound FDI as a percent of GDP 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 N ew Z eala n d Ja p an Au s t ra l i a Un i ted St at e s Po rt u g al S pa i n Austria Nor w ay Finland United Kingdom I r el a nd Denmark Swe d e n 2001 2008 2.2 This is a concern as it suggests that New Zealand may be missing out on the economic benefits associated with businesses expanding their activities through the use of subsidiaries, joint ventures and other substantial investments in foreign markets. These benefits can include improved market knowledge, skills transfer and access to customers and suppliers. This may facilitate export growth or an increase in high-value research, design and management activities in New Zealand. 1 FDI is debt and equity holdings of greater than 10 percent in a foreign company. 2 GDP is a measure of the size of a country’s economy. 6 2.3 A range of possible factors could contribute to New Zealand’s relatively poor outbound FDI performance. For example, some of the difference could be due to industrial structure. Tapping into offshore markets and access to offshore distribution channels may be of varying importance for firms in different industries. Distance from markets may also be important as this could make it more difficult to invest offshore. 2.4 It is important that New Zealand businesses can compete on an even footing with foreign competitors operating in the same country. New Zealand-based businesses have previously raised concerns that New Zealand’s international tax rules could impose higher tax or compliance costs on offshore operations than those faced by competing businesses operating in the same country. This was because a New Zealand business that operated in a foreign country had to comply with the tax rules of that country and also attribute income (and potentially pay further tax in New Zealand) using New Zealand tax concepts. In contrast, many other countries reduce or eliminate the additional tax or compliance burden created by a second layer of tax by exempting offshore income that is earned by active businesses. This created an incentive for New Zealand companies undertaking or considering active business ventures outside New Zealand to relocate their headquarters to countries with more favourable tax rules. 2.5 In response to these concerns, the Government introduced an exemption for active income earned by foreign companies that are controlled by New Zealand investors (CFCs). This means that a shareholder with a 10 percent or greater interest in a CFC is taxed only on their share of any passive income earned by that CFC. In very broad terms, passive income consists of “moveable” income such as rent, royalties, certain dividends and interest. Taxing such income on accrual protects the domestic tax base against income being shifted offshore to reduce tax. 2.6 Before this reform, New Zealand shareholders in CFCs were generally subject to tax on their share of all of the CFC’s income (active and passive) as it accrued, with a credit provided for tax paid by the CFC in its home country. This “full accrual” approach continues to apply to most investments in foreign companies not controlled by New Zealanders (FIFs). The main exceptions are an exemption for interests of 10 percent or greater in FIFs located in one of eight grey list countries and an exemption for less than 10 percent interests in Australian companies listed on the Australian stock exchange. Extending the active income exemption to other types of offshore investment 2.7 CFCs are a key vehicle for expanding New Zealand businesses beyond the domestic market. However, businesses access new markets and opportunities through a variety of structures, and New Zealand companies wanting to expand overseas may have good commercial reasons for not operating through a wholly or majority-owned subsidiary. 7 2.8 For example, firms wanting to expand abroad may establish links with a local partner and establish a joint venture, meaning that the New Zealand company has a substantial but non-controlling, interest in an overseas entity. Typically, the New Zealand partner will provide significant input, through management expertise, technical or specialist input and funding. The host country partner may provide raw materials and a manufacturing base or labour force, as well as an established set of business relationships and an understanding of the market. Although the entity is not controlled by the New Zealand partner, the New Zealand firm will have a major say in the entity’s operations. 2.9 In some countries joint ventures may be the only option for New Zealand businesses. This is because some countries do not allow the entry of companies that are wholly or mainly foreign owned into particular markets. 2.10 As with the former CFC rules, the existing FIF rules can impose additional tax and compliance costs on New Zealand businesses that operate in offshore markets through non-controlling stakes in FIFs. This may create an incentive for these companies to relocate their headquarters to countries with more favourable tax rules as a number of other countries have an active income exemption for FIFs as well as for CFCs. 2.11 One way to reduce tax and compliance costs would be to exempt all types of income derived from a non-portfolio interest in a FIF. However this would create opportunities and incentives for taxpayers to shift moveable (passive) income into low-tax jurisdictions to minimise their tax liabilities. This type of offshore investment is unlikely to enhance New Zealand’s economic potential or wellbeing and could result in a large loss of tax revenue. 2.12 For this reason the CFC rules make a distinction between active and passive income. Restricting the exemption to active income (or active businesses) can be an effective way to reduce tax and compliance costs in cases where the economic benefits are highest and the risks to the tax base are low. 2.13 The remainder of this paper is concerned with developing a similar active income exemption for non-portfolio interests in FIFs. The following design issues are discussed: • Should the active income exemption for FIFs be the same as the active income exemption applying to CFCs? (chapter 3) • Which FIF interests should be eligible for the active income exemption? (chapter 4) • How should the active income exemption rules be applied to FIFs? (chapter 5) • What alternative methods should be available for holders of FIF interests that are eligible for the active income exemption but are unable to comply with it? (chapter 6) 8 Questions for submitters What types of entities and structures are most commonly used by New Zealand businesses to expand their activities offshore? When investing and competing in foreign markets, how important are tax and compliance costs? Do New Zealand’s existing FIF rules create a significant disadvantage? Is an active income exemption for non-portfolio interests in FIFs an effective way to reduce this disadvantage? Are there other ways to reduce tax and compliance costs? 9 Chapter 3 EXTENDING THE ACTIVE INCOME EXEMPTION TO FIFs Summary of suggested changes • The active income exemption for FIFs, like that applying to CFCs, would use an active business test as a gateway. • If a FIF passes the active business test, no income will be taxable, if a FIF fails, only passive income will be taxable. Existing rules for taxing FIF interests 3.1 As described in chapter 2, a “full accrual” approach still applies to most investments in foreign companies not controlled by New Zealand residents (FIFs). The main exceptions are an exemption for 10 percent or greater interests in FIFs located in one of eight grey list countries and an exemption for less than 10 percent interests in Australian companies listed on the Australian stock exchange. 3.2 The methods used for calculating FIF income differ depending on whether the investor has a portfolio (less than 10 percent) or non-portfolio (10 percent or greater) shareholding in the foreign company. 3.3 Subject to certain restrictions, non-portfolio investors have a choice of four possible attribution methods. • The branch equivalent method: This involves the taxpayer doing a full calculation of FIF income using New Zealand tax rules as though the FIF were a New Zealand company. It requires access to very detailed financial information, so is usually only suitable for larger shareholders. The current branch equivalent method for FIFs is identical to the old rules for calculating CFC income. • The accounting profits method: This method is essentially the same as the branch equivalent method but is easier to apply as it is based on accounting information. FIF income is the investor’s share of the foreign company’s accounting profit less credits for foreign tax paid. • The comparative value method: Under this method, FIF income is the difference between the value of the investment at the end of the year (plus any gains during the year) and the value at the beginning of the year (less costs during the year). 10 • The deemed rate of return method: This method calculates FIF income as a percentage of the book value of the investment at the end of the previous year. Each year the Government sets what percentage is to be used, and investors are required to make adjustments to update the book value of their investment. 3.4 Portfolio investors can also choose from the four attribution methods described above. However, the main attribution method for portfolio investors is the fair dividend rate method. Under this method the investor’s FIF income is 5 percent of the market value of their investment at the start of the income year (with an adjustment if the investment is bought and sold in the same year). If a market value is not available, the cost method can be used, under which the 5 percent return is based on either the net asset value, the cost of the investment or an independent valuation. 3.5 For shares that are equivalent to debt the only methods that can be used are the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods (this restriction applies to portfolio as well as non-portfolio investors). Should the active income exemption for CFCs also apply to FIFs? 3.6 The 2006 Government discussion document, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change, considered three broad options for applying an active income exemption to CFC interests. In theory, the same three options should also be available for implementing an active exemption for FIF interests. They are: • An entity approach: an assessment is made of a foreign company’s business activities or assets as a whole. If the entity is predominantly “active” no income is attributed. If not, the shareholder is taxed on its share of the foreign company’s income (regardless of whether the underlying income is active or passive). • A transactional approach: shareholders in the foreign company calculate their attributable income and pay tax based on their share of the foreign company’s income, and the proportion of that income that is passive. • A hybrid approach: an entity test is first applied to the foreign company’s activities. For example, using financial accounts, the active business test looks at whether less than 5 percent of the gross income of the foreign company is passive. If the test is passed, the New Zealand-resident shareholder is not taxed on any income from the shareholding. If the test is failed, only passive income is attributed to the shareholder on a transactional basis, so active income continues to be exempt from attribution. 11 3.7 A concern with the entity approach in the context of the CFC rules is that it can lead to significant amounts of passive income being exempted. The entity approaches used in other countries generally have a high tolerance (up to 50 percent) for passive income or assets. This implies that a pure entity approach could lead to considerable amounts of passive income escaping New Zealand tax. This is problematic given that passive income can be shifted offshore to avoid or defer New Zealand tax. At the same time, for those entities that fail the test all income, including active income, is taxed on accrual. 3.8 A pure transactional approach would avoid these problems, but would involve significant compliance costs for investors in entities with mainly active income. 3.9 For CFCs, the hybrid approach offered a sensible compromise between the various concerns associated with the entity and transactional approaches. Similar considerations seem to arise in relation to FIF interests. A further consideration is that adopting either a pure entity approach or a pure transactional approach for FIF interests would create boundary concerns between the CFC and FIF rules. These could result in tax considerations driving commercial decisions. Taxpayers who preferred the CFC hybrid approach would be motivated to hold a level of offshore interest that brought them within CFC rules. By the same token, taxpayers who preferred the entity approach could structure their investment so that they stayed outside the CFC rules. 3.10 It is therefore suggested that the hybrid approach adopted in the new CFC rules should also form the basis on which the active income exemption is applied to interests in FIFs. 3.11 Having the same design for CFCs and FIF interests would reduce the potential complexity of the international tax rules and make the exemption easier for companies and advisors to understand and operate. 3.12 In particular, some New Zealand companies will have CFCs as well as non- portfolio interests in FIFs, so it could be efficient for these companies to have only one set of active income exemption rules to operate. Changes in the level of stake held, or even changes in the composition of shareholders can result in a CFC interest becoming a FIF interest and vice versa. It would be simpler if these kinds of changes could be dealt with under a common exemption framework. The Australian experience 3.13 The broad design of New Zealand’s new CFC rules (particularly the hybrid approach) is similar to the design of the current Australian CFC rules. 12 3.14 To date, Australia has had an entity approach for calculating income from FIF interests, using two possible methods. Under the stock exchange listing method, a company passes the active income test if it is listed in a class of companies designated by an approved stock exchange as engaged in active business activities, or the company is included in an approved industry classification system as engaged in such activities. Under the balance sheet method, a company passes the active income test if the gross value of the company’s assets for use in active business exceeds 50 percent of the gross value of all its assets. 3.15 The Australian Government has recently announced the repeal of its FIF rules and the reform of its CFC rules. 13 Chapter 4 ELIGIBLE FIFs Summary of suggested changes • The rules for applying the active income exemption to CFCs should be extended so that they also apply to income interests in FIFs of 20 percent or more. • Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) will be prevented from holding income interests of 10 percent or more in a CFC (except if the CFC is a foreign PIE equivalent). Which FIF interests should be eligible for the active income exemption? 4.1 In policy terms, the active income exemption should only apply to interests where the investor is directly involved in the operations of the foreign company. Portfolio shareholders should not have access to the active income exemption. They typically focus on investment returns rather than seeking to directly influence management decisions or exchange knowledge and skills that may help grow a New Zealand business. 4.2 Also, if the active income exemption were to apply to portfolio FIFs, it could create a bias toward investing in offshore stock markets as opposed to domestic investments. Exempting such interests would increase the revenue cost of the active income exemption for little additional economic benefit. Excluding portfolio investors from the scope of the exemption would be consistent with international norms. Other countries do not generally exempt active income from portfolio FIFs. 4.3 Another factor in determining the availability of the active income exemption is the ability for investors to comply with the terms of the exemption. Obviously, an investor who has insufficient information to apply the active business test would need to attribute their income under an alternative method (see chapter 6). But other investors in FIFs fall into two categories. 4.4 In the first category, there are investors who have access to sufficient information to comply with all elements of the rules. They have sufficient information to determine whether or not the FIF has passed the active business test. They also have information to enable them to calculate the amount of income that is required to be attributed if the FIF fails the test. 14 4.5 In the second category are investors who, like those in the first category, have sufficient information to determine whether the FIF has passed the active business test. However, they do not have the information needed to calculate the amount to be attributed if the FIF fails the test. This category may include investors with access to audited account data but without the detailed information that would allow them to apply the branch equivalent method on a transactional basis. 4.6 Ideally, the active income exemption would be available only to investors in the first category described earlier. This is because an investor’s access to the information needed to comply with all the requirements of the exemption is a strong indication that the person has an appropriate level of involvement in the management of the company. In other words, it demonstrates that they are the type of investor that the active income exemption is aimed at in a policy sense. It also makes more sense from a tax administration perspective that the taxpayer can consistently use the active income exemption from year to year. Investors in the second category only have sufficient information to rely on the exemption in years when the entity passes the active business test. 4.7 It would be difficult to devise and enforce a rule that expressly limited the availability of the active income exemption to the first category of investors. It is therefore suggested that the exemption be limited to investors with a minimum level of income interest in a FIF. 4.8 In determining what level of income interest is most appropriate as a threshold, two factors must be considered. • Proxy for effective control. The level of interest must be set at a point at which there is a reasonable presumption that the investor has influence on the management of the foreign company. It needs to reflect the point at which a shareholding could generally be expected to give the investor an active and direct involvement in the running of the company. • Proxy for ability to access information. The level of interest must be set at a point where there is a reasonable presumption that the investor has sufficient information in respect of the foreign entity to comply with the elements of the active income exemption, including both the active business test and, if the test is failed, the calculation of attributable income. Any extension of the active income exemption needs to be workable in practice, and take account of the level of information that is likely to be available to shareholders with various levels of holdings. 4.9 In this context, it is instructive to look at some of the thresholds used for tax and company law purposes in New Zealand that try to capture the point at which an investment becomes “significant” or “substantial”. 15 4.10 Under the current New Zealand regime, 10 percent is the dividing line between portfolio and non-portfolio interests in FIFs in terms of the application of the fair dividend rate method. Also, investors with a 10 percent income interest in a CFC are able to access the active income exemption for CFCs – although the context is different for CFCs because the 10 percent threshold only applies when the entity is controlled by a single or small group of New Zealand residents. 4.11 Under the entity shareholding investment requirements in the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, a PIE must hold less than 20 percent ownership interests (denoted by voting interests) in companies (including unit trusts) that it invests into (other than other PIEs or foreign entities that would be PIEs if they were resident in New Zealand). This means that if the threshold for using the active income exemption was set at 10 percent, a PIE could hold an interest of between 10 to 20 percent in an active FIF or CFC and not be taxed on the foreign income at all, including on distribution to individuals with an interest in the PIE. This is not an appropriate outcome. (PIEs, as their name suggests, are not supposed to have an active role in the management of the companies they invest in, and should not be able to benefit from the tax treatment extended to non-portfolio foreign investments.) 4.12 This difficulty could be resolved for FIF interests by limiting access to the active income exemption to investors with at least a 20 percent FIF interest. In relation to CFCs, it is suggested that PIEs would be prohibited from holding a 10 percent or greater interest in a CFC. PIE holdings of more than 10 percent in a CFC are expected to be rare, and in any case an exception will be made to allow greater than 10 percent holdings in any CFCs that would be PIEs if they were resident in New Zealand. 4.13 Twenty percent is also the threshold for the “fundamental rule” in the New Zealand Takeovers Code – signalling effective control of an entity. Over this threshold additional voting securities can only be acquired in accordance with the rules set out in the Code. 4.14 Finally, the 2001 Tax Review suggested a 30 percent ownership threshold as the appropriate point for an active income exemption to apply. 4.15 Since a threshold based on the level of interest held in a company can only be a proxy measurement for management influence and ability to comply with an active income exemption, there is no threshold that will give the “right” answer in every case. A 10 percent threshold seems too low in this respect. On the other hand, pushing the threshold up to 30 percent seems too strict. On balance, it seems appropriate to extend the active income exemption to income interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF. 16 4.16 A threshold of 20 percent should ensure that: • most investors who have an influence on the management decisions of a foreign company have access to the active income exemption; • any additional revenue cost associated with the active income exemption applying to investors without management influence is minimised; and • there is generally sufficient access to detailed financial information for the eligible investors to be able to perform both the active business test and, if the test is failed, the relevant transactional calculations. 4.17 The remainder of this issues paper is premised on the active income exemption being limited to income interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF (or income interests of 10 percent or more in a CFC). Questions for submitters Is having an income interest of 20 percent a reasonable proxy for having influence on how the FIF is run as well as access to sufficient financial information to apply the active business test and, if necessary, undertake a transactional calculation? If not, what other proxy or threshold should be used? Are there any other options that should be considered? 17 Chapter 5 RULES FOR APPLYING THE ACTIVE INCOME EXEMPTION TO FIF INTERESTS Summary of suggested changes • The active business test and the definition of “passive income” for interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF should follow the rules developed for the CFC active income exemption. • Consistent with the CFC changes, the grey list exemption for non-portfolio FIFs will be replaced with an exemption for shareholders with a 20 percent or more interest in a FIF that is resident in Australia. • Interest, royalties or rents received from a related foreign company in the FIF’s jurisdiction will be disregarded under the new rules. • The interest allocation rules that apply in relation to CFCs should also apply to FIF interests benefiting from the active income exemption. 5.1 As noted in chapter 3, having similar rules for CFC and FIF interests should make the active income exemption easier to operate. Many companies have interests in CFCs as well as non-portfolio interests in FIFs, and some FIFs may subsequently become CFCs or vice versa. On the other hand, an investor in a company that is controlled by non-residents may find it more difficult to access detailed financial information, and the potential revenue risks associated with FIF investments can be different from those that can arise from CFC investments. This chapter takes the new CFC rules as a starting point and then sets out some of the potential issues that could arise from applying these rules to investors with income interests of 20 percent or more in FIFs. We invite comments on these and any other practical concerns that might arise for investors. Active business test 5.2 Under the new rules, a CFC is not required to attribute income if its passive income is less than 5 percent of its total gross income. It is anticipated that most CFCs will pass this active business test. Investors are able to calculate the percentage of passive income based on information from audited accounts that comply with IRFS or NZ GAAP (for smaller entities that are not required to use IFRS), or based on New Zealand tax concepts of passive and total income. 18 5.3 It is suggested that the same active business test would be available to investors with interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF. In most circumstances, a FIF should be able to pass the active business test based on data from audited accounts. This has the advantage of requiring less information than the test based on tax concepts and the branch equivalent calculation that will be used to attribute passive income (if a FIF fails the test). Chapter 6 discusses the attribution methods that will be available to investors with insufficient information to apply the active income exemption. 5.4 Under the new CFC rules, New Zealand companies that have more than one majority-owned CFC in a jurisdiction are allowed to use consolidated accounts for all their majority-owned CFCs in that jurisdiction for the purposes of the active business test. The purpose of this measure is to simplify the application of the test when accounting information is available at a consolidated level, such as when a group produces segmental reporting by country. 5.5 In cases where the CFCs or FIFs are not majority owned, the benefits from allowing consolidation are more questionable, as it would be unusual for line-by-line consolidated accounts to have been prepared in those circumstances. Allowing consolidation of non-majority-owned interests could lead to increased risk or more complex rules, as such interests are not subject to the same accounting treatment as majority-owned interests. There could also be complex interactions if more than one owner seeks to consolidate the same FIF. Replacement of the grey list exemption 5.6 To limit the risk to the New Zealand tax base, it is essential that FIFs with significant amounts of passive income are subject to tax on this income. For this reason the remaining eight-country grey list exemption for greater than 10 percent interests in FIFs should be replaced with: • the active business test; and • an exemption for FIFs that are resident and subject to tax in Australia (if a 20 percent or greater interest) or that are listed on the Australian stock exchange (if a less than 20 percent interest). These Australian exemptions are consistent with the Australian exemptions that currently apply to CFC and portfolio FIF investments. Passive income definition 5.7 It is suggested that the definition of “passive income” that currently applies for CFCs will also generally apply to interests of 20 percent or more in FIFs. The types of income that come under the passive income definition for CFCs include interest, royalties and rents, being income that is highly mobile and not location-specific. However, exceptions apply when the income is associated with an active business and there is limited risk to the New Zealand tax base. 19 5.8 The broad categories of passive CFC income are: • certain types of dividend; • interest; • royalties; • rents earned outside the jurisdiction of the CFC; • income from services performed in New Zealand; • personal services income; • income from offshore insurance businesses; • income from life insurance policies; • income from the disposal of revenue account property; and • certain income related to telecommunications services. 5.9 A more detailed description of the composition of passive income can be found in the report on the earlier CFC and foreign dividend reforms published in the October/November 2009 Tax Information Bulletin (Part II, Vol. 21, No. 8). Payments from related CFCs or FIFs 5.10 Under the new CFC rules, interest, rent and royalties received by a CFC (CFC A) from an associated CFC (CFC B) are not treated as passive income if CFC B passes the active business test and both CFC A and CFC B are resident in the same jurisdiction. To be associated the CFCs are required to have at least 50 percent common ownership. The objective of these concessions is to ensure that taxpayers are not penalised when a holding company is used to control an active business in the same jurisdiction (relative to holding the active business directly). The concession is not intended to apply to companies that operate independently from each other. 5.11 There does not appear to be a strong case for reducing the required common ownership threshold below 50 percent. There are risks from exempting passive income and it seems less appropriate to disregard intra-group payments when there is not a control relationship. Treatment of indirect income interests in other foreign companies 5.12 A New Zealand shareholder that uses the branch equivalent method to calculate FIF income will have an indirect income interest in a second FIF if the first FIF has an income interest in another foreign company. The indirect interest is calculated by multiplying the New Zealand shareholder’s direct income interest in the first FIF by the first FIF’s direct income interest in the second FIF. 20 5.13 If an indirect interest arises, the New Zealand resident needs to make two separate FIF income or loss calculations: one for the direct income interest held in the first FIF, and one for the indirect income interest in the second FIF. The investor can use a different method to calculate the income or loss from the indirect FIF interest from the branch equivalent method used for the direct FIF interest. If the branch equivalent method is used for that second FIF, the indirect interest rules apply in the same manner so that any direct interest held by that FIF in another entity may also be a FIF. 5.14 It would be sensible to keep broadly the same approach under any new regime for FIFs. This would be consistent with the rules for CFCs, under which income from foreign shares owned by CFCs is attributed back to the New Zealand shareholder. Under the suggested approach the active income test would be applied to the FIF. If the FIF has an interest in another company, the shareholder would need to calculate any income to be attributed in respect of that indirect FIF interest. Under the suggested approach, it would be possible, if the indirect interest were 20 percent or over, for the shareholder to apply the active income exemption to the indirect interest. Interest allocation rules 5.15 The interest allocation rules for CFCs place an upper limit on the level of New Zealand debt that a company can use to finance its CFCs. This limit is necessary as New Zealand loses tax revenue when interest costs are taken against New Zealand income to finance a CFC which earns exempt income. The interest allocation rules for investors with CFCs are designed to prevent a New Zealand company allocating a disproportionate amount of interest deductions to New Zealand, with its foreign subsidiary being disproportionately funded through equity. 5.16 The principle underlying the extension of the active income exemption to FIFs is that it should apply to investments where there is a substantial stake in an active foreign company. If there is a substantial stake, there will sometimes be scope to manipulate how a FIF is funded. For example, in the case of a joint venture or a closely held FIF, the New Zealand shareholder could easily have tax incentives that are aligned with those of foreign shareholders, in which case they could negotiate financing arrangements which produce a mutual tax benefit. 5.17 Accordingly, it is suggested that the interest allocation rules should apply to New Zealand residents with FIF interests of 20 percent or more in the same way that they apply to New Zealand residents with CFC interests. 21 5.18 This should ensure that tax considerations do not drive the decision of whether to hold a CFC or FIF interest. It would also eliminate some potential complications (such as a FIF interest becoming a CFC interest) and inconsistencies (such as a taxpayer with a 10 percent interest in a CFC being subject to the interest allocation rules and a taxpayer with a FIF joint venture being outside the rules). Questions for submitters How important is it for the active income exemption for FIF interests to be consistent with the rules for CFCs? Are there any areas where there is a strong case for deviation? Are there any practical issues with applying the active business test developed for CFCs to a greater than 20 percent interest in a FIF? 22 Chapter 6 ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR HOLDERS OF FIF INTERESTS Summary of suggested changes • Investors with a 20 percent or greater income interest in a FIF who are not able to perform the calculations necessary for the active income exemption will need to calculate their tax liability using an alternative attribution method. • The possible methods of attribution will be the fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value and deemed rate of return. Rules will be put in place to prevent any abuse of these methods. Attribution methods when the active income exemption cannot be applied 6.1 A New Zealand investor with an income interest of 20 percent or more in a foreign company would usually be able to apply the active income exemption. Indeed, as discussed in the previous chapter, one of the reasons for requiring an investor to have a 20 percent or greater interest in a FIF to access the active income exemption would be to ensure that investors eligible for the exemption would generally have the ability to perform the necessary calculations. 6.2 However there will be instances when investors with interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF are unable to benefit from the active income exemption either because they cannot apply the active business test itself, or because having failed the test they are unable to make the calculations necessary to apply the exemption on a transactional basis. 6.3 Situations can arise where it is difficult to access financial information. For example, if a business relationship collapsed the majority shareholder might withhold financial information on the company from the minority New Zealand partner. Similarly, if a joint venture was running into financial problems the New Zealand partner might find it difficult to get accurate financial information on its investment. 6.4 Consequently, it is necessary to provide alternative attribution methods that can be operated with less financial information. 6.5 It is important that the “safety net” of alternative methods made available for investors with insufficient information is not too generous. Otherwise there is a risk that some investors who are capable of performing the calculations necessary for the active income exemption will choose the safety net mechanism if it provides a more favourable tax treatment (for example, if the FIF generates a high proportion of passive income). 23 6.6 The active income exemption will effectively replace the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods for FIF interests of 20 percent or more. It is suggested that investors who cannot use the active income exemption will be able to use one of four alternative attribution methods: • comparative value; • deemed rate of return; • fair dividend rate; or • cost. 6.7 It could be argued that the fair dividend rate and cost methods are too broad- brush to apply to non-portfolio interests in FIFs. It is certainly not an ideal method for these sorts of interests. In most cases, a company with a 20 percent or greater interest in a FIF engaged in an active business will want to benefit from the active income exemption, and will have access to the information needed to make any active/passive apportionment required. Only in very exceptional circumstances would a company with a large interest in a FIF generating active income have to use the fair dividend rate or cost methods. 6.8 If this approach is taken, rules will be needed to prevent abuse of the fair dividend rate and cost methods. Otherwise an investor with an interest of over 20 percent in a FIF that had mainly passive income could choose these methods if they provide a more beneficial tax treatment than apportionment of active and passive income. The rules for restricting the choice of method would be modelled on those already in place for FIF interests of less than 10 percent. Those rules require taxpayers to use the comparative value method (or the deemed rate of return method if it is not practical to find out the market value of the investment) for shares that are considered equivalent to debt (such as fixed-rate shares). They also prevent an investor from using the fair dividend rate or cost methods if they use the comparative value method for one of their other investments. Questions for submitters How should taxpayers be treated if they have insufficient information to apply the active income exemption? Which FIF attribution methods are most appropriate in these circumstances? 24 Chapter 7 FIF INTERESTS OF LESS THAN 20 PERCENT Summary of suggested changes • A single set of rules will apply to all interests in FIFs of less than 20 percent. • The accounting profits method will be repealed completely, and the branch equivalent method will not be available for FIF interests of less than 20 percent. (FIF interests of 20 percent or more will apply the active income exemption using a branch equivalent calculation.) • The existing exemptions from the FIF rules for Australian companies listed on the ASX and certain venture capital investments made through grey list companies will be modified to apply to less than 20 percent interests in FIFs. Dividends paid from such FIFs will be subject to income tax. • Portfolio shares that escape attribution under the $50,000 minimum threshold because they were inherited at nil value, will be subject to a deemed sale and reacquisition at market value. 7.1 The introduction of an active income exemption for CFCs and 20 percent or greater interests in FIFs provides the opportunity to look at the overall coherence of the rules covering investment by New Zealand residents in foreign entities. One of the main objectives of the reform is that the FIF rules should be easy for taxpayers and advisors to understand and operate. Repeal of accounting profits and branch equivalent methods 7.2 There are currently six different methods for attributing income from FIF interests. These are: • branch equivalent; • accounting profits; • comparative value; • deemed rate of return; • fair dividend rate; and • cost. 7.3 The active income exemption will replace the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods for FIF interests of 20 percent or more. The question that arises is whether either of these methods should be retained for FIF interests below 20 percent. 25 7.4 Most portfolio shareholders are focused on securing returns from an increase in share price or from dividend yields. In this context, the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods are not really appropriate as they are based on the company’s accounts rather than the shareholder’s investment return, and allow for losses. 7.5 Moreover, few taxpayers with interests of less than 20 percent use the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods for attribution. It seems that smaller shareholders have insufficient information to use the branch equivalent method and prefer not to use the accounting profits method even though accounts are frequently available. Concessions for individuals 7.6 The rules currently applying to FIF interests of less than 10 percent distinguish between individuals and companies in certain respects, particularly the following. • A $50,000 minimum threshold applies to an individual’s investments in foreign companies other than Australian-resident listed companies. If the original cost of these shares totals $50,000 or less, the FIF rules do not apply to the individual. • Where an individual is using the fair dividend rate and the total return on their entire investment portfolio (dividends and capital gains) is less than 5 percent, then tax can be paid on the lower amount, with no tax payable when the total return is nil or negative. This outcome is achieved by allowing individuals (and family trusts) to switch freely between the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods in different income years. 7.7 It would be appropriate to extend these features to cover interests of less than 20 percent in a FIF. Exemption for Australian companies listed on the Australian stock exchange 7.8 The existing FIF rules contain an exemption for a less than 10 percent income interest in an Australian company that is listed on the Australian stock exchange (ASX). It is suggested that this exemption be extended to cover less than 20 percent income interests in ASX-listed companies. This would ensure that a single set of rules applied to all interests in (non-CFC) FIFs of less than 20 percent. 26 Exemption for venture capital investment 7.9 The current rules covering FIF interests contain a special provision to cater for venture capital investments in New Zealand-resident start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to additional equity funding. The provision ensures that, provided certain conditions are met, New Zealand investors who acquired shares before the company migrated from New Zealand do not come within the FIF rules until the end of a 10-year exemption period. 7.10 A similar 10-year venture capital exemption applies to shares purchased in a grey list company that owns a New Zealand company. This variation is designed to cater for situations when shares in a grey list company are received in exchange for shares in a New Zealand-resident company. 7.11 The introduction of an active income exemption for 20 percent or greater interests in FIFs raises the question of whether the exemptions from the FIF rules for certain venture capital investments in the grey list in sections EX 36, EX 37 and EX 37B of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be limited to FIF interests of less than 20 percent. Ideally, these FIFs should be applying the active income exemption, as otherwise they could be used to shelter passive income. In most cases it should be reasonably practicable for investors with a 20 percent or greater interest in a venture capital FIF to access sufficient information to use the active income exemption. We are interested in feedback from the venture capital industry on this issue. Taxation of dividends 7.12 As part of the earlier international tax changes, an exemption was introduced for most types of foreign dividends received by companies. However, as a general principle the foreign dividend exemption should not apply to dividends from an interest of less than 20 percent in a FIF that is not an attributing interest. Otherwise such investments would be more favourably taxed than attributing portfolio investments. 7.13 Accordingly, dividends from a less than 20 percent interest in a FIF (or a less than 10 percent interest in a CFC) described in sections EX 31 (Exemption for ASX-listed Australian companies), EX 32 (Exemption for Australian unit trusts with adequate turnover or distributions), EX 36, EX 37, EX 37B (Exemptions for certain venture capital investments made through grey list companies) or EX 39 (Terminating exemption for grey list company with numerous New Zealand shareholders) should be subject to tax when received by a company. All foreign dividends received by individuals are subject to income tax. 27 Inherited former grey-list portfolio investments 7.14 The treatment of portfolio interests (stakes of less than 10 percent) in FIFs changed from 1 April 2007. At that time, the grey list exemption for portfolio interests was repealed and it was intended those interests would be made subject to tax under – generally – the “fair dividend rate” rules. It has come to light that certain former grey list investments are still not subject to tax. Most commonly, this is because the investor has inherited the shares and claims they have a nil cost, which means they qualify for the $50,000 “de minimis” exemption from the FIF rules. It is not appropriate that these interests continue to be indefinitely exempt from tax. It is proposed that there will be a deemed sale and reacquisition of affected shares at market value. This amendment will have prospective effect. Questions for submitters When do small shareholders use the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods? Is there a strong case to keep these methods for FIF interests of less than 20 percent? Are there other ways in which the FIF rules could be simplified? 28 Appendix TAXATION OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT – CURRENT AND SUGGESTED NEW RULES Interests of less than 10 percent in a FIF Full attribution using one of six possible methods: branch equivalent, accounting profits, fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value, deemed rate of return. Interests of 10 percent or more in a CFC Active income exemption; no attribution for CFCs that pass an active business test or are resident and subject to tax in Australia. Only attribute passive income in other cases. Interests of 10 percent or more in a FIF Full attribution using one of four possible methods: branch equivalent, accounting profits, comparative value, deemed rate of return. No attribution for FIFs in eight grey list countries. Level of interest 0% 100% Current rules Suggested new rules Interests of less than 20 percent in a FIF and interests of 20 percent or more with insufficient information Full attribution using one of four possible methods: fair dividend rate, cost, comparative value, deemed rate of return. Interests of 10 percent or more in a CFC and interests of 20 percent or more in a FIF Active income exemption; no attribution for CFCs or FIFs that pass an active business test or are resident and subject to tax in Australia. Only attribute passive income in other cases.

Often, taxpayers are concerned they haven’t got the right answer to their tax questions – even after talking to Inland Revenue. This creates uncertainty which can affect investment and innovation decisions by businesses and, ultimately, New Zealand’s prosperity. 1.2 Sometimes taxpayers can feel they work for Inland Revenue, when Inland Revenue should be working for them. 1.3 The Government’s goal is for a tax system that supports innovation and growth, and without imposing unnecessary compliance costs on taxpayers. Such a tax system would provide certainty and quick responses to taxpayers, provide value for money for the Government, and build trust and integrity in the community. It is also one that is internationally competitive. This discussion document looks at how new technology might be used to realise this goal. 1.4 The proposals in this document focus on tax being integrated into business processes so Inland Revenue can concentrate on providing services to taxpayers, rather than on back-office functions such as processing paper tax returns. The resulting increase in certainty for taxpayers, and lower compliance and administration costs, are expected to create significant benefits for both taxpayers and the Government. The proposals also envisage a new or expanded role for specialist tax businesses to reduce costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and new opportunities provided by technology. 1.5 This document also raises for consideration a possible major change to the taxation of individuals by making PAYE a final tax for some individuals and proposed changes to the rules around privacy of information. 1.6 For the proposals in this document to work, change will be required from almost everybody involved in the tax system. The main proposal is to build on the increased comfort people have in working online by shifting the majority of their contacts with Inland Revenue to electronic channels. 1.7 The document also focuses on proposed changes to the PAYE system, following similar reforms to the administration of the student loan scheme. The proposed PAYE changes are an example of plans to transform the tax system. In the future, similar changes could be made to simplify other parts of the tax system. 2 1.8 The Government sees real merit in progressing these types of reforms and seeks feedback on the general direction of the changes described. Readers may also wish to access the online forum (www.ird.govt.nz/makingtaxeasier ) that has been launched in tandem with this document. The forum includes short videos which show the current position and a possible future for interactions with Inland Revenue. Summary of proposals 1.9 The key proposals in this consultation are: • reducing the use of paper forms in administering the tax system and increasing online services and technology; • reforming the PAYE and personal tax summary process (including the possible option of making PAYE a final tax for many); and • a new framework for sharing appropriate information with the necessary safeguards with other government agencies. 1.10 The proposed changes will affect nearly all taxpayers. Individuals • This group would self-manage most of their tax and social policy affairs through their own secure area on Inland Revenue’s website much like internet banking. The goal is to provide individuals with a faster and more certain tax system with fewer compliance costs. • There would be fewer errors in the PAYE system through better technology being used by employers and that technology being supported by Inland Revenue. • There would be a possible new approach to the taxation of individuals under which, for some, PAYE would be treated as a final tax. This approach would not apply to groups of taxpayers when the PAYE rules may give inaccurate outcomes. Taxpayers who receive additional income – for example, from rents, will still square-up their non-wage and salary income at year-end. • Inland Revenue would share tax information with other government agencies to reduce the need for individuals to provide the same information multiple times. Privacy issues would be an important consideration in any changes that were to be made. Businesses, employers and the non-profit sector • These groups would have software which takes care of routine PAYE compliance tasks such as the need to separately file an employer monthly schedule, by automatically communicating with Inland Revenue. The software could have an option of providing information to Inland Revenue payday basis. 3 • Information about an employee’s PAYE obligations would be provided by Inland Revenue directly to the employer’s payroll software, after appropriate validations, to help employers get things right. • Businesses, employers and the not-for-profit sector would move towards providing information electronically rather than by paper. The Government is raising for discussion whether mandating the use of electronic communication is acceptable and, if so, when. • Businesses and not-for-profits organisations can expect better service from Inland Revenue as resources are freed up from checking errors and processing paper as a consequence of the proposals outlined here. • Not-for-profit entities often have a high staff turnover, so having software which manages more of the routine processes and supports better use of other software will be of particular value. Software developers • Resources would be devoted to supporting software developers so they can develop improved, more capable products for their clients. Inland Revenue would form strategic partnerships with these groups, starting with payroll businesses. • A key element to the proposed new capabilities is that the software will be able to deal with routine tax compliance tasks, such as providing PAYE information directly into Inland Revenue systems without the need to access them separately. • The Government is seeking the views of software developers on how this strategic partnership might work and how employers could be encouraged to move from paper-based systems to an electronic environment. Privacy • A new framework is being proposed for sharing PAYE information collected by Inland Revenue with other government agencies, and more specifically, with the Ministry of Social Development. Legislation required 1.11 Provided there is support for the reforms, legislative change will be required to provide more flexibility around the PAYE rules, to give Inland Revenue the ability to mandate electronic filing, to make PAYE a final tax for some and to allow Inland Revenue to share information more widely with other government agencies. 4 How to make a submission 1.12 The Government invites submissions on the matters raised in this discussion document. Submissions should be made by 23 July 2010 and be addressed to: Making tax easier C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Making tax easier” in the subject line. 1.13 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.14 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 5 CHAPTER 2 The Government’s economic vision 2.1 The Government’s economic vision is for a tax system that supports and strengthens economic growth by: • improving incentives to work, save and invest; • improving the fairness, coherence and integrity of the tax system by reducing opportunities to avoid tax (and unduly accessing social assistance); and • promoting a tax system that supports New Zealand’s competitiveness globally and in a sustainable manner. 2.2 Surveys suggest the key regulatory burden most businesses face is tax compliance. However, increased government investment in infrastructure, education, skills and business assistance is funded by tax. 2.3 The Government began the reform of the tax system in Budget 2010, by introducing a package of tax policy measures to rebalance the tax system. This discussion document focuses on the underlying tax administration and processes that interact with taxpayers. 2.4 The Government has also identified better, smarter, public services as one of its priorities. This includes taking a whole of government approach in which the focus is on a better connected public service. From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the Government sees this challenge as being one of providing a service to taxpayers at a level expected of an efficient government department. Further, this vision means a system whereby Inland Revenue’s information can be leveraged as a government-wide resource, making interactions easier and eliminating the duplication of information and activities across different government agencies. Privacy concerns would need to be considered as part of any proposed changes in this area. 2.5 A tax administration that supports the Government’s economic vision should deliver: • Benefits to taxpayers, including: – certainty so individuals know their obligations and entitlements; – timely interactions with Inland Revenue; and – low compliance costs. • Benefits to the Government: – value for money; and – trust and integrity. 6 2.6 In the past, significant effort has gone into reducing compliance costs – for example, by simplifying forms and changing thresholds. The next step is to enhance taxpayer interactions with Inland Revenue through greater use of technology that integrates tax with normal commercial activities. This will allow taxpayers to resolve uncertainty online, without having to wait for an answer from Inland Revenue. 2.7 Reform will also help to ensure the Government receives the revenue it needs, and at the lowest administrative cost. 2.8 However, reform is not just a challenge for the tax administration. The current system works because of the support of individuals, businesses, employers, tax agents, payroll firms, financial institutions and software developers, among others. Improving the system by introducing new technology will require the support of those affected by the problems with the current system. Problems with current tax administration 2.9 The Government is concerned the administration of the tax system (including the costs of collection and administration by companies, individuals and Inland Revenue) is showing stress. This is mainly due to the additional requirements that social policy initiatives, such as KiwiSaver, are putting on businesses and Inland Revenue. Businesses sometimes have the feeling they work for Inland Revenue because of the amount of time they have to spend doing their taxes rather than running their business. Businesses and individuals also find current tax processes confusing and time-consuming. 2.10 The Government considers the tax administration system needs to change if it is to keep supporting New Zealand into the future. 2.11 A number of general problems and weaknesses with the system have been identified: • Lack of certainty: The current tax system cannot provide the sort of certainty the Government wants taxpayers to have, mainly because of the large number of predominantly paper-based processes involved. One source of taxpayer dissatisfaction is the inability to directly manage or control straightforward tax interactions. Another is the time it takes to resolve tax technical questions, which is caused by the pressures the current system imposes. • Slow response times: The public sector has been directed to seek ways to provide better, faster access to government services largely within existing resources. Despite significant improvements to Inland Revenue customer services, the volume of tax returns and contacts is increasing so Inland Revenue’s service delivery standards are under pressure. 7 • Value for money: The expanded products and services Inland Revenue administers as a result of its increasing role in social policy delivery have added considerably to pressures on Inland Revenue, and have markedly increased taxpayers’ expectations of service. • Trust and integrity: Inland Revenue’s aging systems mean there may be pressure on one of the core strengths of New Zealand’s tax system, which is the trust people have in the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. Once lost it may be hard to regain. 2.12 The chart below is a not an unreasonable representation of the current system. 8 CHAPTER 3 Moving to an improved tax administration 3.1 There are two broad options for reforming the tax administration. The first option, and the one the Government wants to progress, is to develop a new business model for Inland Revenue with stronger technology capabilities. This option means the dominant channel for communication with Inland Revenue would be electronic (with some exceptions) and reflects the increasing comfort people have in managing their personal and business matters online. The second option is to continue with the current administrative framework and technology, which will be increasingly costly and inefficient. A new approach for Inland Revenue 3.2 Inland Revenue has started providing more electronic services to taxpayers. Over the next few years it will increase its focus on providing greater certainty and quicker responses through electronic channels. This approach will require substantial changes to Inland Revenue’s traditional interactions with taxpayers. 3.3 Under the proposed changes: • Tax would be embedded in business processes. Information reporting and tax payments would be part of a businesses standard accounting processes rather than, as is currently the case, a separate process. For example, a GST package used by an accountant would be able to meet filing and paying obligations, without the business having to separately think about GST rules, due dates for payment and when they have to file a return. Inland Revenue would respond quickly to confirm the correct thing had been done. • The way taxpayers send and receive information would change. Inland Revenue would build on increased public use of electronic services and online tools to send and receive more information electronically. • Taxpayers would get help to get it right. Inland Revenue would require only the information needed to administer the tax system. This information would be provided electronically and not require manual intervention. The information would allow Inland Revenue to tailor its compliance activities and communication with taxpayers so they get the right information and quickly. 9 New and improved technology capabilities for Inland Revenue 3.4 The complexity and age of Inland Revenue’s computer systems are affecting performance, particularly as they have been being adapted for roles they were never intended to fulfil. This is affecting Inland Revenue’s ability to respond to taxpayers in a timely way. This can result in uncertainty for taxpayers in managing their tax affairs. 3.5 The Government has already made initial steps to improve Inland Revenue’s technological capability – for example, the technology being adopted to administer the new student loan system. 3.6 The new student loan system will: • provide the flexibility needed to deliver policy changes to the scheme in a timely and cost-effective manner; • improve customer service through more integrated delivery of services to borrowers, in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Development; • enhance online services, increasing borrowers’ ability, particularly overseas-based borrowers, to self-manage their loan account; and • allow administrative resources to be used more effectively. 3.7 Under the proposed changes to the tax administration system, it is expected this type of technology will be used more widely by Inland Revenue to improve the timeliness and certainty of taxpayer services. 3.8 However, just as the introduction of GST required businesses to change their processes, and resulted in benefits for businesses such as better and more regular financial information, reform of the tax administration system can only be achieved when sufficient individuals and businesses move to an electronic environment. Questions for submitters Submissions on any of the issues outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including whether the outlined reform is the right direction for the Government and Inland Revenue to proceed. 10 CHAPTER 4 Moving to an electronic environment 4.1 Currently Inland Revenue sends out over 30 million envelopes and 76 million pages to be read, including nearly 9 million statements and notices annually. An electronic environment would: • allow Inland Revenue to meet taxpayer’s expectations of good service levels; • provide certainty with real time or near-real time electronic services that ensure taxpayers have instant confirmation of transactions by Inland Revenue; • provide simplicity and flexibility for taxpayers so they can self-manage their obligations and reduce their compliance paperwork; and • provide services that are available and responsive to taxpayers at any time. 4.2 Moving to a largely electronic environment would require a major shift in focus for taxpayers and their advisors. 4.3 The role of Inland Revenue would change, and significant resources would be applied to further support the private sector in its role of helping taxpayers with their accounting, financial management and payroll support services. This is shown in the chart below. Taxpayers would, of course, continue be able to communicate with Inland Revenue directly. 11 Changing the way individuals, employers and businesses interact with Inland Revenue 4.4 Moving to an electronic environment would require significant changes for those who interact with Inland Revenue. For benefits to be fully realised the vast majority of interactions would have to be managed electronically. Old way New way • Primarily paper-based systems. • Primarily electronic environment. • Inland Revenue is primarily focussed on supporting taxpayers directly (basically a model with Inland Revenue at the centre). • Inland Revenue forms strategic partnerships with intermediaries and collaborates with the private sector to help them deliver services to taxpayers (the private sector is at the centre). • Separation of tax and business processes. • Integrated Inland Revenue and software provider systems. • Inland Revenue has significant impact on the end-user functionality that can be delivered by private sector. • Inland Revenue data and processes available through software. • Software providers forced to accept shortfalls in Inland Revenue support and change processes. • Software is subject to less Inland Revenue- imposed constraints so can be better designed for end-user by private sector. Proposals for individuals 4.5 Currently, taxpayers can log into a workspace hosted by Inland Revenue (similar to internet banking) where they provide details previously required by the paper personal tax summary (PTS) or IR 3 tax return. The workspace also gives individuals the opportunity to check their salary and wage income details, their PAYE deduction details and any child support and student loan obligations. 4.6 The Government proposes to increase efforts to move individual taxpayers from filing paper tax returns to providing information electronically. This is expected to take a number of years, but the expectation is of a future in which the majority of individuals will interact electronically with Inland Revenue 4.7 Change would not be limited to tax returns. The Government’s expectation is that payments and refunds would be made electronically in the near future and paper statements would not be issued by default. 4.8 It is recognised that many taxpayers would need to be supported in the move to an electronic environment. Businesses and Inland Revenue will need to work together to provide training in this new electronic environment. 12 4.9 Not all taxpayers will have access to the electronic facilities required in the proposed new environment, or have the capabilities to use them. Support may be required. The Government is interested in receiving comments on this. 4.10 Alternatives may include providing options for taxpayers rather than continuing current processes. For example, Inland Revenue may continue to provide a paper return for some taxpayers but the completed return would have to be provided to Inland Revenue electronically. That is, once an employer has completed an employer monthly schedule they would need to give it to a business services firm to file electronically with Inland Revenue. It is likely the business services firm would charge the employer for this service. For individuals, it could mean using a kiosk in the local Heartland (Ministry of Social Development) office to access a social policy entitlement. Change may be compulsory for some 4.11 A recent study by McKinsey & Company, Global Survey of Tax Administration Best Practices in Management and Operations, indicates that the gain from an electronic environment starts once 60 percent of contact is through electronic channels, but becomes significant and organisationally transforming if over 90 percent of communication is through electronic channels. The move to an electronic environment of this scale would require an increased role for the private sector and a change to an electronic environment by most taxpayers. 4.12 While Inland Revenue would be improving its electronic services in a way that should be inherently appealing to taxpayers, some level of compulsion to use electronic services may be required to ensure that the Government’s value for money goals are achieved. The proposal is that Inland Revenue would have a general power to mandate the electronic filing of information, with penalties supporting that mandate. 13 Questions for submitters Submissions on any of the issues outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including: • Should the electronic provision of information to Inland Revenue be compulsory, by a date to be determined in the future, for some tax types. • What do you think about Inland Revenue replacing paper guides and booklets with electronic information? Businesses • Would the ability to check your tax information online mean you would no longer need paper-based statements, or contact Inland Revenue? • What do you think about your accounting software taking care of routine tax filing rather than doing it yourself? Individuals • What do you think about being able to access information, receive confirmation and view your Inland Revenue information online? • What do you think about no longer receiving paper statements and notices from Inland Revenue? 14 CHAPTER 5 The PAYE system and facilitators 5.1 To demonstrate the Government’s proposed new direction for interactions between taxpayers and Inland Revenue, this chapter sets out an example of how the PAYE system might be reformed. The proposals outlined in this example could be applied to other tax types in the future. 5.2 The main tax form employers use, the employer monthly schedule, was introduced in 1999 as a result of changes proposed in the discussion document Simplifying taxpayer requirements. Its purpose was to provide an efficient mechanism through which Inland Revenue could interact with employers in the collection of employee information and payments. 5.3 The employer monthly schedule sets out the PAYE deducted from each employee’s pay, as well as child support, student loan repayments and KiwiSaver contributions. Approximately 41 percent ($22 billion) of Crown revenue is collected through the PAYE system. Of the 180,000 schedules received by Inland Revenue each month, only 30 percent are received electronically (although these schedules represent 80 percent of employees). 5.4 Processing paper schedules in an efficient and accurate manner requires significant resources. Further, to minimise compliance costs, Inland Revenue takes responsibility for correcting the majority of any errors found in schedules. 5.5 Inland Revenue has a first-generation electronic interface for employers and payroll specialists, called ir-File, which allows employers to file their employer monthly schedule electronically. The system allows only limited at-source validation. Inland Revenue therefore still has to apply extensive manual effort and reprocessing to correct information received through this system. 5.6 With the introduction of KiwiSaver, the employer monthly schedule was amended to collect additional information. A review undertaken by Inland Revenue on the current state of the schedule has highlighted that the collection of additional KiwiSaver information has added complexity to the form and is putting increased pressure (especially at peak times) on the existing paper- based employer monthly schedule process. Further, Inland Revenue’s systems are now at capacity. An electronic PAYE system 5.7 Some employers use payroll software, perhaps as part of their general accounting software or as a standalone program, to prepare their PAYE information. Some employers also use bureaus, which support employers through the entire payroll process, to prepare PAYE information. The software or bureau services these specialists provide are diverse. Some specialise while others provide a wide range of services. The manner of serving their customers can range from simple to complex web-based services, phone or fax. 15 5.8 One thing these specialists have in common is to make their processes as simple as possible for their customers. To do this many of them undertake customer research, user testing and monitoring, and provide call-centre assistance. This has a high level of positive influence on the collection of PAYE. 5.9 Inland Revenue has consulted with some software developers and payroll bureaus to better understand their experiences with the PAYE system. In general, they consider that Inland Revenue’s systems have problems relating to reliability and speed. They are also concerned that their software can have only limited electronic interaction with Inland Revenue’s systems because of its age and lack of flexibility. 5.10 The software developers and payroll bureaus consulted with generally felt under-recognised by Inland Revenue given the importance of their role. A significant concern was that they are restricted in their ability to act for their customers. 5.11 They also believe that Inland Revenue is slow to change and still designs in a paper-based rather than electronic environment. One example raised was that Inland Revenue took paper processes and simply put them online as rather than fundamentally re-designing the process in an electronic environment, with its associated benefits. There are also concerns about the cumbersome way Inland Revenue deals with exceptions or innocent errors. Their underlying concern is that Inland Revenue has significant system constraints which limit their customer service options. 5.12 Those consulted universally considered there are considerable opportunities to use technology to fundamentally reconstruct and automate business processes to bring benefits to their customers and Inland Revenue. Integrating payroll businesses into the centre of the PAYE system 5.13 Under the proposed move towards electronic tax interactions, technology and payroll businesses would be integrated into the PAYE system. This would increase certainty, speed of interactions and provide employers and employees with greater trust in the PAYE system. 5.14 The Government sees this approach as releasing the creativity, customer focus and efficiency of the private sector to support employers and Inland Revenue. That is, PAYE transactions would occur through services provided by the private sector rather than Inland Revenue. Employers would use software provided by a developer to manage their PAYE, in near real-time, and without the need to fill in forms. The software would be developed with support from Inland Revenue and with the ability to access Inland Revenue information. The ability to interact with Inland Revenue’s systems would only be available for approved software, and with the appropriate regard for privacy. 16 5.15 Implementing such a change would require: • payroll businesses to be able to provide their customers with a fully electronic interaction between Inland Revenue and the payroll business if needed; • mechanisms to ensure accurate data is sent and received by all parties in the system; • automation of electronic payments to Inland Revenue and embedding that process in software so that it is transparent to the employer (beyond notification of the amount and timing of payment); • validations and exceptions being addressed via the software used by the employer or payroll bureau, rather than by Inland Revenue at end of the PAYE process as is currently the case; • an ability for payroll businesses to electronically access Inland Revenue systems (with appropriate access/management rights built in) and update information, action changes, check data and perform maintenance; • the option of a pay period-based exchange of data and information in addition to the current employer monthly schedule so employers would have certainty faster than is currently the case; and • structured electronic information requests from Inland Revenue to reduce ad-hoc information requests going directly to employers. Proposed changes for Inland Revenue, payroll specialists and employers New technology for Inland Revenue 5.16 Inland Revenue would introduce a business-to-business link that would be used by payroll specialists to transfer information to their software and to employers in real-time. The information and payment processes associated with PAYE would be integrated into employers’ payroll software and effectively become “invisible” as the employer’s PAYE obligations would be met automatically as part of completing their payroll requirements rather than as a separate tax process. Improving Inland Revenue services to payroll businesses 5.17 Inland Revenue would work with payroll businesses to ensure the tax system is responsive to their needs, with increased tax-technical support for this group and faster responses to queries. The most significant change would be that Inland Revenue would be open to collaborating with payroll specialists on opportunities to streamline the PAYE system. For example, responding to a technology limitation identified by payroll specialists. 17 New services by payroll businesses 5.18 If the proposed changes go ahead, payroll specialists would be able to start making use of the new capabilities Inland Revenue will be able to offer. For example, payroll specialists would be able to extend their software to “interrogate” Inland Revenue’s new systems to provide an employer with a tax code for a new employee in a timely and secure way. Payroll systems would need to pass integrity checks – for example, provide audit trails and not allow actions by employers that are non-compliant. Currently, some software allows employers to replace the calculated PAYE with a manually calculated PAYE amount and provide that information to Inland Revenue. This would be unacceptable as there is a high risk that the information provided in these circumstances could be wrong. The reason this option currently exists is to allow people to correct small errors. The solution is to provide a better, more accurate way for taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs. Example Current environment Jim is a payroll software developer. He identifies a market niche for a software product which would help the not-for-profit sector to calculate its payroll electronically and then file and pay PAYE. Jim is struggling to get anyone at Inland Revenue to discuss his ideas with him or to work with him so he can develop the product for sale. Future environment A payroll business reference group would be established to work with Inland Revenue to design a tax system with better customer functionality. Jim would work with both the payroll reference group and Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would make a minor amendment to its technology to allow Jim’s product to deliver better information into Inland Revenue’s system electronically. Quality management and improvement process 5.19 A voluntary quality management system would be available to ensure the quality of software, underlying business processes and information received by Inland Revenue are correct. The proposal is for a formal set of standards which software developers and payroll bureaus would be required to meet and which can be built into their products. This would acknowledge that the standards have been met, by means of a logo or other quality assurance mark. Submissions on how this quality management process would best work for all parties are welcomed. 18 5.20 It is important to note that the objective of the proposed changes is to increase certainty without adding any undue delay or unnecessary expense to payroll specialists. Therefore, it would not be compulsory to undertake this process. Rather, payroll specialists could choose this option if it made business sense to them. However, certification as part of the quality assurance aspect of the proposed changes could have benefits to employers – for example, the removal of the risk of certain penalties for employers who chose to use certified software. Supporting the transition to an electronic environment 5.21 The move from paper-based systems to an electronic environment will require significant resources and effort from both Inland Revenue and the private sector. Over the next few years, many employers would need to transition to services provided by payroll specialists. Comments are welcomed from payroll specialists on how this transition should be managed, and what timeline for this transition of employers and payroll specialists would be considered reasonable. 5.22 Views are also sought on the likely approaches that would significantly increase the adoption by employers of the proposed new electronic services. This includes suggestions on how incentives might be used. 5.23 It is appreciated that some people may not be able to make the transition to an electronic environment for a number of reasons. Comment on how the needs of this group might be managed in ways that would still provide improved services for this group, while still allowing Inland Revenue to capture efficiencies through reducing the use of paper, are also welcomed. Reference group 5.24 To achieve the changes proposed, Inland Revenue would establish a payroll business reference group which would work to design the technology and tools required. The work of this group would be publicly available to ensure transparency and ensure that no commercial advantage is gained. Suggestions on how this communication should be achieved are welcomed. For example, should Inland Revenue establish an online forum for payroll businesses? 5.25 Inland Revenue would chair this reference group, which would have no more than 10 members who would be willing to commit time and resources to achieving the Government’s objectives for greater efficiencies in the tax administration system. 5.26 Once implementation is complete there would be continuing private sector representation in this group to ensure that the goals of the reforms are achieved. 19 Questions for submitters Submissions on any of the issues outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including: • the focus on using payroll businesses as the main method of providing electronic services to employers; • the proposal for Inland Revenue to approve software as meeting certain standards; • how payroll businesses could support the transition to an electronic environment and the support they may in turn require; and • the idea of a payroll reference group to oversee the development of the new technological capabilities for Inland Revenue. • Note that there may be issues with intellectual property which we would welcome comment on. 20 CHAPTER 6 Moving employers to an electronic environment 6.1 This document has canvassed a number of proposed changes to the way Inland Revenue administers the PAYE system. The emphasis would be on moving away from current paper-based systems to greater use of electronic interactions with taxpayers or their tax service providers. This chapter looks how the PAYE changes could make it easier for employers to meet their obligations by interacting electronically with Inland Revenue. Similar changes could be made to other parts of the tax system in the future. 6.2 As well as an electronic PAYE system, further tax forms and booklets could be provided electronically. 6.3 A possible first step would be to more closely integrate payroll systems and reporting processes so PAYE information is provided automatically by software to Inland Revenue so employers would not need to log on to ir-File and manually upload the employer monthly schedule each month. 6.4 Inland Revenue systems could potentially provide information to employers’ software to help calculate correct deductions. For example, for a new employee, the employer would be advised of the employee’s correct tax code, recognising any student loan and child support obligations. Employees would be able to update their own tax code online when their circumstances change, and updates would be automatically forwarded to the employer’s payroll software. Inland Revenue’s research indicates many employers prefer not to get involved in their employees’ private lives; this proposal would reduce such intervention. 6.5 The ease of transferring information means software could provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue each pay-day, for example, rather than by the 20th of the following month as now happens for most small employers. The current PAYE payment dates would remain but would be removed when simply providing information. The PAYE system could also provide more timely information on an employee’s tax code declaration, to check that the correct amount of PAYE, child support and student loans is being deducted. 6.6 It is acknowledged that many small employers are happy with their current manual processes and sending a paper-based employer monthly schedule to Inland Revenue. However it is also known that they want greater certainty and quicker service from Inland Revenue. To achieve this, Inland Revenue needs to move away from paper-based processes to free up resources to provide better service. In turn this will require small employers to change from paper- based systems despite some not wanting to do so. 21 Example Current environment Mika runs a fishing and outdoor supplies shop, and employs Rodger as his assistant. Rodger has two children to two different women and is liable for child support for one of them. Mika already deducts child support from Rodger's pay as per Inland Revenue's instructions. Following the birth of Rodger's second child, Inland Revenue sends Mika a letter with instructions to deduct a new amount from Rodger's pay. Mika now has to make sure he deducts the new amount correctly from Rodger’s next pay, updates his payroll system and makes sure his employer monthly statement reflects the new amount. Future environment Mika’s payroll and accounting software is integrated with Inland Revenue’s systems and can calculate Rodger’s deductions automatically. Mika does not need to know about Rodger’s child support liabilities or any other details about his personal circumstances, as Rodger will have his own personalised and secure area on the Inland Revenue website where his personal information is stored and can be updated. When Rodger updates his details (for example, adding a dependant) in his individual area on the Inland Revenue website, Mika’s software updates automatically and calculates any new deductions. 6.7 An electronic environment would give employers a range of choices. Some may choose to move to a software payroll package to automate their payroll and reporting processes. Some may choose to use a payroll bureau. Inland Revenue would need to provide some form of electronic service to help very small employers. Submissions on what this service should be and how it should be targeted are welcomed. For example, should Inland Revenue provide a simple software package or an online web-space? 6.8 In proposing these reforms the Government is also aware of limits to what can be achieved within certain timeframes and the need to manage the risks associated with these proposals. The work to support employers would also have to be done within available Government funding. 22 Questions for submitters Submissions on any of the issues outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including: • Your views on the trade-off between continuing the existing paper-based PAYE system and moving to an electronic PAYE environment which provides better services but requires employers to change their PAYE systems to gain these benefits. • Would it be acceptable to make electronic filing mandatory for all employers? • What type of incentives should be considered to move employers towards electronic filing? • Do you have ideas on how Inland Revenue could support employers who do not file electronically? • What do you think about your payroll and accounting software managing your deductions by getting information on your employees from Inland Revenue? • Do you think these proposals would reduce compliance costs for employers? • What electronic services should be provided by Inland Revenue and for whom? 23 CHAPTER 7 Reforming the personal tax summary process 7.1 Most individual taxpayers’ only contact with Inland Revenue is through the personal tax summary process or when claiming a rebate at the end of a tax year. This chapter looks at the possibility of reforming the personal tax summary process as part of the wider proposals to reform the tax administration system. 7.2 The personal tax summary was introduced in 2000 and removed the requirement for individuals who earned income solely from salaries, wages, dividends and interest to file a tax return. Instead, Inland Revenue issues a personal tax summary showing gross income, taxes deducted and any refund or payment due, but only if an individual meets one of the required criteria (such as having a student loan or receiving Working for Families tax credits) or if an individual requests one. In other words, the personal tax summary provides a means for individuals to reconcile their affairs, but only if required or requested. 7.3 The end-of-year square-up process is dependent on individuals accepting the accuracy of the PAYE system. For individuals who think they might be entitled to a refund, the system allows them to request a personal tax summary to verify their tax position and, if a refund is due, it is paid into their bank account. Equally however, if at the end of the square-up process they are found to owe tax, it must be paid. 7.4 Before the personal tax summary was introduced, about 1.2 million taxpayers were required to complete an end-of-year tax return. It was envisaged that changes to the square-up process would mean that only 400,000 of these taxpayers would need to receive a personal tax summary. Therefore, the system was originally designed so that the great majority of taxpayers would be freed from the annual obligation to square-up their tax affairs. 7.5 In the paper-based environment of 2000 it was envisaged that only a small minority of taxpayers would need to contact Inland Revenue. However, changes to social policy measures such as Working for Families, and the prominence of personal tax summary intermediaries in the market, has resulted in a growing number of individuals requesting a square-up at the end of the year and an increase in taxpayer interactions with Inland Revenue. Resources that could be devoted to higher-value activities (for example, answering queries from small businesses on tax matters) are being applied to providing small refunds to individuals. While these refunds are important to the individuals concerned, the question arises whether Inland Revenue’s resources could be used more effectively. 24 7.6 In 2007–08, 857,000 people were issued with, or requested a personal tax summary. For 327,000 (38 percent) of this group, the error corrected was less than a $1 a week. This resulted in refunds of $3 million and assessing a further $2 million for a group that had paid $1,955 million of PAYE during the year. Possible option 7.7 To use tax resources efficiently, the Government is considering a new approach to the taxation of individuals, whereby PAYE would be treated as a final tax for many. In other words, the amount of PAYE deducted for a pay-period would represent an employee’s final tax liability on that income, providing certainty every pay-day that the correct amount of tax has been deducted. 7.8 Inland Revenue resources no longer needed for end-of-year square-ups would instead be used to ensure PAYE is deducted correctly during the year and to helping taxpayers, such as small businesses, with more complex tax matters. Improved services and products from intermediaries would also increase the accuracy of the PAYE system. 7.9 The concept of PAYE as a final tax would apply only to people in stable employment for 11 or 12 months of the year. Much of the inaccuracy within the PAYE system comes from those in part-year employment. Those who earn wages and salary income for 10 months or less in the tax year would continue to be able to square-up their PAYE at year’s end. Example Margaret turned 65 in December and decided to retire. She receives New Zealand Super. In that tax year, Margaret earned $50,000, which had $11,300 PAYE deducted. She also received New Zealand Super of $4,345 which had $615 PAYE deducted. Currently Margaret works out that her annual square-up results in a refund of $931 (because she has not worked the full year) and requests a personal tax summary to claim it. If Margaret were treated as being subject to the proposed final tax concept, the result would be significantly negative for her as she would be unable to claim her refund. However, as Margaret has not worked for 11 or 12 months she would still be able to claim her refund, as under the current rules. 7.10 The proposal would allow the 350,000 part-year earners who currently square- up their PAYE to continue to do so. However, the year-end square-up would no longer be available for the 528,000 people who receive PAYE income for 11 or 12 months of the year. 25 7.11 Of the taxpayers who had PAYE deducted, $107 million (0.64 percent of total PAYE deducted) was taken from more than 570,000 people. This represents an average over-deduction of $188 (or $3.61 per week). Conversely, 890,000 people had PAYE under-deducted by $96 million (0.57 percent of total PAYE deducted) representing an average underpayment of $108 (or $2.08 per week). The remaining approximately 370,000 people had PAYE correctly deducted to within $5 for the full year. Of those entitled to refunds, about one-third did not claim their refund in 2008. 7.12 The final tax concept would not apply to groups such as those with employment-related deductions or those who are responsible for their own PAYE deductions. It also would not apply to groups that are subject to withholding tax such as casual agricultural workers or independent contractors. For those people, the PAYE or withholding payments deducted is approximate, therefore making such PAYE deductions a final tax could lead to over-taxation. The current system of annual filing would continue for these groups. 7.13 We acknowledge that ultimately the success of this approach will rely on the integrity of both the PAYE system and the employer’s overall systems for determining an employees pay, and deductions. The merits of this proposal should be considered with the longer-term view of the better future PAYE system in mind. Treatment of other income 7.14 Employees with other income such as rents, partnership or overseas income that has not been subject to New Zealand tax would continue to file. This is to ensure that tax is paid on income that has not had PAYE deducted. So employees know the correct amount of PAYE has been deducted when they do file an annual return, the tax credit for employment income would be the amount that should have been deducted, rather than the amount that was deducted. That is, the annual return would in effect only tax their other income at the correct marginal rate. 7.15 Those individuals who receive interest and dividends which might be over- taxed would still be able to or require to square-up their tax affairs at year’s end. The square-up would be limited to interest and dividend income – that is, they would not square-up income from which PAYE has been deducted. Example Bill works full-time but also earns income from a rental property. Under the proposed final tax concept he would file a tax return and have his tax calculated as under the current system. However, rather than receiving a credit for his actual PAYE deducted because Bill worked for the full-year, he would receive a credit based on the theoretical amount of PAYE that should have been deducted from his employment income. This would ensure the correct amount of tax is paid on his rental income but he has the certainty that the tax paid through the PAYE rules is final. 26 Social policy entitlements 7.16 Employees who also receive social policy entitlements, such as Working for Families tax credits, would continue to square-up annually but for those who worked 11 or 12 months during the year there would be re-recalculation of the PAYE on their wage and salary income. Questions for submitters Submissions on any of the issues outlined in this chapter are welcomed, including: • How would the concept of a full and final tax be best supported given the practical issues the PAYE system faces currently, particularly the increased reliance on information integrity the proposal assumes? • Do you agree that compliance and administration costs should be reduced by ignoring small refunds and tax liabilities? • What level of refund do you think people should forgo to enable Inland Revenue to help someone else? • Whether PAYE should be treated as a final tax for some taxpayers where the PAYE system tends to be accurate? • Do you think anybody needs to be added to the list of people who can still file to have their PAYE income squared-up at year’s end? The concept of PAYE being treated as a final tax should only apply to those for whom the PAYE system is very accurate. 27 CHAPTER 8 Sharing PAYE information with other government agencies 8.1 This chapter’s focus is on making it easier for people to deal with government agencies. Wider use of information by government would allow improved service. 8.2 Inland Revenue has access to a wide range of information about individuals, including (where applicable) their name, address, income, dependents, student loan details, and social policy entitlements. The new technologies and associated infrastructure, as discussed in the preceding chapters, would improve the efficiency, reliability, and accuracy of the PAYE information collected and would provide Inland Revenue with more frequent and timelier information about individuals. 8.3 Often, information collected by Inland Revenue is also collected by other government agencies so they can provide their services to individuals. For example, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) requires that benefit recipients report any changes in their income so that benefit entitlements can be adjusted to correspond with that recipient’s needs. 8.4 The Government considers there is scope to use this information to deliver a better, smarter public service, within a limited increase in public funding. To that end, the Government is considering the possibility of a new framework for sharing PAYE information with other government agencies, and in the first instance, sharing PAYE information with MSD. 8.5 The Government’s view is that when interacting with government agencies, individuals expect to be provided with service levels similar to those they experience elsewhere. They also expect that their entitlements and obligations to be met without them having to provide the same information multiple times. The proposals to share PAYE information with other government agencies would, in certain situations, remove the requirement for individuals to provide at times complex, duplicated information to agencies that require the same PAYE information that Inland Revenue already collects. Under this proposal, PAYE information would only need to be provided to Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue would then represent a single point of contact for PAYE information for taxpayers and other government agencies. 8.6 As sharing PAYE information improves timeliness and efficiency, there may be potential for lowering compliance costs and improving efficiency for businesses. Therefore, beyond service improvements, there are potential opportunities for administrative cost savings and efficiencies. 28 8.7 However, any changes regarding the use of personal information must be considered against individual privacy rights and Inland Revenue’s secrecy obligations. This consideration needs to be informed by people’s views on the balance of better service and a lower-cost public service against the proposal that income information Inland Revenue receives will, within limits, be given to other agencies, with resulting impacts on privacy. The importance of privacy 8.8 Inland Revenue collects and holds different types of taxpayer information, including information about individuals as well as business and company information. The former is protected by Inland Revenue’s taxpayer secrecy obligations, as well as the principles in the Privacy Act 1993. This Act controls how agencies collect, use, store and give access to personal information. Almost every person or organisation that holds personal information is an “agency” – this includes government agencies, companies of all sizes, religious groups, schools and clubs. 8.9 The Privacy Act is primarily concerned with good personal information- handling practices. It sets out 12 information privacy principles which govern the collection, holding, use and disclosure of personal information and the assignment of unique identifiers. The Privacy Act also regulates the practice of information matching in the public sector through authorised information- matching programmes. 8.10 The Government recognises there may be concerns about accuracy, unauthorised access, and the use of personal information for other purposes. In moving to meet the objective of better value for money, the Government acknowledges that an individual’s privacy is important. To that end, any proposal to share information aims to encourage better use of individuals’ personal information, to deliver improved public services for them, while at the same time, safeguarding their personal privacy. The Government would not implement an information-sharing framework without clear benefits that would address the public’s concerns and that deliver tangible benefits to them. 8.11 The privacy rights of individuals and the use of an individual’s tax information – such as PAYE information – must be finely balanced. Privacy protection is an essential element of voluntary compliance. If an appropriate balance is not struck, this could not only affect the effective delivery of services, but could also undermine future compliance with the tax system. 29 Options for PAYE information in the future Information-sharing framework 8.12 In developing a new framework for sharing PAYE information in the future, the Government considers that maintaining the integrity of the tax system and promoting voluntary compliance should always be overriding factors. The administration of the New Zealand tax system relies heavily on taxpayers’ voluntary compliance to operate effectively. For taxpayers to be willing to comply with the tax system, it is crucial that they have trust in Inland Revenue. In turn, to retain taxpayers’ trust in Inland Revenue, it is important that taxpayers’ information is not disclosed inappropriately. 8.13 The Government welcomes submissions on whether the proposed information- sharing framework outlined below strikes the appropriate balance between the effective use of PAYE information to deliver tangible benefits for individuals, while at the same time ensuring that current privacy and tax secrecy concerns are addressed. Proposed framework for sharing PAYE information 8.14 PAYE information collected by Inland Revenue would be shared with other government agencies under the following framework: Provision of existing PAYE information 1. PAYE information would only be shared with another government agency if: y the government agency seeking access to the information had the ability and the authority to collect that information in its own right; and y the information is available and already collected by Inland Revenue. A case is made for sharing 2. Information should only be shared and able to be accessed by another government agency if the sharing of that information is not so highly sensitive that it would likely inhibit individuals from providing accurate information in the future. And: y it is uneconomic for that government agency to collect the information themselves; or y there are clear and high compliance cost benefits to individuals, for that government agency to have access to the information collected by Inland Revenue. Appropriate oversight 3. The final decision about whether Inland Revenue should share information with another government agency should rest with Cabinet, through an Order in Council. The Minister of Revenue and the Minister responsible for the department seeking access to the information, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, would prepare a joint report seeking Cabinet’s approval for Inland Revenue to share, and for the other government agency to have access to the PAYE information. The specific joint-purposes for which the information would be used would be included in the report, with a view to these purposes being included in the Order in Council to be approved by Cabinet. 30 8.15 This framework would represent a significant step towards meeting the Government’s objective of delivering a better, smarter public service while still respecting the value of individual privacy. Government agencies seeking access to Inland Revenue’s information would have to be already entitled to that information in their own right. Additionally, the framework recognises that Inland Revenue is able to collect PAYE information more efficiently and economically than other agencies. The proposed new technologies mean that the PAYE information Inland Revenue collects would be received on a more frequent and timely basis, and involve front-end validation so that the PAYE information received is accurate and reliable. 8.16 The Government recognises that the proposal outlined in this chapter would mean that PAYE information collected by Inland Revenue may not necessarily be used for the purpose for which it was originally collected. When an agency collects information, it informs individuals why their information is being collected and this consequently determines how information can be used and disclosed. As such, it is important that the purposes are specific and clearly stated. 8.17 Under these proposals, before any PAYE information is shared with or accessed by another government agency, the specific purposes for sharing the information would be clearly stated and widely publicised so that individuals to which the information sharing relates, know and are fully informed of the exact purpose for which their information is used. For example, the details surrounding information sharing would be readily available on each individual’s online PAYE workspace. It is also proposed that the specific purposes would be listed in an Order in Council and form part of Cabinet’s decision as to whether another government agency should have access to Inland Revenue’s PAYE information. 8.18 This means that the purposes for which Inland Revenue collects PAYE information, that subsequently will be shared, would change to a joint-agency purpose. Once the joint purposes have been set, information would be collected by Inland Revenue, and used by Inland Revenue and the other agency only for those specific and predetermined purposes. This means that PAYE information shared under this proposal would be limited to information collected from individuals after the joint purposes for collection have been set (prospective information), and would not include information Inland Revenue already held about individuals before joint purposes were determined. 8.19 Transparency and ensuring that the public is fully informed about the way their information will be handled is an important to protecting privacy. Additionally, the ability and right for individuals to access and correct information about themselves will not change under the proposals. Rather, the personalised online workspace for individuals would allow individuals to have greater access and control over their personal information. 31 8.20 The Government welcomes submissions on this aspect of the proposal, which would enable the purposes for collecting PAYE information to be changed to a joint-agency purpose (between Inland Revenue and MSD in the first instance). 8.21 The Government is particularly interested in gauging whether the public considers that this aspect of the proposal would provide individuals with more tailored and improved services across the public service (or more specifically, across Inland Revenue and MSD while still protecting the privacy of individuals). The proposal to share PAYE information with MSD 8.22 The information-sharing framework proposed in this chapter would best be applied on an agency-by-agency basis. Therefore, by applying the framework in the first instance, and focusing on PAYE information, the Government considers that sharing PAYE information collected by Inland Revenue with MSD will provide significant benefits over the current information-matching regime, in terms of speed and accuracy for individuals and government, as well as administrative efficiency. 8.23 Under the proposals, Inland Revenue would only share PAYE information that is already available within its systems and collected from third parties (such as PAYE information collected from payroll intermediaries). Other information, such as additional audit intelligence information acquired under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act would not be shared. Additionally, Inland Revenue would not share any information with MSD if the provision of that information is inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s taxpayer secrecy obligations, or if it impacted on voluntary compliance. This means some relationship information, such as custodial information, would not be provided to MSD. 8.24 However, provided that MSD has the ability and authority to collect the information, the following PAYE information could be provided: • identity and location information such as name, gender, address, employer details, employment commencement and cessation dates; and • financial information such as income, tax paid, debt owed, entitlements and/or assistance received. 32 Benefits of the proposal Paying the correct rate: The social assistance system is designed to respond to income needs and relies on accurate information. Recipients of benefits are required to report any changes in their income, and their benefit entitlements are adjusted accordingly. In practice, people tend to report their wages after they are received, sometimes months later, and with varying degrees of accuracy. The recipient’s benefit is adjusted in response to reported income, and is subsequently adjusted again when more accurate wage information is provided. This means there may be a considerable time lag from when wages are in hand to when the benefit is reduced, which may result in a benefit debt. If MSD has access to a beneficiary’s PAYE information, adjustments could be made without having to rely on the benefit recipient reporting correct income as it is earned. This would reduce benefit debt. Granting assistance: There can be difficulties in establishing entitlement when an employer winds up a business and the employee does not keep wage information (for example, because the employee is initially confident of finding another job). Access to PAYE information – such as evidence on employment start and stop dates, and on rates of pay – would be useful in granting and cancelling entitlements. Additionally, under the proposals, Inland Revenue’s PAYE information could be used by MSD for various other purposes (as appropriate), including: • avoiding fraud or evasion; • improving the cost efficiency of both departments by removing information duplication and improving accuracy and timeliness; • statistics and evaluative purposes; and • developing better targeted and effective policy. Current information matching regime 8.25 Information matching is the current regime through which government agencies (such as Inland Revenue) exchange information with other government agencies and is often used by agencies as an auditing and verification function. Information matching generally involves comparing personal information from one set of records against personal information from another set of records, for the purpose of producing or verifying information (usually a name) about an identifiable individual, generally with the aim of finding records in both sets that belong to the same person. 1 1 The current information matching regime is regulated through part 10 and schedules 3 and 4 of the Privacy Act 1993. 33 8.26 The current framework recognises that there are many reasons that government agencies may wish to share personal information. Information matching is an accepted, statutory mechanism for agencies to use when the information they have collected for one purpose is to be disclosed to another agency for a different purpose on a routine basis. The safeguards provided by information matching ensure that this erosion of an individual's privacy rights only takes place in an appropriately controlled, transparent environment. For example, requiring matches to be contained in primary legislation provides transparency and accountability. 8.27 The current regime provides a mechanism for information exchanges, and there are no limits to the number of records that can be matched in an information exchange. That is, information matching can provide a high degree of specificity by allowing one agency to access another agency’s information in order to look up an individual and also to identify clients as a whole. 8.28 Currently, information collected by Inland Revenue – such as, PAYE information – is matched with other government agencies under specific information matching agreements. Inland Revenue currently has eight information-matching agreements with MSD – five of these involve the disclosure of Inland Revenue-collected personal information. For Inland Revenue, these agreements are prescriptive and are focused on enforcement. The current information-matching regime does not require agreements to be focused on enforcement, and Inland Revenue could broaden its information matching activities to achieve more effective and efficient sharing of PAYE information. 8.29 Under this option, Inland Revenue could update its current information- matching programmes. Increasing the frequency in some instances, and adding new information matches when necessary could allow more efficient use of information. This option would mean that current PAYE information would continue to be exchanged under updated information-matching agreements. However, any new information exchange or matching initiative would require a new information-matching agreement. This would need to go through the process of legislative authorisation. A better, smarter public service 8.30 Although the current information-matching regime is a proven mechanism for exchanging information, the Government considers that through more effective and efficient use of Inland Revenue’s PAYE information, there is scope to achieve better value for money from the public service within a limited increase in public funding. 34 8.31 As noted above, there are increasing expectations on the public service to deliver services that are both efficient and individually tailored. The proposed framework outlined in this chapter would allow, within limits, PAYE information collected by Inland Revenue to be freely accessible to other government agencies. Other agencies would then subsequently be able to use the Inland Revenue-collected income information to provide services to their customers. This means that in certain cases, an individual’s entitlements and obligations could be met without the individual having to provide the same information multiple times to different agencies as Inland Revenue would already have collected the information through the new electronic PAYE environment that is being proposed. 8.32 The Government recognises the importance of privacy and acknowledges that any framework that appears to depart from the Privacy Act must be thoroughly examined. The proposal that Inland Revenue-collected income information will, within limits, be given to other agencies has impacts on privacy. Although there is huge potential to make better use of personal information to deliver benefits to the public, this will be realised only if the public trusts the way the Government handles personal information. The Government has the responsibility to ensure that information available to it is used in the most efficient and effective way possible to achieve its goals. However, in doing so, it needs to adopt and develop a framework that is transparent and affects the privacy rights of individuals. Therefore, the Government welcomes submissions on any or all aspects of the information-sharing proposal. 35 CHAPTER 9 Releasing information for tax administration purposes 9.1 Inland Revenue is required to keep secret all information it collects under the tax laws. There are two main exceptions to this requirement: • information can be disclosed when it is necessary to do so for tax administration purposes; and • information can be shared with other government agencies for non-tax purposes under specific statutory exceptions. 9.2 This chapter discusses whether the tax secrecy provisions provide sufficient flexibility for Inland Revenue to administer the tax system in an optimal way. It proposes a new framework that will help to provide a more effective tax system while providing appropriate restrictions over the use of tax information. Inland Revenue’s secrecy obligations 9.3 The effective administration of the New Zealand tax system relies heavily on taxpayers voluntarily complying with that system. In order to be willing to comply with the tax system, it is crucial that taxpayers have trust in Inland Revenue. To retain taxpayers’ trust in Inland Revenue, it is important that taxpayers’ information is not disclosed inappropriately. 9.4 At the same time, Inland Revenue must be able to disclose information to taxpayers and third parties, when it is reasonable to do so, in order to operate the tax system efficiently. 9.5 An appropriate balance, therefore, needs to be struck in situations where these principles are inconsistent with each other. Currently, section 81 of the Tax Administration Act governs how these principles are reconciled. This section strictly prohibits disclosure of any information relating to tax legislation except when reasonably necessary to carry into effect Inland Revenue Acts, or when a specific exception applies. Some specific exceptions relate to tax administration purposes and other specific exceptions relate to disclosure for non-tax purposes. Before disclosing individuals’ personal information, Inland Revenue must also consider the principles contained in the Privacy Act. 9.6 The strictness of the current secrecy rules can be seen as promoting the principle that taxpayers’ information is not disclosed inappropriately. However, the rules provide insufficient flexibility to administer the tax system in an optimal way. 36 9.7 When a conservative interpretation is taken, Inland Revenue can be prevented from making disclosure to administer the tax legislation – even when the disclosure provides benefits (such as efficiency or promotion of taxpayer compliance) that outweigh any costs. 9.8 There is a range of potential initiatives involving disclosure of information related to administering the tax system which have benefits (such as efficiency or taxpayer compliance), but which may not be necessary to administer the tax system. 9.9 When the benefits of disclosure for a particular initiative are sufficiently high, legislative uncertainty has been resolved in the past by adding a specific exception to the legislation clarifying that disclosure is permitted. An example of this is a specific provision introduced in 2007 to ensure that Inland Revenue can inform a taxpayer whether the person who is preparing the taxpayer’s return of income is listed as a tax agent. 9.10 The Government proposes changes to the tax secrecy rules that would allow Inland Revenue to administer the tax system more efficiently. Proposed legislative change to the tax secrecy rules 9.11 To provide administrative flexibility, while still reflecting the importance of protecting information held by Inland Revenue, the following changes to the secrecy provisions in the tax rules are proposed. Lower threshold for release of information for tax administration purposes 9.12 As noted above, Inland Revenue is currently permitted to disclose information only when it is reasonably necessary to administer the tax laws. However, this provides insufficient flexibility for Inland Revenue to administer the tax system in an optimal way. The Government proposes this threshold be replaced with a requirement that the disclosure is for a purpose that is related to the administration of the tax system (and Inland Revenue’s related functions such as administration of KiwiSaver and child support). It would be clarified that “administering the tax laws” for these purposes would include measures aimed at protecting the integrity of the tax system or promoting taxpayer compliance. 9.13 Under this proposal, Inland Revenue could disclose information in a greater range of circumstances. Any lowering of the threshold is likely to result in concerns that taxpayer information may be released inappropriately. To mitigate this concern, the Government considers that Inland Revenue should be required to explicitly consider the integrity of the tax system and the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers before releasing information to another agency. 37 Explicit consideration of sections 6 and 6A before release of information 9.14 Sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act are the fundamental guiding principles that are the basis for Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system. 9.15 Section 6 requires that Inland Revenue officers must protect “the integrity of the tax system”. “The integrity of the tax system” includes, but is not limited to: • taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; • the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially and according to law; • the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; • the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; • the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and • the responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. 9.16 Under section 6A, Inland Revenue is charged with the care and management of taxes. In exercising this discretion, Inland Revenue must consider the importance of promoting voluntary compliance. 9.17 The Government considers that the proposed rules should require Inland Revenue to explicitly consider how a proposed disclosure will impact on the following key principles reflected in sections 6 and 6A: • integrity of the tax system; • promotion of voluntary compliance; and • administrative efficiency. 9.18 The Government considers that the Inland Revenue should also consider the sensitivity of the information to the taxpayer. This would ensure that taxpayer- specific information that is more sensitive (such as information about child support payments) receives higher protection. If Inland Revenue is the only agency that holds the information, it is likely to be more sensitive. 9.19 The requirement would ensure that Inland Revenue could not make a disclosure, and is not compelled to make a disclosure, unless upon consideration of the factors outlined above, the benefits of the disclosure outweigh the disadvantages. 9.20 Higher benefits to the integrity of the tax system, the promotion of voluntary compliance, or administrative efficiency would have to be demonstrated before there was any disclosure of taxpayer information of a more sensitive nature. 38 9.21 As noted above, Inland Revenue also considers the principles contained in the Privacy Act 1993 before disclosing individuals’ personal information. This would not change under this proposal. Information that does not identify a taxpayer 9.22 Currently, Ministerial authorisation is required before information that does not relate to an identifiable taxpayer can be disclosed for non-tax purposes. Because this imposes compliance costs for researchers studying the tax system, this rule sometimes hinders research that would assist in designing a better tax administration. The Government proposes that this requirement be removed. This means that information about Inland Revenue’s processes or aggregate data about taxpayers could be released without Ministerial authorisation, as long as this was consistent with protecting the integrity of the tax system and promotion of taxpayer compliance. 9.23 The process outlined in Diagram 1 demonstrates how Inland Revenue could apply the new secrecy rules. Diagram 1: Proposed secrecy rules process Is the disclosure for purposes of tax administration? Is the disclosure of non- taxpayer-specific information consistent with maintaining the integrity of the tax system? Is the information taxpayer-specific? YesNo Apply the following matrix Does another specific exception apply (including under proposed PAYE data-sharing)? Release Do not release YesNo LowHigh High Low Sensitivity Benefits Release under that exception Release Is not permitted YesNo NoYes Information cannot be released Information can be released 39 9.24 Below are some examples of how the proposed rules would work in practice. Circumstances when information may be disclosed (a) Providing a public explanation of an Inland Revenue administrative decision that involves a taxpayer An example of when Inland Revenue might not be able to disclose information under the current rules is when a high-profile tax investigation has been incorrectly reported in the media, and public comment on limited relevant aspects by Inland Revenue on the case would protect public perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. In the majority of tax investigation cases, Inland Revenue should not provide any public comment. This is because an important element of protecting the integrity of the tax system is a taxpayer’s right to have his or her individual affairs kept confidential. However, in some circumstances, the need to protect taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system might outweigh these confidentiality considerations. This is particularly so when the taxpayer has already commented publicly about the matter. Under the current rules, it is not clear if disclosure could be made. The proposed rules would allow Inland Revenue to provide limited, relevant public comment when protection of taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system outweigh confidentiality considerations. Under the new rule it would be clear that Inland Revenue could release information in this situation. (b) Releasing the fact that a taxpayer has a tax debt to a credit reporter Disclosing the fact that a taxpayer has an outstanding tax debt to a credit reporter would be a possible strategy to improve taxpayer compliance. The underlying assumption is that it would encourage taxpayers to pay their tax debt to avoid their credit rating being affected. Although in certain circumstances this disclosure may be an appropriate strategy to improve taxpayer compliance, and therefore the integrity of the tax system, it is arguably not sufficiently necessary to administer the Inland Revenue Acts. If there is good reason to believe that this type of disclosure would be an effective compliance tool in certain circumstances, under the proposed rules disclosure is likely to be a purpose that is related to the administration of the tax system. The disclosure should be made only if it is consistent with protecting the integrity of the tax system. As noted above, taxpayers’ rights to have their individual affairs kept confidential is important. Other components of the integrity of the tax system, such as taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system, and the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law, must be considered. Advising a credit bureau that a taxpayer has a tax debt is likely to enhance these components, as other taxpayers would have confidence 40 that the tax system encourages taxpayers to comply with the law. When balancing these different components, it may be appropriate to make a disclosure only in limited circumstances, such as when the debt amount is significant, overdue and not the subject of a dispute. Under the proposed rule, it would be clear that Inland Revenue could release information in this situation. Before any release of information, the taxpayer concerned would be notified and given the opportunity to pay any arrears or raise any concerns. (c) Answering phone queries from a family member of a deaf or non- English speaking taxpayer It is not clear if the current rules permit Inland Revenue to answer phone queries made on behalf of a deaf or non-English speaking taxpayer from a relative or friend. This is because it is not clear that disclosing information to the taxpayer’s relative or friend would meet the current test of being “reasonably necessary”, given that the taxpayer could make enquiries in writing. While a specific exception allows Inland Revenue to release information to a taxpayer, his or her agent or their legal representative, a friend or family member will usually not fall under this category (a taxpayer’s agent or legal representative generally has associated responsibilities such as filing or fiduciary obligations). Under the proposed rules, it would be clear that Inland Revenue would be able to answer such queries when the taxpayer has authorised the relative or friend to ring Inland Revenue on their behalf. The purpose of the disclosure is related to the administration of the tax system. When the taxpayer has authorised the relative or friend, this disclosure would be consistent with protecting the integrity of the tax system and promoting compliance. Under the proposed rule it would be clear that Inland Revenue could release information in this situation. Circumstances when information would not be disclosed (d) Employer wants to know whether employee has a second job A taxpayer’s employer asks Inland Revenue whether a taxpayer has a second job. The employer suspects the taxpayer has a second job, which is in contravention of the taxpayer’s employment agreement. The information is related to a specific taxpayer and the disclosure is not for a purpose that is related to the administration of the tax system. No other specific exceptions apply. Inland Revenue should not release information in this situation. 41 (e) GST refund thresholds A person asks Inland Revenue at what threshold GST refunds are sent automatically. This information could potentially be used to defraud the tax system. Although this information is non-taxpayer specific, its release is likely to harm the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue should not release information in this situation. Improving legislative navigability of rules 9.25 The Government considers that the large number of specific legislative exceptions to the secrecy rules should be reorganised so that it is clear which exceptions are examples of disclosures that are related to tax administration purposes, and which are disclosures that are unrelated (or not primarily related) to the administration of the tax system. This would improve legislative navigability. Operational guidelines 9.26 The proposal would allow Inland Revenue more flexibility to administer the tax system based on an assessment of risks, benefits and costs. This means the proposed rules would require more judgement and consideration than the current rules. It will be important that the proposed rules are applied consistently by Inland Revenue to different situations. The proposed option is that Inland Revenue should develop operational guidelines, in the form of a standard practice statement, to explain how Inland Revenue would exercise its discretion and how the proposed rules would be administered in different situations. 9.27 The standard practice statement would categorise disclosures according to the type of information and the recipient of the disclosure. It would outline the process for disclosure and the level at which different types of disclosures would be signed off. 9.28 The standard practice statement would be developed in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, and professional bodies such as the New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. 9.29 In addition, the proposed legislative provisions should not take effect until the standard practice statement has been published. 42 Questions for submitters Do you think tax information should be shared, more broadly, if it would mean improved services and less hassle? In what circumstances should Inland Revenue release taxpayer information for tax administration purposes? Do you agree that information should be released in the scenarios outlined in paragraph 9.24? Are there other scenarios when Inland Revenue could release taxpayer information? The proposed test for releasing information for tax administration purposes would require higher benefits of disclosure to be demonstrated before releasing sensitive taxpayer information. The benefits must be to the integrity of the tax system, the promotion of voluntary taxpayer compliance, and administrative efficiency). Do you agree with these criteria? Are there other criteria that should be considered? Should taxpayer consent be a factor in whether information is disclosed?

Financial instability following a break-up is all too common. If parents are able to work together in the interests of all family members, this can greatly reduce the strain and pressure of the situation. Many separated parents do make private, relatively amicable arrangements for the care and financial welfare of their children. This is the best option and the one to be encouraged. However, there will always be circumstances in which amicable arrangements are impossible. In these circumstances the Government provides a means for the financial welfare of children to be safe-guarded. The state-run child support scheme is a back-up for parents who are living apart and are unable or unwilling to make satisfactory private arrangements for the financial support of their children. Government intervention for parents living apart can, however, exacerbate tensions between them, since externally imposed schemes are, by their very nature, less flexible than good private arrangements. I note that over a quarter of the letters I receive as Minister of Revenue are from people who are unhappy with some aspect of the child support scheme. Even though it will never be possible to develop a child support scheme that satisfies all participants all the time, it is from time to time worth reviewing the scheme to see if it can meet the needs of the vast majority. In the 18 years since the scheme was introduced there have been significant shifts in patterns of child raising, workforce participation, the expenditure for raising children, and family law. Child support debt levels, mainly due to penalties, have also escalated considerably. I therefore encourage you to express your views on the options suggested in this discussion document for improving the child support scheme. Your contributions will have a big influence on ensuring we have a child support scheme that works as effectively as possible, and for the wellbeing of our children. Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue 1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 The New Zealand child support scheme helps to provide financial support for over 210,000 children. It is therefore essential that the scheme operates as effectively as possible, and in the best interests of the children involved. 1.2 The child support scheme is intended to be a simple, efficient, equitable and transparent method of establishing the amount of financial support that parents living apart may have to pay towards raising their children. Not all parents involved with the scheme, however, perceive it to be so and over the years, since its introduction in 1992, there have been numerous calls to make changes to the scheme. 1.3 Everyone has a different view about what a fairer scheme might look like and how to achieve it, and it will never be possible to design rules to satisfy all concerned. Nevertheless, many people consider that the scheme is now out of date, which if true, could undermine parents’ incentives to meet their child support obligations. This could be detrimental to the wellbeing of their children. This discussion document considers these issues and suggests changes to the way that child support is calculated and enforced. 1.4 Some paying parents have raised concerns that the scheme does not take account of their particular circumstances. 1 For example, they may share the care and costs of their children but have arrangements that do not qualify as “shared care” for the purposes of the child support formula. Or they might be in a situation where their income, on which child support liability is calculated, is substantially less than that of the receiving parent’s. 1.5 Some receiving parents may be concerned about non-payment of child support on the part of the paying parent or the instability of payments. Some may consider the payments to be insufficient to meet the costs of caring for their children. 1.6 These perceptions can make some parents less willing to meet their payment obligations or increase their desire to have the amount of their contributions reviewed. Because children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, any improvements to the current scheme will be based on the need to increase incentives to meet child support obligations. This is most likely to occur if the scheme is seen as a fair reflection of the expenditure for raising children, the parents’ contributions to care and their capacity to pay, as well as being well administered through appropriate sanctions for non-payment. 1 In this document the terms “receiving parent” and “paying parent” are generally used to distinguish between the two parents, rather than “custodial parent” and “liable parent”. There are some relatively rare situations when both parents are paying and receiving child support. 2 1.7 The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving parent is the main care provider. However, when parents live apart, there is now a greatly increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children’s lives. 1.8 Participation of women in the workforce, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work. 2 1.9 These issues form part of this review. 1.10 Ways of dealing with the ever escalating levels of accumulated debt relating, in the main, to child support penalties, also need to be considered. Options to encourage the prompt payment of child support and increased compliance by paying parents are therefore discussed in this document. Conversely, paying parents may consider the penalties for late payment to be excessive and may question whether the penalties provide the right incentives to pay. 1.11 Tax credits that assist families in raising their children have changed substantially since the scheme was established, and the child support scheme needs to be evaluated against this. 1.12 Developments in other countries need to be considered too. Australia undertook a substantial review of its child support scheme in 2005. The result was a fundamental change in the way that child support contributions have been calculated in Australia since 1 July 2008. Given our cultural and economic similarities, and the co-operation that exists between Australia and New Zealand in relation to child support enforcement, there are advantages in our schemes being compatible. What this discussion document aims to do 1.13 Improvement to the child support scheme is an ongoing process that will continue to happen on a variety of fronts. The suggestions in this document follow a number of recent changes made to improve the effectiveness of the scheme, such as: • The introduction in 2008 of child support information-matching with the Customs Service that allows Inland Revenue to know when parents who are significantly behind paying child support enter or leave the country. This has proved to be a very effective enforcement measure that has resulted, in the year to 30 June 2010, in these parents agreeing to make over $77 million in back-payments of child support. 2 Department of Labour statistics show that the female labour force participation rate was at a record high of 62.5 percent in the year ending March 2009, compared with 54.3 percent for the same period in 1992. Over the same period there was little change in the male labour force participation rate. 3 • In 2006, the ability for Inland Revenue to review a child support assessment if an investigation into a paying parent’s financial affairs shows the assessment does not reflect the parent’s true ability to provide financial support. This is a very useful tool that enables Inland Revenue to counter the use of vehicles such as trusts to shelter parental income for child support purposes. 1.14 This document includes options for revising the child support formula to take account of the important issues of better recognition of shared care, the income of both parents, and the current expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. 1.15 The Government needs to ensure that the best incentives to pay are in place so that child support payments are made on time, as timely payment is critical. The document therefore analyses these issues, and makes various suggestions, including that child support payments be compulsorily deducted from salaries or wages. 1.16 The desirability of parents reaching private agreements on their financial contributions and care arrangements for their children, without having these arrangements imposed upon them cannot, however, be emphasised too strongly. The Government supports the conclusions of the issues paper published last year by the Families Commission in this regard. 3 SUMMARY OF MAIN OPTIONS Child support formula Option 1 – comprehensive change Under this option, the child support formula would be revised to incorporate: • Lower levels of regular and shared care, by way of tiered thresholds (in which case care at levels from 14 percent of nights could be recognised). • The income of each parent. For the purposes of the calculation, each parent’s income would be reduced by a fixed living allowance, equivalent to one-third of average earnings. • Up-to-date information on the expenditure for raising children. This information would result in the amount of child support payable being variable, depending on: – the number of children; – the age of the children (costs being higher for children over 12 years); and – parents’ combined income (taking into account that expenditure on children rises in absolute terms as income rises, but declines in percentage terms). 3 The Families Commission’s issues paper of August 2009 entitled “What separating parents need when making care arrangements for their children.” 4 Payments would still be subject to an income cap to reflect that, even though there is no obvious cut-off point for expenditure on children, the expenditure becomes increasingly discretionary as household income rises. Option 2 – component changes Elements of option 1 would be incorporated into the existing child support formula. For example, the existing formula could be extended to include recognition of a wider range of regular care situations (including a simple reduction to the minimum shared care percentage) or just incorporate the up-to-date expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. Option 3 – status quo Retaining the current child support formula, particularly having regard to the impact and complexity of more radical change, is also an option. Payment, penalties and debt Improving payment The compulsory deduction of child support payments from salary and wages for all employees with child support obligations is proposed. Other suggestions include Inland Revenue being able to place greater reliance on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s level of care. Reducing debt Options for reducing debt, mainly through the penalties system, include reducing penalties in later years or capping them and, instead, increasing non-financial enforcement measures, are also considered. Timing of reform 1.17 The Government will be guided by the feedback on this discussion document. If feedback supports change, the Government will consider the detail of any such change and when it would be most appropriate to implement it.

Objectives of a child support scheme 2.1 The purpose of a child support scheme is to deliver financial support to children to promote their ongoing wellbeing and healthy development following parental separation. This includes: • maintaining as far as possible the level of care children could have expected had the parents remained together, by providing financial support to assist receiving parents to raise their children, thereby promoting stability for the children; • ensuring the scheme does not discourage either parent from being actively engaged in their children’s lives and that they share care and financial responsibility where possible; • encouraging parents to work together in the best interests of their children; • reducing opportunities for conflict which will negatively impact on the children; and • encouraging and facilitating parents to make timely payments. 2.2 Child support schemes may also be designed to ensure, where relevant, that contributions are made towards taxpayer-funded sole-parent benefits. 2.3 With these aims in mind, the current scheme was established by the Child Support Act 1991. That Act revised the rules relating to child maintenance when agreement between parents proves difficult, or when the receiving parent is a beneficiary. 2.4 One of the Government’s key social policy objectives is to ensure that New Zealanders have an equal opportunity to participate in and contribute to society. This includes providing a safety net through the benefit system for those who are unable, for various reasons, to financially support themselves. 7 2.5 In the context of child support, this means that child support payments are collected and delivered for the benefit of the children they are intended for, and that parents do not pass their financial responsibilities to maintain their children onto other members of society. This is why parents can be liable for child support even when the custodial parent receives a state-provided benefit. 2.6 The child support scheme is needed when parents cannot mutually agree on their relative financial contributions to support their children. Although many parents reach private agreement on their financial contributions and care arrangements, and outcomes may be more satisfactory if they do, many others cannot achieve agreement. A back-stop scheme is needed in these circumstances. 2.7 In the absence of an administratively based scheme family courts would need to determine levels of child support contributions when parents cannot reach agreement. This could place undue pressure on the court system. The administrative approach will, in any event, likely be more efficient because contributions can usually be determined quickly by reference to a formula. 2.8 The scheme is not, however, intended to provide full financial compensation to offset any decline in family members’ living standards as a result of the parents living apart. A decline in living standards is often inevitable in these circumstances. There is often a duplication of housing and related costs, such as utilities and household furnishings. There are also additional costs associated with the children visiting or staying with the paying parent, such as play and study space, toys and play equipment, and transport costs. Does the scheme calculate contributions appropriately? 2.9 While an administratively based scheme is generally accepted internationally, child support schemes and how contributions under these schemes are calculated differ. The intention is that the payments should represent the expenditure for raising children but there are different views about how to measure the expenditure. There is no single “expenditure” that applies in all situations as parental income and values may influence how much parents would normally spend on their children. Further questions include to what degree regular care by paying parents should result in reduced payments and whether, if it is appropriate to link the payments to income, there should be an income cap. These are all difficult issues that other countries have had similar problems grappling with. Perceptions 2.10 In the stressful circumstances of a relationship breakdown, or when parents are otherwise separated, a child support scheme that calculates and places an obligation upon parties can appear to one or both parties to be unreasonable and inflexible irrespective of its merits. 8 2.11 Many parents have said they would prefer the scheme to be more flexible to take account of their particular circumstances. For example, parents may genuinely share the care and costs of their children but have arrangements that do not qualify as shared care for the purposes of the child support formula. Or they might be in a situation where the paying parent’s income is substantially less than that of the receiving parent. 2.12 If the receiving parent is a sole-parent beneficiary, some paying parents may perceive that their payments are not being passed on to their children, given that the state generally retains the child support payments to help offset the cost of the benefit. 2.13 In these situations, child support obligations imposed on many paying parents can be a barrier to their willingness to pay. 2.14 In other cases, the scheme may simply fail to accommodate the discordant views about a child’s upbringing that may become apparent when parents separate. This too can reduce the willingness to pay. 2.15 Conversely, receiving parents want to ensure that the payments are received and are on time, that the paying parent is meeting his or her responsibilities, and that the children do not suffer the consequences of late or non-payment. Importantly, they want to ensure that the payments they receive are adequate for supporting the children. A survey commissioned by the Families Commission found that receiving parents often feel the payment is insufficient to cover both everyday expenses and “one-offs” throughout the year. 4 2.16 This perceived lack of flexibility in the scheme may also mean that, for either parent, there is insufficient regard for: • re-establishment costs that parents incur when they separate; • private financial contributions parents make for the benefit of their children; and • parenting agreements relating to the care of children for shared care purposes. 2.17 Are these perceptions about the scheme correct? To answer this question this chapter considers in more detail the advantages and disadvantages of the scheme. Before doing so, features of the scheme are first outlined. A more detailed outline is provided in appendix 1, along with some background on earlier child support legislation. 4 New Zealand Child Support Arrangements – A research report for the Families Commission: Kōmihana ā whānau by Colmar Brunton. 9 How child support works 2.18 The current child support scheme is administered by Inland Revenue, which is responsible for both assessing contributions and collecting payments. The child support scheme is voluntary for parents unless the caregiver is receiving a sole parent benefit. 2.19 When an application for child support has been properly made, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is bound to accept it. Liability then arises under a simple administrative formula. The parent with the liability makes his or her payment to the Crown which then passes it to the person who has primary care for the child. In most cases this will be the child’s other parent. If the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit, the child support payments are retained by the Crown to help defray the cost of the benefit and any excess is passed on to the caregiver. The standard formula 2.20 The current formula for calculating child support is: (a – b) x c where: “a” is the child support income amount; “b” is the living allowance; and “c” is the child support percentage. 2.21 For most paying parents, the child support income amount is their taxable income in the preceding income year. The maximum child support income that can be assessed is set at two and a half times the national average earnings for men and women as at mid-February of the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year. The maximum is currently $120,463. 2.22 There are six separate living allowance levels, ranging from $14,158 to $35,868, depending on whether the paying parent is living alone or with a partner and/or other children. The allowance is based on benefit rates plus a set amount for each dependent child up to a maximum of four children. 2.23 Once the living allowance has been deducted from child support income, the product is multiplied by the child support percentage relevant for the number of children being supported. The standard percentages are: No. of children Child support percentage – sole care 1 18 2 24 3 27 4 or more 30 10 2.24 There is a minimum amount of child support payable each year, the current minimum amount being $815. Shared care 2.25 The above percentages are reduced if parents share the care of their child. Under the Child Support Act, care of a child is regarded as being shared when each provider of care shares the ongoing daily care of the child “substantially equally” with the other care provider. A paying parent who looks after a child for at least 40 percent of nights is considered to meet this test. 2.26 If a parent does not meet this test, he or she may qualify under an alternative test based on the court’s interpretation of “substantially equally”. This is at least 50 percent of the responsibility in relation to the factors constituting care other than overnight care. 2.27 If shared care is established, parents can cross-apply for child support. This involves respective liabilities being offset to produce a net amount for one parent to pay. Administrative reviews 2.28 If either parent considers that the amount payable under the formula is not appropriate, they can apply for an administrative review under one or more of the 10 grounds set out in the Child Support Act. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue then appoints an independent review officer experienced in relevant cases to consider the application. The review officer makes a recommendation on whether departure from the child support formula assessment is warranted. The Commissioner has the discretion to either accept the review officer’s recommendation or conduct a rehearing. Advantages of the current approach to calculating contributions 2.29 The scheme is fairly simple and provides relative certainty for parents about their obligations and entitlements. Assessment under the scheme is simple to understand and relatively easy to administer. Furthermore, the formula’s fixed standards generally ensure that parents with like circumstances are treated the same. In most cases, there is no need for a reassessment. Disadvantages of the current approach to calculating contributions 2.30 The main disadvantage of the current approach is that it does not adequately reflect the variety of social and parenting circumstances in New Zealand today. To the extent that, in the longer term, this adversely affects parents’ willingness to pay child support, it adversely affects the children concerned. It is also at least questionable, given increasing child support debt rates, whether the current penalties system creates the appropriate level of incentive to pay. 11 Actual expenditure for raising children 2.31 The formula is linked directly to income rather than expenditure. Expenditure appears to rise in tandem with income, but whether the current income percentages and the cap in the formula are set at appropriate levels may be questioned. Incentives to pay child support may decline if parents are unhappy with the basis used for calculating the payments. 2.32 An associated issue is the impact of the increase in the living allowance when a paying parent establishes another family. This leads to a lower contribution towards the expenditure for raising children from an earlier relationship even though costs have not declined. 5 2.33 These concerns are explored in chapter 3. 2.34 Generally, there is a need to ensure that child support in New Zealand focuses on the expenditure for raising children rather than any wider objective such as providing a general income supplement for single-parent households. If a greater equalisation of lifestyles between parents is intended, there are other income transfer mechanisms for separated families designed precisely for this purpose – namely, domestic maintenance, Working for Families Tax Credits and state-provided benefits. Shared care 2.35 Shared care is assumed under the formula to arise in a narrow set of circumstances. In reality, parenting arrangements are far more varied. The current approach, therefore, acts as a disincentive to shared care. Specifically, the threshold tests for recognising shared care are perceived as too high and as creating a “cliff” effect. A “cliff” effect results in there being a substantial change in the amount of child support payable, depending on whether shared care is established at the prescribed level. 6 Paying parents who have care of their children for lesser periods are not entitled to a reduction in their liability even though they incur costs in providing for their children during those periods of care. The cliff effect may have a negative impact on the time children are able to spend with the paying parent because, in reaching the threshold, there is a sudden and substantial drop in the amount of child support received. These matters and how they might be addressed are explored in chapter 4. 5 This issue was discussed in the 1994 Trapski report. See Child Support Review, Report of the Working Party, 8 November 1994. 6 Under the current scheme, in extreme cases, this change can come down to which parent the child is with on a given night. 12 Respective incomes 2.36 The current child support formula assumes that receiving parents’ main contribution to raising their children is their time and that they have little income because of this commitment. 7 Consequently, the child support formula only applies to the paying parent’s income. This approach can produce inequities when both parents are in fact in paid employment and are, therefore, able to financially contribute towards their children’s upbringing. In some cases, the receiving parent may even have a higher income than the paying parent. 2.37 A method of calculating child support that not only reflects the expenditure for raising children but also more closely mirrors what parents would likely do were they living together, such as pooling more of their income and expenditure, could produce a better outcome for both parents and children. 2.38 These issues are explored in chapter 5. Interaction with administrative review process 2.39 Inevitably, a formula cannot take the wide variety of often complex circumstances surrounding the breakdown of a parental relationship fully into account. The administrative review process is designed to provide further flexibility but the factors that it can currently take into consideration are not always pertinent and the process can be cumbersome and stressful. Appendix 2 sets out the current administrative review criteria. 2.40 A consequence of the measures outlined in this document is that a wider range of relevant factors could be taken into account up-front. This could result in efficiencies in the administrative review function. Child support debt and penalties 2.41 A critical issue in delivering child support is the timeliness of the payments. Chapter 7 outlines how this could be improved by ensuring deductions are made automatically from salary or wages. 2.42 Penalties play a vital role in encouraging parents to pay their child support obligations, and should continue to do so. However, if they are excessive, they can perversely discourage the payment of child support, to the detriment of the children concerned. 2.43 Changes that could encourage the timely payment of child support and increase compliance by paying parents, in addition to dealing with existing accumulated debt, are discussed in chapter 8. 7 This in-kind contribution can be measured as the foregone potential employment opportunities and loss of work while providing day-to-day care of the child. 13 Summary 2.44 Although the current scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents. These concerns need to be addressed in any revised approach. The following chapters explore how this might be done. 14 CHAPTER 3 Expenditure for raising children This chapter outlines Australian and New Zealand studies relating to the expenditure for raising children and discusses the implication of these studies for the child support formula. It concludes that the trends in the estimated expenditure for raising children in New Zealand are broadly in line with Australian findings, and suggests that these expenditures should be recognised in any revised formula. A number of related matters are also discussed. Relevance of the expenditure for raising children 3.1 There is an acceptance internationally that child support contributions should reflect the cost to parents of raising children. Various methods are used to try to achieve this. They invariably involve deriving a “cost” and then translating it into a percentage of income to represent the assumed expenditure for raising a child for a particular income level or range. 3.2 New Zealand’s current scheme is based on an approach initially developed in the United States in the early 1980s as a way to recover from paying parents welfare payments made to receiving parents. 8 Like other schemes internationally, it incorporates a measure of the expenditure for raising children to derive the income percentages used in its formula. 3.3 As noted earlier, a commonly raised criticism of the current scheme – and in particular its formula – is that it may not accurately reflect the expenditure for raising children in varying family circumstances. 3.4 This is partly a function of the approach assuming, in the first instance, that: • the receiving parent cares for the child and does not earn any income outside of the home (the paying parent is therefore assumed to be the sole income earner); and • the child lives with the receiving parent for the vast majority of the time. 3.5 Adjustments and review mechanisms have been provided to accommodate a wider range of circumstances such as shared care but these have been found lacking. Accordingly, alternative ways of relaxing the assumptions the scheme is currently based on are discussed in subsequent chapters. 8 The scheme originated in Wisconsin and formed the basis of the scheme previously adopted by Australia too. 15 3.6 It is important to consider whether the formula produces payments that fairly represent the true expenditure for raising a child even when there is no shared care and the receiving parent has little income. Some mechanism for determining what it costs to raise a child that is a fair reflection or proxy of the actual cost in the majority of circumstances is, therefore, necessary. Accordingly, this chapter examines overseas results in this area and compares them with estimates of the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand, to test their relevance in the New Zealand context. Measuring the estimated average expenditure for raising children 3.7 Internationally there is a wealth of research into the expenditure for raising children. It often starts with identifying the items that make up cost or expenditure. These are housing costs, 9 energy consumption, food, clothing and footwear, household goods and services, 10 childcare, health, transport, leisure, 11 personal care and education. Identifying a dollar amount for each of these items is a more complex exercise, however. 3.8 Matters that need to be taken into account to gauge costs include: • Which methodology is most appropriate. As described in paragraph 3.10, there are two main methodologies for measuring costs – one based on actual expenditure (as per household survey data) and another that uses a “basket of goods” that a child is considered to need for an acceptable living standard. 12 • The need to compare like with like. For example, families should have equivalent living standards for comparisons to be valid. Also, when analysing actual expenditures it is necessary to make assumptions about the way in which having a child affects the amount that parents spend on themselves as this is not directly measured in household survey data. • How to allocate costs of goods and services used collectively by the family, the key ones being housing and transport. • Whether to take into account the additional duplicate costs that arise when parents live apart. These essentially arise from shared care; for example, an extra bedroom, toys and clothes at the paying parent’s home, and travel. Household survey data will tend to reflect the expenditures of two-parent families. • The need to reduce expenditures by any tax credits and other similar benefits received as these in effect subsidise the cost to parents. 13 9 Because of the variability of housing and the fact that the costs of home ownership, such as a mortgage, are used to acquire an asset that adds to wealth, studies may instead use private rents as their cost guide. For example, the study undertaken by Paul Henman for the Australian Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support used median private rents as its guide. Expenditure for the child was based on whether an additional bedroom was required, which depended on the number, age and sex of the children. 10 This includes an assumed reduction in the life of general household appliances and utensils. 11 Includes the cost of toys, books, sporting equipment and outings. 12 Identifying living standards is an issue in itself. 13 Income tax aspects were not taken into account in the Wisconsin model as it was originally intended to apply to income earners paying little or no tax. 16 3.9 Opportunity costs, such as forgone earnings while looking after the children, are often not taken into consideration, partly because they are a non-cash cost and studies generally focus on direct parental expenditure. The expenditure required to enable parents to stay in the workforce, namely the cost of childcare, may be included instead, but there is some debate around how to do this. Parents’ participation in the labour force varies significantly so simply including an average cost of childcare within expenditure for raising children estimates could overstate the aggregate costs for those who do not incur childcare and understate the cost for those who, even after allowing for Government subsidies, may have substantial childcare costs. 14 Methodologies 3.10 While there is a range of approaches to measuring expenditure, the two main methods are: • Analysing actual household expenditure data to estimate how children add to a couple’s observed household expenditure. Households with the equivalent standard of living, with and without children, are compared under this approach. • Calculating how much it costs two-parent households to meet the non- discretionary financial needs of children, holding living standards constant, irrespective of household income. Rather than using actual expenditure data, this approach costs a “basket” of goods and services considered appropriate for the relevant living standard. 15 3.11 There are supporters and detractors of both approaches and their variants. The consensus internationally is that there is no single method that is best and that produces an unambiguous “true expenditure” for raising a child. The Australian Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support undertook one of the most comprehensive studies of this area and concluded that, in the end, it is a matter of judgement, and that judgement must be informed by existing empirical estimates and be evidence-based. 16 Australian studies and results Key findings 3.12 The Australian Taskforce took the view that the formula percentages should be based on the best available estimates of the expenditure for raising children. It considered the fairest basis for the scheme to be the expenditure for raising children in two-parent families, with the research on the expenditure for raising children in separated families informing the issue of how to take account of the costs of regular and shared care. 14 Australia has endeavoured to provide for childcare and some degree of lost earnings through applying the higher expenditure for raising 5-12 year olds also to 0-4 year olds given that childcare costs are likely to be highest for very young children. 15 This approach has been used as the basis for many child support guidelines in the United States. 16 The National Academy of Sciences Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance in the United States which undertook a major study on how to measure poverty and equivalence scales, came to the same view. 17 3.13 The taskforce compared the results of various methodologies to reach what it considered to be the best and most up-to-date estimates of the expenditures for raising children in two-parent Australian families. In one study, the Australian Household Expenditure Survey was used to derive patterns of expenditure on children while another study used the basket of goods approach, taking into account differences in housing costs across Australia. The results of these two studies were then compared with earlier Australian research findings on the expenditure for raising children. The Australian estimates were also benchmarked against international studies on the expenditure for raising children. 3.14 The key findings of this research were: • The dollar cost of raising children increases with family income but declines as a proportion of income. • The expenditure for raising children rises with the age of the children (teenagers were found to cost two to three times as much as very young children). • There are economies of scale so that, in general, each additional child costs less than the last. • Subsidies delivered through the tax system mean that the community as a whole now plays a much more substantial role in sharing the expenditure for raising children for all types of families. 3.15 Some key results from the study undertaken by Paul Henman of the University of Queensland, using a basket of goods to derive estimated expenditure for raising a child for various family situations, are provided in Table 1. The results are reported as percentages of taxable income and, given as noted earlier that childcare costs can vary appreciably depending on a parent’s participation in the workforce, are shown with and without the costs of childcare.

A modest income two-parent household 17 was found to have spent on average 30 percent more on a child than a low-income family, with annual expenditure, depending on the city, ranging from A$6,500 to A$10,300 compared with A$4,910 to A$7,850 for a low-income family, assuming no childcare costs. 3.17 In contrast, the study undertaken by Richard Percival and Ann Harding of the University of Canberra used actual household survey data to estimate the expenditure for raising children. Some key results are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Estimated average expenditure for raising children in two-parent families, by number of children and family income, Australia 2005–06 (A$ per week) Number of children in household Level of income Average weekly income 1 child % of income 2 children% of income 3 children% of income 4 children % of income Low income $661 $114 17 $209 32 $290 44 $362 55 Middle income $1,330 $179 13 $317 24 $428 32 $522 39 High income $2,662 $285 11 $492 18 $651 24 $779 29 Average income $1,473 $188 $331 $446 $543 Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics 1998–99 Household Expenditure Survey. Calculations do not include childcare costs. Additional expenditure for raising children when parents live apart and care is shared 3.18 There is general agreement that the costs associated with shared care of a child are higher than when one parent has sole care. The major cause is the need to duplicate housing and related costs, such as utilities, household furnishings, play and study space, toys and play equipment, and additional transport costs. 17 Defined to earn in 2004 around A$46,000 per annum when both parents were working full-time. 19 3.19 The Australian Taskforce research has helped to throw light on the extent of these additional costs. The research by Henman found that for households with a modest but adequate living standard, a paying parent with 20 percent care of a six year old child has average costs that amount to 38 percent of the expenditure for a child that is 100 percent cared for by a sole parent. 18 On the other hand, the receiving parent with 80 percent care still incurs 99 percent of the costs he or she would have borne had that parent been caring for the child 100 percent of the time. Aggregate costs are therefore on average 37 percent more under this shared care scenario. 3.20 For the equivalent low-cost household, when 20 percent contact occurs the paying parent faces average costs that are 60 percent of the cost of raising a child in one household and the receiving parent still faces 99 percent of the costs associated with 100 percent care. In aggregate, the cost is 59 percent greater than under the one-household scenario. 3.21 This increase in costs is also evident when care is evenly shared. For modest but adequate households, the costs borne by each parent with 50 percent care represent around 71 percent of the costs borne when all the care is provided by one parent, equating to an aggregate cost of 143 percent. For low-cost households, the equivalent percentages are around 87 percent for each parent and 175 percent in aggregate. 3.22 These findings are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1: Estimated average shared care costs as proportion of 100 percent care situation in Australia 9999 137 159 71 38 87 60 137 143 175 159 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 % of care % costs Modest - one parentLow-cost, one parent Modest - both parentsLow-cost - both parents 205080 18 This confirmed earlier research which had shown that paying parents who care for their children for 15 percent to 30 percent of the time incur a relative share of costs in excess of this proportion. 20 3.23 Table 3 shows how the aggregate costs are distributed among the two parents: Table 3: Percentage of estimated average total costs incurred by each parent Low Cost Modest % of shared care Receiving parent Paying parent Receiving parent Paying parent 80:20 62 38 72 28 50:50 50 50 50 50 3.24 The findings suggest that sizable additional costs arise even when a parent has only a 20 percent share of a child’s care. This implies that the shared care threshold should be substantially lower than the 40 percent of nights currently used. Net costs 3.25 The expenditure for raising children has always been split between parents and the community, with the latter effectively occurring through taxpayers funding the provision of cash transfers or services used by families with children. 3.26 The Australian Taskforce studies highlighted that these transfers had increased substantially since the Australian Child Support Scheme was introduced in 1988, meaning the community as a whole now plays a much more substantial role in sharing the expenditure for raising children for all types of families, but particularly for lower income families. Because of various tax credits there was, for example, no noted net increase in costs after three children. 3.27 Consequently, the taskforce recommended basing child support liabilities on the contribution parents normally make out of their own earnings towards the expenditure for raising their children in two-parent family situations, rather than on the total costs. Such “net” expenditure for raising children is the gross expenditure for raising children minus the contribution of Government through family tax benefits. Implications for New Zealand 3.28 Following the Australian approach, two methods have been used to measure the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand for the purposes of this discussion document, based on the costs for two-parent families. The options for handling the additional costs arising from shared care when parents live apart are addressed in the next chapter on regular and shared care. 3.29 The methodology from the equivalent Australian studies into the expenditure for raising children has been used as far as possible, but with New Zealand data. The application of these methodologies in the New Zealand context is discussed in detail in appendix 3. A summary of the results is provided below. 21 Using actual expenditure survey data 3.30 The first method involves estimating parents’ actual expenditures on their children using data from Statistics New Zealand’s 2006–07 Household Economic Survey (HES). This survey collects detailed information on household income and expenditure as well as demographic information on individuals and households. 19 3.31 The method requires estimating not only households’ expenditure but also households’ standards of living. Households with the same proportion of expenditure on a set of key expenditure items are assumed to have the same standard of living, irrespective of other differences like the total dollar amount spent on consumption, household size or composition. 20 3.32 The expenditure for a single child can then be measured by the difference in expenditures of a couple-only household and a two-parent household with a child, where both households have the same standard of living. Similarly, the expenditure for raising a second child can be measured by the differences in expenditures of a two-parent household with one child and a two-parent household with two children. Given that child support is potentially payable until a child reaches 19 years of age, the expenditure for raising children is defined as parental expenditures on children up to that age. 3.33 The results show that the average expenditure for raising children in New Zealand varies according to the age of the child, households’ level of income and the number of children in the household. Higher income households are found to spend more on their children than lower income households, but the proportion of household income spent is lower, particularly for children aged 13 to 18 years. The average expenditure per child is greatest for households with one child and progressively declines with additional children. Moreover, the expenditure for raising children aged 12 years and under is lower than that of teenagers. These findings are shown in Table 4 and Figures 2 and 3, with more detail being provided in appendix 3. The results are all consistent with the findings of the Australian studies. Table 4: Estimated average weekly expenditure for raising one child in New Zealand 0 to 1213 to 18 Low income$704$147$196 Middle income$1,365$243$291 High income$2,838$426$477 Average income$1,552$268$316 Age of child Level of incomeAverage weekly income Low income households are defined as the bottom one-fifth of households with children, middle income households the middle one-fifth and high income households the highest income one-fifth.

One parent was assumed to be employed full-time, with the other parent being the primary caregiver. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% Low incomeMiddle incomeHigh income Single child 12 years or youngerSingle child 13 to 18 years old $0 $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 $300 $350 $400 $450 $500 Low incomeMiddle incomeHigh income 1 child2 children3 children4 children 23 3.36 This estimate for one family type only was done as an accuracy check on the estimated expenditure for raising children calculated from the expenditure approach using the HES data. It was not intended to use the basket of goods approach more widely to try to replicate the trends observed from using actual expenditure data across a range of incomes. This is because the preferred method was the expenditure approach, which bases the expenditure for raising children on parents’ actual expenditure rather than a subjective basket of goods and services considered necessary to provide for children to achieve a given living standard. 3.37 The items, amounts and weightings used in the basket by Henman for a modest income household in Australia were used, as far as possible, to provide direct comparability. 21 For example, when goods or services were used jointly by family members, a portion was allocated to the children in accordance with the weights used in the Australian study. Average retail prices for the basket items were obtained from Statistics New Zealand’s Consumers Price Index data. In some cases, substitute items were used when there was no New Zealand equivalent, because of data confidentiality, for example. 3.38 The modest income household’s total weekly expenditure was estimated to be $1,088 of which $187 was allocated to the 6 year old child and $216 allocated to the 14 year old boy, a total of $403, this being the estimated expenditure for raising the two children. It is broadly in line with the estimate for a similar income household under the other study using HES data (see Figure 3). 22 Conclusion 3.39 The estimated average expenditure for raising children as a proportion of income for New Zealand is reasonably in line with the Henman findings (using a basket of goods) but is generally higher than the base estimates obtained in the other Australian study (using HES data) by Percival and Harding. For example, the following table compares the expenditure for a 6 year old, a 10 year old and a 14 year old for a low-income household. 21 That basket contained over 700 items. 22 A “modest income” household with a single income earner would appear to fall between a low and middle income household in the HES study. The expenditure for raising children derived from the basket of goods approach is subject to two known biases, which affect the estimates in opposite directions. The basket of goods and services is likely not to have included some necessary items, which will make the estimated expenditure for raising children lower than the actual costs. On the other hand, the estimated costs are also overstated because they use average retail prices. Lower income households are more likely to shop at discount stores and take advantage of sales. The magnitude of these two effects, and hence whether the costs overall are over-estimated or under-estimated, is unknown. 24 Table 5: Comparison of results for a low-income household Australia – Henman study\* Modest Low Australia – Percival and Harding study New Zealand cost study 6 year old 17% 25% 18% 21% 10 year old 19% 28% 18% 21% 14 year old 22% 32% 28% 28% \* Modest income households are also included given that they seem to fall between low and middle income households in the other two studies. This comparison excludes very young children and focuses on ages when childcare costs are less of an issue. 3.40 There may be several reasons for the difference: • The lower level of incomes in New Zealand would suggest that the proportion of income spent on children should be slightly higher given the general finding that the proportion of income spent on children declines as income rises. • The data set used in the New Zealand estimation is smaller and so may be susceptible to greater variation. • The underlying Australian HES survey data is around 10 years old so that people’s expenditure mixes may have changed. • Food and energy costs have increased relative to incomes since the Australian studies were undertaken. • The New Zealand survey data is likely to include childcare costs for some couples, and possibly education costs. As illustrated in the Australian findings, and in particular Table 1, childcare costs can add significantly to the overall cost, particularly for very young children. 3.41 These variations reinforce the view that, in reality, there is no clear single cost and that a degree of judgement is required. On balance, however, a reasonable conclusion is that the New Zealand results are sufficiently in line with those of the Australian studies to support adopting the Australian approach to recognising the expenditure for raising children in the child support formula. What this might mean in practice is discussed in chapter 6. 3.42 An important point to consider is that the costs included in the child support formula should be net of the average tax benefits likely to be received. 25 Impact of tax benefits 3.43 As in Australia, the tax benefits provided to New Zealand families have increased substantially since the child support scheme was introduced, and the benefits provided in both countries are not dissimilar. Accordingly, the expenditure for raising children as identified above should be adjusted to reflect the amounts that parents would normally need to pay from their own resources – that is, the aggregate costs less any tax subsidy. 3.44 The main benefits in New Zealand are the family tax credit and the in-work tax credit. The family tax credit is paid to the principal caregiver irrespective of whether the person is working or is a beneficiary. A payment is made for each child – in the one-child scenario this equates to $4,487 per annum if the child is under 16 and $5,198 if the child is 16 or over. 3.45 The in-work tax credit is also paid to the principal caregiver but only if that caregiver or their spouse, civil union or de facto partner works “full-time” and neither receives an income-tested or similar benefit. In most cases the payment is a flat $3,120 per annum. 3.46 Tax credits are abated at 20 cents for every dollar of family income over $36,827. 3.47 A separated parent would not qualify unless he or she was also a principal caregiver, in which case the tax benefits would be shared proportionately, according to the level of care, between the parents. 23 3.48 Child support receipts may also affect the amount of tax benefits that a parent receives, as child support receipts are included as income when calculating Working for Families Tax Credits. This means that if income, including child support, is in excess of $36,827, then for every additional dollar of child support received, the tax benefits received reduce by 20 cents. Likewise, for every dollar reduction in child support, the tax benefits received increase by 20 cents. Paying parents’ tax benefits may also change if they share care. 3.49 Figure 4 illustrates one example of the magnitude and spread of costs adjusted for the tax credits. Overall, the outcome will be very dependent on the circumstances of each parent, including the extent to which they participate in the labour force. In the example, however, one parent is the sole income earner and the other parent is the sole care giver for their one child, both when the parents are living together and when they are living apart. 3.50 Under this scenario, when the parents are living together, the family receives both the family tax credit and the in-work tax credit but the abatement applies as the family income rises. The estimated net cost in these circumstances is the solid dark blue line. 23 Both parents could, however, qualify in full for the in-work tax credit in their own right if they share care. For Working for Families Tax Credits purposes, shared care arises if the parent has the child in his or her care for at least one-third of the year. 26 3.51 When the parents separate, the receiving parent will continue to be eligible for the family tax credit because his or her income will be less than the abatement threshold of $36,827, irrespective of how much the paying parent earns. However, because of the separation, the receiving parent will not usually be eligible for the in-work tax credit. The estimated net cost in these circumstances is the dotted line. Figure 4: Estimated expenditure for raising children adjusted for tax credits: one child under 12 years 3.52 Rather than endeavouring to build into the child support formula an adjustment for tax benefits that reflects each parent’s situation, which would unduly complicate the formula, it seems to be more appropriate to follow the Australian approach of reducing the expenditure for raising children percentages for each income band by the average tax benefits likely to be received. This means that the expenditure for raising children matrix shown in Table 10 (chapter 6) is net of likely average tax benefits. -10,000 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 5,000 15,00025,00035,00045,00055,00065,00075,00085,00095,000 105,000115,000125,000135,000145,000 Parental income ($) $ Gross estimated costs Net estimated costs: parents living together Net estimated costs: parents living apart 27 CHAPTER 4 Shared care This chapter discusses how shared care is recognised under the current scheme and suggests alternatives to recognise other levels of regular care in line with levels of care adopted in Australia and the United Kingdom. The options outlined in this chapter aim to address concerns that the financial burden of child support may not always fall fairly on parents who have regular care of their children, or substantial input into the care of their children. The chapter specifically considers, and invites submissions on, the following sequence of issues: • whether the single threshold for shared care (the current 40 percent of nights test) should be retained, but lowered (for example, closer to the one-third test used for Working for Families Tax Credits); • whether a tiered system of shared care should be introduced and, if so, what tiers would achieve the fairest result in determining child support liability (tiers from 14 percent of nights are discussed); and • how the additional costs arising from regular care should be split between parents. Submissions are also invited on whether Inland Revenue, in taking account of shared care, should be able to rely on a parenting order or a parenting agreement to establish the amount of time a child spends with each parent. Background Greater emphasis on contact and care 4.1 Societal changes to patterns of parenting have occurred since the Child Support Act was introduced so it is now more common for both parents to be actively involved in raising children. 4.2 In addition, there is now far greater emphasis placed under family law on both separated parents remaining actively involved in their children’s lives and sharing responsibility for their welfare. The Care of Children Act 2004 highlights the responsibilities that both parents have towards their children rather than the rights they have as parents, emphasising that parents’ responsibilities are ongoing, and that both parents should have a significant role in their children’s upbringing. As such, parents are encouraged to co- operate and agree on arrangements for the care of their children. 28 4.3 Evidence indeed suggests there is a substantial degree of regular parental sharing of care. Thirty-six percent of respondents to the Families Commission’s survey 24 said that paying parents look after their children overnight at least a few days a fortnight. Even when high levels of care did not occur, comments from parents suggested they would be willing to increase their levels of care if other hurdles, such as conflict between the parents, could be overcome or reduced. 4.4 This is a clear contrast with the current situation under the child support scheme where shared care provisions apply to only approximately four percent of children and five percent of parental relationships in the scheme. 25 As noted in the previous chapter, the sharing of basic costs occurs at a level of care significantly below the 40 percent of nights threshold. Why we have the current shared care test 4.5 Before the introduction of the Child Support Act, the Advisory Committee on the Child Support Formula, in its 1990 report to the Ministers of Social Welfare and Revenue, recommended there be a modified child support formula for parents living apart who shared the care of their children. 4.6 The Committee considered the formula should take into account that in most cases both parents have to maintain, amongst other things, adequate accommodation to meet the needs of the children for the whole year when care is shared. While noting that the length of time chosen to denote a shared care arrangement was necessarily arbitrary, the Committee considered the (then) Australian definition of four nights out of 10 to be acceptable. The Committee further noted that this definition should be flexible but suggested that the length of time spent by children with each parent must be substantial, and that there must be a sharing of basic costs. These recommendations were incorporated into the current child support formula. What is the current adjustment? 4.7 In addition to recognising the child as being a dependant when calculating the living allowance, 26 the child support percentage based on income is reduced, depending on the number of children involved, when the 40 percent of nights shared care threshold is met, as shown in Table 6. 27 24 For details, see Appendix 4. 25 As at 31 March 2009, 7,976 children and 6,950 parental relationships were covered by a qualifying shared cared arrangement, representing 3.9 percent of children and 4.6 percent of relationships in the child support scheme. 26 The higher living allowance for shared care is of less relative benefit for higher income parents because it is set at a fixed level which does not take account of income. 27 This simplified table does not reflect the fact that a parent may have some children with shared care and some without. An adjustment does occur in such circumstances. 29 Table 6 No. of children Child support percentage Sole care Child support percentage Shared care 1 18 12 2 24 18 3 27 21 4 30 24 5 30 25.5 6 30 27 7 30 28.5 8 or more 30 30 Summary of shared care concerns 4.8 Chapter 2 outlined the key concerns that parents have expressed about the current shared care provisions, namely: • that the 40 percent of nights threshold for automatic recognition of shared care is perceived as being too high and creates a “cliff” effect; and • that the alternative test is considered to be too onerous as it may require at least 50 percent of care other than overnight care. 4.9 The Government is concerned that the current scheme provides disincentives to parents sharing the care of their children for the following reasons: • It gives receiving parents an incentive to limit shared care to a level just below the threshold, which may not be in a child’s best interests. Receiving parents would in many cases receive materially less child support if a paying parent qualifies for a shared care adjustment. • It does not recognise the significant costs some parents incur while trying to retain a significant role in their children’s upbringing, because those costs are not recognised under the standard child support formula. This may affect the paying parent’s willingness or ability to meet their child support obligations or to maintain any significant level of care. 4.10 Two further possible criticisms of the current approach to shared care are: • Its administrative complexity. Establishing shared care in many cases involves asking each parent to complete questionnaires for consideration by Inland Revenue. Decisions, objections and appeals relating to shared care are time-consuming for parents, especially when attempting to reconcile conflicting information. 30 • It differs from how shared care is defined in other areas of the law. To qualify for Working for Families Tax Credits, a parent must have a child in their care for at least one-third of the year. 28 For entitlements to certain benefits, a parent must show that they have primary responsibility for the care of a dependent child for at least 40 percent of the time. This difference in definitions can lead to confusion. 4.11 As observed in chapter 3, when both parents have regular care of their children, costs for the paying parent increase with an associated, but disproportionately lower, reduction in the receiving parent’s costs. This is because of a loss of the economies of scale that exist in two-parent families, and in many cases when care is shared, neither parent is able to maintain their former standard of living. 4.12 The key question to be addressed is whether the costs incurred by both parents can be borne in a more equitable way. Suggested approach 4.13 Any new approach to shared care should be evaluated by reference to the following criteria: • that any change should be supportive and not act as a barrier towards parents sharing the care of their children; • any change should not exacerbate conflict between parents; • consideration must be given to the level of regular and shared care that starts to give rise to dual costs; • how the extra costs are borne by each parent; • the degree of complexity that the scheme should reasonably bear; • the financial impact of any change, as it affects children, paying parents, receiving parents and, when the child support offsets benefit payments, the Government; • the degree to which the approach encourages paying parents to comply; and • the costs involved in implementing the approach. 4.14 The Government is concerned that any reform to the child support rules which results in the paying parent’s child support payments being decreased will, in some cases, amount to a decrease for receiving parents – even though the costs in the receiving parent’s household may not have reduced by an equivalent amount. 29 Any change to the rules must, therefore, take account of this concern by providing the best possible reflection of the costs incurred by both parties when care is shared to a significant degree. Ultimately, this is not purely a mechanical exercise and a degree of judgement and compromise is required. 28 Note that this is not a test based on care for a number of nights, but instead a test based on care for 122 days a year. 29 This is not an issue for parents who are receiving a sole-parent benefit as the child support payments are not passed on to them. 31 Options for changing the threshold 4.15 In considering how the threshold might be changed, two options have been considered. Option one – reducing the shared care threshold 4.16 Retaining a single, but lower, shared care threshold would maintain the simplicity of the current shared care rules. A lower threshold would allow more paying parents to benefit from the shared care rules, and better recognise their contributions towards raising their children. 4.17 Possible options for a revised single threshold are: • a one-third test; and • an even lower shared care threshold (possibly as low as 14 percent of nights). 4.18 The advantages of a one-third test are: • more paying parents would be able to benefit from the shared care rules; • the paying parents that would benefit from the change would likely be those who are incurring the highest additional costs; • there would be no added complexity for parents; and • it would not involve significant administrative costs for the Government. 4.19 The disadvantages of a one-third test are: • the threshold would still be set at a relatively arbitrary level, and would not reflect overseas research that actual additional costs for paying parents arise at much lower levels of regular and shared care; • the cliff effect described in chapter 2 would remain; and • a relatively small number of paying parents would benefit from the changes. 4.20 A substantially lower threshold would retain the advantages of a one-third test and would have the key additional advantages of better reflecting additional costs, reducing the impact of the cliff effect and allowing a greater number of paying parents to benefit from the shared care rules. 32 4.21 On the other hand, a lower threshold may provide too great an adjustment. As already noted, although paying parents’ costs rise at relatively low levels of care, receiving parents’ costs do not tend to decrease noticeably at those levels. If all paying parents above the substantially lower threshold received the same proportionate adjustment in recognition of regular or shared care, it is likely that receiving parents who care for their children for at least 80 percent of the nights would bear too high a proportion of total costs. This would have a negative impact on their ability to care for their children. Accordingly, the threshold ideally needs to alter with the degree of shared care. This leads to option two. Option two – introducing a tiered set of thresholds 4.22 The Australian reforms have resulted in a tiered cost recognition of regular and shared care, as shown in Table 7. Table 7 Number of nights of care annually Percentage of annual care Proportion of net expenditure for child considered incurred 0 to 51 0 to less than 14% Nil 52 to 126 14% to less than 35% 24% 127 to 175 35% to less than 48% 25% plus 0.5% for each night over 127 nights 176 to 182 48% to 50% 50% 4.23 Likewise, the United Kingdom’s shared care recognition is calculated as shown in Table 8. Table 8 Number of nights of care annually Percentage of annual care Proportion of net expenditure for child considered incurred 0 to 51 0 to less than 14% Nil 52 to 103 14% to less than 28% 1/7 (14.3%) 104 to 155 28% to less than 42% 2/7 (28.6%) 156 to 174 42% to less than 48% 3/7 (42.9%) 175 or more 48% or more 50% 4.24 Under a tiered approach, paying parents would have the care they provide acknowledged at a given rate, with higher levels of care reflected in a corresponding increase in the child support liability adjustment, in recognition of the additional costs incurred. 33 4.25 The advantage of a tiered approach is that once regular or shared care is confirmed, subsequent small increases in levels of care would not give rise to major changes in child support for either parent – that is, there would be less of a cliff effect, and instead there would be a series of smaller incremental adjustments. 4.26 While this approach is more complex and would involve greater administrative changes (in particular, changes to Inland Revenue’s computer systems), it is likely to more accurately reflect parents’ relative costs. It would also provide consistent outcomes in similar situations while maintaining certainty for both parents about the financial implications of different care arrangements. 4.27 There is a question about whether it is appropriate to have a sizable reduction in child support liability for a relatively small amount of care. The Australian approach does this to reflect the apparent substantial set-up costs of providing care that can arise even for one night a week. The United Kingdom approach, on the other hand, assumes that care costs increase more gradually as the level of care increases. 4.28 If the tiered approach is adopted for New Zealand, it could be a compromise between these two approaches, for example, as set out in Table 9: Table 9 Number of nights of care annually Proportion of net expenditure for child considered incurred 0 to 51 Nil 52 to 103 14% 104 to 174 14% plus 0.5% for each night over 103 175 or more 50% 4.29 Submissions are invited on this approach. 4.30 It would be possible to commence the tiers from 33% – for example, if a higher minimum threshold for recognising shared care was considered more appropriate. Additional costs arising from shared care 4.31 The analysis of the expenditure for raising children has been based on the costs for a two-parent family. A question is whether those costs be adjusted when parents are living apart and each has regular care of their children. 34 4.32 There is little direct analysis of the costs of care and how the expenditure for raising children is shared between separated parents in New Zealand. The Families Commission’s survey results, however, indicated that parents are incurring increased costs because of regular care, with approximately 50 percent of the paying parents who responded saying that they incurred additional expenses in the past year (see appendix 4). It is also reasonable to assume that the increased costs of care and how they are distributed between the two parents would be broadly similar to the findings of the Henman study for Australia (see chapter 3). 4.33 There are two possible options for handling these costs. No direct adjustment for additional costs 4.34 The first approach would be to establish the expenditure for a child for a two- parent family and apportion this cost in a way that reflects the relative costs already incurred by each parent in caring for the child. Although the expenditure for the child would be understated under this approach because it would not take into account the additional costs of shared care, both parents would bear this shortfall broadly in proportion to the level of care they provide. Given that parents’ contributions are also influenced by their relative incomes, Australia has adopted this approach, in conjunction with sharing costs in accordance with each parent’s share of total income (see chapter 5). Adjustment for additional costs 4.35 Another option involves incorporating an inflated expenditure for raising children figure into the child support formula to reflect the additional costs generated by care being shared. This cost could then be distributed between the parents. This approach has the advantage that the additional costs would be specifically identified and recognised. 4.36 This approach would arguably generate more accurate results but would likely result in a more complex formula since it would have to incorporate different expenditures for raising children depending on parents’ income levels and the level of care being provided by the parents. If the formula calculations were to be automated, this may be less problematic. 4.37 Of more importance would be the need to ensure that the cost uplift did not create a cliff effect between a shared care situation and one involving no regular care. Such an effect could deter regular care of the child or children concerned. Avoiding this effect, however, could be problematic. An additional arbitrary percentage of, say, 50 percent, would clearly create a cliff effect which would arise even using the graduated percentages implied by the Henman study which shows in Australia that aggregate costs rise by between 37 percent and 75 percent depending on the scenario. 35 Other issues affecting shared care Use of number of nights as a test 4.38 Shared care for child support purposes is determined by the number of nights of care a parent provides. For other purposes it is based on days or time in general. The “nights” test is used for child support to provide a clear-cut guideline which minimises confusion for parents and lessens administrative uncertainty. It is easily measured and understood and is, on balance, considered the best indicator of parental involvement and additional costs for the purposes of the child support scheme. This view is based on the likelihood that when a child spends a night with a parent, the parent will usually provide a bedroom, dinner, breakfast and transport. 4.39 Accordingly, it would seem appropriate to retain the nights test for child support purposes. The administrative review process would still be available to provide departures from the test on a case-by-case basis when justified. Costs of day-time contact 4.40 Some parents may not have their children stay overnight but nevertheless may have extensive daytime contact. The costs involved with daytime care are likely to vary with the age of the child, with the costs being higher for older children. The Australian Taskforce acknowledged that parents in these circumstances should qualify for an adjustment if they can establish that they incur costs at least equivalent in aggregate to those taken into account in applying the nights-based test. 4.41 The Australian Child Support Registrar has the discretion, in the absence of agreement between the parents, to determine whether the level of daytime contact is sufficient to justify an adjustment. In the absence of additional housing costs, the expectation is that daytime contact would need to be substantially in excess of 14 percent of days to qualify. 4.42 Feedback is invited on whether the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have a comparable discretion to adjust child support contributions if a parent can show that the costs he or she incurs through daytime contact are sufficiently substantial. This would be a simpler, more straightforward process than having the matter treated as grounds for an administrative review. Reliance on parenting orders and agreements 4.43 A minor amendment is also suggested that would allow Inland Revenue to rely on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s share of care for child support purposes. 36 4.44 Allowing Inland Revenue in the first instance to rely on the terms of parenting orders and agreements would result in more efficient processing of regular and shared care applications. It would also reinforce what the courts have determined to be in the best interests of the children. 4.45 Currently, decisions and objections relating to shared care are time-consuming for those affected and often involve reconciliations by Inland Revenue of conflicting information. Greater consistency in processing regular and shared care arrangements could be achieved if the terms set out in a parenting order could be relied on by Inland Revenue as an acceptable form of verification. 4.46 This initiative would extend to parenting agreements which, while not enforceable by the courts, nonetheless convey the intentions and expectations of both parents. 4.47 If Inland Revenue were able to rely more on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s share of care for child support purposes, a new administrative review ground would be needed to enable a parent to challenge this presumption. The onus of proving that the order or agreement was not being adhered to would rest with the parent making the challenge. 37 CHAPTER 5 Taking both parents’ income into account This chapter discusses the merits of taking both parents’ income into account for the purposes of determining child support payments, and of providing each parent with a set living allowance as a deduction from their income. Submissions are invited on these points as well as on whether, in the absence of a recognised shared care arrangement, there should continue to be a minimum child support payment. 5.1 Taking into account the income of both parents in determining levels of child support payments may better reflect the realities of modern-day parenting and parents’ relative abilities to contribute towards the expenditure for raising their children. This is consistent with providing a better recognition of shared care and applying corresponding costs as discussed earlier. Background 5.2 The standard child support formula takes into account the income of the paying parent only. Social and demographic changes in society since the introduction of the scheme mean, however, that it is more likely that a receiving parent is now also participating in the workforce. 5.3 Labour-force participation rates for women were at a record high of 62.5 percent in the year ending March 2009 compared with 54.3 percent for the same period in 1992. 30 Over the same period there was little change in the male labour-force participation rate. Women were more likely to be working part-time, with female workforce participation tending to increase as children grow older. It is therefore clear that an increasing majority of parents now depend on two incomes to support their children. 5.4 The percentage of sole mothers participating in paid employment has correspondingly increased since 1992, as shown in Figure 5. 31 30 Statistics New Zealand – Household Labour Force Survey 31 Ministry of Social Development, June 2007 – “The 2002 Domestic Purposes and Widows’ Benefit Reform: Evaluation report”. 38 Figure 5: Percentage of sole mothers employed part- and full-time 1991–2006 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Sep-91Sep-92Sep-93Sep-94Sep-95Sep-96Sep-97Sep-98Sep-99Sep-00Sep-01Sep-02Sep-03Sep-04Sep-05Sep-06 Full-timePart-timeTotal Source: Statistics New Zealand: HLFS, customised tables, annual averages. 5.5 In view of the evidence, it seems reasonable to consider both parents’ financial capacities to support their children. This is consistent with trying to replicate, as far as possible, the financial arrangements that existed in providing for children before their parents began living apart (notwithstanding that separation may cause a decline in living standards). 5.6 Although both parents’ incomes can be taken into account under the current scheme where shared care exists by each parent cross-applying for child support, which involves the respective liabilities being offset to produce a net amount for one parent to pay, cross-application can be impractical for the parties involved and can also be administratively cumbersome. A more direct method may be needed. Income-shares approach 5.7 The essential feature of a child support scheme that directly reflects both parents’ incomes is that the expenditure for raising children are worked out based on the parents’ combined income, with those costs distributed between parents in accordance with their respective shares of that combined income and their level of care of the child. The Australian scheme discussed in earlier chapters adopts this “income-shares” approach as do a number of other jurisdictions, including Norway, Sweden and several U.S. states. 5.8 The Government seeks your feedback on whether this combined cost and income-shares approach should be adopted in New Zealand. 39 Advantages and disadvantages of an income-shares approach 5.9 The main advantages of an income-shares approach are: • It is more transparent. It provides an estimate of how much is being contributed by each parent towards the support of their child. • It better reflects parents’ relative abilities to financially contribute towards the expenditure for their children and parallels likely expenditure by those parents as if they were in a two-parent household where both parents have income. • It makes processes around changes of financial circumstances clearer and simpler. If there is a reduction in the income of either parent, this can be automatically reflected in the contribution calculation, potentially removing the need for an administrative review. 5.10 Possible disadvantages of the income-shares approach are: • If the receiving parent’s income varies significantly – for example, to accommodate the needs of children, there is potential to increase conflict between parents as the paying parent’s child support contribution would also vary. • Some receiving parents could be discouraged from participating in the workforce because a portion of every dollar they earned over the self- support amount would be “lost” through a decrease in the child support they received. On the other hand, there may be a greater incentive for paying parents to earn higher incomes if they were paying less in child support as a result of both incomes being taken into account. • The approach could make the level of payments less secure as a change in either parent’s income may well result in a change in child support payable or receivable. 5.11 These arguments, however, need to be balanced against the reality that changes in either parent’s work patterns do impact on their children and would do so if the parents were living together. Ideally, the formula should reflect this reality in which case the advantages of the income-shares approach would seem to outweigh the possible disadvantages. Changing the definition of “income” 5.12 Ideally how “income” is defined for child support purposes should align with how it is defined for tax credit purposes; that is, it should generally continue to be taxable income. Budget 2010 made an important change to the way that income is defined for tax credit purposes. From 1 April 2011, investment losses, including losses from rental properties, will be added back so that these losses cannot be used to reduce income when assessing eligibility for Working for Families Tax Credits. The Government is considering making a similar change for child support purposes on the basis that this would better reflect the real income that families would normally have available to them. 40 5.13 Budget 2010 also signalled that the Government would be introducing other measures in relation to Working for Families Tax Credits, including ensuring trust income is counted as part of a family’s total income. These changes could be considered in the child support context too. In the meantime, the use of trusts can currently be taken into account under the administrative review process, including Commissioner initiated reviews. 5.14 Also relevant to this consideration is that means-tested benefits, such as the domestic purposes benefit and the unemployment benefit, are taxable income 32 but child support receipts and tax credits, such as the family tax credit, are not. Living allowance 5.15 New Zealand currently deducts from a paying parent’s income an amount considered necessary to cover the parent’s living expenses. Australia has a similar adjustment with two key differences. 5.16 The first difference is that in Australia there is just one living allowance amount, set at one-third of the average earnings for a male employee. It does not vary even if, for example, there are children from another relationship. Children from a current relationship are instead factored into the calculations in a similar manner to children who receive child support by applying the cost percentage for the relevant child support income band. This amount is then deducted from the relevant parent’s income for child support purposes. 5.17 The second difference is that both parents qualify for the living allowance adjustment given that their combined incomes are used as the basis for calculating contributions. 5.18 The Government is considering this approach for New Zealand. Given that annual average earnings are $48,162 in New Zealand, one-third of this would mean a living allowance of $16,054, which is above the current living allowance for a single parent with no dependents ($14,158). Under this approach, both parents’ taxable incomes would be reduced by this amount. An example of what this would mean for parents with dependent children is provided in the next chapter. Minimum payment 5.19 The living allowance is of relatively more benefit to low-income earners. This means that in some cases parents with low incomes pay very little towards the expenditure for their children – perhaps less than if they were in a two-parent family situation. 32 The amount that beneficiaries receive is net of tax. 41 5.20 In developing the suggestions in this discussion document, consideration was given to whether the minimum payment should be set closer to the basic expenditure for raising a child, which would result in an amount of between $2,000 and $3,000. However, as shown in Figure 4 in chapter 3, for low- income earners the tax benefits foregone when they have little care of their children would essentially match this amount. A low minimum payment (currently $815) would still seem to be justified. 5.21 If lower levels of regular shared care were recognised, this minimum payment could be waived on the basis that the costs incurred from regular care would be at least equivalent to the minimum payment. 42 CHAPTER 6 A revised formula for improving the child support scheme This chapter brings together the key elements of the previous chapters to discuss how a revised child support formula might work, including how the formula would account for other dependent children. It also includes examples of how the amounts of child support payable might compare under that formula and the existing formula. Submissions are invited on: • whether all of the factors mentioned in this discussion (the expenditure for raising children, shared care and taking both parents’ income into account) should be included in a revised child support formula; and • if all elements of the formula were not included, which one idea should be given priority. 6.1 Chapters 3, 4 and 5 outlined how the child support formula could be updated to better reflect a greater variety of circumstances and the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. This chapter brings these various strands together. Before doing so, it considers some remaining issues: whether contributions should just cover basic costs or rise with income, whether there should be an income cap and whether the formula should reflect any differences in costs for raising children at different ages. Should contributions just cover basic costs or rise with income? 6.2 Costs and the associated child support contributions need not be expressed as a percentage of income. The alternative approach would be to have a flat child- support payment to reflect the basic expenditure for raising a child. 6.3 There are arguments for and against this approach. Having a flat amount would simplify the administration of child support, including the administrative review process, as there would be fewer grounds for variation. Given the discussion thus far, the payment would, however, need to be adjusted to reflect how care of the children was shared between parents. The payment may also need to be apportioned between the two parents based on their share of total income. 6.4 A flat amount could result in higher child support payments for those on lower incomes, possibly more than they would pay in a two-parent family situation after allowing for tax benefits. Conversely, those on higher incomes would pay appreciably less, but could voluntarily pay more than the basic amount if they wished. 43 6.5 A flat amount may be appropriate when the child support recipient also received a sole parent benefit. This is because the benefit amount is fixed and there is generally no pass-on of the child support payments to the beneficiary. 33 6.6 In other cases, the state’s role is to facilitate calculation of a child support amount and ensure that it is received by the other parent for the benefit of the child. In these cases a flat amount is not appropriate as children have a right to expect the amount to better reflect the income of their parents, as it would in the two-parent family. 6.7 A further reason for not having a flat payment is the research finding for New Zealand and elsewhere that expenditures on children increase, although at a declining rate, with income. 34 Higher income households generally have higher living standards and, all other things being equal, children tend to share in those living standards. 35 Consequently, other countries relate their child support payments to parental income and express the expenditure for raising children as a percentage of income. 6.8 Also, to the extent that children’s expectations about living standards are not fulfilled because only a flat amount of child support is paid, relief may be sought for additional payments through the administrative review process or the courts. This would increase the overall costs to parents and put more pressure on both the administrative review process and the court system. 6.9 Financially, a flat amount is unlikely to be an adequate benchmark for separated parents who might otherwise avoid the court process by using the formula as a starting point for reaching a voluntary agreement on their child support arrangements. 6.10 For the reasons discussed above, the expenditure for raising children should continue to be expressed as a percentage of income in New Zealand too. Should there still be an income cap? 6.11 Australia recognises that, as household income levels rise far above the community average, it becomes increasingly difficult to measure further increases in expenditure on children. Spending becomes increasingly discretionary, so that costs tend to gradually flatten out. 36 Accordingly, an income cap for the purposes of calculating the payment was considered appropriate for Australia, at 2.5 times the total average earnings for a male. This equates currently to a child support income cap of A$147,135. As child support income is net of both parents’ living allowances, this means that in terms of taxable income the cap is equivalent to over A$180,000. 33 Pass-on is discussed in chapter 9. 34 One Australian study suggests that a reason why higher income Australian families spend a lower proportion of their gross income on children is because they pay more tax than lower income families. Consequently, spending on children as a percentage of after-tax income would likely be much closer across the income scale. See AMP.NATSEM Income and Wealth Report Issue 18, December 2007 by Richard Percival, Alicia. 35 These studies tend to be based on two-parent family situations. Consequently, when parents live apart and care of the child is shared there is generally less income available to spend on the children relative to the two-parent situation. This makes the continuity of expenditure principle harder to achieve in practice unless parental income is high. 36 Data from the Families Commission’s survey also showed an appreciable fall-off in the percentage of income put towards child support payments as higher income rises, although the sample size was small. 44 6.12 For the same reasons, an income cap seems appropriate for New Zealand. It is recognised that it is difficult to measure when expenditure might flatten out and that, although the cap would need to be appreciably above the average income, how much above is likely to be somewhat arbitrary. New Zealand currently has a cap which, like Australia’s, is 2.5 times the average income but it includes only the paying parent’s income and there is no adjustment for the New Zealand living allowance. 6.13 If both parents’ incomes were to be included in the child support liability calculation (see chapter 5), it would seem appropriate that the cap be raised to the same level as Australia’s – that is, effectively 3.17 times the total average earnings before deducting the two parents’ living allowances. 37 6.14 A high-income paying parent who is a sole income earner could be disadvantaged by this change. However, there may be offsetting benefits from a child support percentage structure that progressively declines with each higher income bracket and that provides greater recognition of lower levels of regular and shared care. Should the child’s age be taken into consideration? 6.15 Given the findings from the study of the expenditure for raising children that costs increase significantly for older children, the question arises whether payments should increase after the child reaches 12 years of age. Both Australian studies found that older children are more costly, even after factoring in additional childcare costs for younger children. 6.16 Taking age into consideration would further complicate the formula. Australia nevertheless decided that this complication was necessary given the extent of the variation in age groups. 6.17 A contribution calculation that did not take into account a child’s age could lead to material over- or under-payments, depending on how old the child was when child support was first paid and how long the child was in the scheme. 6.18 Accordingly, if the formula is to be amended to reflect the expenditure for raising children as suggested below, it is recommended that age should be taken into consideration, as in Australia, by having values based on two age categories: 0-12 years and over 12 years. A possible revised formula – option 1 – comprehensive change 6.19 Having considered all of the relevant variables, the rest of this chapter brings these together in a revised formula. Under this formula, the three key initiatives would be: 37 This equates to 2.5 times the total average earnings for a male: 3.17 – 2(0.333) = 2.5, with the living allowance being a third (0.33) of the male total average earnings. 45 • To deal with concerns about insufficient recognition of regular and shared care of children, the formula would incorporate lower levels of shared care. For the purposes of this chapter, this would be by way of tiered thresholds (see chapter 4). This would mean that the minimum regular care recognised would be 14 percent of nights (or its equivalent). Regular care of at least this level would remove the minimum annual child support contribution. • To deal with concerns about the capacity to pay, both parents’ incomes would be included in the formula, with payments being apportioned according to each parent’s share of total income. For each parent, “income” would generally be defined as taxable income for Working for Families Tax Credit purposes, less a fixed living allowance set at one- third of the average earnings. If there were also dependent children, a parent’s income would be further reduced for the assumed expenditure for those children, before calculating their child support contribution. • To deal with concerns about payments not being in line with the expenditure for raising children, the formula would use a new scale of income percentages that reflected up-to-date information on the net (of average tax benefits) expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. These percentages would vary with: – the number of children; – the age of the children (the percentage would be higher for children over 12 years); and – the combined income of the parents. Given the conclusion reached in chapter 3 that the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand is broadly in line with the findings in Australia, the new scale should broadly adopt the income percentages used in the new Australian scale, with the income levels reflecting average earning levels in New Zealand. The Australian table of costs for raising children incorporates six marginal child support income bands and the cost associated with each band progressively declines to reflect that expenditures on children as a proportion of income decline as income rises. Table 10 sets out how a similar table would look for New Zealand in these circumstances. 46 Table 10: Expenditure for raising children matrix Parents’ combined child support income (income above the living allowance amounts) 1 Number of children $0 – $24,081 2 $24,082 – $48,162 3 $48,163 – $72,243 4 $72,244 – $96,324 5 $96,325 – $120,405 6 Over $120,405 6 Expenditure for raising children (to be apportioned between the parents) Children aged 0–12 years 1 child 17c for each $1 $4,094 plus 15c for each $1 over $24,081 $7,706 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $10,596 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $13,004 plus 7c for each $1 over $96,324 $14,689 2 children 24c for each $1 $5,779 plus 23c for each $1 over $24,081 $11,318 plus 20c for each $1 over $48,162 $16,134 plus 18c for each $1 over $72,243 $20,469 plus 10c for each $1 over $96,324 $22,877 3+ children 27c for each $1 $6,502 plus 26c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,763 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $18,783 plus 24c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 18c for each $1 over $96,324 $28,897 Children aged 13+ years 1 child 23c for each $1 $5,539 plus 22c for each $1 over $24,081 $10,836 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $13,726 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $16,134 plus 9c for each $1 over $96,324 $18,302 2 children 29c for each $1 $6,983 plus 28c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,726 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $19,746 plus 20c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 13c for each $1 over $96,324 $27,693 3+ children 32c for each $1 $7,706 plus 31c for each $1 over $24,081 $15,171 plus 30c for each $1 over $48,162 $22,395 plus 29c for each $1 over $72,243 $29,379 plus 20c for each $1 over $96,324 $34,195 Children of mixed age\* 2 children 26.5c for each $1 $6,381 plus 25.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,522 plus 22.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $17,940 plus 19c for each $1 over $72,243 $22,515 plus 11.5c for each $1 over $96,324 $25,285 3+ children 29.5c for each $1 $7,104 plus 28.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,967 plus 27.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $20,589 plus 26.5c for each $1 over $72,243 $26,971 plus 19c for each $1 over $96,324 $31,546 1 Calculated by adding the two parents’ child support incomes, that is, adding each parent’s adjusted taxable income minus their living allowance of $16,054 (1/3 of Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)). 2 .5 of AWE. 3 AWE. 4 1.5 times AWE. 5 2 times AWE. 6 2.5 times AWE. Expenditure for raising children does not increase above this cap. Note that this equates to a cap at a combined adjusted taxable income of $152,514. \* The rates are the average of the two previous age categories. 47 How this approach would work in practice 6.20 Under this new formula each parent would be allocated a standard living allowance which would be deducted from his or her respective taxable income. 38 The two net amounts would be summed up and expressed as a percentage of the total. These proportions would then be applied to the expenditure for raising children amount relevant for that child so the expenditure for raising the child or children is split between the two parents based on their relative net incomes. 6.21 Each parent’s percentage of shared care would then be deducted from the result to produce a net liability for one of the parents. This would be the parent whose shared-care percentage is less than his or her share of total net income. 6.22 These steps are illustrated in the following example. Example 1: How the formula would take into account income and shared care Situation A Parents Kenny and Clara, who are living apart, have two children, aged 15 and 10. Kenny’s taxable income is $50,000 while Clara’s is $15,000. Kenny and Clara would each be entitled to a fixed living allowance of $16,054 reducing their respective incomes to $33,946 and $0, a combined child support income of $33,946. Kenny’s proportion of child support income would therefore be 100 percent while Clara’s would be 0 percent. Clara is the sole caregiver so there is no shared care adjustment. In accordance with Table 10, the relevant expenditure for the two children of mixed ages is $8,897. Clara has no liability and Kenny must pay $8,897 to help support the children. Situation B Kenny’s taxable income is $50,000 while Clara’s is now $25,000. Kenny and Clara would again each be allowed a fixed living allowance of $16,054 reducing their respective incomes to $33,946 and $8,946, a combined child support income of $42,892. Kenny’s proportion of child support income would therefore be 79.14 percent while Clara’s would be 20.86 percent. Clara is still the sole caregiver so there is no shared care adjustment. In accordance with Table 10, the relevant expenditure for the two children of mixed ages is $11,178. Accordingly, Kenny must pay $8,847 to help support the children. 38 If the net amount was negative then it would be treated as zero. 48 Situation C This is the same as situation B except that Kenny now also shares some of the care, having the children every other weekend or one-seventh (14%) of nights. If the compromise table for shared care (noted in Table 9) was used, Kenny would be considered to incur 14 percent of the expenditure for raising the children. Kenny’s share of the $11,178 expenditure would be 79.14 percent less the amount (14 percent) he is assumed to have already paid out by caring for the children, a net amount of 65.14 percent, meaning that Kenny must pay $7,282 to help support the children. Clara would have no liability as her share of care (86 percent) would be more than her proportion of total child support income (20.86 percent). Alternatively, if shared care was based on a minimum 33 percent of nights, there would be no shared care adjustment and the outcome would be the same as under situation B. Comparison with current formula In all of situations A, B and C, under the existing formula Kenny would have to pay $8,602 (based on not living with a partner and no other dependent children living with Kenny). Treatment of other dependent children and new partners 6.23 Under this revised formula, adjustments would be made to take into account the expenditure for raising other dependent children. For this purpose, other dependent children would be treated the same way as children subject to child support. To recognise the care a parent provides for dependent children, an amount (in addition to the living allowance) would be deducted from the parent’s adjusted taxable income before applying the basic formula. 6.24 The parent’s care and cost percentages would be worked out for the relevant dependent child. For the purposes of calculating the expenditure for raising the child, the income of one parent only would be used. The expenditure for raising the child would be multiplied by the cost proportion. This would be the relevant dependent child amount, which would be deducted from the parent’s taxable income, along with the living allowance, to determine their child support income. The basic new formula would then be applied to work out the level of payments for the children receiving child support. 6.25 The income of a new partner would not be taken into account in these calculations. In some cases, the new partner in effect becomes a parent, while in others parenting may remain primarily with the separated parents. It is not possible to reflect this variance in a formula, particularly if the new partner also has personal child support liabilities. The administrative review process would, however, continue to be available to parents who consider that the other parent’s new partner’s circumstances should be taken into account. (com 49 Example 2: How the formula would take into account other dependent children Stella pays child support for her daughter Belle, 17. She has two dependent children in her new family, Mick, aged 13 and Ailsa, aged 8. Mick and Ailsa live with Stella. Stella’s income needs to be adjusted to reflect the two dependent children in her current relationship before calculating her contribution towards Belle’s child support. Stella’s taxable income of $50,000 is first reduced by the living allowance of $16,054, giving $33,946. Stella’s percentage of care for Mick and Ailsa is 100 percent. This means that her cost percentage for these two children is 100 percent – in other words, she is assumed to incur all of the costs associated with raising these children. The expenditure for the dependent children is worked out using Stella’s child support income only (see the mixed age category in Table 10). On an income of $33,946 the total expenditure for raising Mick and Ailsa is $8,897 with each child costing $4,449. Each child’s cost is multiplied by the parent’s cost percentage for the child – in this case 100%. Stella’s income of $50,000 is therefore reduced by both the living allowance of $16,054 and the $8,897 leaving an amount of $25,049 to be used as her child support income for the purposes of calculating her child support contribution for Belle. 6.26 Further examples are provided in appendix 5. Comparison of contributions under the old and new formulas When a parent is the sole income earner and does not share care 6.27 Figures 6 to 9 illustrate the impact of revised child support payments under a possible compromise formula as a percentage of different income levels. They do not factor in changes that could arise from including both parents’ incomes or from taking into account instances of regular parental care. They are for the very specific situation when the paying parent is the sole income earner, has no dependent children and does not share care with the receiving parent. The estimated costs are after adjusting for tax benefits. 6.28 The greatest difference is in relation to a single child up to 12 years of age. The current formula appears to result in over-payments whereas the suggested new formula is very close to the estimated net cost. In part this is the result of the current formula using the same child support percentage irrespective of income, whereas it is envisaged that the new formula would, as discussed earlier in this chapter, use a scale of declining rates to reflect the declining proportion of income spent on children as income rises. 50 6.29 Conversely, the payments under the current formula for a child aged 13 years or over tend to be less than the net cost. Again, the new formula is close to the net costs. Figures 6 to 9 illustrate the merits of distinguishing between the two age bands. 6.30 The differences between the two formulas are far less for two and three children. 6.31 In all four cases the payments diverge from the estimated net expenditure for raising children once the income cap applies. The income cap would cut in, however, at a higher level than under the current formula, reducing the range of divergence.

Effect of potential changes taking into account both parents’ incomes and shared care 6.32 Figure 10 factors in the suggested changes that would arise from including both parents’ incomes and recognising a wider range of regular parental care, as well as the estimated expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. In terms of shared care, two scenarios are shown. The first recognises shared care as low as 14 percent of nights (referred to earlier as the compromise example) and the second recognises shared care on the same tiered basis but only from when parental care is at least 33 percent. 52 6.33 A main finding shown in the charts in Figure 10 is that, for a large portion of both receiving and paying parents, the changes would not result in any change in the amounts parents received or paid. This reflects the fact that many parents will continue to either receive a sole-parent benefit (and therefore do not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. 6.34 In particular, it should be noted that, for many receiving parents, a reduction in the child support contribution from the paying parent will not result in any decrease in the amount of benefit that they receive. 6.35 Of those remaining parents whose child support will be affected, the change in child support receipts or payments for the majority is likely to be between plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). Figure 10 indicates that over 80 percent of current child support receipts and around 70 percent of payments would either be unaffected or affected to the extent of plus or minus $66 per month. 6.36 Parents who would qualify for any wider recognition of shared care would be most affected, with paying parents likely to pay less in such cases. Consequently, how and the extent to which regular care is recognised is important to the overall outcome. This is graphically illustrated in the differences between the outcomes of shared care commencing from 14 percent compared with commencing from 33 percent. Under a minimum of 33 percent care, there are just as many receiving parents who would receive more than would receive less, and the impact on paying parents is correspondingly less. 6.37 The recognition of both parents’ incomes would generally have less of a financial impact unless the receiving parent earns around $40,000 or more. 6.38 The above impacts may be reduced as in some cases changes in the amount of child support received or paid affects (in the opposite direction) the amount of Working for Families Tax Credits received. Alternative option – option 2 – component changes 6.39 An alternative option would be to incorporate just one or two of the key changes. The existing formula could be extended to include recognition of a wider range of regular care situations, just the up-to-date expenditure for raising children in New Zealand, just both parents’ incomes, or a combination of some of these. This approach would likely reduce the overall impact of any change. It would, however, be a less comprehensive and transparent solution. 6.40 Any change could have a material impact for a minority of parents. Nevertheless, the overall question to bear in mind is whether any particular change would achieve a fairer outcome that would encourage more parents to pay their outstanding child support liabilities voluntarily. 53 Figure 10: Estimated monthly change in child support receipts and payments Receiving parents 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 $201 or more $101 to $200 $67 to $100 $34 to $66 $1 to $33 $0 -$1 to -$33 -$34 to -$66 -$67 to - $100 -$101 to - $200 -$201 or more $ change per month Number of parents 14% shared care minimum33% shared care minimum Paying parents 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 $201 or more $101 to $200 $67 to $100 $34 to $66 $1 to $33 $0 -$1 to -$33 -$34 to -$66 -$67 to - $100 -$101 to - $200 -$201 or more $ change per month Number of parents 14% shared care minimum33% shared care minimum Notes: The estimates are based on current child support relationships – that is, where someone is currently paying child support. The number of receiving parents includes parents receiving the sole-parent domestic purpose benefit. For parents entitled to the domestic purpose benefit there is no impact unless payments currently exceed the benefit because the child support payments are not directly passed on and are instead retained by the Crown. They have, however, been included to show a complete picture. The number of paying parents exceeds the number of receiving parents because of children who are cared for by a third person. Taxable income information for the year ended March 2008 is used for both parents. No net amount is calculated for parents with multiple child support relationships and for parents who cross-apply for shared care arrangements. The receiving parent’s child support income is slightly overstated in some cases because information is not available on how many dependent children they might have. The age composition of the paying parent’s other dependent children is unknown and randomly assigned; it is unknown whether this results in an over- or under-estimation of the projected child support payments. 54 CHAPTER 7 Automatic deduction of child support payments from salary and wages To ensure payments are made as and when they fall due, this chapter suggests that child support payments be automatically deducted by employers from paying parents’ salary and wages. Submissions are invited on this idea. 7.1 With the Government’s commitment to streamlining the administration of the tax system, changes are planned for the administration of the student loan scheme, the Working for Families Tax Credit, the PAYE scheme, and the company tax return. As child support is one of the social policy schemes administered by Inland Revenue, there are obvious advantages in ensuring that child support administration evolves with changes to the administration of these other areas. 7.2 Changes to the administration of the tax system are focussed on: • Increased use of electronic technology. Most Inland Revenue processes are currently paper-based. Processes and systems for online delivery of relevant services and information will, however, become the norm, allowing greater levels of customer self-management. • A wider range of self-management options for customers who do not have access to the web, such as interactive voice response and text phone services. • Increased reliance on accurate PAYE deductions each pay period and less need for end-of-year square-ups. • Legislation being updated to reflect the use of new technologies and processes by Inland Revenue. 7.3 The proposed reforms are the first step in transforming Inland Revenue to help protect the integrity of the tax system and the social programmes it administers, reduce compliance costs and deliver better services to customers. 7.4 Any changes to Inland Revenue’s administrative functions are likely to have implications for the way that child support services are delivered – in particular, the making of payments and the approaches adopted when payments are not made. Allowing child support assessment periods to be spread more evenly across a year – an idea which could in future be considered – may also be consistent with future administrative reforms. 55 Payment deductions 7.5 Paying parents currently have a range of options for paying their monthly child support liability. Payment methods include cheque, credit card, automatic payment or by cash. Employees, however, generally cannot choose to have direct deductions made by their employer from their pay. Deductions from pay only currently occur when parents default on their payments. 7.6 The absence of direct deductions may increase the risk of non-payment of child support which, in turn, adversely affects the wellbeing of the children involved. It can also unnecessarily inconvenience paying parents, especially those who are paid weekly or fortnightly. If they wish to make child support payments to match their pay cycle, they need to calculate the amount to be paid and set up a separate automatic payment arrangement with a bank to ensure their liability is met on their payday. 7.7 To address these problems, it is suggested that deductions from pay by employers be made compulsory for paying parents who receive regular employment income. This would be similar to the process currently applicable to KiwiSaver contributions. Paying parents would have their payments automatically co-ordinated with their pay periods, whether those periods were weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 7.8 It is recognised that some paying parents may have concerns about their employers knowing that they are making child support contributions. However, arguably the public interest in operating an effective child support scheme should outweigh these individual concerns. 7.9 There may be some, albeit marginal, increased compliance costs for employers from having to make deductions and record and pay the monies to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. The increase in the number of deductions would, however, be very small relative to the volumes already being processed at the same time to account for PAYE, ACC and KiwiSaver contributions. 7.10 Additional compliance costs to employers should be mitigated if this change were incorporated as part of proposed changes to the PAYE scheme – in particular, in improving the design and functionality of the employer monthly schedule. 7.11 This suggested change would complement the legislation enacted in 2006 allowing Inland Revenue to review a child support assessment if an investigation into a paying parent’s financial affairs shows the assessment does not reflect the parent’s ability to provide financial support to the children involved. This is a very useful tool that enables Inland Revenue to counter the parent’s use of vehicles such as trusts to shelter income for child support purposes. 56 CHAPTER 8 Child support payment, penalties and debt This chapter discusses the child support penalty rules, and suggests possible changes that may assist with the prompt payment of child support and increased compliance by paying parents. It also considers the question of how the Government can deal with existing accumulated penalty debt. It specifically seeks submissions on which of the following ideas should be considered further: • reducing incremental penalty rates and improving enforcement; • capping penalties; • closer alignment with late payment penalties and use-of-money interest used for tax purposes; • penalty write-off grounds; • writing-off assessed child support debt; and • passing on penalties to the receiving parent. 8.1 The child support scheme as a whole needs to be perceived as fair. Paying parents are more likely to pay child support if the way it is calculated is transparent and takes account of the right variables. The options described elsewhere in this discussion document are intended to address many of the concerns about fairness that paying parents have with the current scheme. 8.2 There is currently a very high level of accumulated debt relating to child support penalties, much of which has been in place for a long time. Ways of dealing with this debt need to be considered to ensure that payments are made for the care of the children or to offset the cost to the Government of providing benefits to receiving parents. 8.3 This chapter discusses child support penalties and looks at a range of options for change in this area to stop child support debt being created in the first place or, where it does exist, to reduce it as soon as possible. 8.4 Improved administrative practices, in addition to the proposed automatic deduction of child support payments from salary and wages discussed in chapter 7, would be a significant step towards better addressing concerns of receiving parents and stopping child support debt being created. 8.5 In addition to any legislative measures, both parents need to have ready access to succinct and accurate information on child support and the consequences of non-payment so that ignorance of the law is not a barrier to compliance. 57 Child support debt 8.6 On balance, the New Zealand child support scheme has been very successful in collecting assessed child support debt. Since the scheme’s introduction in 1992, Inland Revenue has collected 89 percent of all the child support payments assessed by Inland Revenue. This rate compares very favourably internationally. 8.7 Despite the fact that the vast majority of payments are collected, the aggregate child support debt (assessed child support debt plus associated penalties) has continued to accumulate. 8.8 In addition to child support debt owed by parents living in New Zealand, a significant amount of debt is also owed from parents living overseas. Most of this overseas debt is in respect of paying parents living in Australia, but amounts are also due by parents living in other countries. New Zealand currently has a reciprocal agreement with Australia that allows Inland Revenue to pass child support cases to the Australian Child Support Agency for enforcement (and vice versa). Although it is more difficult for Inland Revenue to recover debt from other countries, child support debt collection in such circumstances may improve if the Hague Convention for the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (in which New Zealand is a signatory) comes into force. 8.9 As at 30 June 2010, total child support debt stood at $1.944 billion. Over 70 percent of this aggregate debt (or nearly $1.368 billion) now consists of accumulated child support penalties. 8.10 Table 11 highlights how the age profile of debt has changed over time. Debt that is over 10 years old continues to increase as a proportion of total debt – it now represents approximately 35 percent of all debt. Table 11 58 8.11 Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations. They also help to fund the Government’s costs of collecting this debt. If penalties are excessive, however, they can perversely discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. Striking a balance between these conflicting issues is essential. Current penalties rules 8.12 Currently, paying parents who fail to pay in full and on time incur an initial penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. A further penalty of two percent of the unpaid amount (including the 10 percent penalty) is imposed on a compounding basis for each month that the amount remains outstanding. These penalties are retained by the Government and are not passed on to a receiving parent. 8.13 Since the introduction of the Child Support Scheme, various legislative changes have been made to encourage parents to pay more promptly and reduce debt levels, the most recent being in 2006. This 2006 change allowed Inland Revenue to remit the two percent incremental penalty when an instalment arrangement is entered into and payments under the arrangement are maintained. 8.14 Several concerns have been identified with the current penalty system, including: • the size and nature of the penalties, in particular the two percent incremental penalty; • the relatively limited circumstances in which the two percent incremental penalty can be written off; • the restrictions on writing off assessed debt; and • whether penalty amounts paid should be passed on to the receiving parent. Alternative options for imposing penalties 8.15 The cumulative nature of the two percent monthly penalty means that penalty amounts can grow rapidly. These penalties continue to become an increasingly large proportion of the total outstanding child support debt. 8.16 At some point parents who would otherwise be willing to pay off their assessed child support liability may be reluctant to approach Inland Revenue because of the magnitude of the penalty sums involved, particularly if they are not aware they could qualify for some form of penalty remission. In other words, high levels of penalty debt could be acting as a disincentive to re-engage with the child support scheme and start or resume payment of child support liabilities. 59 8.17 Submissions are therefore sought on whether any of the following options outlined in this chapter should be introduced. The basis for any change should be that it would provide a better incentive for paying parents to comply with their child support obligations and make payment as soon as possible. Reduce current incremental penalty rate 8.18 One option would be to keep the current structure of the existing penalty system in place, but to reduce the two percent incremental penalty. 8.19 Such a reduction could be introduced after a set period of non-compliance by the paying parent – for example, after non-compliance of one year. To counter perceptions that this could be a reward for non-compliance, it could be introduced at the same time as additional and more focussed enforcement measures, as discussed below. This would ensure that there were more effective sanctions in place for those that continue to avoid payment. 8.20 Reducing the two percent incremental penalty would help to prevent penalty debt from escalating at the current rapid rate. It would slow down the rate at which debt increases, helping to avoid debt from reaching levels where parents feel they are simply not able to be repaid (and which may be viewed as disproportionate to the original debt). 8.21 The effect that such a change may have can be seen from the example of a paying parent who has not paid a child support assessment of $3,227 39 for five years. Under the current rules, the amount owing after five years, including core assessment and penalties (initial and incremental two percent amounts), would be in excess of $11,500. Changing the incremental penalties to 1 percent after one year would have the effect of reducing this outstanding debt to approximately $7,250. 8.22 This could be seen as a fairer outcome that might reduce the disincentive for paying parents to start making their child support repayments. Importantly, this reduction would not make any difference to the receiving parent other than in the sense of improving the possibility of payment. 8.23 However, if such a change were made to penalty rates, the Government would need to ensure that other offsetting enforcement measures were adopted. Additional measures could potentially include: • The paying parent being subject to a more focussed and specific compliance effort from Inland Revenue (that is, being subject to more intensive case management). • Further use of the automatic deduction of refunds due to paying parents from other Inland Revenue sources in order to offset any child support debts due (for example, in respect of unconfirmed personal tax summaries). 39 This amount represents the average annual assessment for a paying period for one year only. In reality, many paying parents who are in debt are likely to be liable for more than one year. 60 • The use, in extreme circumstances, of departure prohibition orders whereby paying parents could be restricted from travelling overseas until their child support liabilities are settled. Departure prohibition orders are used with some success in Australia. • “Naming and shaming” paying parents, while being mindful of privacy concerns and the need to ensure a person is not improperly named. Capping penalties 8.24 Another suggestion is to cap the amount of penalties that could apply to a parent’s child support debt. This would stop the debt accumulating and reduce the potential reluctance parents might have to contact Inland Revenue. 8.25 On the other hand, once this cap is reached there may be limited further incentive for paying parents to continue to pay their child support liability. If this option were to be considered, the Government would need to ensure that other enforcement measures were also adopted to increase the likelihood of payment (similar to those previously described in this chapter). This could also include an option to increase the initial 10 percent penalty at the same time. Aligning child support penalties to tax penalties and use-of-money interest 8.26 Another question worth considering is whether to better align child support penalties with the penalty and use-of-money interest rules that apply for tax purposes. Using tax-based late payment penalties and use-of-money interest rates would allow for better alignment with the treatment of tax debts and could provide administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue. 8.27 A tax-based penalties system is not fully relevant to the child support scheme, however. In addition to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest, tax penalties also contain shortfall penalties. These are determined in relation to benchmark standards of behaviour and care (for example taking an unacceptable tax position or being grossly careless) that are not usually relevant to the non-payment of child support. 8.28 In addition, use-of-money interest applied for tax purposes is not a penalty. Rather, it compensates the Government for receiving the tax revenue in a later period. Under the child support scheme, the Government is collecting child support from one parent on behalf of the other parent, and does not pass penalties on to the receiving parent. This is in contrast to the tax system, where the Government is the direct recipient of the money collected. Applying interest to a debt to which the Government is not directly entitled could be seen to be at odds with the purpose of use-of-money interest. 8.29 That said, some other jurisdictions (for example, Australia) do apply interest to late payments of child support and it would be possible to design a system so that child support penalties were linked to prevailing tax use-of-money interest rates (while also retaining a penal element). For example, the existing initial 10 percent non-payment penalty could be retained, but the incremental two percent monthly penalties could be replaced with a penalty equal to the tax use- of-money interest rate plus an additional penal rate (for example, an additional 1 percent per annum). 61 Penalties write-off grounds 8.30 As noted previously, the vast majority of existing child support debt relates to penalties. This is in part because payments made by paying parents will always first be set off against assessed child support debt, not penalties. 8.31 Although the primary objective of any changes to the penalty rules should be to progressively recover any existing core debt and establish the regular payment of child support liabilities, writing off penalties should also be considered if this facilitates regular payment or is justifiable on hardship grounds. 8.32 Currently, there is a range of grounds under which penalties can be written off by Inland Revenue. In some cases write-offs are mandatory while others are at the Commissioner’s discretion. Some write-off processes relate only to the 10 percent penalty, some only to the incremental penalties, and others cover both. 8.33 Despite the number of grounds that exist, the ability to write-off child support penalties is generally more restrictive than for the write-off of tax penalties because the Crown is holding the money for use towards the care of the child involved. Nevertheless, there seems to be some scope for improving the ability to write off penalties. In particular, although changes were made in 2006 that enabled the write-off of incremental penalties if an instalment arrangement had been entered into and adhered to for a minimum period of 26 weeks, the rules could be relaxed to allow a greater level of write-off. 8.34 Options that could be considered include: • relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written off when a paying parent agrees and adheres to an instalment arrangement for ongoing compliance; • allowing Inland Revenue a wider range of options to negotiate the write- off of penalties; • allowing Inland Revenue to automatically write-off low levels of penalty- only debt below a certain value; and • introducing a child support penalty debt amnesty whereby penalties are automatically written off if a paying parent pays all their existing assessed child support debt during a set time period. 8.35 Submissions are sought on whether any of these options, described in more detail below, should be considered further. The main basis for any change should be that it would increase the incentives for paying parents to start meeting their child support obligations in full. Where this is not relevant (for example, when only penalty debt remains as all assessed debt has already been recovered) any change should enable the Government to collect the largest amount possible given the circumstances and the need to balance the likelihood of fully recovering the debt with the administrative costs involved. 62 Relaxing circumstances when penalties can be written off for ongoing compliance 8.36 The current rules stipulate that for any incremental penalties to be written off, an instalment arrangement for the repayment of core assessment debt must be entered into and adhered to for a minimum of 26 weeks. Any failure to meet this agreement, however minor, means that the penalties cannot be written off. 8.37 The strict way in which the current rules operate for writing off incremental penalty debt can be an impediment to its effectiveness, sometimes with serious implications for the goodwill and willingness of paying parents to continue repaying their outstanding (and ongoing) child support debt. 8.38 Applying less stringent conditions in certain circumstances, such as by continuing to allow a penalty-write off when the vast majority of agreed repayments have been made, and there are clearly justifiable circumstances why other payments have not been made, could have merit. Negotiated write-off of penalties 8.39 Greater ability to negotiate with paying parents on an individual basis, even if some assessed debt remains, would allow Inland Revenue a wider range of options for the write-off of penalty debt. Inland Revenue would be able to balance a range of considerations in attempting to collect the highest amount of assessed child support and penalties over time. For example, it would take into account the integrity of the child support scheme, the promotion of voluntary compliance and the administrative costs involved. 8.40 The objective of any negotiated write-off would be to achieve the maximum possible recovery, taking into account the effect on the paying parent, the efficient use of resources, fairness to other compliant parents and parents who have already paid their penalties in full. 8.41 As currently exists for penalty-only debt (that is, when the assessed debt has been paid), such a write-off could be used if the paying parent would be placed in significant hardship or if it would be a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the debt because the chances of collection are very low. 8.42 To ensure transparency and consistency, such a provision would be supported by published administrative guidelines or criteria. Allowing Inland Revenue to automatically write-off low levels of penalty-only debt 8.43 Another option could be to allow Inland Revenue to automatically write-off certain low levels of penalty-only debt (when the assessed child support has been paid, and only penalty debt remains). 8.44 The discretion would allow Inland Revenue, once all assessed child support debt had been paid, to automatically write off all penalty-only debt below a certain value. This value would be determined by Inland Revenue, based on set published criteria or guidelines. 63 Child support penalty debt amnesty 8.45 A child support penalty debt amnesty could be introduced whereby if a paying parent paid all their existing assessed child support debt during a set period all associated penalties would be automatically written off. 8.46 Although an amnesty for existing child support debt would likely achieve a significant recovery of arrears in the short term, any gains would likely be short-lived. This is because an amnesty is not likely to change the long-term behaviour of errant paying parents. A greater concern is that compliant paying parents (and those that have already paid their penalties) would see persistent failure to comply by others being rewarded rather than punished. This could have an adverse effect on the future behaviour of compliant paying parents and create adverse perceptions about the fairness of the child support scheme more generally. Write-off of assessed child support debt 8.47 Inland Revenue cannot currently write off assessed debt because, in many cases, the debt is owed to the other parent for the care of the child. Receiving parents who are not on a benefit do, however, have the discretion to waive the assessed debt. 8.48 Inland Revenue does not have any discretion to waive assessed debt owed to it when a parent is in receipt of a benefit. The courts can order a debt to be written off but this is costly and time-consuming. 8.49 Arguably, assessed debt relating to beneficiaries should be able to be written off by Inland Revenue on serious hardship grounds. Similar allowance already exists in relation to tax debt – for example, when someone has a serious illness and is unable to work, or is otherwise unable to meet minimum living standards. Submissions are invited on the merits of allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt in these circumstances. Inland Revenue passing on penalties to the receiving parent 8.50 Some receiving parents consider that penalty payments made by paying parents should be passed on to them so that they are compensated for the loss of funds and not, therefore, disadvantaged by the non-payment of child support. 8.51 Penalties for child support debt could be considered to have three purposes: a monetary sanction for not complying, compensation for the lack of use of funds, and compensation for the additional administration costs incurred in recovering overdue debts. 8.52 Passing on a component that is compensating for the lack of use of funds only to the receiving parent would make the child support scheme more complex to administer. Determining the appropriate rate to be passed on would also need to be regularly reviewed. 64 8.53 Passing on penalties may also create inconsistencies in treatment between receiving parents, as the approach adopted by Inland Revenue in writing off penalties could affect the amounts actually received. As a result, receiving parents who were in otherwise identical situations could receive different amounts of support. 8.54 The focus should therefore be on encouraging the prompt payment of child support, with the imposition of late payment penalties, and the ability to write off in certain circumstances, being the main method of achieving this. 8.55 For reasons discussed earlier, the Government is not currently in favour of penalties being passed on to receiving parents. Submissions are, however, invited on this issue. 65 CHAPTER 9 Other issues for future consideration This chapter discusses a number of other issues for future consideration on which submissions are welcome: • whether a test should be introduced restricting who can claim child support; • whether paying parents should be able to receive “credits” against their child support liability by directly meeting significant costs of raising the child; • whether re-establishment costs should be taken into account in establishing income for child support purposes in certain circumstances; • whether child support payments should automatically cease when the child turns 18, unless the child is still in full-time secondary education, in which case payments would cease when the child leaves school; and • passing on child support payments to the receiving parent. 9.1 This chapter discusses a range of other issues that affect the amount of child support paid or received. Determining who can claim child support 9.2 Currently, a person can claim child support if they are the sole or principal provider of care for a child (or share that role equally with someone else). There are no other specific requirements or tests that must be satisfied. When an application for child support has been properly made, therefore, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is initially bound to accept it regardless of circumstances (although the parent who is, on the face of it, liable for child support can object and lodge an appeal). A caregiver receiving certain Government benefits relating to a child must, under law, make an application for child support. 9.3 At times, views may differ about whether a person should be able to claim child support – for example, in certain circumstances when a child leaves home to live with a person, other than a parent or other legal custodian of the child, who is not receiving a benefit relating to that child. 9.4 A specific test could therefore be introduced that restricts who is able to claim child support. This could, for example, restrict the ability to claim child support to either: • a parent of a child; or 66 • someone who has legal custody of a child; or • someone who is entitled to receive a Government benefit for a child. 9.5 There could, of course, be disadvantages in introducing such a test, as there could likely be some individual circumstances when it would not be in the best interests of a child to prevent a caregiver from claiming child support when they do not meet these requirements. However, the question is finding the right balance between the two considerations. 9.6 Inland Revenue, being predominantly a collection agency, is not best placed to make judgements that determine who a child should ideally be living with. Any changes in this area would therefore have to be very carefully considered in conjunction with the Ministries of Social Development and Justice. However, views are sought as part of this review on whether such a change should be considered and, if so, who should or should not be able to claim child support for a child. Prescribed payments 9.7 In Australia, the Child Support Agency can credit certain payments towards a paying parent’s child support liability. Credit can be given up to a maximum of 30 percent of the ongoing liability provided the balance of child support is paid as it becomes due. This facility is not, however, available to parents whose child support liability has been adjusted to reflect regular or shared care. 9.8 The types of payments that can be credited in this way are listed or “prescribed” by regulation. They are: • childcare costs for the relevant child; • fees charged by a school or preschool for that child; • amounts payable for uniforms and books prescribed by a school or preschool for that child; • fees for essential medical and dental services for that child; • the receiving parent’s share of amounts payable for rent or a security bond for the receiving parent’s home; • the receiving parent’s share of repayments on a loan that financed his or her home; and • costs to the receiving parent of obtaining and running a motor vehicle, including repairs and standing costs. 67 9.9 Views are sought on whether this option would be useful in New Zealand. 9.10 Prescribed payments may provide a greater incentive to pay child support as a paying parent may be more comfortable that the payment (or at least part of it) was directly benefiting the child according to the paying parent’s desires for the child’s upbringing. For a payment to be recognised, however, it would clearly need to have both parents’ agreement as parents’ views about expenditure choices may differ. For example, one parent may wish to send their child to a private school and be willing to pay the school fees while the other parent may prefer a state school. 9.11 Any prescribed payment system would not be available if the caregiver was solely receiving a sole parent benefit as the Government is already in effect providing contributions towards the payments as part of that benefit. In these circumstances, the making of prescribed payments by the paying parent would not offset the Government’s costs of providing the benefit as currently occurs. Recognising re-establishment costs through exempting some income 9.12 Sometimes a paying or receiving parent may take on additional employment or overtime work to re-establish themselves after a relationship separation – for example, to assist in buying an alternative home where their children can live or stay. 9.13 Under the Australian child support scheme, parents who are paying or receiving child support have, since 1 July 2008, been able to apply for their assessment to be amended to exclude additional income from overtime or a second job for up to three years from their separation. Additional requirements are: • that the income was earned in accordance with a pattern that was established after the parents first separated and is of a kind that it is reasonable to expect would not have been earned in the ordinary course of events; and • the excluded income is no more than 30 percent of the parent’s taxable income. 9.14 Establishing that the pattern of workforce participation has changed can sometimes be difficult. A parent may, for example, have undertaken overtime from time to time before separation. In other cases, the change in pattern will be more obvious. 9.15 Furthermore, the adjustment is not done through the formula because parents’ circumstances can vary substantially and a child support liability can run for substantially more than three years. Instead, the Australian child support scheme takes re-establishment costs into consideration as a ground for the equivalent of an administrative review. 68 9.16 Currently, in New Zealand, secondary employment and overtime are automatically included in the formula calculation. Re-establishing oneself is not an administrative review ground in itself. 9.17 Views are sought on whether, if both parents income is to be taken into account in calculating a child support liability, re-establishment costs should be made a ground for an administrative review on a similar basis to that adopted in Australia. Qualifying age of children 9.18 Views are sought on whether the maximum age at which child support ceases should be changed. 9.19 Child support is normally payable until a child reaches the age of 19 years but ceases earlier if: • the child becomes financially independent (defined as either being in full employment, or receiving a state-supported benefit or a student allowance); • is living in the nature of marriage; or • ceases to be ordinarily resident in New Zealand and is not a New Zealand citizen. 9.20 Some receiving parents consider the cut-off age should be higher, say 25, to provide for students in tertiary education. They may feel that, in the absence of continued payments from the paying parent, they do not have the financial means to assist their children through tertiary education, even though they feel there is a real need for them to do so. Conversely, some paying parents consider that child support should automatically cease earlier – for example, when the child reaches 18 or leaves school. 9.21 The qualifying age was fixed at 19 because of the increasing number of young people who are continuing secondary education past their eighteenth birthday. (In 2008 over 22,000 young people turned 18 in year 13 of their schooling and went on to complete that year’s education.) At that stage an individual is generally considered to be an adult (because they are eligible to vote, for example), and are no longer dependent on parental support. 9.22 The student loan and student allowances schemes are available to provide assistance after high school. Even if a student does not qualify for a student allowance because of his or her parents’ combined income, a student loan would still be available. 9.23 There may, therefore, be a case for ceasing payment when students leave secondary school rather than waiting until they turn 19 in their first year at university. 69 9.24 The latest age at which child support ceases should not be before the latest age at which the sole parent benefits cease, the main benefit being the domestic purposes benefit which generally ceases when the child turns 18. The unsupported child’s benefit (paid to carers of a child whose parents cannot care for them because of family breakdown) ceases when the child turns 19. 9.25 The Government is interested in submissions on whether the qualifying age should be changed so that it automatically ends at age 18 unless the child is still in full-time secondary education, in which case the child would cease to be a qualifying child upon leaving school. Passing on child support payments to the receiving parent (“pass-on”) 9.26 Government-provided welfare benefits give certainty to sole parents about the amount that they will receive to assist them in raising their children. However, in these circumstances some paying parents maintain that there is little incentive for them to pay child support given that their payments are generally retained by the Crown up to the amount of the benefit paid. 40 The children are no better or worse off as a result of the child support payment because the benefit is paid regardless. 9.27 “Pass-on” is the term used to describe the situation when some or all of the payments, instead of being retained by the Crown, are passed on to the beneficiary caregiver. A number of countries provide pass-on. 41 Pass-on, depending on how it operates in practice, can provide beneficiaries with more money to help raise their children. It has also been suggested that pass-on may increase the incentive to pay child support and improve compliance. 9.28 Another advantage is that there may be a greater incentive for primary caregivers who are beneficiaries to trace paying parents and to contest the level of contribution if this is considered inadequate or unjust. 9.29 Disadvantages with pass-on are: • Passing on child support contributions to beneficiaries would involve a significant fiscal loss to the Government unless benefits were netted off on the basis that the benefits included an amount for raising children. • Netting-off benefit payments would create uncertainty, and in some cases hardship, for beneficiaries and the children involved, as the overall amount they received would be dependent on whether and how promptly the other parent paid his or her child support contribution. • It does not ensure that child support payments are used on the child, which may be crucial in increasing the incentive to pay. Tagged payments or vouchers would achieve this but are, with the exception of prescribed payments (discussed earlier), largely impractical. 40 There are about 2,000 cases where the child support contribution exceeds the benefit and, therefore, the surplus is passed on. This represents around 3 percent of the situations where the primary caregiver is a beneficiary. 41 For example, Britain recently introduced partial pass-on as part of various reforms to its child support scheme and has noted an increase in compliance. In Australia, child support amounts are passed on but may result in a reduced benefit, depending on their magnitude. 70 • The costs that would be incurred by Government in administering the additional payments that pass-on would necessitate. 9.30 Changing to a system where a beneficiary receives some or all of the child support payment would be a major shift in the philosophical basis of New Zealand’s child support scheme. Some countries that have pass-on have used it to emphasise the welfare of the children where child poverty has been the central concern. However, payment of higher benefits would seem to be an administratively less complex alternative in such circumstances. 9.31 It is not clear what effect pass-on would have on parents’ decisions to participate in the workforce. Supplementing the benefit by passing on child support payments might discourage a receiving parent from taking up employment because the financial impact of moving away from a benefit would be greater. Under the current scheme, the receipt of child support payments partly cushions the loss of the benefit when the receiving parent takes up employment. 9.32 As noted earlier in this document, New Zealand’s child support collection rate compares well with other countries, lessening the incentive to introduce pass- on without strong evidence to support such a change. 9.33 On balance, it is considered that the disadvantages of passing on child support payments outweigh any likely benefits and no changes are warranted at this time. It may be a matter best considered in light of further evidence and analysis on its likely impact. 71 APPENDIX 1 Legislative history of child support in New Zealand The Child Support Act The Child Support Act 1991 came into force on 1 July 1992. It revised the rules relating to child maintenance in cases where agreement proves difficult, or when the receiving parent is a beneficiary. What differentiates the child support scheme from the previous arrangements under the Family Proceedings Act 1980 and the Social Security Act 1964 are its legislatively fixed standards, which set the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children, and its coverage. Previously, many of the situations now covered by the child support scheme would have been determined by the courts. Pre-1981 The Destitute Persons Act 1910 and the Domestic Proceedings Act 1968 created a statutory means by which women could seek maintenance orders against the fathers of their children. The court could, at its discretion, set the rate it thought appropriate for the father to pay the mother to support the child. This kind of maintenance continued until the child reached the age of 16, but continued to be payable for a child over that age if the child was in full-time education. Under the Social Security Acts of 1938 and 1964, and the Social Security Amendment Act 1973 (which introduced the statutory domestic purposes benefit), sole parents’ access to benefit assistance was conditional on pursuit of maintenance through the courts. Even though the legislation provided a means by which mothers could seek maintenance from the presumed father: • a mother had to resort to the court to enforce the maintenance agreement or order when the father did not voluntarily comply; and • an unmarried mother had to obtain a court order, an acknowledgement of paternity from the father or a declaration of paternity from the court which would entitle her to seek maintenance. Naming the father on the birth certificate was not enough to create an automatic obligation for maintenance. 72 1981–92 From 1981 to 1992 when a sole parent was in receipt of a domestic purposes benefit, the Social Security Act 1964 provided for the former Department of Social Welfare to make an assessment against the other parent of each child included in the benefit for a contribution towards the cost of the benefit. This was the Liable Parent Contribution scheme. Sole parents not in receipt of a social security benefit could agree on maintenance of their children which could subsequently be registered in court for enforcement, or they could apply directly to the court under the Family Proceedings Act 1980 for a level of maintenance to be decided on. Problems with this dual approach included: • Complexity. Many parents escaped contributing and consequently the objective of recovering from liable parents a proportion of the cost of the benefits paid to sole- parent beneficiaries was not met in many cases. For the year ending 31 March 1990, only $55 million was collected from paying parents, whereas expenditure on the domestic purposes benefit was $1,136 million. The amount owed by paying parents was $136 million, so the collection rate was very low at around 40 percent. The estimated cost of administering the scheme was $27 million. • Parents who could not agree on their child support financial arrangements had to go through the courts for a solution. Consequently, it was decided to rationalise these two approaches into a single, unified child support scheme, open to both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, which would provide for administrative assessment of child support liabilities using a formula approach. 1991 reforms In 1989 a working group was set up to establish principles and objectives for a new child support scheme and put forward possible options for reform. Early in 1991 the Government agreed on the broad principles for reform. 42 Those principles were: • that children have a right to support (including financial support) from their parents, and parents have an obligation to provide support according to their capacity to provide, irrespective of whether they are living with their children; • the State has a responsibility to ensure an adequate level of financial support for children and families and, if necessary, to supplement the financial support that parents can provide; and • the State has an interest in ensuring that caregivers of children are not left without income. It has a role through an up-to-date child support scheme in ensuring that parents meet their obligations to provide financial support, thereby limiting dependency on the State. 42 Child Support Review 1994, Report of the Working Party, 8 November 1994. 73 At the same time the Government identified the key objectives of the reform which formed the basis for the objectives in the Child Support Act, as outlined below: • To affirm the right of children to be maintained by their parents. • To affirm the obligation of parents to maintain their children. • To affirm the right of caregivers of children to receive financial support on behalf of those children from non-custodial parents of the children. • To provide that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children is to be determined according to their capacity to provide financial support. • To ensure that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support for their children should provide like amounts of financial support. • To provide legislatively fixed standards in accordance with which the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children should be determined. • To enable caregivers of children to receive support on behalf of those children from parents without the need to resort to court proceedings. • To ensure that equity exists between receiving and paying parents, in relation to the costs of supporting children. • To ensure that obligations to birth and adopted children are not extinguished by obligations to stepchildren. • To ensure that the costs to the State of providing an adequate level of financial support for children and their caregiving parent is offset by the collection of a fair contribution from paying parents. • To provide a scheme whereby child support and domestic maintenance payments can be collected by the Crown, and paid by the Crown to those entitled to the money. It was decided that the scheme should be administered by Inland Revenue, given its access to income information, and collection and enforcement capabilities. Like its then Australian model, the New Zealand child support scheme was based on the application of a formula to the paying parent’s taxable income but with important differences: • The Australian legislation left existing court-ordered arrangements for child and spousal/partner maintenance intact, whereas the New Zealand legislation overrode some existing private and court-ordered agreements. • The living allowances in New Zealand were changed to include new spouses/partners and stepchildren whether they were financially dependent or not. 74 APPENDIX 2 Administrative reviews A child support formula result can be changed if a parent seeks an administrative review through Inland Revenue. In these cases, Inland Revenue appoints an independent review officer experienced in relevant court cases to hear the parties to the application. 43 The review officer then makes a recommendation on whether departure from the child support formula assessment is warranted. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the discretion to either accept the review officer’s recommendation or conduct a rehearing. This process not only ensures an independent decision but also provides parents with an inexpensive, informal and readily available mechanism for considering their case. No recourse to the courts is required. The entire process takes approximately 35 days until a decision is issued by the Commissioner and the decision becomes binding on both parties. Either parent can apply or cross-apply to Inland Revenue under one or more of the following 10 grounds set out in the Child Support Act: • The parent has a duty to maintain another child or person. • It costs extra to cover the special needs of another child or person the parent has a duty to maintain. • The parent has necessary expenses in supporting themselves. • The parent has necessary expenses in supporting another child or person they have a duty to maintain. • It costs more than 5 percent of the child support income amount to enable the paying parent to have contact with the child. • It costs the parent extra to cover the child’s special needs. • It costs the parent more than normal to care for, educate or train the child in the way that was expected by either parent. • The child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of either parent or the child. • The child support assessment does not take into account previous payments, transfers or property settlements made by the paying parent for the benefit of the child. • The paying parent still has a financial interest in a property that the receiving parent is entitled to live in. 43 The review officers are generally lawyers practising in the area of family law. 75 These grounds can be distilled into three broad categories: • grounds affecting the capacity of the applicant to provide support; • grounds affecting the needs of the child; and • residual grounds of fairness, based on the actions of the parties and their comparative positions. If the ground(s) merit being taken into account, a new child support assessment will be made. If neither parent is happy with the Commissioner’s decision, they have several choices. They may seek an appeal to the Family Court, a judicial review, or they can seek another administrative review on new grounds. 76 APPENDIX 3 Estimated expenditure for raising children in New Zealand Estimated expenditure for raising children This appendix provides more detail on the results from estimating the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. It is based on a paper, Costs of raising children, by Iris Claus, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang which was presented at the New Zealand Association of Economists’ 2009 conference in July 2009. For further detail on the data and methodology used, please refer to that paper on www.nzae.org.nz . Expenditure for a single child Table 10 and Figure 11 present the average estimated expenditure by households with different incomes on a single child aged 12 years or under, and a child who is 13 to 18 years old. 44 The results show that parental expenditures increase as household incomes rise, with high-income households on average spending more than twice as much on their child than low-income households. The costs of teenagers were found to be higher than those of children 12 years or under. On average, low, middle and high-income households spent respectively 33, 20 and 12 percent more on teenagers than on children aged 12 years old or under. Table 10: Average estimated weekly expenditure for raising a single child 0 to 1213 to 18 Low income$704$147$196 Middle income$1,365$243$291 High income$2,838$426$477 Average income$1,552$268$316 Age of child Level of incomeAverage weekly income 44 The reference to “average” in the tables and figures in this appendix relates to the average for the income band. 77 Figure 11: Average estimated weekly expenditure for raising a single child Costs as a proportion of income Although the estimated expenditures for raising the child rise with household income, the proportion of income spent on the child was found to decline (see Table 11 and Figure 12). Low-income households spent about 21 percent of their income on a 0 to 12 year old child and 28 percent on a teenager. This compared with, respectively, 15 and 17 percent for a high-income household. High-income households with a child had on average about four times higher incomes than low-income households but spent less than three times as much as low-income households on a child 12 years or under, and less than two and a half times on a teenager. Also, the proportion of income spent on older children fell faster as income rose than did the proportion of income spent on younger children (falling from 28 to 17 percent compared with a fall from 21 to 15 percent). Table 11: Average estimated weekly expenditure for raising a single child as a proportion of households’ weekly income (in percentages) 0 to 1213 to 18 Low income$70421%28% Middle income$1,36518%21% High income$2,83815%17% Average income$1,55217%20% Level of incomeAverage weekly income Age of child $0 $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 $300 $350 $400 $450 $500 Low incomeMiddle incomeHigh income Single child 12 years or youngerSingle child 13 to 18 years old 78 Figure 12: Average estimated weekly expenditure for raising a single child as a proportion of households’ weekly income (in percentages) Multiple children The estimated expenditure for raising children depending on the number of children in the household is reported in Tables 12 to 14 and Figures 13 to 15. These figures represent estimated parental expenditure on children averaged across both age ranges. The results show that estimated parental expenditure increased with the number of children and household income. As with single-child households, the proportion of income spent on children by high-income households was lower than that of low- income households (as shown in Table 13 and Figure 14). It fell from about 40 percent for low-income households with two children to 25 percent for high-income households. For households with four children, the decline in costs was even sharper, from around 68 percent to about 38 percent.

This is shown in Table 14 and Figure 15. For low-income households the expenditure for a second child is about 78 percent of the expenditure for the first child, the expenditure for a third child falls to about 65 percent of the first child, while the expenditure for the fourth child is marginally less at 62 percent. For high-income households the decline is more dramatic. The expenditure for raising the second, third and fourth child as a proportion of the first child’s costs is, respectively, 64, 46 and 36 percent. The reductions in the average expenditure for an additional child typically arise from the economies of scale associated with raising more than one child. They may also partly result from income constraints.

This paper notes that in 2008 the Families Commission commissioned Colmar Brunton to undertake high-level research into a number of issues relating to separated parents. The issues included: • the different types of care and contact arrangements that separated parents make for their children and the factors that influence parents in making those arrangements; • the financial arrangements that separated parents make for the care of their children and the factors that influence their decisions in that area; • where applicable, an insight into how the expenditure for raising children can vary in different care and contact arrangements; and • families’ views on the characteristics of an equitable child support scheme. Ten thousand surveys were posted to Inland Revenue’s child support and Working for Families parents, resulting in 1,602 completed responses. In addition, 50 separate in- depth interviews were carried out with parents who are party to a child-support relationship to gain their views on what a fairer child support scheme would be for them. Key findings Care and contact arrangements The research yielded the following information on care and contact arrangements: • 51.9 percent of parents who pay child support (through voluntary arrangements as well as through the child support scheme) say they see their child at least a few days per fortnight, compared with 41.2 percent of receiving parents who say their child sees the paying parent at least a few days a fortnight (an average of 44.1 percent across both parent groups). • 48.3 percent of parents who pay child support (again, through voluntary arrangements as well as through the child support scheme) say their child stays overnight at their house at least a few days per fortnight, compared with 32.0 percent of receiving parents who say their child stays overnight at the paying parent’s home at least a few days a fortnight (an average of 36.4 percent). 82 Care and contact arrangements vary enormously depending on personal circumstances. Where parents can achieve agreement on these arrangements, other arrangements between the parents, including financial decisions, are more likely to also be agreed upon. Parents who have reached their own financial arrangements are more likely to have greater care and contact with their children. In addition, parents who reach private arrangements are more likely to: • take their child to school and also pick them up from after-school activities (47 percent, compared with 35 percent of those in the child support scheme); • pick their child up from school (45 percent, compared with 36 percent of those in the child support scheme); and • take care of their child while the other parent meets work commitments (43 percent, compared with 31 percent of those in the child support scheme). This reflects the reality that the child support scheme, by its very nature, tends to deal with the more difficult situations when agreement cannot be reached. Child support financial arrangements Private arrangements for child support are often calculated by reference to the child support scheme formula. Thirty-two percent of parents making private arrangements say they gained assistance from Inland Revenue or used the formula to help work out their initial financial arrangement regarding their children, even though they did not take part in the child support scheme themselves. Main costs incurred when caring for a child The survey revealed the following information on the costs incurred when caring for a child: • 89 percent of children stay in a separate bedroom (whether shared with another child or not) when in overnight care with the paying parent. • Approximately 33 percent of receiving parents live more than 100 kilometres away from the other parent. Other costs commonly incurred by both parents include food, bedroom furnishings, clothes, medical fees, school expenses, sports, music, hobbies, nappies, games or toys. Views on the characteristics of an equitable child support scheme The quantitative results on how satisfied parents are with their child support arrangement show: • 71 percent of receiving parents and 24 percent of paying parents in the child support scheme consider that the scheme does not work very well or at all well; and • 38 percent of receiving parents and 12 percent of paying parents in a private child support arrangement consider that their arrangement does not work very well or at all well. 83 Of those dissatisfied with the child support scheme, the research indicated that the current scheme does not adequately reflect the range of care arrangements parents enter into regarding their children (in particular, the costs incurred when care of a child is shared). 84 APPENDIX 5 Examples of contributions under the new formula Duncan and Helen Duncan and Helen have three children, all under 12. They separate. All of the children live with Helen. They stay with Duncan for 25 percent of the nights per year (generally alternate weekends and half of the school holidays). Step 1: Find Duncan and Helen’s child support incomes Duncan has a taxable income of $51,500 and Helen has a taxable income of $27,000. Deducting the self-support component ($16,054) from each gives Duncan a child support income of $35,446 and Helen a child support income of $10,946. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the children Duncan and Helen’s combined child support income is $46,392. The expenditure for raising the children is calculated by taking 27 percent of the first $24,081 and 26 percent of $22,311 (the remainder of the combined child support income). 27 percent of $24,081 is $6,502, and 26 percent of $22,311 is $5,801, giving a total of $12,303. (In the Expenditure for Raising Children Table, 45 this is shown as $6,502 plus 26 cents for each dollar over $24,081.) This is the expenditure for raising the children. Step 3: Apportion this cost between the parents This cost is apportioned according to each parent’s capacity to pay. A parent’s capacity to pay is determined by the proportion that they have of the combined child support income. Duncan has 76.41 percent of the combined child support income, so Duncan is responsible for 76.41 percent of the cost and Helen is responsible for 23.59 percent of the cost. If the compromise table for shared care (noted in Table 9) was used, Duncan would be considered to incur 14 percent of the expenditure for raising the children. Duncan’s share of the $12,303 would be 76.41 percent less the amount (14 percent) he is assumed to have already paid out by caring for the children, a net amount of 62.41 percent, meaning that Duncan must pay $7,678 to help support the children. Helen would have no liability as her share of care (86 percent) would be more than her proportion of total child support income (23.59 percent). Alternatively, if shared care was limited to a minimum of 33 percent of nights, there would be no shared care adjustment and Duncan would pay $9,401 (representing 76.41 percent of the total cost). Comparison with current formula Duncan would have to pay $10,082 under the current formula (based on not living with a partner and no other dependent children living with Duncan). 45 See chapter 6. 85 Simon and Kiri Simon and Kiri have one child, aged 15. They separate. The child stays with Simon for 153 (42 percent) of the nights per year (generally three nights a week) and the remaining time with Kiri. Step 1: Find Simon and Kiri’s child support incomes Simon has a taxable income of $82,000 and Kiri has a taxable income of $47,000. Deducting the self-support component ($16,054) from each gives Simon a child support income of $65,946 and Kiri a child support income of $30,946. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the child Simon and Kiri’s combined child support income is $96,892. The expenditure for raising the child is calculated by taking 23 percent of the first $24,081 of this, 22 percent of the next $24,081, 12 percent of the next $24,081, 10 percent of the next $24,081, and 9 percent of $568 (the remainder of the combined child support income). 23 percent of $24,081 is $5,539, 22 percent of $24,081 is $5,298, 12 percent of $24,081 is $2,890, 10 percent of $24,081 is $2,408, and 9 percent of $568 is $51, giving a total of $16,185. (In the Expenditure for Raising Children Table, this is shown as $16,134 plus 9 cents for each dollar over $96,234.) This is the expenditure for raising the child. Step 3: Apportion this cost between the parents This cost is apportioned according to each parent’s capacity to pay. A parent’s capacity to pay is determined by the proportion that they have of the combined child support income. Simon has 68.06 percent of the combined child support income, so Simon is responsible for 68.06 percent of the cost and Kiri is responsible for 31.94 percent of the cost. If the compromise table for shared care (noted in Table 9) was used, Simon would be considered to incur 39 percent of the expenditure for raising the children. Simon’s share of the $16,185 would be 68.06 percent less the amount (39 percent) he is assumed to have already paid out by caring for the children, a net amount of 29.06 percent, meaning that Simon must pay $4,703 to help support the children. Kiri would have no liability as her share of care (61 percent) would be more than her proportion of total child support income (31.94 percent). Comparison with current formula Simon would have to pay $4,200 under the current formula (based on having shared care and hence one dependant child, and cross-applying for child support from Kiri). 86 Kahu and Vanessa Kahu and Vanessa have two children, one is 14 and one is 16. They separate. They share care of the children equally. Step 1: Find Kahu and Vanessa’s child support incomes Kahu has a taxable income of $54,000 and Vanessa has a taxable income of $67,000. Deducting the self-support component ($16,054) from each gives Kahu a child support income of $37,946 and Vanessa a child support income of $50,946. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the children Kahu and Vanessa’s combined child support income is $88,892. The expenditure for raising the children is calculated by taking 29 percent of the first $24,081 of this, 28 percent of the next $24,081, 25 percent of the next $24,081, and 20 percent of $16,649 (the remainder of the combined child support income). 29 percent of $24,081 is $6,983, 28 percent of $24,081 is $6,743, 25 percent of $24,081 is $6,020, and 20 percent of $16,649 is $3,330, giving a total of $23,076. (In the Expenditure for Raising Children Table, this is shown as $19,746 plus 20 cents for each dollar over $72,243.) This is the expenditure for raising the children. Step 3: Apportion this cost between the parents This cost is apportioned according to each parent’s capacity to pay. A parent’s capacity to pay is determined by the proportion that each has of the combined child support income. Vanessa has 57.31 percent of the combined child support income, so she is responsible for 57.31 percent of the expenditure for the children and Kahu is responsible for 42.69 percent. If the compromise table for shared care (noted in Table 9) was used, Vanessa is given credit for incurring 50 percent of the children’s costs by caring for the children. The balance of Vanessa’s obligation must be contributed through her child support payment. Vanessa’s payment is her total obligation (57.31 percent of the children’s costs) less credit due to care (50 percent). Her payment is 7.31 percent of the expenditure for the children. 7.31 percent of $23,076 is $1,687. Vanessa is required to pay $1,687 to help support the children. Comparison with current formula Vanessa would have to pay $2,340 under the current formula (based on having shared care, and cross-applying for child support from Kahu). 87 Jim and Phillipa Jim and Phillipa have two children, one is 8 and one is 15. They separate. Both the children live with Phillipa 100 percent of the time. Step 1: Find Jim and Phillipa’s child support incomes Jim has a taxable income of $50,000 and Phillipa has a taxable income of $24,000. Deducting the self-support component ($16,054) from each gives Jim a child support income of $33,946 and Phillipa a child support income of $7,946. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the children Jim and Phillipa’s combined child support income is $41,892. Since the children are of mixed age, the expenditure for raising the children is calculated by taking 26.5 percent of the first $24,081, and 25.5 percent of $17,811 (the remainder of the combined child support income). 26.5 percent of $24,081 is $6,381, and 25.5 percent of $17,811 is $4,542, giving a total of $10,923. (In the Expenditure for Raising Children Table, this is shown as $6,381 plus 25.5 cents for each dollar over $24,081.) This is the expenditure for raising the children. Step 3: Apportion this cost between the parents This cost is apportioned according to each parent’s capacity to pay. A parent’s capacity to pay is determined by the proportion that each has of the combined child support income. Jim has 81.03 percent of the combined child support income, so Jim is responsible for 81.03 percent of the cost, and Phillipa is responsible for 18.97 percent of the cost. Phillipa spends her share of the cost in paying for day-to-day expenses from her money and Jim pays Phillipa his share to meet the remaining expenses of the children. 81.03 percent of $10,923 is $8,851. Jim must pay $8,851 to help support the children. Comparison with current formula Jim would have to pay $8,602 under the current formula (based on not living with a partner and no other dependent children with Jim). 88 Callum and Phoebe Callum and Phoebe have one child aged 9 years. They separate. The child lives with Phoebe 100 percent of the time. Step 1: Find Callum and Phoebe’s child support incomes Callum has a taxable income of $26,000 a year. Phoebe has no income of her own and is paid the maximum rate of the DPB, giving her an estimated adjusted taxable income of $16,794. Deducting the self-support component ($16,054) from each gives Callum a child support income of $9,946 and Phoebe a child support income of $740. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the children Callum and Phoebe’s combined child support income is $10,686. 17 percent of $10,686 is $1,817. (In the Expenditure for Raising Children Table, this is shown as 17 cents for each dollar.) This is the expenditure for raising the child. Step 3: Apportion this cost between the parents This cost is apportioned according to each parent’s capacity to pay. A parent’s capacity to pay is determined by the proportion that they have of the combined child support income. Callum has 93.08 percent of the combined child support income, so he is responsible for 93.08 percent of the expenditure for the child. As Phoebe receives the DPB from the Government to help raise their child, Callum pays child support to the Crown to help offset some of this expense. 93.08 percent of $1,817 is $1,691. Callum must therefore pay $1,691 to the Crown. Comparison with current formula Callum must pay $2,132 to the Crown. 89 Andy and Ali Andy and Ali have two children aged 6 and 4. They separate. The children spend some time in the school holidays with Andy, so that Ali’s share of care is 90 percent. Step 1: Find Andy and Ali’s child support incomes Andy and Ali both have adjusted taxable income below the level of the self-support component ($16,054). They therefore have a net child support income of zero. Step 2: Calculate the expenditure for raising the children Andy and Ali’s combined child support income is zero. There is therefore no cost to be apportioned between them. Step 3: Calculating the child support obligation As Andy has less than 14 percent care of the children and no net child support income, he pays the minimum payment of $815 a year in child support. As Ali is in receipt of a social security benefit, Andy must pay this $815 to the Crown to help offset some of this expense. Ali has no liability given her share of care. Comparison with current formula No change, the same minimum payment of $815 to the Crown would apply.

Financial instability following a break-up is all too common. If parents are able to work together in the interests of all family members, this can greatly reduce the strain and pressure of the situation. Many separated parents do make private, relatively amicable arrangements for the care and financial welfare of their children. This is the best option and the one to be encouraged. However, there will always be circumstances in which amicable arrangements are impossible. In these circumstances the Government provides a means for the financial welfare of children to be safe-guarded. The state-run child support scheme is a back-up for parents who are living apart and are unable or unwilling to make satisfactory private arrangements for the financial support of their children. Government intervention for parents living apart can, however, exacerbate tensions between them, since externally imposed schemes are, by their very nature, less flexible than good private arrangements. I note that over a quarter of the letters I receive as Minister of Revenue are from people who are unhappy with some aspect of the child support scheme. Even though it will never be possible to develop a child support scheme that satisfies all participants all the time, it is from time to time worth reviewing the scheme to see if it can meet the needs of the vast majority. In the 18 years since the scheme was introduced there have been significant shifts in patterns of child raising, workforce participation, the expenditure for raising children, and family law. Child support debt levels, mainly due to penalties, have also escalated considerably. I therefore encourage you to express your views on the options suggested in this discussion document for improving the child support scheme. Your contributions will have a big influence on ensuring we have a child support scheme that works as effectively as possible, and for the wellbeing of our children. Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue 1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 The New Zealand child support scheme helps to provide financial support for over 210,000 children. It is therefore essential that the scheme operates as effectively as possible, and in the best interests of the children involved. 1.2 The child support scheme is intended to be a simple, efficient, equitable and transparent method of establishing the amount of financial support that parents living apart may have to pay towards raising their children. Not all parents involved with the scheme, however, perceive it to be so and over the years, since its introduction in 1992, there have been numerous calls to make changes to the scheme. 1.3 Everyone has a different view about what a fairer scheme might look like and how to achieve it, and it will never be possible to design rules to satisfy all concerned. Nevertheless, many people consider that the scheme is now out of date which, if true, could undermine parents’ incentives to meet their child support obligations. This could be detrimental to the wellbeing of their children. This discussion document considers these issues and suggests changes to the way that child support is calculated and enforced. 1.4 Some paying parents have raised concerns that the scheme does not take account of their particular circumstances. 1 For example, they may share the care and costs of their children but have arrangements that do not qualify as “shared care” for the purposes of the child support formula. Or they might be in a situation where their income, on which child support liability is calculated, is substantially less than that of the receiving parent’s. 1.5 Some receiving parents may be concerned about non-payment of child support on the part of the paying parent or the instability of payments. Some may consider the payments to be insufficient to meet the costs of caring for their children. 1.6 These perceptions can make some parents less willing to meet their payment obligations or increase their desire to have the amount of their contributions reviewed. This may be detrimental to the children involved. 1.7 The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving parent is the main care provider. However, when parents live apart, there is now a greatly increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children’s lives. 1 In this document the terms “receiving parent” and “paying parent” are generally used to distinguish between the two parents, rather than “custodial parent” and “liable parent”. There are some relatively rare situations when both parents are paying and receiving child support. 2 1.8 Participation of women in the workforce, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work. 1.9 Ways of dealing with the ever escalating levels of accumulated debt relating, in the main, to child support penalties, also need to be considered. Options to encourage the prompt payment of child support and increased compliance by paying parents are therefore discussed in this document. Conversely, paying parents may consider the penalties for late payment to be excessive and may question whether the penalties provide the right incentives to pay. What this discussion document aims to do 1.10 This document includes options for revising the child support formula to take account of the important issues of better recognition of shared care, the income of both parents, and the current expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. 1.11 The Government needs to ensure that the best incentives to pay are in place so that child support payments are made on time, as timely payment is critical. The document therefore analyses these issues, and makes various suggestions, including that child support payments be compulsorily deducted from salaries or wages. 1.12 The desirability of parents reaching private agreements on their financial contributions and care arrangements for their children, without having these arrangements imposed upon them cannot, however, be emphasised too strongly. SUMMARY OF MAIN OPTIONS Child support formula Option 1 – comprehensive change Under this option, the child support formula would be revised to incorporate: • Lower levels of regular and shared care, by way of tiered thresholds (in which case care at levels from 14 percent of nights could be recognised). • The income of each parent. For the purposes of the calculation, each parent’s income would be reduced by a fixed living allowance, equivalent to one-third of average earnings. • Up-to-date information on the expenditure for raising children. This information would result in the amount of child support payable being variable, depending on: – the number of children; – the age of the children (costs being higher for children over 12 years); and – parents’ combined income (taking into account that expenditure on children rises in absolute terms as income rises, but declines in percentage terms). 3 Payments would still be subject to an income cap to reflect that, even though there is no obvious cut-off point for expenditure on children, the expenditure becomes increasingly discretionary as household income rises. Option 2 – component changes Elements of option 1 would be incorporated into the existing child support formula. For example, the existing formula could be extended to include recognition of a wider range of regular care situations (including a simple reduction to the minimum shared care percentage) or just incorporate the up-to-date expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. Option 3 – status quo Retaining the current child support formula, particularly having regard to the impact and complexity of more radical change, is also an option. Payment, penalties and debt Improving payment The compulsory deduction of child support payments from salary and wages for all employees with child support obligations is proposed. Other suggestions include Inland Revenue being able to place greater reliance on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s level of care. Reducing debt Options for reducing debt, mainly through the penalties system, include reducing penalties in later years or capping them and, instead, increasing non-financial enforcement measures, are also considered. Timing of reform 1.13 The Government will be guided by the feedback on this discussion document. If feedback supports change, the Government will consider the detail of any such change and when it would be most appropriate to implement it.

How child support works The standard formula 2.1 The current formula for calculating child support is: (a – b) x c where: “a” is the child support income amount; “b” is the living allowance; and “c” is the child support percentage. 2.2 For most paying parents, the child support income amount is their taxable income in the preceding income year. The maximum child support income that can be assessed is currently set at $120,463. 2.3 There are six separate living allowance levels, ranging from $14,158 to $35,868, depending on whether the paying parent is living alone or with a partner and/or other children. 2.4 Once the living allowance has been deducted from child support income, the product is multiplied by the child support percentage relevant for the number of children being supported. The standard percentages are: No. of children Child support percentage – sole care 1 18 2 24 3 27 4 or more 30 6 2.5 There is a minimum amount of child support payable each year, the current minimum amount being $815. Shared care 2.6 The above percentages are reduced if parents share the care of their child. Under the Child Support Act, care of a child is regarded as being shared when each provider of care shares the ongoing daily care of the child “substantially equally” with the other care provider. A paying parent who looks after a child for at least 40 percent of nights is considered to meet this test. Administrative reviews 2.7 If either parent considers that the amount payable under the formula is not appropriate, they can apply for an administrative review under one or more of 10 grounds set out in the Child Support Act. Advantages of the current approach to calculating contributions 2.8 The scheme is fairly simple and provides relative certainty for parents about their obligations and entitlements. Assessment under the scheme is simple to understand and relatively easy to administer. Furthermore, the formula’s fixed standards generally ensure that parents with like circumstances are treated the same. In most cases, there is no need for a reassessment. Disadvantages of the current approach to calculating contributions 2.9 The main disadvantage of the current approach is that it does not adequately reflect the variety of social and parenting circumstances in New Zealand today, particularly in the following areas: • Shared care: The threshold tests for recognising shared care are too high and create a “cliff” effect. A “cliff” effect means that there can be a substantial change in the amount of child support payable, depending on whether or not shared care is established at the prescribed level. • Actual expenditure for raising children: Child support payments do not reflect the costs associated with raising children in New Zealand. The formula is linked directly to income rather than costs. • Respective incomes: The current child support formula presumes that receiving parents’ main contribution to raising their children is their time and that they have little income because of this commitment. With a greater number of sole parents now participating in paid employment, this may no longer be a valid assumption. 2.10 To the extent that these issues adversely affect parents’ willingness to pay child support, they adversely affect the children concerned. 7 2.11 It is also at least questionable, given increasing child support debt rates, whether the current payment and penalties system creates the appropriate level of incentive to pay. Penalties play a vital role in encouraging parents to pay their child support obligations, and should continue to do so. However, if they are excessive, they can perversely discourage the payment of child support, to the detriment of the children concerned. Summary 2.12 Although the current scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents. These concerns need to be addressed in any revised approach. The following chapters explore how this might be done. 8 CHAPTER 3 Expenditure for raising children This chapter outlines Australian and New Zealand studies relating to the expenditure for raising children and discusses the implication of these studies for the child support formula. It concludes that the trends in the estimated expenditure for raising children in New Zealand are broadly in line with Australian findings, and suggests that these costs should be recognised in any revised formula. Relevance of expenditure for raising children 3.1 There is an acceptance internationally that child support contributions should reflect the cost to parents of raising children. Various methods are used to try to achieve this. They invariably involve deriving a “cost” and then translating it into a percentage of income to represent the assumed expenditure for raising a child for a particular income level or range. 3.2 Some mechanism for determining what it costs to raise a child that is a fair reflection or proxy of the actual cost in the majority of circumstances is, therefore, necessary. Measuring the estimated average expenditure for raising children 3.3 There are two main methodologies for estimating the expenditure for raising children – one based on actual expenditures (as per household survey data) and another that uses a “basket” of goods that a child is considered to need for an acceptable living standard. 3.4 In reaching an estimated “expenditure” some things that need to be considered include: • The need to compare like with like. For example, families need to have equivalent living standards for comparisons to be valid. • How to allocate costs of goods and services used collectively by the family, the key ones being housing and transport. • The need to reduce expenditures by any tax credits and other similar benefits received as these in effect subsidise costs. New Zealand results 3.5 Following the approach used by Australia in redesigning its child support formula, two methods have been used to measure the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand, based on the expenditures for two-parent families. The methodologies from the equivalent Australian studies into the costs of raising children have been used as far as possible, but with New Zealand data. 9 3.6 The results show that the average expenditure for raising children in New Zealand varies according to the age of the child, households’ level of income and the number of children in the household. As shown in Figures 1 and 2 costs are lower for children in the 12 years and under age group than for children aged between 13 and 18 years. Higher income households are found to spend more on their children than lower income households, but the proportion of household income is lower, particularly for children aged 13 to 18 years. The expenditure per child is greatest for households with one child and progressively declines with additional children. Figure 1: Estimated average weekly expenditure for raising one child as a proportion of households’ weekly income (in percentages) Figure 2: Estimated average estimated weekly expenditure for raising the first, second, third and fourth child 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% Low incomeMiddle incomeHigh income Single child 12 years or youngerSingle child 13 to 18 years old $0 $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 $300 $350 $400 $450 $500 Low incomeMiddle incomeHigh income 1 child2 children3 children4 children 10 How do these results compare with Australian studies? 3.7 The trends outlined above are consistent with the findings of the comparable Australian studies, with some explicable variances. For example, the proportion of income spent on children seems to be slightly higher in New Zealand but this may be the result of incomes being generally lower in New Zealand. Other reasons for the variances include: • The data set used in the New Zealand estimation was smaller and so may be susceptible to greater variation. • The underlying Australian survey data is around 10 years old so that people’s expenditure mixes may have changed. • Food and energy costs have increased relative to incomes since the Australian studies were undertaken. 3.8 Taking into account these differences, the New Zealand results are sufficiently in line with those of the Australian studies to support further consideration of including the estimated average expenditures for raising children in the child support formula. Adjusting for tax benefits 3.9 The tax benefits provided to New Zealand families have increased substantially over the past decade. 3.10 Rather than endeavouring to build into any child support formula an adjustment for tax benefits that reflects each parent’s situation, which would unduly complicate the formula, it seems to be more appropriate to follow the Australian approach of reducing the expenditure for raising children percentages for each income band by the average tax benefits likely to be received. This means that the expenditure for raising children matrix shown in chapter 6 is net of likely average tax benefits. 11 CHAPTER 4 Shared care This chapter discusses how shared care is recognised under the current scheme and suggests alternatives to recognise other levels of regular care in line with levels of care adopted in Australia and the United Kingdom. The chapter specifically considers, and invites submissions on, the following issues: • whether the single threshold for shared care (the current 40 percent of nights test) should be retained, but lowered (for example, closer to the one-third test used for Working for Families Tax Credits); • whether a tiered system of shared care should be introduced and, if so, what tiers would achieve the fairest result in determining child support liability (tiers from 14 percent of nights are discussed); and • how the additional costs arising from regular care should be split between parents. Submissions are also invited on whether Inland Revenue, in taking account of shared care, should be able to rely on a parenting order or a parenting agreement to establish the amount of time a child spends with each parent. Summary of shared care concerns 4.1 The Government is concerned that the current scheme provides disincentives to parents sharing the care of their children as it does not currently recognise the significant expenditures some parents incur while trying to retain a significant role in their children’s upbringing. This may affect the paying parent’s willingness or ability to meet their child support obligations or to maintain any significant level of care. 4.2 As observed in chapter 3, when both parents have regular care of their children, expenditures for the paying parent increase with an associated, but disproportionately lower, reduction in the receiving parent’s expenditures. This is because of a loss of the economies of scale that exist in two-parent families, and in many cases where care is shared, neither parent is able to maintain their former standard of living. 4.3 The key question to be addressed is whether the expenditures incurred by both parents can be borne in a more equitable way. 12 Options for changing the threshold 4.4 In considering how the threshold might be changed, two options have been considered. Option one – reducing the shared care threshold 4.5 Retaining a single, but lower, shared care threshold would maintain the simplicity of the current shared care rules. A lower threshold would allow more paying parents to benefit from the shared care rules, and better recognise their contributions towards raising their children. On the other hand, wherever the threshold level is set, it will be seen as arbitrary and still create a noticeable “cliff” effect. Option two – introducing a tiered set of thresholds 4.6 Under a tiered approach, paying parents would have the care they provide acknowledged at a given rate, with higher levels of care reflected in a corresponding increase in the child support liability adjustment, in recognition of the additional expenditures incurred. 4.7 The advantage of a tiered approach is that once regular or shared care is confirmed, subsequent small increases in levels of care would not give rise to major changes in child support for either parent – that is, there would be less of a cliff effect, and instead there would be a series of smaller incremental adjustments. 4.8 If the tiered approach is adopted for New Zealand to provide relief for care given, it could be based on the following table: Table 1 Number of nights of care annually Proportion of net expenditure for child considered incurred 0 to 51 Nil 52 to 103 14% 104 to 174 14% plus 0.5% for each night over 103 175 or more 50% 4.9 It would be possible to commence the tiers from 33% – for example, if a higher minimum threshold for recognising shared care was considered more appropriate. 13 Other issues affecting shared care Use of number of nights as a test 4.10 Shared care for child support purposes is determined by the number of nights of care a parent provides. For other purposes it is based on days or time in general. The “nights” test is used for child support to provide a clear-cut guideline which minimises confusion for parents and lessens administrative uncertainty. It is easily measured and understood and is, on balance, considered the best indicator of parental involvement and additional costs for the purposes of the child support scheme. This view is based on the likelihood that when a child spends a night with a parent, the parent will usually provide a bedroom, dinner, breakfast and transport. 4.11 Accordingly, it would seem appropriate to retain the nights test for child support purposes. The administrative review process would still be available to provide departures from the test on a case-by-case basis when justified. Reliance on parenting orders and agreements 4.12 An amendment is suggested that would allow Inland Revenue to rely on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s share of care for child support purposes. 4.13 Allowing Inland Revenue in the first instance to rely on the terms of parenting orders and agreements would result in more efficient processing of regular and shared care applications. It would also reinforce what the courts have determined to be in the best interests of the children. This initiative would extend to parenting agreements which, while not enforceable by the courts, nonetheless convey the intentions and expectations of both parents. 4.14 If Inland Revenue were able to rely more on the terms of parenting orders and agreements to determine a parent’s share of care for child support purposes, a new administrative review ground would be needed to enable a parent to challenge this presumption. The onus of proving that the order or agreement was not being adhered to would rest with the parent making the challenge. 14 CHAPTER 5 Taking both parents’ income into account This chapter discusses the merits of taking both parents’ income into account for the purposes of determining child support payments, and of providing each parent with a set living allowance as a deduction from their income. Submissions are invited on these points as well as on whether, in the absence of a recognised shared care arrangement, there should continue to be a minimum child support payment. Income-shares approach 5.1 Taking into account the income of both parents in determining levels of child support payments may better reflect the realities of modern-day parenting and parents’ relative abilities to contribute towards the expenditure for raising their children. This is consistent with providing a better recognition of shared care and applying corresponding expenditures discussed earlier. 5.2 The essential feature of a child support scheme that directly reflects both parents’ incomes is that expenditures for raising children are worked out based on the parents’ combined income, with the expenditure distributed between parents in accordance with their respective shares of that combined income and their level of care of the child. 5.3 The Government seeks your feedback on whether this combined expenditure and income-shares approach, which is adopted in Australia and elsewhere, should be adopted in New Zealand. Advantages and disadvantages of an income-shares approach 5.4 The main advantages of an income-shares approach are: • It is more transparent. It provides an estimate of how much is being contributed by each parent towards the support of their child. • It better reflects parents’ relative abilities to financially contribute towards raising their children and parallels likely expenditure by those parents as if they were in a two-parent household where both parents have income. • It makes processes around changes of financial circumstances clearer and simpler. If there is a reduction in the income of either parent, this can be automatically reflected in the contribution calculation, potentially removing the need for an administrative review. 15 5.5 Possible disadvantages of the income-shares approach are: • If the receiving parent’s income varies significantly – for example, to accommodate the needs of children, there is potential to increase conflict between parents as the paying parent’s child support contribution would also vary. • Some receiving parents could be discouraged from participating in the workforce because a portion of every dollar they earned over the self- support amount would be “lost” through a decrease in the child support they received. On the other hand, there may be a greater incentive for paying parents to earn higher incomes if they were paying less in child support as a result of both incomes being taken into account. • The approach could make the level of payments less secure as a change in either parent’s income may well result in a change in child support payable or receivable. 5.6 These arguments, however, need to be balanced against the reality that changes in either parent’s work patterns do impact on their children and would do so if the parents were living together. Ideally, the formula should reflect this reality in which case the advantages of the income-shares approach would seem to outweigh the possible disadvantages. Changing the definition of “income” 5.7 Ideally how “income” is defined for child support purposes should align with how it is defined for tax credit purposes; that is, it should generally continue to be taxable income. Budget 2010 made an important change to the way that income is defined for tax credit purposes. From 1 April 2011, investment losses, including losses from rental properties, will be added back so that these losses cannot be used to reduce income when assessing eligibility for Working for Families Tax Credits. The Government is considering making a similar change for child support purposes on the basis that this would better reflect the real income that families would normally have available to them. 5.8 Budget 2010 also signalled that the Government would be introducing other measures in relation to Working for Families Tax Credits, including ensuring trust income is counted as part of a family’s total income. These changes could be considered in the child support context too. Living allowance 5.9 New Zealand currently deducts from a paying parent’s income an amount considered necessary to cover the parent’s living expenses. 16 5.10 The Government is considering changing this, given the option that combined incomes are used as the basis for calculating contributions, so that both parents qualify for the living allowance adjustment. This living allowance could be based on annual average earnings in New Zealand. Given that annual average earnings are $48,162 in New Zealand, one-third of this would mean a living allowance of $16,054, which is above the current living allowance for a single parent with no dependents ($14,158). Under this approach, both parents’ taxable incomes would be reduced by this amount. An example of what this would mean for parents with dependent children is provided in the next chapter. Minimum payment 5.11 It is proposed that the minimum payment be retained at its existing level (currently $815). However, if lower levels of regular shared care were recognised, this minimum payment could be waived on the basis that the expenditures incurred from regular care would be at least equivalent to the minimum payment. 17 CHAPTER 6 A revised formula for improving the child support scheme This chapter brings together the key elements of the previous chapters to discuss how a revised child support formula might work, including how the formula would account for other dependent children. It also includes examples of how the amounts of child support payable might compare under that formula and the existing formula. Submissions are invited on: • whether all of the factors mentioned in this discussion (the expenditure for raising children, shared care and taking both parents’ income into account) should be included in a revised child support formula; and • if all elements of the formula were not included, which one idea should be given priority. 6.1 Chapters 3, 4 and 5 outlined how the child support formula could be updated to better reflect a greater variety of circumstances and expenditure on raising children in New Zealand. This chapter brings these various strands together. It also considers whether there should be an income cap and whether the formula should reflect any differences in expenditure for raising children at different ages. Should there still be an income cap? 6.2 An income cap seems appropriate for New Zealand because studies have shown that, as household income levels rise far above the community average, it becomes increasingly difficult to measure further increases in expenditure on children. 6.3 If the option discussed in chapter 5 to include both parents’ incomes in the child support liability calculation was implemented, the income cap could be increased to a level of effectively 3.17 times the total average earnings before deducting the two parents’ living allowances (similar to the approach taken in Australia). Should the child’s age be taken into consideration? 6.4 Given the findings from the study of the expenditure for raising children that expenditure increases significantly for older children, the question arises whether payments should increase after the child reaches 12 years of age. 18 6.5 Taking age into consideration would further complicate the formula. However, a contribution calculation that did not take into account a child’s age could lead to material over- or under-payments, depending on how old the child was when child support was first paid and how long the child was in the scheme. 6.6 Accordingly, if the formula is to be amended to reflect the expenditure for raising children as suggested below, it is recommended that age should be taken into consideration, as in Australia, by having values based on two age categories: 0-12 years and over 12 years. A possible revised formula – option 1 – comprehensive change 6.7 Having considered all of the relevant variables, the rest of this chapter brings these together in a revised formula. Under this approach, the three key initiatives would be: • To deal with concerns about insufficient recognition of regular and shared care of children, the formula would incorporate lower levels of shared care. For the purposes of this chapter, this would be by way of tiered thresholds from 14 percent of nights (or its equivalent). Regular care of at least this level would remove the minimum annual child support contribution. • To deal with concerns about the capacity to pay, both parents’ incomes would be included in the formula, with payments being apportioned according to each parent’s share of total income. For each parent, “income” would generally be defined as taxable income for Working for Families Tax Credit purposes, less a fixed living allowance set at one- third of the average earnings. If there were also dependent children, a parent’s income would be further reduced for the assumed expenditure for those children, before calculating their child support contribution. • The formula would use a new scale of income percentages that reflected up-to-date information on the net (of average tax benefits) expenditures for raising children in New Zealand. These percentages would vary with: – the number of children; – the age of the children (the percentage would be higher for children over 12 years); and – the combined income of the parents. Table 2 sets out how a table for establishing expenditures for raising children would look for the purposes of the revised formula. 19 Table 2: Expenditure for raising children matrix Parents’ combined child support income (income above the living allowance amounts) 1 Number of children $0 – $24,081 2 $24,082 – $48,162 3 $48,163 – $72,243 4 $72,244 – $96,324 5 $96,325 – $120,405 6 Over $120,405 6 Expenditure for raising children (to be apportioned between the parents) Children aged 0–12 years 1 child 17c for each $1 $4,094 plus 15c for each $1 over $24,081 $7,706 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $10,596 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $13,004 plus 7c for each $1 over $96,324 $14,689 2 children 24c for each $1 $5,779 plus 23c for each $1 over $24,081 $11,318 plus 20c for each $1 over $48,162 $16,134 plus 18c for each $1 over $72,243 $20,469 plus 10c for each $1 over $96,324 $22,877 3+ children 27c for each $1 $6,502 plus 26c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,763 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $18,783 plus 24c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 18c for each $1 over $96,324 $28,897 Children aged 13+ years 1 child 23c for each $1 $5,539 plus 22c for each $1 over $24,081 $10,836 plus 12c for each $1 over $48,162 $13,726 plus 10c for each $1 over $72,243 $16,134 plus 9c for each $1 over $96,324 $18,302 2 children 29c for each $1 $6,983 plus 28c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,726 plus 25c for each $1 over $48,162 $19,746 plus 20c for each $1 over $72,243 $24,563 plus 13c for each $1 over $96,324 $27,693 3+ children 32c for each $1 $7,706 plus 31c for each $1 over $24,081 $15,171 plus 30c for each $1 over $48,162 $22,395 plus 29c for each $1 over $72,243 $29,379 plus 20c for each $1 over $96,324 $34,195 Children of mixed age\* 2 children 26.5c for each $1 $6,381 plus 25.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $12,522 plus 22.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $17,940 plus 19c for each $1 over $72,243 $22,515 plus 11.5c for each $1 over $96,324 $25,285 3+ children 29.5c for each $1 $7,104 plus 28.5c for each $1 over $24,081 $13,967 plus 27.5c for each $1 over $48,162 $20,589 plus 26.5c for each $1 over $72,243 $26,971 plus 19c for each $1 over $96,324 $31,546 1 Calculated by adding the two parents’ child support incomes, that is, adding each parent’s adjusted taxable income minus their living allowance of $16,054 (1/3 of Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)). 2 .5 of AWE. 3 AWE. 4 1.5 times AWE. 5 2 times AWE. 6 2.5 times AWE. Expenditure for raising children does not increase above this cap. Note that this equates to a cap at a combined adjusted taxable income of $152,514. \* The rates are the average of the two previous age categories. 20 How this approach would work in practice 6.8 Under this new formula each parent would be allocated a standard living allowance which would be deducted from his or her respective taxable income. 2 The two net amounts would be summed up and expressed as a percentage of the total. These proportions would then be applied to the expenditure for raising children amount relevant for that child so the expenditure for raising the child or children is split between the two parents based on their relative net incomes. 6.9 Each parent’s percentage of shared care would then be deducted from the result to produce a net liability for one of the parents. This would be the parent whose shared-care percentage is less than his or her share of total net income. 6.10 These steps are illustrated in the following example. Example 1: How the formula would take into account income and shared care Situation A Parents Kenny and Clara, who are living apart, have two children, aged 15 and 10. Kenny’s taxable income is $50,000 while Clara’s is $15,000. Kenny and Clara would each be entitled to a fixed living allowance of $16,054 reducing their respective incomes to $33,946 and $0, a combined child support income of $33,946. Kenny’s proportion of child support income would therefore be 100 percent while Clara’s would be 0 percent. Clara is the sole caregiver so there is no shared care adjustment. In accordance with Table 2, the relevant expenditure for the two children of mixed ages is $8,897. Clara has no liability and Kenny must pay $8,897 to help support the children. Situation B Kenny’s taxable income is $50,000 while Clara’s is now $25,000. Kenny and Clara would again each be allowed a fixed living allowance of $16,054 reducing their respective incomes to $33,946 and $8,946, a combined child support income of $42,892. Kenny’s proportion of child support income would therefore be 79.14 percent while Clara’s would be 20.86 percent. Clara is still the sole caregiver so there is no shared care adjustment. In accordance with Table 2, the relevant expenditure for the two children of mixed ages is $11,178. Accordingly, Kenny must pay $8,847 to help support the children. 2 If the net amount was negative then it would be treated as zero. 21 Situation C This is the same as situation B except that Kenny now also shares some of the care, having the children every other weekend or one-seventh (14%) of nights. If the table for shared care noted in Table 1 was used, Kenny would be considered to incur 14 percent of the expenditure for raising the children. Kenny’s share of the $11,178 expenditure would be 79.14 percent less the amount (14 percent) he is assumed to have already paid out by caring for the children, a net amount of 65.14 percent, meaning that Kenny must pay $7,282 to help support the children. Clara would have no liability as her share of care (86 percent) would be more than her proportion of total child support income (20.86 percent). Comparison with current formula In all of situations A, B and C, under the existing formula Kenny would have to pay $8,602 (based on not living with a partner and no other dependent children living with Kenny). Treatment of other dependent children and new partners 6.11 To recognise the care a parent provides for other dependent children, an amount (in addition to the living allowance) would be deducted from the parent’s adjusted taxable income before applying the basic formula. The income of a new partner would not be taken into account in these calculations. Comparison of contributions under the old and new formulas Effect of potential changes taking into account both parents’ incomes and shared care 6.12 Figure 3 factors in the suggested changes that would arise from including both parents’ incomes and recognising a wider range of regular parental care, as well as the estimated expenditure for raising children in New Zealand. In terms of shared care, two scenarios are shown. The first recognises shared care as low as 14 percent of nights and the second recognises shared care on the same tiered basis but only from when parental care is at least 33 percent. 6.13 A main finding shown in the charts in Figure 3 is that, for a large portion of both receiving and paying parents, the changes would not result in any change in the amounts parents received or paid. This reflects the fact that many parents will continue to either receive a sole parent benefit (and therefore do not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. 6.14 In particular, it should be noted that, for many receiving parents, a reduction in the child support contribution from the paying parent will not result in any decrease in the amount of benefit that they receive. 22 6.15 Of those remaining parents whose child support will be affected, Figure 3 indicates that over 80 percent of current child support receipts and around 70 percent of payments would either be unaffected or affected to the extent of plus or minus $66 per month. 6.16 Parents who would qualify for any wider recognition of shared care would be most affected, with paying parents likely to pay less in such cases. Consequently, how and the extent to which regular care is recognised is important to the overall outcome. This is graphically illustrated in the differences between the outcomes of shared care starting from 14 percent compared to shared care starting from 33 percent. Under a minimum of 33 percent care, there are just as many receiving parents who would receive more than would receive less, and the impact on paying parents is correspondingly less. 6.17 The above impacts may be reduced as in some cases changes in the amount of child support received or paid affects (in the opposite direction) the amount of Working for Families Tax Credits received. Alternative option – option 2 – component changes 6.18 An alternative option would be to incorporate just one or two of the key changes. The existing formula could be extended to include recognition of a wider range of regular care situations, just the up-to-date expenditure for raising children in New Zealand, just both parents’ incomes, or a combination of some of these. Any of these approaches would likely reduce the overall impact of any change. They would, however, be a less comprehensive and transparent solution. 6.19 Any change could have a material impact for a minority of parents. Nevertheless, the overall question to bear in mind is whether any particular change would achieve a fairer outcome that would encourage more parents to pay their outstanding child support liabilities voluntarily. 23 Figure 3: Estimated monthly change in child support receipts and payments Receiving parents 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 $201 or more $101 to $200 $67 to $100 $34 to $66 $1 to $33 $0 -$1 to -$33 -$34 to -$66 -$67 to - $100 -$101 to - $200 -$201 or more $ change per month Number of parents 14% shared care minimum33% shared care minimum Paying parents 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 $201 or more $101 to $200 $67 to $100 $34 to $66 $1 to $33 $0 -$1 to -$33 -$34 to -$66 -$67 to - $100 -$101 to - $200 -$201 or more $ change per month Number of parents 14% shared care minimum33% shared care minimum Notes: The estimates are based on current child support relationships – that is, where someone is currently paying child support. The number of receiving parents includes parents receiving the sole-parent domestic purpose benefit. For parents entitled to the domestic purpose benefit there is no impact unless payments currently exceed the benefit because the child support payments are not directly passed on and are instead retained by the Crown. They have, however, been included to show a complete picture. The number of paying parents exceeds the number of receiving parents because of children who are cared for by a third person. Taxable income information for the year ended March 2008 is used for both parents. No net amount is calculated for parents with multiple child support relationships and for parents who cross-apply for shared care arrangements. The receiving parent’s child support income is slightly overstated in some cases because information is not available on how many dependent children they might have. The age composition of the paying parent’s other dependent children is unknown and randomly assigned; it is unknown whether this results in an over- or under-estimation of the projected child support payments. 24 CHAPTER 7 Automatic deduction of child support payments from salary and wages To ensure payments are made as and when they fall due, this chapter suggests that child support payments be automatically deducted by employers from paying parents’ salary and wages. Payment deductions 7.1 Paying parents currently have a range of options for paying their monthly child support liability. Payment methods include cheque, credit card, automatic payment or by cash. Employees, however, generally cannot choose to have direct deductions made by their employer from their pay. Deductions from pay only currently occur when parents default on their payments. 7.2 The absence of direct deductions may increase the risk of non-payment of child support which, in turn, adversely affects the wellbeing of the children involved. It can also unnecessarily inconvenience paying parents, especially those who are paid weekly or fortnightly. If they wish to make child support payments to match their pay cycle, they need to calculate the amount to be paid and set up a separate automatic payment arrangement with a bank to ensure their liability is met on their payday. 7.3 To address these problems, it is suggested that deductions from pay by employers be made compulsory for paying parents who receive regular employment income. This would be similar to the process currently applicable to KiwiSaver contributions. Paying parents would have their payments automatically co-ordinated with their pay periods, whether those periods were weekly, fortnightly or monthly. 7.4 It is recognised that some paying parents may have concerns about their employers knowing that they are making child support contributions. However, arguably the public interest in operating an effective child support scheme should outweigh these individual concerns. 7.5 There may be some, albeit marginal, increased compliance costs for employers from having to make deductions and record and pay the monies to Inland Revenue through the PAYE system. The increase in the number of deductions would, however, be very small relative to the volumes already being processed at the same time to account for PAYE, ACC and KiwiSaver contributions. 7.6 Additional compliance costs to employers should be mitigated if this change were incorporated as part of proposed changes to the PAYE system – in particular, in improving the design and functionality of the employer monthly schedule. 25 CHAPTER 8 Child support payment, penalties and debt This chapter discusses the child support penalty rules, and suggests possible changes that may assist with the prompt payment of child support and increased compliance by paying parents. It also considers the question of how the Government can deal with existing accumulated penalty debt. It specifically seeks submissions on which of the following ideas should be considered further: • reducing incremental penalty rates and improving enforcement; • capping penalties; • closer alignment with late payment penalties and use-of-money interest used for tax purposes; • penalty write-off grounds; and • writing-off assessed child support debt. 8.1 The child support scheme, as far as possible, needs to be perceived as fair. Paying parents are more likely to pay child support if the way it is calculated is transparent and takes account of the right variables. The options described elsewhere in this discussion document are intended to address many of the concerns about fairness that paying parents have with the current scheme. 8.2 There is currently a very high level of accumulated debt relating to child support penalties, much of which has been in place for a long time. Ways of dealing with this debt need to be considered to ensure that payments are made for the care of the children or to offset the cost to the Government of providing benefits to receiving parents. 8.3 This chapter discusses child support penalties and looks at a range of options for change in this area to stop child support debt being created in the first place or, when it does exist, to reduce it as soon as possible. Current penalties rules 8.4 Currently, paying parents who fail to pay in full and on time incur an initial penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. A further penalty of two percent of the unpaid amount (including the 10 percent penalty) is imposed on a compounding basis for each month that the amount remains outstanding. These penalties are retained by the Government and are not passed on to the receiving parent. 26 8.5 Several concerns have been identified with the current penalty system, including: • the size and nature of the penalties, in particular the two percent incremental penalty; • the relatively limited circumstances in which the two percent incremental penalty can be written off; and • the restrictions on writing off assessed debt. Alternative options for imposing penalties 8.6 At some point parents who would otherwise be willing to pay off their assessed child support liability may be reluctant to approach Inland Revenue because of the magnitude of the penalty sums involved. In other words, high levels of penalty debt could be acting as a disincentive to re-engage with the child support scheme and start or resume payment of child support liabilities. 8.7 Submissions are therefore sought on whether any of the following options should be introduced. The basis for any change should be that it would provide a better incentive for paying parents to comply with their child support obligations and make payment as soon as possible. Reduce current incremental penalty rate 8.8 One option would be to keep the current structure of the existing penalty system in place, but to reduce the two percent incremental penalty. 8.9 Such a reduction could be introduced after a set period of non-compliance by the paying parent – for example, after non-compliance of one year. To counter perceptions that this could be a reward for non-compliance, it could be introduced at the same time as additional and more focussed enforcement measures for those that continue to avoid payment. These could include: • The paying parent being subject to a more focussed and specific compliance effort from Inland Revenue (that is, being subject to more intensive case management). • Further use of the automatic deduction of refunds due to paying parents from other Inland Revenue sources in order to offset any child support debts due (for example, in respect of unconfirmed personal tax summaries). • The use, in extreme circumstances, of departure prohibition orders whereby paying parents could be restricted from travelling overseas until their child support liabilities are settled. (Departure prohibition orders are used with some success in Australia.) • “Naming and shaming” paying parents, while being mindful of privacy concerns and the need to ensure a person is not improperly named. 27 Capping penalties 8.10 Another suggestion is to cap the amount of penalties that could apply to a parent’s child support debt. This would stop the debt accumulating and reduce the potential reluctance parents might have to contact Inland Revenue. On the other hand, once this cap is reached there may be limited further incentive for paying parents to continue to pay their child support liability. Again, if this option were to be considered, the Government would need to ensure that other enforcement measures were also adopted to increase the likelihood of payment. Aligning child support penalties to tax penalties and use-of-money interest 8.11 Another question worth considering is whether to better align child support penalties with the penalty and use-of-money interest rules that apply for tax purposes. Using tax-based late payment penalties and use-of-money interest rates would allow for better alignment with the treatment of tax debts and could provide administrative efficiencies for Inland Revenue. 8.12 A tax-based penalties system is not fully relevant to the child support scheme, however. In addition to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest, tax penalties also contain shortfall penalties. These are determined in relation to benchmark standards of behaviour and care (for example taking an unacceptable tax position or being grossly careless) that are not usually relevant to the non-payment of child support. Penalties write-off grounds 8.13 Although the primary objective of any changes to the penalty rules should be to progressively recover any existing core debt and establish the regular payment of child support liabilities, writing off penalties should also be considered if this facilitates regular payment or is justifiable on hardship grounds. 8.14 Currently, there is a range of grounds under which penalties can be written off by Inland Revenue. In some cases write-offs are mandatory while others are at the Commissioner’s discretion. Despite the number of grounds that exist, the ability to write-off child support penalties is generally more restrictive than for the write-off of tax penalties because the Crown is holding the money for use towards the care of the child involved. Nevertheless, there seems to be some scope for improving the ability to write off penalties. 8.15 Options that could be considered include: • relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written off when a paying parent agrees and adheres to an instalment arrangement, but may not fully meet the current requirements; • allowing Inland Revenue a wider range of options to negotiate the write- off of penalties; 28 • allowing Inland Revenue to automatically write-off low levels of penalty- only debt below a certain value; and • introducing a child support penalty debt amnesty whereby penalties are automatically written off if a paying parent pays all their existing assessed child support debt during a set time period. 8.16 Submissions are sought on whether any of these options should be considered further. The main basis for any change should be that it would increase the incentives for paying parents to start meeting their child support obligations in full. Write-off of assessed child support debt 8.17 Inland Revenue cannot currently write off assessed debt because, in many cases, the debt is owed to the other parent for the care of the child. Receiving parents who are not on a benefit do, however, have the discretion to waive the assessed debt. 8.18 Inland Revenue does not have any discretion to waive assessed debt owed to it when a parent is in receipt of a benefit. The courts can order a debt to be written off but this is costly and time-consuming. Arguably, assessed debt relating to beneficiaries should be able to be written off by Inland Revenue on serious hardship grounds. Similar allowance already exists in relation to tax debt – for example, when someone has a serious illness and is unable to work, or is otherwise unable to meet minimum living standards. Submissions are invited on the merits of allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt in these circumstances. 29 CHAPTER 9 Other issues for future consideration This chapter discusses a number of other issues for future consideration on which submissions are welcome: • whether a test should be introduced restricting who can claim child support; • whether paying parents should be able to receive “credits” against their child support liability by directly meeting significant costs in raising the child; • whether re-establishment costs should be taken into account in establishing income for child support purposes in certain circumstances; • whether child support payments should automatically cease when the child turns 18, unless the child is still in full-time secondary education, in which case payments would cease when the child leaves school; and • passing on child support payments to the receiving parent. 9.1 This chapter discusses a range of other issues that affect the amount of child support paid or received. Determining who can claim child support 9.2 Currently, a person can claim child support if they are the sole or principal provider of care for a child (or share that role equally with someone else). There are no other specific requirements or tests that must be satisfied. At times, views may differ about whether a person should be able to claim child support – for example, in certain circumstances when a child leaves home to live with a person, other than a parent or other legal custodian of the child, who is not receiving a benefit relating to that child. 9.3 A specific test could therefore be introduced that restricts who is able to claim child support. This could, for example, restrict the ability to claim child support to either: • a parent of a child; or • someone who has legal custody of a child; or • someone who is entitled to receive a Government benefit for a child. 9.4 There could, of course, be disadvantages in introducing such a test, as there could likely be some individual circumstances when it would not be in the best interests of a child to prevent a caregiver from claiming child support when they do not meet these requirements. However, the question is finding the right balance between the two considerations. 30 9.5 Inland Revenue, being predominantly a collection agency, is not best placed to make judgements that determine who a child should ideally be living with. Any changes in this area would therefore have to be very carefully considered in conjunction with the Ministries of Social Development and Justice. However, views are sought as part of this review on whether such a change should be considered and, if so, who should or should not be able to claim child support for a child. Prescribed payments 9.6 In Australia, the Child Support Agency can credit certain payments towards a paying parent’s child support liability. Credit can be given up to a maximum of 30 percent of the ongoing liability provided the balance of child support is paid as it becomes due. This facility is not, however, available to parents whose child support liability has been adjusted to reflect regular or shared care. 9.7 The types of payments that can be credited in this way are listed or “prescribed” by regulation. They are: • childcare costs for the relevant child; • fees charged by a school or preschool for that child; • amounts payable for uniforms and books prescribed by a school or preschool for that child; • fees for essential medical and dental services for that child; • the receiving parent’s share of amounts payable for rent or a security bond for the receiving parent’s home; • the receiving parent’s share of repayments on a loan that financed his or her home; and • costs to the receiving parent of obtaining and running a motor vehicle, including repairs and standing costs. 9.8 Prescribed payments may provide a greater incentive to pay child support as a paying parent may be more comfortable that the payment (or at least part of it) was directly benefiting the child according to the paying parent’s desires for the child’s upbringing. For a payment to be recognised, however, it would clearly need to have both parents’ agreement as parents’ views about expenditure choices may differ. For example, one parent may wish to send their child to a private school and be willing to pay the school fees while the other parent may prefer a state school. 9.9 Any prescribed payment system would not be available if the caregiver was solely receiving a sole parent benefit as the Government is already in effect providing contributions towards the payments as part of that benefit. In these circumstances, the making of prescribed payments by the paying parent would not offset the Government’s costs of providing the benefit as currently occurs. 31 Recognising re-establishment costs through exempting some income 9.10 A paying or receiving parent may take on additional employment or overtime to help re-establish themselves after a separation – for example, to buy an alternative family home. Currently in New Zealand, secondary employment and overtime are automatically included in the formula calculation. 9.11 Incorporating re-establishment costs into the child support formula is likely to create unnecessary uncertainty. Views would be welcome, however, on whether, if both parents income is to be taken into account in calculating a child support liability, re-establishment costs should be made a ground for an administrative review. This is likely to be subject to a parent (either receiving or paying) meeting the following key requirements: • the income was earned in accordance with a pattern that was established after the parents first separated; and • the excluded income is no more than 30 percent of taxable income. Qualifying age of children 9.12 Currently, child support is normally payable until a child reaches the age of 19 years. However, many children are already in higher education at that stage, when the student loan and student allowances schemes are available to provide assistance. There may, therefore, be a case for ceasing child support payments when students leave secondary school rather than when they turn 19 years of age. 9.13 The Government is interested in submissions on whether the qualifying age should be changed so that child support payments automatically end at age 18 unless the child is still in full-time secondary education. In that case, the child would cease to be a qualifying child when he or she left school. Passing on child support payments to the receiving parent (“pass-on”) 9.14 “Pass-on” would require the Government to pass some or all of the child support payment that it currently retains on to a beneficiary recipient. Currently, these amounts are retained by the Government to partially offset the costs of sole-parent and guardian benefits. 9.15 Having regard to the various advantages and disadvantages involved in a pass- on scheme, introducing such a scheme is not considered appropriate at this time. The matter may best be left for later consideration in light of further evidence and analysis on its likely impact.

Article 2 TAXES COVERED 1. This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, as well as taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. 3. The existing taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are in particular: a) in Turkey: i) the income tax ; ii) the corporation tax ; (hereinafter referred to as "Turkish tax"); b) in New Zealand: the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"). 4. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their respective taxation laws. Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: a) i) the term "Turkey" means the Turkish territory including territorial sea and air space above it, as well as the maritime areas over which it has jurisdiction or sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration, exploitation and conservation of natural resources, pursuant to international law; ii) the term "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealandbut does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyondthe territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation andin accordance with international law as an area in which NewZealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to naturalresources;  b) the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean Turkey or New Zealand as the context requires; c) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; d) the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; e) the term "legal head office" means; i) with respect to Turkey, the registered office registered under the Turkish Code of Commerce; ii) with respect to New Zealand, the place of incorporation; f) the term "national", in relation to a Contracting State, means: any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; g) the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; h) the term "competent authority" means: i) in the case of Turkey, the Minister of Finance or a representative authorised by the Minister of Finance; and ii) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; i) the term "international traffic" means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State. 2. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person�s domicile, residence, legal head office, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is aresident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows: the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State inwhich a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanenthome is available to the individual in both States, the individual shallbe deemed to be a resident only of the State with which theindividual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vitalinterests); if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interestscannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to theindividual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be aresident only of the State in which the individual has an habitualabode; if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither ofthem, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Stateof which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. However, where such person has its place of effective management in a Contracting State and its legal head office in the other Contracting State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall determine by mutual agreement the State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be considered to be a resident of either Contracting State for the purposes of enjoying benefits under the Agreement. Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term "permanent establishment" includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; and f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, orsupervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment for more than 183 days in any 12 month period if: a) it carries on activities which consist of the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or b) it operates substantial equipment in that State; (i) for the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources; or (ii) in activities connected with that exploration or exploitation. 5. Where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services, other than the services that are dealt with in Article 14, in the other Contracting State: a) through one or more individuals who are present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and more than 50 per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in that other State through that individual or those individuals, or b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or connected projects through one or more individuals who are performing such services in that other State or are present in that other State for the purpose of performing such services (excluding an individual who performs such services on behalf of another enterprise, unless the first-mentioned enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which such services are performed by the individual), the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person - other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has and habitually exercises in a Contracting State an authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 8. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in aContracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture, forestry or fishing, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed or immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income fromany form of insurance. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Nothwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, amounts paid or payable to an enterprise of a Contracting State for carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are by the first-mentioned State claimed to be profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits, where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in that other State; b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, "jouissance" shares or "jouissance" rights, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as other income subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. Profits derived by a resident of New Zealand through a permanent establishment situated in Turkey may, after having been taxed under Article 7, be taxed on the remaining amount of that profit in Turkey, but the tax so charged shall not exceed: 5 per cent of the remaining amount provided that such profits are exempt from tax in New Zealand; b) 15 per cent of the remaining amount in all other cases. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if it is paid to a bank; b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest in all other cases. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in: a) New Zealand and paid to the Government of Turkey or to the Central Bank of Turkey (T�rkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankas1) shall be exempt from New Zealand tax; b) Turkey and paid to the Government of New Zealand or to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand shall be exempt from Turkish tax. 4. The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personel services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, or the sale of, any copyright (including any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, cinematograph films and recordings for radio and television) any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base, in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment or fixed base then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. Article 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State if such services or activities are performed in that other State and if: the individual has a fixed base regularly available to them in that other State for the purpose of performing those services or activities; or the individual is present in that other State for the purpose of performing those services or activities for a period or periods amounting in the aggregate to 183 days or more in any continuous period of 12 months. In such circumstances, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base or is derived from the services or activities performed during the individual�s presence in that other State, as the case may be, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State if such services or activities are performed in that other State and if: the enterprise has a permanent establishment in that other State through which the services or activities are performed; or the period or periods during which the services or activities are performed exceed in the aggregate 183 days in any continuous period of 12 months. In such circumstances only so much of the income as is attributable to that permanent establishment or to the services or activities performed in that other State, as the case may be, may be taxed in that other State. In either case, the enterprise may elect to be taxed in that other State in respect of such income in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of this Agreement as if the income were attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State. This election shall not affect the right of that other State to impose a withholding tax on such income. 3. The term "professional services" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants and other activities requiring specific professional skill. Article 15 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18, 19 and 20, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the calendar year concerned, and b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and c) the remuneration is not borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remunerationderived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated ininternational traffic by a resident of a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. Article 16 DIRECTORS' FEES Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person�s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Article 17 ARTISTES AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person�s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person�s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. Income derived by an entertainer or a sportsperson from activities exercised in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State, if the visit to that State is supported wholly or mainly by public funds of the other Contracting State, a political subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article 18 PENSIONS 1. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similarremuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of pastemployment shall be taxable only in that State.

Article 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such payments shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: i) is a national of that State; or ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to payments in respect ofservices rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Governmentreferred to in paragraph 1. Article 20 STUDENTS 1. Payments which a student or business apprentice who is a national of a Contracting State and who is present in the other Contracting State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that other State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that other State. 2. Remuneration which a student or a business apprentice who is a national of a Contracting State derives from an employment which that person exercises in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding two years, in order to obtain practical experience related to their education or training shall not be taxed in that other State provided that they were present in that State solely for that purpose. Article 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, notdealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in thatState. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than incomefrom immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient ofsuch income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of aresident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of thisAgreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that otherState. Article 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Double taxation for the residents of Turkey shall be eliminated as follows: a) Subject to the provisions of the laws of Turkey regarding the allowance as a credit against Turkish tax of tax payable in a territory outside Turkey (as they may be amended from time to time without changing the general principles hereof), New Zealand tax payable under the laws of New Zealand and in accordance with this Agreement in respect of income (including profits and chargeable gains) derived by a resident of Turkey from sources within New Zealand shall be allowed as a deduction from the Turkish tax on such income. Such deduction, however, shall not exceed the amount of Turkish tax, as computed before the deduction is made, attributable to such income. b) Where in accordance with any provision of the Agreement income derived by a resident of Turkey is exempt from tax in Turkey, Turkey may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income. 2. Double taxation for the residents of New Zealand shall be eliminated as follows: Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand income tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Turkish tax paid under the laws of Turkey and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Turkey (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. Article 23 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 10, the taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation based on domestic legislation of that other State levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. 3. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements based on domestic legislation of the first mentioned State to which similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State are or may be subjected. 4. If one of the Contracting States considers that taxation measures of the other Contracting State infringe the principles set forth in this Article, the competent authorities shall use the mutual agreement procedure to endeavour to resolve the matter. 5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to its own residents. 6. The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes which are the subject of this Agreement. Article 24 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if that person�s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within five years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Article 25 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 26 ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION OF TAXES 1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article. 2. The term "revenue claim" as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Agreement or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State. 4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. 6. Nothing in paragraph 5 requires a Contracting State to provide assistance for an amount of unpaid tax that becomes uncontested more than 6 years before this Article entered into force in that State or if the request for assistance is first made more than 15 years after the date on which the unpaid tax became uncontested. 7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first- mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. Article 27 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 28 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify to the other, through diplomatic channels, the completion of the procedures required by its domestic law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter of these notifications. 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall have effect: in Turkey, for taxes with respect to every taxable period beginning on or after the first day of January of the year following that of entry into force of the Agreement; b) in New Zealand: i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the January of the year following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force. 3. Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 2, Article 26 shall have effect from the date agreed in a subsequent exchange of notes through diplomatic channels. Article 29 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: a) in Turkey, for taxes with respect to any taxable period beginning on or after the first day of January of the year following that in which the notice of termination is given; b) in New Zealand: i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the January of the year following that in which the notice of termination is given; ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given.

With reference to Article 5 of the Agreement It is agreed that, for the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 5, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 3. With reference to Article 5, paragraph 7 of the Agreement It is agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 5, where a person - other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 of Article 5 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and, a) has no authority, to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise but habitually maintains in a Contracting State a stock of goods or merchandise from which that person regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the enterprise; or b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 of Article 5 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 4. With reference to Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Agreement It is understood that, any right referred to in that paragraph shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. 5. With reference to Article 7, paragraph 3 of the Agreement It is understood that, no such deduction will be allowed in respect of contributions to the expenses and losses of the head office or other permanent establishments situated abroad and, likewise, the amounts paid by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, interest, commissions or other similar payments. 6. With reference to Article 7 of the Agreement It is agreed that, where: a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee(s) of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and b) in relation to that enterprise, that resident would have a permanent establishment in that other State if the resident carried on the business of the enterprise in their own capacity instead of through any trust or trusts, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee(s) shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident's share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 7. With reference to Articles 10 and 11 of the Agreement It is agreed that, the term �dividends� in Article 10, paragraph 3 of the Agreement includes; a) in the case of Turkey, income derived from an investment fund or an investment trust; b) in the case of New Zealand, income in relation to profit-related debentures and substituting debentures as defined in Section FA 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 or any similar provision agreed by the competent authorities of both Contracting States.

With reference to Articles 12 and 13 of the Agreement, It is agreed that, in case of any payment received as a consideration for the sale of the property referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 12, the provisions of Article 13 shall apply, unless the payment in question is not a payment for genuine alienation of the said property. In such case the provisions of Article 12 shall apply. 11. With reference to Article 23 of the Agreement It is agreed that, if New Zealand, after the date of signature of this Agreement, enters into a tax treaty, which includes a Non-Discrimination Article that is in line with the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital, negotiations for a revision of Article 23 of this Agreement shall take place. 12. With reference to Article 24, paragraph 2 of the Agreement It is understood that, with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 24 the taxpayer must in the case of Turkey claim the refund resulting from such mutual agreement within a period of one year after the tax administration has notified the taxpayer of the result of the mutual agreement.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME The Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of New Zealand, desiring to conclude an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 PERSONS COVERED This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. Article 2 TAXES COVERED 1. This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, as well as taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. 3. The existing taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are in particular: a) in Turkey: i) the income tax ; ii) the corporation tax ; (hereinafter referred to as "Turkish tax"); b) in New Zealand: the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"). 4. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their respective taxation laws. Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: a) i) the term "Turkey" means the Turkish territory including territorial sea and air space above it, as well as the maritime areas over which it has jurisdiction or sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration, exploitation and conservation of natural resources, pursuant to international law; ii) the term "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; b) the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean Turkey or New Zealand as the context requires; c) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; d) the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; e) the term "legal head office" means; i) with respect to Turkey, the registered office registered under the Turkish Code of Commerce; ii) with respect to New Zealand, the place of incorporation; f) the term "national", in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; g) the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; h) the term "competent authority" means: i) in the case of Turkey, the Minister of Finance or a representative authorised by the Minister of Finance; and ii) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; i) the term "international traffic" means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State. 2. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person’s domicile, residence, legal head office, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. However, where such person has its place of effective management in a Contracting State and its legal head office in the other Contracting State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall determine by mutual agreement the State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be considered to be a resident of either Contracting State for the purposes of enjoying benefits under the Agreement. Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term "permanent establishment" includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; and f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment for more than 183 days in any 12 month period if: a) it carries on activities which consist of the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or b) it operates substantial equipment in that State; (i) for the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources; or (ii) in activities connected with that exploration or exploitation. 5. Where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services, other than the services that are dealt with in Article 14, in the other Contracting State: a) through one or more individuals who are present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and more than 50 per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in that other State through that individual or those individuals, or b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or connected projects through one or more individuals who are performing such services in that other State or are present in that other State for the purpose of performing such services (excluding an individual who performs such services on behalf of another enterprise, unless the first- mentioned enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which such services are performed by the individual), the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person - other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has and habitually exercises in a Contracting State an authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 8. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture, forestry or fishing, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed or immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Nothwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, amounts paid or payable to an enterprise of a Contracting State for carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are by the first-mentioned State claimed to be profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits, where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company (other than a partnership) which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends; provided that such dividends are exempt from tax in that other State; b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, "jouissance" shares or "jouissance" rights, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as other income subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. Profits derived by a resident of New Zealand through a permanent establishment situated in Turkey may, after having been taxed under Article 7, be taxed on the remaining amount of that profit in Turkey, but the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 per cent of the remaining amount provided that such profits are exempt from tax in New Zealand; b) 15 per cent of the remaining amount in all other cases. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if it is paid to a bank; b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest in all other cases. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in: a) New Zealand and paid to the Government of Turkey or to the Central Bank of Turkey (Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası) shall be exempt from New Zealand tax; b) Turkey and paid to the Government of New Zealand or to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand shall be exempt from Turkish tax. 4. The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personel services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, or the sale of, any copyright (including any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, cinematograph films and recordings for radio and television) any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or fixed base, in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment or fixed base then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. Article 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State if such services or activities are performed in that other State and if: a) the individual has a fixed base regularly available to them in that other State for the purpose of performing those services or activities; or b) the individual is present in that other State for the purpose of performing those services or activities for a period or periods amounting in the aggregate to 183 days or more in any continuous period of 12 months. In such circumstances, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base or is derived from the services or activities performed during the individual’s presence in that other State, as the case may be, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State if such services or activities are performed in that other State and if: a) the enterprise has a permanent establishment in that other State through which the services or activities are performed; or b) the period or periods during which the services or activities are performed exceed in the aggregate 183 days in any continuous period of 12 months. In such circumstances only so much of the income as is attributable to that permanent establishment or to the services or activities performed in that other State, as the case may be, may be taxed in that other State. In either case, the enterprise may elect to be taxed in that other State in respect of such income in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of this Agreement as if the income were attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State. This election shall not affect the right of that other State to impose a withholding tax on such income. 3. The term "professional services" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants and other activities requiring specific professional skill. Article 15 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18, 19 and 20, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the calendar year concerned, and b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and c) the remuneration is not borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson himself but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. Income derived by an entertainer or a sportsperson from activities exercised in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State, if the visit to that State is supported wholly or mainly by public funds of the other Contracting State, a political subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article 18 PENSIONS 1. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State.

The provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Government referred to in paragraph 1. Article 20 STUDENTS 1. Payments which a student or business apprentice who is a national of a Contracting State and who is present in the other Contracting State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that other State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that other State. 2. Remuneration which a student or a business apprentice who is a national of a Contracting State derives from an employment which that person exercises in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding two years, in order to obtain practical experience related to their education or training shall not be taxed in that other State provided that they were present in that State solely for that purpose.

The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. Article 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Double taxation for the residents of Turkey shall be eliminated as follows: a) Subject to the provisions of the laws of Turkey regarding the allowance as a credit against Turkish tax of tax payable in a territory outside Turkey (as they may be amended from time to time without changing the general principles hereof), New Zealand tax payable under the laws of New Zealand and in accordance with this Agreement in respect of income (including profits and chargeable gains) derived by a resident of Turkey from sources within New Zealand shall be allowed as a deduction from the Turkish tax on such income. Such deduction, however, shall not exceed the amount of Turkish tax, as computed before the deduction is made, attributable to such income. b) Where in accordance with any provision of the Agreement income derived by a resident of Turkey is exempt from tax in Turkey, Turkey may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income. 2. Double taxation for the residents of New Zealand shall be eliminated as follows: Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand income tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Turkish tax paid under the laws of Turkey and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Turkey (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. Article 23 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 10, the taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation based on domestic legislation of that other State levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. 3. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements based on domestic legislation of the first mentioned State to which similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State are or may be subjected. 4. If one of the Contracting States considers that taxation measures of the other Contracting State infringe the principles set forth in this Article, the competent authorities shall use the mutual agreement procedure to endeavour to resolve the matter. 5. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to its own residents. 6. The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes which are the subject of this Agreement. Article 24 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if that person’s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within five years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Article 25 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 26 ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION OF TAXES 1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article. 2. The term "revenue claim" as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Agreement or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State. 4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. 6. Nothing in paragraph 5 requires a Contracting State to provide assistance for an amount of unpaid tax that becomes uncontested more than 6 years before this Article entered into force in that State or if the request for assistance is first made more than 15 years after the date on which the unpaid tax became uncontested. 7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first- mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first- mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. Article 27 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 28 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify to the other, through diplomatic channels, the completion of the procedures required by its domestic law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the latter of these notifications. 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall have effect: a) in Turkey, for taxes with respect to every taxable period beginning on or after the first day of January of the year following that of entry into force of the Agreement; b) in New Zealand: i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the January of the year following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force. 3. Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 2, Article 26 shall have effect from the date agreed in a subsequent exchange of notes through diplomatic channels. Article 29 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: a) in Turkey, for taxes with respect to any taxable period beginning on or after the first day of January of the year following that in which the notice of termination is given; b) in New Zealand: i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the January of the year following that in which the notice of termination is given; ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given.

With reference to Article 5 of the Agreement It is agreed that, for the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Article 5, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 3. With reference to Article 5, paragraph 7 of the Agreement It is agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 5, where a person - other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 of Article 5 applies - is acting on behalf of an enterprise and, a) has no authority, to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise but habitually maintains in a Contracting State a stock of goods or merchandise from which that person regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the enterprise; or b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 of Article 5 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 4. With reference to Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Agreement It is understood that, any right referred to in that paragraph shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. 5.

With reference to Articles 12 and 13 of the Agreement, It is agreed that, in case of any payment received as a consideration for the sale of the property referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 12, the provisions of Article 13 shall apply, unless the payment in question is not a payment for genuine alienation of the said property. In such case the provisions of Article 12 shall apply. 11.

As a result, a company’s income and losses would both be passed on to shareholders, so income would be taxed and losses deducted at a shareholder’s marginal tax rate. 1 The purpose of the change is to address a number of problems with the current qualifying company rules which undermine the integrity of the tax system. 1.2 This issues paper seeks comment on the implementation and transition details of moving qualifying companies to flow-through treatment for income tax purposes. Background to the qualifying company rules 1.3 The qualifying company rules were introduced in 1992 after a review of the tax system by the Valabh Committee. 2 In its report on the taxation of distributions from companies, the Valabh Committee recommended the introduction of a new elective regime for closely held New Zealand-resident companies. The regime would treat a qualifying company and its shareholders as one entity for income tax purposes, similar to the tax treatment of partnerships. 1.4 The primary purpose of the qualifying company rules was to remove the tax disincentive faced by the owners of closely held businesses who wish to operate through a company. Attaining the benefits of limited liability afforded by a corporate form meant sole traders and partnerships lost the ability to be taxed at the level of the owner. 1.5 The qualifying company rules have applied from the 1992 –93 income year. Current qualifying company rules 1.6 The qualifying company rules provide shareholders of closely held companies a form of partnership treatment for income tax purposes, while maintaining the corporate protections afforded under general law (such as a separate legal entity status and limited liability). Income is initially assessed at the company level. On election to be a qualifying company, the shareholders agree to be personally liable for their share of the company’s income tax liability that is not met. 1 The term “shareholder” is used in this paper and refers to a person with an interest in a qualifying company, despite the company being treated as a partnership for income tax purposes in order to apply flow-through treatment. 2 Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, appointed in 1989 and chaired by Mr. Arthur Valabh. 2 1.7 Dividends paid out by qualifying companies are taxable only to the extent that imputation credits are available. When a qualifying company has no imputation credits, any dividends paid out are tax-free. As a result, shareholders can have tax-free access to the company’s capital gains without having to wind up the company. 1.8 The LAQC rules are a subset of the qualifying company rules. A company must satisfy additional criteria to be an LAQC. Like qualifying companies, income is also initially taxable at the company level. Unlike qualifying companies, however, an LAQC’s net losses are allocated to shareholders in proportion to their effective interest (generally based on voting interest) in the company. A loss will either be allowed as a deduction from the shareholder’s annual gross income or it will be carried forward. Problems with the current rules 1.9 There are significant problems with the current LAQC rules which result in risks to the tax base. These are discussed in more detail below. Arbitrage opportunities 1.10 The qualifying company and LAQC rules were implemented when the company rate and top individual tax rate were aligned at 33 percent. Since their introduction, a gap has opened up between the top individual tax rate (currently at 38 percent, but at 33 percent from 1 October 2010) and the company rate (currently 30 percent, but reducing to 28 percent from the 2011 /12 income year). Income is initially assessed at the entity level, so profits are taxed at the company rate. With LAQCs, any losses can be allowed as a deduction from a shareholder’s annual gross income, which may be taxed at a higher rate. This disparity creates arbitrage opportunities and tax base integrity pressures. 1.11 The amount of losses that can be deducted from an LAQC shareholder’s other income may not be commensurate with the level of financial risk that the shareholder faces. That is, there are no loss limitation rules equivalent to those for limited partnerships, despite the similarity in economic terms between an LAQC shareholder and a limited partner. LAQC shareholders can deduct losses in excess of their equity in the LAQC. This is subject to the rules limiting deductions for arrangements involving money not at risk (sections GB 45 to GB 48 of the Income Tax Act 2007). While these rules have restricted schemes promoted using LAQCs, they are narrower in scope than the limited partnership loss limitation rules. The absence of comprehensive loss limitation rules is likely to distort efficient decision- making and resource allocation as a result of allowing investors to claim larger tax losses than their true economic losses. 3 Remission income inconsistency 1.12 An inconsistency in the LAQC rules allows shareholders to benefit from allocated losses but to avoid liability for an LAQC’s income tax. Generally, a taxpayer can claim a deduction for an expenditure or loss for income tax purposes when it is incurred, even if payment has not taken place. The Income Tax Act 2007 claws back the unpaid portion of expenditure or losses through the remitted income rules. This does not occur in the case of LAQCs, as the benefit of the loss is enjoyed by the shareholders but the remitted income is derived by the LAQC. 1.13 Remission income arises in the year of remission, rather than in the year in which the deduction was originally claimed. If remission income arises in an income year after the company has revoked its LAQC status, the directors and shareholders are not personally liable for the tax liability of the company, as that only applies for an income year during which the company is an LAQC. As a result, shareholders can claim LAQC losses and then eliminate personal liability for the tax on the remitted income simply by revoking LAQC status before remission income is derived by the company, which may not be able to pay the tax on that income. Structuring around partnership rules 1.14 The 2006 discussion document, General and limited partnerships – proposed tax changes, raised the possibility of LAQCs being used to structure around the limited partnership loss limitation rules. 3 Loss limitation rules restrict the amount of losses that can flow through to a limited partner to the amount of that partner’s investment in the partnership. The loss limitation rules apply only to limited partners (as they have limited liability). 1.15 Currently, LAQCs can be used as partners in a general partnership to allow net tax losses in excess of the equity invested in the partnership to flow through to the individual LAQC shareholders, even though the LAQC vehicle serves to provide limited liability to the shareholders. This structure circumvents the policy intent behind the limited partnership loss limitation rules. 1.16 LAQCs can also be used to circumvent the disposal provisions under the partnership rules while shareholders still receive the benefit of loss flow- through, similar to partners in a partnership. For example, an individual can invest in forestry through an LAQC, receive its losses, and sell the shares in the company for a non-taxable gain, instead of investing in a forestry partnership and being taxed on any gain on disposal of their partnership interest. 3 General and limited partnerships – proposed tax changes, June 2006, p.42. 4 How to make a submission 1.17 Officials invite submissions on the matters raised in this issues paper concerning the implementation details of making qualifying companies flow- through entities for income tax purposes.

Qualifying companies are currently subject to company tax treatment, whereby income is taxable and losses deductible by the company at the company tax rate. In addition, LAQCs are partially transparent entities in which income is retained at the company level but losses can flow through to individual shareholders. Attributed losses are treated as if they were incurred by a shareholder in deriving their income, and so can be offset against the shareholder’s other income or be carried forward to future years. 2.2 With flow-through treatment for income tax purposes, a qualifying company’s income and losses will both be passed on to shareholders. That is, they will not be retained at the company level. Instead, income will be taxed and losses deducted at a shareholder’s marginal tax rate. The company’s tax treatment will be integrated with the tax treatment of the owners, on the basis that entities are agents for their owners. 2.3 Flow-through will be based on the rules currently applying to partnerships and will be primarily achieved by the rules in section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In general, the ordinary partnership tax rules will apply to shareholders of qualifying companies under the new rules. For example, instead of fringe benefit tax (FBT) applying to the provision of a motor vehicle to a shareholder-employee, an apportionment of costs based on private and business use would have to be made, in accordance with existing partnership treatment. Similarly, section DC 4, which allows a deduction for working partner salaries, would be applicable. 2.4 This change will erase the distinction between qualifying companies and LAQCs, as both entities will be transparent. There will be only one classification under the new qualifying company rules. 2.5 Approximating partnership tax treatment will necessitate amending the definition of “company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act to exclude qualifying companies. Without this change, a qualifying company would still be characterised as a company for income tax purposes, so the company’s income and expenses would not flow through to the shareholders but would instead be taxed and deducted at the company level. The definition of “partnership” will be amended to include a qualifying company. Similarly, the definition of “partner” will be amended to include a member of a qualifying company. These will be the primary amendments through which flow-through will be achieved, as qualifying companies will be brought within the scope of subpart HG and, in particular, section HG 2. 6 2.6 As a result of this change, the limited partnership and qualifying company tax rules will be largely aligned, with limited partners and qualifying company shareholders being treated the same for income tax purposes. Both entities will be transparent for income tax purposes while remaining separate legal entities at general law. However, some differences between the regimes, relating to the underlying structure of the entity, will remain. In particular, qualifying company shareholders will be able to take an active role in the management of the company while retaining limited liability, unlike limited partners in a limited partnership who may not participate in the management of the partnership. Tax treatment of closely held entities 2.7 The Tax Review 2001 considered that closely held entities (with five or fewer members) should be taxed on a partnership basis, and widely held entities be taxed on a company basis. 4 Partnership tax treatment recognises the close economic connection between an entity and its members, and ensures that the income of closely held entities are taxed at the marginal tax rate of the ultimate beneficial owner. 2.8 Flow-through treatment for qualifying companies is consistent with this approach. Qualifying companies and their shareholders will be treated as a single economic entity, which is the original rationale for the qualifying company and LAQC rules. Flow-through treatment will more closely integrate the taxation of the company and its shareholders. The role that taxation factors play in the choice of business entity will be reduced, as flow- through qualifying companies and partnerships (general and limited) will be more substitutable. Addressing current concerns 2.9 Flow-through treatment will address concerns with the current rules, in particular, arbitrage opportunities and the risk to tax base integrity, and the use of LAQCs as vehicles for tax avoidance or structuring around the limited partnership loss limitation rules. It will also fix the remission income inconsistency. 2.10 With partnership tax treatment, both the company’s income and losses would be passed on to the shareholders, so income would be taxed and losses deducted at a shareholder’s marginal tax rate. As a result, there would be no arbitrage opportunities due to the difference between company tax and higher personal tax rates – the company tax rate will not apply for qualifying companies. This treatment will therefore improve the integrity and coherence of the tax system. 4 Tax Review 2001, Final Report, October 2001, p.69. 7 2.11 This change will address the potential for LAQCs to be used as partners in general partnerships to structure around the limited partnership loss limitation rules. The proposed loss limitation rules for qualifying companies will prevent excessive losses from flowing through to shareholders via a qualifying company general partner. 2.12 The inconsistency in the LAQC rules that allows shareholders to benefit from allocated losses but to avoid liability for the company’s income tax will be closed by moving to flow-through tax treatment. Shareholders of a qualifying company will not be able to eliminate their liability for the company’s income tax (by revoking LAQC status) as all the company’s income – including deemed remission income – will instead be automatically taxed at the shareholder level. Distributions and dividends 2.13 Applying partnership tax treatment will mean that qualifying companies will no longer, for income tax purposes, pay dividends to shareholders, as no income will be retained by the company under the new rules. Instead, profits and losses will be allocated directly to shareholders without going through the imputation system. This is a natural consequence of flow-through tax treatment. This will allow the current qualifying company rules to be significantly simplified. A number of sections in the Income Tax Act will be able to be removed, including section CW 15 and sections HA 14 to HA 16. 2.14 Similar to the existing limited partnership rules, any amounts earned by a qualifying company will retain their character in the shareholder’s hands. For example, capital gains will retain their character because they will be treated as being earned directly by the shareholder and, therefore, will generally not be subject to tax. 2.15 Qualifying companies will not need or be able to operate an imputation credit account. This will reduce compliance costs for closely held companies. However, if the qualifying company election is revoked or the requirements cease to be met, the qualifying company will revert to being an ordinary company and normal company tax treatment, including the maintenance of an imputation credit account, will apply. 2.16 Distributions to non-residents are currently subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). With flow-through treatment, however, non- resident shareholders of a qualifying company will be allocated their portion of the company’s income and expenditure, and any actual distributions from the qualifying company to non-resident shareholders will not be recognised for NRWT purposes. However, the underlying income may be subject to NRWT. For example, dividends paid by New Zealand-resident companies to a qualifying company will be allocated to the qualifying company’s non- resident shareholders according to their effective interest in the company and subject to NRWT. 8 Removal of current shareholder liability for company’s tax 2.17 The current liability of qualifying company shareholders for a company’s unpaid income tax will be removed. This is a natural consequence of flow- through treatment. Treatment of foreign losses 2.18 Currently, LAQC losses are deductible against a shareholder’s other income, but foreign-sourced controlled foreign company (CFC) and some foreign investment fund (FIF) losses can only be offset against CFC and FIF income. That is, CFC and some FIF losses are ring-fenced. It is therefore possible for shareholders not to be able to receive the benefit of foreign losses if they have no available foreign income to offset the losses against. 2.19 Section HA 25 of the Income Tax Act provides that an LAQC may elect to retain attributed CFC and FIF net losses at the company level instead of passing such losses to shareholders, to facilitate later use of these losses. Any retained losses may be offset against the company’s foreign income in subsequent years. However, flow-through treatment means that losses will not be able to be retained at the company level to be carried forward for future years. Furthermore, there will be no income retained by the company against which the losses can be offset. 2.20 It is therefore proposed to remove section HA 25, which will prevent qualifying companies from electing to retain foreign losses at the company level. Instead, foreign losses will automatically flow-through to shareholders and will be subject to the normal rules for attributed CFC and FIF losses in subpart DN of the Income Tax Act. Shareholder’s effective interest 2.21 The basis for the allocation of a qualifying company’s income tax liability and losses to a shareholder, as well as certain shareholder elections, is the shareholder’s “effective interest” in the company. The meaning of effective interest is set out in section HA 43 of the Income Tax Act. It generally means a shareholder’s voting interest in the company – for example, based on the number of shares held. However, if a market value circumstance exists, a shareholder’s effective interest is the average of their voting interest and market value interest. If a shareholder’s interest changes during an income year, a weighted average is used. 2.22 It is proposed to maintain the same definition of “effective interest”, in sections HA 43 and 44 of the Income Tax Act, under the new qualifying company rules. 9 Anti-streaming rule 2.23 Under the new qualifying company regime, it is proposed that assessable income, exempt income, excluded income, expenditure, capital gains and capital losses will be apportioned by the qualifying company to each shareholder in accordance with each shareholder’s effective interest in the company. Shareholders will derive income and expenses from each source and would then include these amounts in their tax return for the appropriate income year. This anti-streaming rule will be similar to that applying for partnerships in section HG 2(2) of the Income Tax Act, and follows the approach recommended by the Valabh Committee. 2.24 This rule will ensure income or losses from particular sources – for example, foreign-sourced income – cannot be streamed to the shareholder who would benefit the most. Without an anti-streaming rule, certain types of income that are exempt from tax (such as capital gains) could be disproportionately allocated to shareholders on higher marginal tax rates, and taxable income could be allocated to shareholders on lower marginal tax rates in order to reduce the amount of tax payable. Such a rule will help protect the integrity of the tax system, as well as provide certainty in the allocation of income and expenditure. 10 Chapter 3 ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 3.1 There are several criteria that companies must satisfy to become qualifying companies. In particular, a company must be tax-resident for all of the income year, must be closely held (five or fewer shareholders) unless it is a flat-owning company, must meet certain shareholding criteria (a shareholder must be a natural person, another qualifying company, or an eligible trustee), may not be a unit trust, and may not earn more than $10,000 foreign non- dividend income in an income year. 3.2 Because of the potential for abuse of the LAQC rules due to the streaming of losses to shareholders best able to use them, LAQCs must meet additional requirements. First, there must be only one type of share (section HA 10 of the Income Tax Act). All shares must have the same rights concerning, for example, receiving distributions and the appointment of directors. LAQCs must also meet an additional anti-avoidance requirement in section HA 12. Eligibility for new rules 3.3 It is proposed to maintain the current general qualifying company eligibility requirements for the new regime, with some modifications. This recognises that the new qualifying company rules, like the old rules, are designed for closely held New Zealand-resident entities. Keeping mostly the same rules will also minimise compliance costs for businesses. 3.4 Officials propose to remove the requirement in section HA 8B of the Income Tax Act that a qualifying company must not have income interests in a CFC or attributing interests in a FIF that are a direct income interest of 10 percent or more. Similarly, we propose removing section HA 9 which prescribes that a qualifying company may not have more than $10,000 of foreign non- dividend income in any particular income year. Such investment and income restrictions mainly apply because unimputed dividends paid out by qualifying companies are currently exempt in a shareholder’s hands. These restrictions are unnecessary with flow-through tax treatment because qualifying company shareholders will be directly allocated their share of any foreign-sourced income. Elections 3.5 Shareholders and directors are required to elect into the qualifying company regime, as set out in sections HA 5 and HA 28 to HA 37 of the Income Tax Act. Shareholders must also elect to take personal liability, according to their share in the company, for the company’s income tax liability that is not met. 11 3.6 Submissions are sought on whether the current election (and revocation of election) provisions should be retained or amended for the new qualifying company rules, subject to the entry and exit rules; in particular, whether the elections in and out of the rules should operate prospectively only, that is, from the start of the following income year. 3.7 As income will automatically flow through to shareholders, the shareholder election to be personally liable for the company’s income tax, in section HA 8, is redundant and will therefore be removed. One class of share requirement 3.8 The Valabh Committee in its final report considered that, if the flow-through of losses was extended to income as well, the one share requirement would be necessary. Officials propose that the current one share requirement for LAQCs should be included as a general requirement for qualifying companies under the new rules. 3.9 The one share requirement would help ensure that the allocation of income and losses to shareholders is as simple as possible. This is necessary to avoid complex allocation rules for income and losses under different classes of shares. However, it would increase the number of requirements that companies would need to meet to become qualifying companies. By comparison, limited partnerships do not have a similar eligibility requirement. This requirement may have implications for existing qualifying companies (not also being LAQCs) which currently have more than one class of share. In order to transition into the new qualifying company rules, such qualifying companies would need to have only one class of share – for example, by amending the company’s constitution – before 1 April 2011. 3.10 Maintaining this requirement would reduce the ability for income and losses to be streamed to particular shareholders, as each share must have the same allocation of income and losses as every other share. The proposed anti- streaming rule would provide similar protection against streaming. 12 Chapter 4 DISPOSAL EVENTS 4.1 With flow-through tax treatment, a shareholder of a qualifying company would be treated as carrying on the activities of the company, and having the status, intention and purpose of the company. A shareholder would also be treated as holding the property that a qualifying company holds. This is the same approach as under the existing partnership rules. 4.2 The following events would result in qualifying company shareholders being treated as disposing of their interest in the qualifying company, with resultant tax consequences: • a shareholder disposes of their shares in a qualifying company; • a qualifying company ceasing to meet or electing out of the qualifying company rules; and • the liquidation of a qualifying company. Disposal of shareholder interest in a qualifying company 4.3 If a shareholder disposes of their interest in a qualifying company, they would, under the new rules, be treated as disposing of their share of the underlying company property, including any revenue account property, and would bear any tax consequences associated with the disposal. This is a natural consequence of flow-through treatment applying. However, it could result in significant compliance costs for qualifying companies and their shareholders. 4.4 Sections HG 5 to HG 10 of the Income Tax Act are special disposal provisions designed to reduce compliance costs for partners and partnerships. It is proposed to apply the same rules for qualifying companies to reduce the tax consequences of a deemed disposal of shareholder interests. 4.5 The application of these rules to qualifying companies would remove the requirement for an exiting shareholder to account for tax when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds. A shareholder will be required to account for tax on disposing of their interest in a qualifying company only if the value of the proceeds from the disposal exceeds the total net tax book value of their share of company property by more than $50,000. However, if the $50,000 threshold in section HG 5 is exceeded, an exiting shareholder would not need to account for tax in certain circumstances. These exclusions would be the same as for partnerships and are contained in sections HG 5 to HG 10 of the Income Tax Act. 13 Qualifying company status ending 4.6 If a company revokes its election into the qualifying company regime or fails to meet the eligibility requirements, flow-through treatment would cease to apply and the company would be subject to normal company taxation rules generally from the start of that income year. Companies who elect out of the qualifying company regime could choose for this to apply from the start of a subsequent income year. 4.7 When a company ceases to be a qualifying company, there would be a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the company’s assets at their market value on that date. This would give rise to tax consequences for the shareholders, who would be treated as disposing of their share of the qualifying company’s property. For example, shareholders would be liable to tax on any gain from revenue account property. The company (which has lost its qualifying company status) would be treated as having acquired the property at its market value. The company’s available subscribed capital would be based on any capital contributed by the shareholders under the Companies Act 1993. To ensure that double taxation does not arise on eventual distribution, the portion of shareholder funds that represents undistributed reserves of a revenue nature will be treated as a capital gain amount. Disposal on liquidation 4.8 On liquidation of a qualifying company, the disposal provisions in section HG 4 would apply. A shareholder of a qualifying company would be treated as disposing of and reacquiring all their interests in the company at market value. This would give rise to tax consequences – for example, for property held on revenue account. Thus, the tax treatment of a qualifying company on liquidation and a partnership on final dissolution will be aligned. 14 Chapter 5 LIMITATION OF SHAREHOLDER TAX LOSSES 5.1 The limited partnership rules contain loss limitation rules which prevent the flow-through of losses in any income year to limited partners in excess of the actual investment of the limited partner. A limited partner’s tax loss is restricted if the amount of the loss exceeds the carrying tax value of that partner’s investment. Disallowed losses in any year may be carried forward to future years. 5.2 This rule applies only to limited partners because they are not exposed to any risk of loss greater than the amount of their investment in the limited partnership. In contrast, general partners have unlimited liability and therefore exposure to the risk of loss. 5.3 Currently, the flow-through of LAQC losses to shareholders is subject to “at risk” rules in sections GB 45 to GB 48 and section HA 27 of the Income Tax Act. However, these rules do not prevent the flow-through of losses in excess of a shareholder’s equity in the LAQC, which is the treatment under the limited partnership loss limitation rules. Proposed loss limitation rules 5.4 As no loss limitation rules similar to those for limited partnerships apply in the current LAQC regime, an LAQC shareholder can deduct losses in excess of their equity in the LAQC. The amount of losses may not be commensurate with the level of financial risk that the shareholder faces. Therefore, officials propose implementing loss limitation rules for the new qualifying company regime, similar to the rules applying to limited partnerships. These rules would allow shareholders to offset, for tax purposes, net tax losses only to the extent of the shareholder’s investment in the qualifying company. 5.5 If the allocated losses exceed the value of the shareholder’s investment in the qualifying company for tax purposes, the excess losses may be carried forward by the shareholder until, for example, the shareholder’s investment in the company increases. The basis for measuring a shareholder’s investment in a qualifying company is discussed later in this chapter. 5.6 Tax losses of a qualifying company will be allocated to shareholders and treated as those of the shareholders themselves. Therefore, losses may be offset without any special restrictions against other income, just as if the losses had been the shareholder’s directly. 15 Policy rationale 5.7 The rationale behind restricting a shareholder’s tax losses in any given year is to ensure that the tax losses claimed reflect the actual level of that shareholder’s economic loss. 5.8 Shareholders have limited liability in relation to their interest in the qualifying company, so do not have exposure to losses greater than the amount of their investment in any year. As shareholders cannot lose more than the amount of their investment, it is not appropriate for shareholders to take a deduction for a greater amount. Therefore, it is the correct policy result to allow shareholders to offset, for tax purposes, only those tax losses they have exposure to. 5.9 In the absence of such rules, qualifying companies would provide opportunities for taxpayers to receive tax deductions in excess of the expenditure they personally have at risk in the qualifying company. The absence of such rules may therefore distort efficient decision-making and efficient resource allocation, by encouraging investors to enter arrangements or schemes whereby small amounts of capital are invested to get access to larger net tax losses. This could result in abuse of the new qualifying company rules and in actions that are contrary to their intent. 5.10 It is international practice to limit the flow-through of losses of a transparent entity to its members where their liability is limited. This occurs, for example, in the United States and Australia (such as for venture capital limited partnerships). Membership basis 5.11 A shareholder of a qualifying company will only be able to offset allocated losses to the extent of their investment in the company. To measure a shareholder’s level of investment in the company, officials propose to adopt a qualifying company membership basis similar to the “partner’s basis” in section HG 11 which applies for limited partners. This would include the share of any debt guaranteed by the shareholder. 5.12 If a tax loss exceeds a shareholder’s basis because the shareholder has insufficient equity in the qualifying company, the tax loss would not be included in the shareholder’s annual total deduction. In other words, it cannot be offset against the shareholder’s other income. Instead, it can be carried forward by the shareholder to use in a future year if the shareholder has sufficient basis in the qualifying company to offset the loss. 16 Anti-avoidance 5.13 Section HG 11(9) of the Income Tax Act provides that any investment into a partnership within 60 days of the end of the year which is subsequently reduced within 60 days after the year end will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating a shareholder’s membership basis. This is an anti- avoidance rule that prevents an artificially high basis around the end of the income year, in order to increase the flow-through of losses. Officials propose a similar anti-avoidance rule for the new qualifying company rules. Example of loss limitation John and Colleen jointly own a company and elect into the new qualifying company rules with application from 1 April 2011. John owns 75 percent of the shares. The total equity investment in the company is $100,000. The company earns gross income of $20,000 during the year and distributes $10,000 to John and Colleen in proportion to their interest in the company. John’s share of the equity investment is therefore $75,000 (75 percent of $100,000). He has a 75 percent share of the company’s income and distributions, which equal $15,000 and $7,500 respectively. John’s membership basis in the qualifying company is calculated as follows: Original investment $75,000 Income $15,000 Distributions ($7,500) Deductions taken in previous years ($0) Disallowed amounts ($0) John’s membership basis in the qualifying company is therefore $82,500. In the 2012/13 income year, the qualifying company makes a loss of $120,000. John’s share of the tax loss is $90,000 (75 percent of $120,000). The proposed loss limitation rules, which will limit the amount of losses allowed as a deduction to the amount of the shareholder’s membership basis, are applied to John as follows: Membership basis $82,500 Allocated losses ($90,000) Allowable tax loss ($82,500) Therefore, John is allowed a tax loss of $82,500, which can be deducted from his other income. The proposed loss limitation rules mean that John is disallowed a tax loss to the value of $7,500 ($90,000 less $82,500). This loss cannot be included in his annual tax calculation for the 2012/13 income year as a deduction, and so cannot be offset against his other income. The disallowed loss can, however, be carried forward by John and used in a subsequent year if John’s membership basis in the qualifying company is sufficient. (The allowable tax loss taken as a deduction in the 2012/13 income year will reduce John’s membership basis for later income years by that amount.) 17 Chapter 6 ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE Tax returns 6.1 Section 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the return filing obligations of partnerships and partners. Partners are required to complete a joint income return for the partnership income and expenditure, and separate individual returns which include amounts allocated to the partner as a member of the partnership. Officials propose to follow a similar approach for qualifying companies. 6.2 A qualifying company under the new rules would not file a company tax return (IR4). This is because a qualifying company’s income and losses would not be retained at the company level but would be passed through to shareholders. Unlike ordinary companies, therefore, qualifying companies would have no tax payable and, for example, no imputation credit account to maintain. Instead, a qualifying company would be required, under section 42, to complete a partnership income tax return (IR7) which is appropriate for flow-through taxation. An IR7 form will include the details of each shareholder and the amounts allocated to each for the relevant income year. A qualifying company would still use the same “tax file number” (IRD number) while using an IR7 form, and would be treated as an entity for return filing purposes even though it is not assessed for tax. 6.3 Individual shareholders of a qualifying company would be required to separately include any allocated income and expenses from the qualifying company in their individual income tax return (IR3) for an income year. 6.4 A qualifying company (A) which is a shareholder in another qualifying company (B) would be allocated income and expenditure from company B in proportion to its effective interest. Both qualifying companies would need to file an IR7 return. Income allocated from company B to company A would subsequently flow through to company A’s shareholders, along with company A’s other income. 6.5 Trustee shareholders of qualifying companies would need to include any allocated income and expenditure from the qualifying company in their IR6 return. Information requirements and record-keeping 6.6 The Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 amended section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendment clarified that it is the partnership, rather than each partner in the partnership, that must maintain records. 18 6.7 It is not necessary for both shareholders and the qualifying company to keep business records. Therefore, it is proposed that shareholders of a qualifying company will not be required to retain any records if the company retains the necessary records under section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is consistent with the record-keeping requirements for partners and partnerships. This is an example of a qualifying company being treated as an entity despite the general look-through rule in section HG 2. The existence of such exceptions is recognised by the section HG 2 wording of “unless the context requires otherwise”. 6.8 A qualifying company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 will continue to be subject to the general regulatory requirements under the Companies Act and the Financial Reporting Act 1993 – for example, the requirement to file annual returns with the Companies Office. 19 Chapter 7 OTHER MATTERS Qualifying company and shareholder are associated persons 7.1 Section YB 12 of the Income Tax Act treats a partnership and a partner in the partnership as associated persons. However, an exception exists for limited partners. A limited partnership and a limited partner in the partnership are associated persons only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more. 7.2 An ordinary company and a shareholder are associated persons if the shareholder has a voting interest of 25 percent or more in the company. This is consistent with the associated person rules for limited partnerships. 7.3 As a result of qualifying companies being treated as a partnership and their shareholders as partners for income tax purposes, section YB 12 would apply. Consequently, a qualifying company and its shareholders would always be treated as associated persons, regardless of whether the shareholder has an interest in the qualifying company of 25 percent or more. Even though the new qualifying company rules will be mainly based on the limited partnership rules, the application of section YB 12 is appropriate because a qualifying company is a closely held entity with the shareholders typically managing the company, which is not the case with limited partners. 7.4 For the disposal of film property, section DS 4(5) provides that an LAQC and an LAQC shareholder are associated persons. The removal of the LAQC regime and application of section YB 12 to qualifying companies and their shareholders will supersede section DS 4(5), which will be removed. Anti-avoidance provisions 7.5 There are currently a number of specific anti-avoidance provisions relating to qualifying companies – in particular, those in sections GB 6 and HA 12 of the Income Tax Act. 7.6 Section GB 6 applies when a company share has been subject to an arrangement whose purpose is to defeat the intent and application of the qualifying company rules, and when this arrangement allows a company to enter into the qualifying company rules. In such cases, the company is treated as not being a qualifying company. Section HA 12 provides that an LAQC is considered to be not eligible to be an LAQC if a share in the company has been part of an arrangement whose purpose is to defeat the intent and application of the qualifying company rules. 20 7.7 Officials consider that the general anti-avoidance provision in section BG 1 should be sufficient to cater for the situations that sections GB 6 and HA 12 are intended to address. Therefore, it is proposed to remove these specific anti-avoidance provisions as part of this reform. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 7.8 Under the Income Tax Act, qualifying companies under the new rules will be treated as companies for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and the company would be the taxable person rather than the shareholders. 21 Chapter 8 TRANSITION 8.1 Existing qualifying companies which continue to meet the eligibility requirements will automatically transition into the new rules, and may not remain under the current rules. 8.2 If an existing qualifying company revokes its election into the qualifying company rules, ordinary company tax treatment will apply from the start of the income year in which the revocation notice is received by Inland Revenue, unless a later income year is nominated. 8.3 The flow-through tax treatment will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011. Qualifying companies with early balance dates will continue operating under the current rules until the start of their next income year after 1 April 2011. Tax consequences of transition 8.4 There will be no deemed disposal and reacquisition of an existing qualifying company’s assets when it transitions into the new qualifying company rules, in order to reduce the tax compliance costs of transition. 8.5 It is proposed that shareholders of qualifying companies that transition into the new treatment will need to determine their initial membership basis. The limited partnership rules have two methods for determining this, a market value method and an historical method. Similar methods may be appropriate for determining the initial membership basis for a transitioning qualifying company. Existing carried-forward losses 8.6 When a company elects into the qualifying company rules, any loss balances which arose in the income years during which the company was not a qualifying company are forfeited. This includes attributed CFC losses and FIF losses. It is proposed to maintain this treatment under the new qualifying company rules. 8.7 Officials propose that any loss balances accumulated by an existing qualifying company (not also being an LAQC) will be allocated, under the new rules, to shareholders in the qualifying company based on their effective interest. These losses will only be allowed to be offset against the shareholder’s income from that qualifying company. 22 Imputation credit account 8.8 A qualifying company under the new rules will not be able to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) or other memorandum account. Any existing credits in an ICA or other memorandum account would be extinguished on the qualifying company’s transition into the new rules. This is appropriate because, under the partnership model, there will be no separate taxable distribution from a qualifying company to its shareholders. Qualifying company election tax 8.9 Under the current qualifying company rules, dividends paid by a qualifying company to its shareholders either have imputation credits and/or dividend withholding payment credits attached or are exempt from tax to the extent that the dividends are unimputed. Thus, it is necessary to tax the company’s reserves at the time of entry into the qualifying company rules, as once the company is a qualifying company those reserves will subsequently be able to be distributed tax-free to the extent that dividends are unimputed. 8.10 The tax on these reserves is referred to as the qualifying company election tax (QCET), and is payable at the company tax rate. It is levied on an amount that is broadly equivalent to the amount which would be taxable if the company were to wind up. QCET prevents taxable reserves within a company being rendered exempt simply by electing into the qualifying company rules. 8.11 Under the new qualifying company rules, a company’s reserves would be treated as being held by a shareholder in proportion to each shareholder’s effective interest. The qualifying company would be treated as not holding the reserves. This will be achieved through the flow-through mechanisms in section HG 2 of the Income Tax Act. 8.12 A company’s retained earnings that have not been subject to tax (that is, which are unimputed) will be attributable directly to shareholders when the company becomes a qualifying company. Therefore, there would be no taxable distribution when the company makes an actual distribution to its shareholders. Such amounts could still be distributed tax-free to shareholders. It is necessary, therefore, to retain a form of QCET to cater for situations when an ordinary company enters the qualifying company rules, to ensure unimputed retained earnings are taxed. 8.13 Owing to flow-through treatment, the qualifying company itself will not retain any reserves or be able to pay QCET on those reserves. It is proposed to amend the QCET rules in sections HA 40 to 42 of the Income Tax Act to make shareholders separately liable for QCET based on their share of the company’s reserves when the company enters the qualifying company rules. A shareholder’s portion of the company’s reserves will be determined by their effective interest in the qualifying company. The values on which QCET is calculated will be reflected in the tax cost of revenue account property under the new qualifying company rules. 23 8.14 To determine a shareholder’s personal liability for QCET, the current formula in section HA 41 will be adapted. QCET will be calculated on the company’s reserves (which are allocated to shareholders) but will be paid by each shareholder at their tax rate in proportion to their effective interest in the company. This could be achieved by including the amount calculated before tax in each shareholder’s return which, therefore, will be subject to ordinary income tax.

Tax systems must allow these disputes to be efficiently resolved and a regular review of the resolution mechanism is therefore necessary. 1.2 The way Inland Revenue conducts its disputes process results from the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (the Richardson Committee). 1 The recommendations of the Richardson Committee were subject to a post-implementation review, the key aspects of which were included in the 2003 Government discussion document, Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review. 2 This issues paper follows these previous reviews to focus on some remaining areas of concern for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 1.3 This document does not propose major changes to the existing disputes process. Instead, it: • outlines administrative changes currently being implemented by Inland Revenue that are designed to help the process work more efficiently for all concerned; and • suggests a limited number of legislative changes to remedy areas that are not working in a way that reflects the policy objectives of the process, or to complement and give effect to the revised administrative practices. 1.4 Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references in this document are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). Policy objectives of the disputes process 1.5 The policy objectives of the disputes process remain the same as those set out in the 2003 discussion document (p1), which stated that: The objective of the legislative disputes process is to ensure that an assessment is as correct as is practicable and to deal with any disputes over tax liability fairly, efficiently and quickly. The disputes process is designed to achieve these objectives by ensuring a high level of disclosure of relevant information and discussion between the parties, which encourages them to place “all cards on the table”. The procedures require time and effort to be put into all cases early in the process before an assessment which would alter a position in a taxpayer’s return is issued. 1 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994, Chapter 10. 2 Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review, a government discussion document first published in July 2003. 2 The overall objectives of the process have, therefore, been to improve the quality and timeliness of assessments and reduce the likelihood and grounds for litigation. Context of this review 1.6 In August 2008 the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) and the New Zealand Law Society sent a joint submission to the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue summarising their members’ concerns about the disputes process. While the submission acknowledged that the underlying principles set out by the Richardson Committee were sound, they highlighted the following matters as causing some remaining concern: • The quality of Inland Revenue disputes documentation is variable, especially notices of proposed adjustment (NOPAs) issued by the Commissioner. • The conference phase in particular does not encourage full and open communication. • There is no unilateral right for taxpayers to opt out of the disputes process. • The evidence exclusion rule, which is designed to prevent “trial by ambush”, can result in high compliance and administration costs in an effort to include every conceivable argument and piece of evidence in the statement of position (SOP). • There is no timeframe within which the Commissioner must issue a SOP, other than within the general time-bar for amending assessments. • What constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” is too narrowly defined. • The current mechanisms for dealing with small claims are inadequate, resulting in taxpayers abandoning legitimate disputes. • The procedure for test cases is inadequate. 1.7 This issues paper examines these concerns and discusses some possible options for resolving them. It also discusses a number of remedial matters that logically fall within the ambit of this review. Approach to this review 1.8 The disputes process is, and should continue to be, about how the process operates in practice. While some legislative provisions are required for any disputes process, these should simply provide a framework for the administrative process, rather than rules that the administrative process has to shape itself around. 3 1.9 As noted by the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission, the legislation surrounding the disputes process appears to be broadly adequate. Substantial changes to the legislation have the potential to result in numerous disputes to test the boundaries of the changes, rather than focussing the parties on the substantial issues at hand. We note the current rules have themselves been heavily litigated since their introduction. 1.10 While there may be a small number of inconsistencies between practice and policy, these matters should continue to be tackled through administrative change and guidelines wherever possible, rather than through legislation. The majority of the issues in question can be adequately dealt with through published standard practice statements and internal procedures that will ensure greater clarity and consistency for taxpayers and still meet the over- riding policy objectives of the disputes process. Summary of suggested options The main options covered in this paper are: • Whether taxpayers should have a unilateral right to opt out of the disputes process (Chapter 3). • Whether the current evidence exclusion rule is working as intended (Chapter 4). • Whether the Commissioner should be subject to more prescribed timeframes in the disputes process (Chapter 5). • What the scope of the “disputable decision” definition in relation to certain specific decisions of the Commissioner should be (Chapter 6). • Whether the “exceptional circumstances” definition is too narrow (Chapter 7). • Whether the disputes system deals adequately with smaller tax disputes (Chapter 8). • Whether there should be changes to the way test cases are designated (Chapter 9). 1.11 Simultaneously with the release of this issues paper, Inland Revenue has released revised standard practice statements (SPSs) related to the disputes process for public consultation. The revised SPSs document changes to the current standard practice in the following key areas (which are also discussed in more detail in Chapter 2): • preparation of the Commissioner’s NOPA; • conduct of a conference; • conference facilitation; and • opting out of the disputes resolution process. 4 1.12 We believe that these revised SPSs will greatly facilitate a swifter and more accessible dispute resolution process and will address many of the concerns raised by NZICA and the NZ Law Society. This paper is prepared on the understanding that the revised SPSs will take effect broadly in the manner set out in Chapter 2. 1.13 The legislative changes suggested in this paper include: • A limitation of the evidence exclusion rule to the “issues” and “propositions of law” raised by the parties in their SOPs. • Amendments to the definition of “exceptional circumstances” to include a separate test based on a taxpayer’s “intention to dispute”, and for the Commissioner’s decision on such matters to be “disputable”. • The removal of certain matters from being “disputable decisions”. • The repeal of the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority. • Amending the test case procedure either to allow for the designation of test cases to be decided by the High Court or for existing court rules to perform a similar function. • Other remedial matters. How to make a submission 1.14 Submissions on either or both this paper and the revised SPSs should be made by 20 August 2010 and can be addressed to: Disputes Project C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.15 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Disputes Project” in the subject line. 1.16 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact those making submissions and to discuss their submission, if required. 1.17 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Accordingly, those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 5 Chapter 2 ADMINISTERING THE DISPUTES PROCESS 2.1 The current disputes process involves the following sequence of events: • A notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) is issued by either the Commissioner or taxpayer to the other advising that an adjustment is sought to the taxpayer's assessment, the Commissioner's assessment or a disputable decision. • A notice of response (NOR) is issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it. • A disclosure notice is issued by the Commissioner. • A statement of position (SOP) is issued by both parties, providing an outline of the issues, facts, evidence and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the position taken. 2.2 There are also two administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been resolved after the NOR phase, a conference will generally be held to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. If the dispute remains unresolved after the SOP phase, the Commissioner will usually refer the dispute to the Adjudication Unit, which is the final process before any amendment to the taxpayer's assessment. 2.3 The full disputes process is set out in the Annex to this paper. 2.4 The efficient resolution of disputes is dependent on how Inland Revenue administers the dispute. Legislation should therefore be sufficiently flexible to allow for a best-practice approach for dealing with this. It is for this reason that the very important steps of the conference phase and the adjudication process are not legislated for. 2.5 Administrative guidelines are a way of effecting good practice; they have the advantage of flexibility, in that they can be relatively easily amended as necessary, while giving taxpayers a degree of certainty about how their dispute will be handled. 2.6 The Commissioner’s current SPSs in relation to the disputes process are SPS 08/01: Disputes Resolution Process Commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and SPS 08/02: Disputes Resolution Process Commenced by a Taxpayer. 3 The Commissioner has now released the revised SPSs for consultation. This paper is drafted on the assumption that the key changes contained in the revised SPSs will be adopted into practice once the current consultation process is completed. If any of the changes discussed below undergo material change during this consultation process, some of the conclusions in this paper may need to be revised accordingly. 3 Both SPS are contained in TIB Volume 20, No. 6, July 2008. 6 2.7 The motivation for changes contained in the revised SPSs is to specifically address some of the key concerns raised in the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission outlined in Chapter 1. For the purposes of this paper, the most important changes contemplated by the revised SPSs are in the following areas: • preparation of the Commissioner’s NOPA; • facilitation of a conference; • conduct of a conference; and • providing guidelines on when the Commissioner would be prepared to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) (the opt- out guidelines). 2.8 The full text of the revised SPSs can be found at the Policy Advice Division website (http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz ). This chapter outlines the content and objectives of the major changes proposed by the revised SPSs. Preparation of the Commissioner’s NOPA 2.9 A common complaint is that Inland Revenue can “burn off” taxpayers (that is, discourage them from proceeding with the dispute) by issuing a long and complicated NOPA for relatively small disputes. Such NOPAs may increase compliance costs because taxpayers feel forced to issue a lengthy NOR in response. 2.10 The revised SPS (for Commissioner-initiated disputes) is intended to improve the process for NOPAs prepared by the Commissioner in the following ways: • by issuing a NOPA only after a completed investigation; • by taking a coordinated approach within Inland Revenue to NOPA drafting, to enhance the quality of the NOPA and to ensure that all aspects of it are fully considered before it is issued; • by the prompt issue of a NOPA when a taxpayer and Inland Revenue reach the stage where they “agree to disagree”; • by ensuring the size of the NOPA is proportionate to the dispute, including guidelines on the maximum NOPA length; and • by ensuring the NOPA concentrates on the main legal arguments that support the Commissioner’s position, with alternative grounds and arguments kept to a minimum. 2.11 It is anticipated that these proposed changes will reduce any “burn-off”. The revised SPSs should provide greater certainty and consistency in Inland Revenue’s approach to taxpayers and to better ensure that only arguments with a good prospect of success are pursued. 7 Facilitation and conduct at a conference 2.12 A conference between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue following the issue of a NOR is seen as a vital part of the disputes process. It is a chance for the parties to the dispute to exchange any information that should have been disclosed and resolves differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments. 2.13 In their joint submission, NZICA and the NZ Law Society considered that the conference should be an independent forum that benefits both parties. The revised SPSs propose that conferences should, at the option of the taxpayer, be attended by a “facilitator”. The facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who has not been involved in the dispute. 2.14 The facilitator would not be authorised to settle a dispute. Instead, they would assist in focussing the parties on the relevant facts and technical issues, explore options and ensure that all information that should have been disclosed is exchanged at the earliest possible opportunity. The facilitator will have the ability to determine that the conference phase is at an end. 2.15 The revised SPSs also set out a basic set of ground rules for the meeting. This includes agreeing to and adhering to, wherever possible, an agenda and timeframe. It also outlines how the facilitator (or, if there is no facilitator, the parties) would manage any meetings and how the conference phase is concluded. 2.16 These proposed operational changes should make the conference more meaningful for the taxpayer. If final resolution is not possible, the approach should better enable the parties to focus on agreed points of difference. Opt-out guidelines 2.17 The opt-out guidelines apply for disputes initiated by the Commissioner and set out the circumstances in which the Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out of the disputes process. So as not to undermine the “all cards on the table” objective, one prerequisite to the Commissioner agreeing to opt-out is that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully in the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute. Provided this has taken place, the Commissioner will agree to opt-out when any one of the following features is present: • the “core tax” in dispute is $75,000 or less (except when it is part of a larger dispute); • the dispute turns on the facts; • the dispute concerns issues that are about to be considered by the courts; or 8 • the dispute has facts and issues that are materially similar to a previous dispute between the Commissioner and another taxpayer and that dispute has been decided in favour of the Commissioner by the Adjudication Unit, so that the Commissioner is unlikely to change his view on the relevant matters. 2.18 The Commissioner retains the discretion to agree to opt out in circumstances outside of those described above. 9 Chapter 3 OPTING OUT OF THE DISPUTES PROCESS This chapter outlines the arguments for and against a right for taxpayers to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process. It notes that the proposed opt-out guidelines should give a considerably larger number of taxpayers the ability not to follow the full disputes process. While the chapter does not recommend a unilateral opt-out, it considers what legislation for a unilateral opt-out may look like if it were ultimately concluded that this was desirable. Consistently with this conclusion, it recommends removing the existing taxpayer right of unilateral opt-out (which exists for taxpayer-initiated disputes). 3.1 Barring a limited number of exceptions, the full disputes process is intended to be followed so that the various steps can fulfil their role of ensuring disclosure by the parties of the facts and arguments and, therefore, possible resolution of the dispute before it goes to court. Applying the full process generally means that the dispute has been considered by the Adjudication Unit. 3.2 The Richardson Committee also saw the disputes process being complied with in full as an important element in ensuring that any amended assessment was “right first time”. Unilateral opt-out provision 3.3 One of the suggestions raised in the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission is that taxpayers, following the NOPA and the NOR, should have a unilateral right to opt out of the disputes process by electing that the matter go straight to a hearing authority. Some examples of when a right of unilateral opt-out would be justified have been suggested: • when the claim is “small”; • when the point at issue is the subject of an Inland Revenue dispute that is being litigated with another taxpayer; and • when the same taxpayer is in more than one dispute in relation to the same issue (for example, when the same position has been adopted across more than one tax period). 10 3.4 The submission alternatively suggests that taxpayers have a right equal to the Commissioner’s right to apply to the Court for an order that the completion of the disputes process is not required. 4 3.5 The proposals in the submission contained the following arguments: • Given that the adjudication process is largely for the benefit of the taxpayer, they should not be compelled to participate in it if they don’t perceive any benefits from doing so. • Proceeding straight to a hearing authority may (if the dispute is likely to end up there anyway) result in the dispute being resolved faster, lessening taxpayer exposure to shortfall penalties and use-of-money interest (UOMI) in the event of an unfavourable outcome. 3.6 Given the resource constraints placed on the courts, it could, however, be argued that it is best to keep all disputes out of court that do not logically belong there. While appreciating that there will always be differences of opinion over whether a particular dispute belongs in court, less tax litigation is highly desirable in reducing the time and costs for all parties. Specifically, resolutions that take place outside of traditional litigation (generally referred to as “alternative dispute resolution”) tend to have the following advantages in: • reducing filings; • encouraging settlement; • reducing both hearing-related as well as case preparation costs by narrowing the issues that require judicial consideration; and • developing sustainable solutions that are less likely to be subject to repeated re-litigation. 5 3.7 These objectives are similar to those established by the Richardson Committee. Given the weight of the arguments, there are two further questions: • Is it necessary to have a unilateral opt-out? • Would a unilateral opt-out improve the current system? Is unilateral opt-out necessary? 3.8 Taxpayers have, since 2005, had the option to seek the opt-out agreement provided for in section 89N(1)(c)(viii). As discussed in the previous chapter, it is anticipated that the administration of this opt-out would be greatly assisted by the proposed new opt-out guidelines. 4 The Commissioner’s ability to apply for such an order is contained in section 89N(3). 5 Ministry of Justice website: http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/a/alternative-dispute- resolution-general-civil-cases/6-adr-and-the-courts-system/?searchterm=reducing%20court. 11 3.9 These guidelines (set out in the revised SPS for Commissioner-initiated disputes) will provide taxpayers with a degree of certainty on whether their dispute will be required to go through the full disputes process. The proposed $75,000 core tax threshold means that for many taxpayers the opt- out process will in effect be available. As we have noted, the other criteria, such as the issue being one of fact, similar cases being in front of the courts and the Commissioner’s discretion to agree to opt-out in other cases, will make the opt-out process more broadly available. 3.10 Under the terms of the opt-out guidelines, it is therefore likely that there will be a considerable number of disputes that proceed directly to a hearing authority following a conference. This will result in a much less compelling case for a unilateral opt-out. Would a unilateral opt-out be an improvement to the current system? 3.11 Given the increase in the number of disputes that are likely to be eligible for bilateral opt-out, the question is whether a unilateral opt-out would be an improvement to the process for the remainder of tax disputes. 3.12 The role of the Adjudication Unit becomes more prominent in larger disputes: taxpayers are likely to be more willing to bear the costs in the event of the Adjudication Unit finding in their favour, and both parties are likely to welcome the opportunity of a review being undertaken by technically skilled staff not previously involved in the dispute. 3.13 The contents of the revised SPSs regarding the preparation of disputes documents and conduct at the conference phase are designed to ensure that disputes are focussed and, where possible, resolved during the administrative phases of the process – rather than resorting to the courts. The adjudication process is a further step in the process at which resolution can occur. Legislating for the opt-out 3.14 Granting taxpayers a unilateral opt-out right raises the question of where in the disputes process the opt-out right should be available. The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission appears to suggest that for small claims, the right should exist at any stage and for all other cases, the right should exist after the exchange of the NOPA and NOR (presumably irrespective of whether the dispute is taxpayer- or Commissioner-initiated). 3.15 Even if the right applied after the exchange of the NOPA and NOR, there are further matters to consider. Irrespective of the size or complexity of the dispute, the conference is an important forum for the exploration of arguments, exchange of information and discussion of options on how to proceed with the dispute. Any opt-out right that existed immediately after the rejection of a NOR would allow the taxpayer to circumvent the conference phase, which could detract from the objective of avoiding court, and the related costs, where possible. 12 3.16 A potential way around this would be to legislate for a conference phase (a proposal supported by the joint submission) and then allow for a unilateral opt-out right after the conference phase. 3.17 If the conference were legislated for, the purposes of the conference and the procedures that it entails would also need to be included. These purposes would differ from case to case. Some may be used predominantly for exchange of legal arguments and information, while others may explore settlement options. Legislating for desired outcomes during this phase could, unless carefully drafted, result in further litigation about the respective requirements. 3.18 It is anticipated that the facilitation of conferences (as detailed in the revised SPSs) will assist in the conference being a venue for constructive dialogue. Legislating for desired outcomes may detract from any improvements that could result from this process. 3.19 The other difficulties in legislating for a conference relate to the logistical differences between disputes. In particular: • The “conference” is often more akin to a series of discussions, rather than a single session. • The discussion can take place across a range of timeframes and forums (for example, face-to-face, telephone or video-conference). • Any meetings that do take place can be formal or informal in nature. 3.20 If legislation were nevertheless considered desirable, this might be achievable by keeping the legislation limited to: • a requirement that the parties “meet” (in any forum) at least once (for body corporate taxpayers, the person attending would have to be authorised to commit the taxpayer to a course of action); and • the taxpayer signing a statement to the effect that all information relevant to the dispute had been provided. 3.21 This would allow a significant degree of flexibility in terms of available forums and discussion points, and would provide the Commissioner with some comfort that all information needed to contest any subsequent court challenge was available. 13 Conclusion 3.22 We consider that the current process (which will be supplemented by the revised SPSs) should be departed from only if the alternative offers a substantial improvement. Although we see merits in taxpayers having a unilateral opt-out right, it does not seem to represent a vastly superior process for the majority of disputes. This conclusion is further supported by our view that a unilateral opt-out right would need to be accompanied by legislating for the conference phase. Given the desire to keep legislative change to a minimum (to maintain administrative flexibility and reduce the cost of disputes about the process), legislating for something that can be capably dealt with through administrative measures appears counter- productive. 3.23 Although every disputant clearly has a right to their “day in court”, this has to be balanced against the policy objective of reducing unnecessary tax litigation. The bilateral opt-out provisions appear to provide the best balance between these two, occasionally competing, ideas. 3.24 As a result, we believe that legislation to provide for a unilateral opt-out for Commissioner-initiated disputes is unnecessary. Court order not to complete the disputes process 3.25 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission also suggests including a matching taxpayer ability to the Commissioner’s ability under section 89N(3) to apply to the High Court for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required. 6 The Commissioner’s view on this provision is set out in SPS 08/01 and reiterated in the revised SPSs. 3.26 Section 89N(3) is used in practice as either a revenue-protection provision, which prevents taxpayers from unduly delaying the process when they know that the time-bar may work in their favour, or as a cost-saving mechanism when there are numerous substantially similar disputes that are not suitable for test case treatment. 3.27 Given the administrative constraints that the Commissioner places on the ability to truncate the process under section 89N(3), we do not consider that a matching taxpayer right is warranted. In addition, taxpayers are free to approach the Commissioner with a proposal that completion of the disputes process is not required. The Commissioner has the ability to treat such a proposal as an opt-out request and may use the residual discretion outlined in the opt-out guidelines to agree to the request if none of the main opt-out criteria are met. 6 Section 89M(3) also allows the Commissioner to apply for an order to allow more time to complete the disputes process. However, such an application is not directly relevant for these purposes. 14 3.28 Further, the opt-out guidelines cater for disputes where the issue is already being considered by the courts. As a result, we anticipate that the use of section 89N(3) to truncate the process will become rarer. 3.29 As a final point, we note that section 89M(11) currently provides taxpayers with the capacity to apply to the High Court for more time to respond to the Commissioner’s SOP. Because SOPs are generally the most detailed documents produced by the parties, it is important that this provision is retained to give taxpayers the opportunity to respond to new propositions put forward by the Commissioner at the SOP stage. Likewise, it is important that sections 89M(13) and (14) are retained, so that additional information can be added to SOPs, with the agreement of the other party. Section 138B(3) 3.30 As a result of the conclusion that a unilateral opt-out right for the taxpayer is not desirable, we believe that section 138B(3) should be repealed or amended. In circumstances when the dispute has been initiated by the taxpayer, this section effectively provides taxpayers with a unilateral opt-out immediately following receipt of the Commissioner’s NOR. The existence of section 138B(3) produces a discrepancy between disputes that are taxpayer-initiated and those that are Commissioner-initiated. It is because of this section that the opt-out guidelines have not been reproduced in the revised SPS for taxpayer-initiated disputes – there is little point having guidelines when the taxpayer can circumvent them through the challenge provisions. 3.31 A taxpayer-initiated NOPA must be issued within four months of the date on which the original self-assessment is received by Inland Revenue. 7 In practice, taxpayer-initiated NOPAs tend to occur when a taxpayer is aware of potential ambiguity in the law: they will self-assess on a conservative basis and then immediately propose an adjustment to that assessment. 3.32 Although this practice has the advantage of bringing potential legislative anomalies to the attention of Inland Revenue, its result (being a unilateral opt-out right for taxpayers) is inconsistent with our view regarding unilateral opt-out measures more generally. Following our suggested amendment to section 138B(3), it is anticipated that the bilateral opt-out procedures set out in the opt-out guidelines will be incorporated into the revised SPS for taxpayer-initiated disputes, so that they will apply irrespective of which party produced the NOPA. 7 Section 89DA. The four-month response period is the general timeframe. For R&D tax credits, the response period is two years (see section 89AB(3)(b). 15 Chapter 4 EVIDENCE EXCLUSION RULE Summary of suggested changes This chapter suggests the following amendments to the evidence exclusion rule: • that it applies only to the “issues” and “propositions of law” elements of the relevant party’s SOP; • that when one party is required to produce a SOP both parties are required to do so. The evidence exclusion rule will then attach to these SOPs; and • that there be no formal evidence exclusion rule in place for disputes if the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii). It also suggests that the Taxation Review Authority Regulations be updated to refer to the District Court Rules 2009. 4.1 The evidence exclusion rule (EER), contained in section 138G, applies following the issue of a disclosure notice 8 and limits the Commissioner and the taxpayer to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that are disclosed in their respective SOPs. Policy 4.2 By largely limiting the parties to the material in their SOP, the EER serves as the central pillar to the “all cards on the table” approach advocated by the Richardson Committee. In the words of the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission, its purpose is to “encourage open and full communication”. 4.3 The EER aims to ensure that the SOP contains all of the best arguments for each party and therefore eliminates the possibility of “trial by ambush”. It also helps to make sure that all relevant information is brought forward at the SOP stage (at the latest) to increase the possibility that the Commissioner’s assessment will be correct. 8 Section 89M of the TAA. 16 Current problems with the EER 4.4 The main problem with the EER stems from what is sometimes described as the “kitchen sink” approach to preparing a SOP, whereby all facts, evidence, issues and propositions are included. There are two possible motivations for this: • to avoid the risk of the matter being prevented from being raised in a hearing authority; and 9 • to provide all relevant information that the parties consider will be persuasive or helpful to the Adjudication Unit (which, as an independent function of Inland Revenue, will not have previously been exposed to the issues being disputed). 4.5 The result of this all-inclusive approach is lengthy documentation and, if the dispute does reach a hearing authority, potential duplication between the preparation of the SOP, court documents and discovery process. 10 This can increase reluctance to proceed with a legitimate dispute. 4.6 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission suggests that the scope of the EER be relaxed, so that the parties are limited to the “propositions of law” set out in their respective SOPs, rather than also being limited to the facts and evidence. The submission argues that this will provide the necessary certainty on the legal issues at stake, while going some way towards preventing the “kitchen sink approach” to SOP preparation. 4.7 The current legislation also arguably provides the potential in taxpayer- initiated disputes for the EER to apply to the taxpayer only. This possibility comes about because section 89N(2) provides that the Commissioner can issue an amended assessment after the taxpayer’s SOP has been considered; there is no requirement for the Commissioner to also produce a SOP. The counter-argument is that the Commissioner is effectively required to issue a SOP because, without doing so, section 138G would prevent any arguments being able to be raised in a hearing authority. The matter requires clarification. Role of disputes documents 4.8 In considering whether the EER should be amended, the respective roles of the NOPA and the SOP should be taken into account. 9 Joint Submission: The Dispute Resolution Procedures in Part IVA of the TAA 1994 and The Challenge Procedures in Part VIIIA of the TAA 1994, by NZLS and NZICA, para. 3.16. 10 Note the distinction between dispute documents – documents which are legislatively required under the Disputes and Challenge procedures of the TAA – eg, NOPA, NOR, SOP, disclosure notice – and court documents, which are required to be filed within the hearing authority – eg, Notice of Claim, Notice of Defence. 17 The role of a NOPA 4.9 The NOPA is the first step towards the identification of the issues in a dispute. The purpose of the NOPA is to ensure that the party receiving the notice is aware of the arguments on which the other party is relying. It is intended to foster open and frank discussion early in the resolution process and advance the “all cards on the table” objective. 11 4.10 Irrespective of whether it is issued by the Commissioner or the taxpayer, a NOPA must identify the proposed adjustment, provide a concise statement of the key facts and the law (in sufficient detail to inform the other party of the grounds for the proposed adjustments) and state how the law applies to the facts. A taxpayer’s NOPA must also provide copies of significantly relevant documents. 12 4.11 The NOPA is not intended to be an investigative tool (for Commissioner- initiated disputes), as ideally the investigation of the taxpayer’s affairs would have been concluded by this point and any proposed adjustments should already have facts and evidence to support them. If further information is considered necessary, but is not forthcoming, the Commissioner will be able to exercise the powers under sections 16 and 17 to gather it. In this respect, the NOPA is a document that reflects the outcome of a concluded investigation. The role of the SOP 4.12 The SOP forms the basis upon which the issues will be argued if the case proceeds to court. It is generally the last card on the table before the challenge procedures, and its main role is to inform the other party of the legal and factual arguments that the party is relying on so that any “trial by ambush” is effectively eliminated from future litigation. 4.13 The SOP must, with sufficient detail to inform the other party, give an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law relied upon. 13 A well-drafted SOP provides the other party with an adequate base from which to draft either a reply SOP or a notice of claim in the hearing authority. A SOP that contains at least an outline of all relevant information is also important for the effective operation of the Adjudication Unit. 4.14 Concerns about possible duplication of the NOPA and SOP are, in our view, not overly problematic when looking at the disputes process as a whole. Given that the NOPA and the SOP are extremely likely to focus on the same points, some degree of duplication is inevitable (some issues may have been resolved in the intervening period). 11 Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review. A government discussion document. July 2003 para. 2.14-2.16. 12 Section 89F, TAA. 13 Section 89M. 18 4.15 If the NOPA is completed as outlined, the pressure for the SOP to be a heavily detailed document will be reduced. If not all of the contents of the SOP are subject to the EER, as suggested by the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission, there will be less temptation to include every available shred of information. These factors should in turn result in the SOP being the “outline” document contemplated by the TAA. Possible solutions 4.16 We therefore agree that the EER should be relaxed, subject to: • the Commissioner having all relevant information available so that any assessment is as accurate as possible; and • if a challenge does arise from that assessment, any court proceedings operating on a “no surprises” basis to the fullest extent possible. 4.17 If the EER is to be relaxed, it is questionable whether an “evidence exclusion rule” is an appropriate label for such a rule. Any new label used will need to be consistent with its role in the overall disputes process. One possibility is simply to change the label to “exclusion rule”. 4.18 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission suggested relaxing the EER so that it was limited to the “propositions of law” contained in the SOP, allowing for new issues, facts and evidence to be adduced at the challenge stage. The submission also suggested, especially if no SOP is involved, binding the Commissioner to the “grounds of assessment”. “Proposition of law” EER 4.19 A “proposition of law” can be regarded as the legal basis for the technical position taken by the party. It will contain references to the relevant statutory provisions, and judicial and other authorities that may assist in the interpretation of them (including, where appropriate, overseas court decisions, legislative history analysis, and reference to legal principles and cases outside of the taxation area). It may also include a statement on the application of law that has not previously been considered by the courts. 4.20 Certainty as to the propositions of law is important to the efficient operation of the disputes process. If propositions of law are not finalised during the dispute phases, legal issues may be poorly defined until the commencement of proceedings in court. Such an outcome would be directly contrary to the objectives of the Richardson Committee, which sought full and early disclosure of relevant matters. 19 Possible advantages 4.21 Removing the existing strict requirements to include facts, evidence and issues in the SOP, and having the EER limited to propositions of law appears to have a number of advantages: • It continues the current practice of both parties being aware of the legal arguments proposed by the other. • It should provide the Adjudication Unit with all the information required to analyse the respective legal arguments. • It should take some of the pressure away from including every fact and piece of evidence in the SOP. • Propositions of law, as a term, is already included in the legislation and is a requirement for the contents of a SOP. Any legislative change to limit the EER in this way would therefore be minimised. “Grounds of assessment” EER 4.22 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission suggests that the Commissioner should be bound by his “grounds of assessment”, particularly when no SOP has been issued. A rule based on grounds of assessment has one major advantage, in that there is almost always an assessment in a substantive dispute. Because the challenge is generally to the assessment, there is no possibility of the rule not applying to the Commissioner. 4.23 However, we do not favour a “grounds of assessment” rule for the following reasons: • The assessment is generally issued after the SOP. Therefore, there would be no finality to the SOP. • The Commissioner’s assessment quantifies the tax liability but does not contain detailed analysis. This would necessarily change. If there is a SOP, this could be a simple cross-reference or reproduction of the SOP. However, when there is no SOP, (such as opt-out disputes), this rule would effectively still require the Commissioner to produce a document similar to a SOP with the attendant documentary detail. • To provide parity, so that the Commissioner was not the only party bound, an additional reply would be required of the taxpayer. Placing further documentary requirements on the taxpayer would be an unnecessary additional compliance cost. 20 “Issues” EER 4.24 We see “issues”, in the context of the SOP as akin to “legal issues to be resolved between the parties”. This is supported in some respect by the fact that sections 89M(4) and (6) both refer to issues that the party “considers will arise”. This can be contrasted with the facts, evidence and propositions of law “on which the \[party\] intends to rely”. In other words, the issues arise and the remaining elements are relied upon to demonstrate a particular view. If this is the case, then “issues” is effectively the umbrella term and propositions of law, facts and evidence are put forward by the parties in an attempt to make a decision-maker resolve the issues in their favour. 4.25 On this basis, it makes sense to consider the possibility that the issues should be set, so that the parties can go about constructing their propositions of law and gathering their facts and evidence. Such an approach has many of the advantages of a “propositions of law” approach (discussed above) while recognising that propositions of law are only ever determined in the context of the wider legal issues. Possible solution 4.26 On balance, we consider that the best approach may be to have the EER apply to “issues” and “propositions of law”. We prefer this for the following reasons: • Simply having an “issues” EER could lead to concerns around exactly how broadly “issues” is defined. A dispute may only have one over- arching issue. Although there are arguably benefits in having this issue set, it may be so broad as to effectively provide no limitation at all. • Having a “propositions of law” EER would effectively limit the issues because a new issue would be unlikely to be introduced unless propositions of law could be raised to support it. • Requiring the parties to clearly state what they consider to be the relevant issues, and the propositions of law that would support the resolution of those issues in their favour, would create an appropriate level of certainty – especially when coupled with the requirement to provide an outline of facts and evidence in the SOP. 4.27 We do note, however, that any amendment to the EER within the existing legislative framework would not cater for truncated disputes. 21 “Trial by ambush” and factual certainty 4.28 To relax the EER, both parties would need assurance that they could not be “ambushed” at a court hearing by previously undisclosed material. Correspondingly, the parties would also need to be confident that they fully understood the factual events relied upon by the other (even if there are disagreements over the relevant facts). Trial by ambush 4.29 The risk of trial by ambush is reduced in the modern litigation environment. Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Mercer v Chief Constable of the Lancashire Constabulary stated: 14 Over the last quarter of a century there has been a sea-change in legislation and judicial attitudes towards the conduct of litigation, taking the form of increased positive case management by the judiciary and the adoption of procedures designed (a) to identify the real issues in dispute (b) to enable each party to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of his own and his opponent’s case at the earliest possible moment and well before any trial. Not only does this tend to make for shorter trials and save costs, even more importantly it facilitates and encourages settlements. 4.30 New Zealand commentators have expressed the view that the above passage is equally true in New Zealand. Discovery and the advent of the case management system 15 has encouraged an environment where the Court is no longer accepting of trial by ambush, 16 and the traditional adversarial approach to litigation whereby parties “keep their cards close to their chest”. 17 District Courts Rules and judicial settlement conferences 4.31 Under section 16 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, the TRA has a wide discretion to determine its own proceedings. The District Courts Rules in effect act as a guide to reduce any uncertainty about TRA proceedings. 18 To this end, Regulation 4 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 states: To the extent that they are not inconsistent with these regulations, or the provisions of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, or the Tax Administration Act 1994, the District Courts Rules 1992 apply to the commencement, interlocutory steps, and conduct of proceedings in the Authority as if those proceedings were civil proceedings in the District Court. 14 \[1991\] 2 All ER 504, 508-509 (CA). 15 The system whereby judiciary officers allocate proceedings to different tracks according to their needs and complexity, and ensures they keep moving through regular checks and conferences. 16 see Donovan v Graham (22/5/90, Eichelbaum CJ, HC Auckland, CP1980/89). 17 Andrew Beck, Civil Procedure in NZ, para 1.13. 18 Section 16(1). 22 4.32 New District Court Rules came into effect 1 November 2009. One feature of the new rules is that they provide for “settlement conferences” between the parties before a hearing. 4.33 A judicial settlement conference must be convened by a judge and held in chambers. The purpose of the conference is to give the parties to the proceedings an opportunity to negotiate a settlement of the claim or any issue. 19 The inclusion of the conference is another opportunity to make sure parties have the same understanding of the facts and should prevent any trial by ambush before a hearing. It is worth noting that a party can still apply for discovery if there is a serious possibility of information having been withheld or trial by ambush. 4.34 Under section 16 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act and Regulation 4, the TRA has the discretion to adopt these settlement conferences into its proceedings. However, greater certainty on the application of the rules may be desirable. 4.35 Because of the improved systems that settlement conferences introduce, and to make it easier for disputants (who will not then have to deal with the “old” rules) we suggest that the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations be amended to apply the 2009 District Court Rules and that the settlement conferences be incorporated for tax challenges. 20 4.36 One question that does arise, however, is whether the documentation required by the disputes process and the new District Court Rules overlap. Our view is that this is not likely because if adequate exchanges between the parties have occurred under the disputes process, the court documents will simply become more manageable in nature. 4.37 To this end, we also suggest an amendment to Regulation 8 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations to relax the requirement that notices of claim have to effectively duplicate the SOPs of both parties. Provided the relevant information (NOPA, NOR and SOPs) were attached to the notice of claim, that would be sufficient. In practice, this is often what occurs and appears to cause little difficulty. Factual certainty 4.38 Factual certainty is essential to an efficient disputes process and, as previously noted, it is important that any relaxation of the EER does not undermine this. Whatever change is made towards relaxing the EER, there would still be a requirement that a SOP contain an outline of the facts and evidence “on which the \[party\] intends to rely”. 21 If an important fact or piece of evidence is not included in this outline and the party then seeks to rely on it, they run the risk of the hearing authority refusing to accept it. 19 Clause 2.47.2 District Court Rules 2009. 20 Reg. 4, TRA Regulations. 21 Section 89M(6). 23 4.39 Factual certainty could be achieved in the following ways: • There is a natural incentive for taxpayers and the Commissioner to put their best case forward as early as possible in the dispute process because of the costs (including UOMI) of doing otherwise. If the Commissioner suspects the taxpayer has not disclosed all the relevant information, the Commissioner can rely on the information-gathering statutory powers under sections 16 and 17, or the hearing authority’s powers in relation to discovery and interrogatories, to obtain as much factual certainty as possible. • The Commissioner will also have the ability to achieve greater factual certainty during the conference phase, particularly if there is an opt-out under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), as an agreement will be signed at the end of the conference stating that all material facts have been disclosed. • As discussed above, the District Court Rules 2009 also provide for a settlement conference to take place between the parties. Assuming that this element of the new rules is applied to proceedings in the TRA, this conference will also afford the parties with an opportunity to ensure that all the key facts are available and issues discussed in requisite detail. The prospect of material factual information being withheld from a statement of claim, when a settlement conference is imminent, is minimal. EER applying to both parties 4.40 We agree with the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission that, where the EER applies, it should apply to both parties. There are two possible solutions to ensuring this is achieved: • make it clear that the Commissioner must, to continue a taxpayer- initiated dispute, issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP; or • provide that the Commissioner always issues the first SOP, even in taxpayer-initiated disputes. Commissioner issues a SOP 4.41 This proposal would require an amendment to section 89N(2)(b) (concerning the process for taxpayer-initiated NOPAs) to the effect that the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment until the later of: • the Commissioner has considered a statement of position issued by the disputant; or • the Commissioner has issued a statement of position. 24 4.42 This would mean that if one party has to produce a SOP, so would the other. Each party to a dispute would then have a SOP to which the EER could apply. Commissioner always issues the first SOP 4.43 An amendment could be made to section 89M(3). This section currently states that the Commissioner’s disclosure notice does not need to be accompanied by a SOP if the NOPA was issued by the taxpayer. If this requirement were removed, the Commissioner would always have to issue a SOP at the same time as the disclosure notice. The taxpayer would then have the usual response period to reply with their SOP. 4.44 This proposal has the advantage of aligning all disputes from the conference phase onwards. Irrespective of who initiated the dispute, the onus would always be on the Commissioner to produce a disclosure notice and SOP. In the event that the taxpayer’s SOP raised novel material or arguments not previously discussed between the parties, the Commissioner would still be able to respond to these through the addendum SOP provisions in section 89M(8). On the other hand, this approach presupposes that the Commissioner will have completed the investigation well in advance of the SOP having to be issued. For taxpayer-initiated NOPAs this is not always the case and the approach may not therefore provide an adequate basis from which the Commissioner can prepare an appropriate SOP. 4.45 We welcome submissions on the possible approaches. EER and opt-out under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) 4.46 When the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree to opt-out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), the EER (in either its current or proposed form) will not apply, as no SOP will have been issued. Therefore, in theory, nothing limits the issues, propositions of law, facts or evidence put forward by either the taxpayer or the Commissioner. The question is whether or not this should be seen as a problem for either party to such a dispute. 4.47 The natural incentive to end the dispute as soon as possible will still exist under an opt-out scenario. Also, because of the requirement set out in the opt-out guidelines that all material information has been provided by the taxpayer, the conference is likely to be an adequate disclosure tool in an opt- out case. 25 4.48 Factual certainty does not necessarily provide certainty as to the issues and propositions of law. However, when a conference is undertaken before an opt-out, there is less potential for disputes to reach a hearing stage without the issues and propositions of law being sufficiently well defined. This is because, if the parties have all the information relevant to the dispute (a pre- requisite of being eligible for opt-out), they should be in a position to anticipate the legal arguments of the other party with some degree of accuracy. 4.49 The following further factors appear to weigh in favour of there being no EER (or equivalent) applicable to opt-out disputes: • If novel arguments are raised in the court documents, the other party will still have some time to consider these before filing their documents or the judicial settlement conference begins (as applicable). • Although it is not correct to say that all disputes of $75,000 or under (a suggested criterion for an opt-out) are “simple”, we do not anticipate that the most complex of cases will be eligible for the opt-out. 26 Chapter 5 TIMEFRAMES This chapter focuses on whether the issuing of a disclosure notice and SOP by the Commissioner should be subject to a statutory timeframe. Although it concludes that administrative guidelines are sufficient at the current time, it also discusses what form any future legislation on this issue might take. Finally, the chapter suggests some minor amendments to the Taxation Review Authority Regulations to align timeframes between the TRA and the High Court. 5.1 The Commissioner generally has four years from the end of the tax year in which the return was filed to undertake any investigation of a taxpayer’s affairs and complete the disputes process to the point where an amended assessment can be issued. 5.2 Concerns have been raised that this timeframe should incorporate appropriate intermediate deadlines that the Commissioner must meet – particularly relating to the Commissioner’s disclosure notice and associated SOP, for which there are no statutory timelines. Arguments for imposing timeframes 5.3 The arguments for imposing specific timeframes on the Commissioner include the following: • Excessive delays undermine the integrity of the tax system and go against the aims of the Richardson Committee. In this sense, the non- financial aspects of a tax dispute are also important. Disputes with Inland Revenue can have a negative effect on the particular taxpayer (for example, a business may not take on additional employees until it is certain of its financial position) as well as an emotional impact on the people concerned. • The Commissioner is subject to some time limits, but not all. The “playing field” should be level: if timeframes apply to taxpayers at each step then they should equally apply to the Commissioner. • UOMI continues to run through the course of a dispute, irrespective of which party is primarily responsible for any delay. The lack of timeframes on the Commissioner provides an incentive to delay the process. In other words, delay is effectively a means by which taxpayers can be “burnt off” by the continued accumulation of UOMI. 27 Arguments for not having timeframes for the Commissioner’s SOP 5.4 One of the main recommendations of the Richardson Committee was that disputes should have every opportunity to be resolved before reaching the courts. It is therefore important that any timeframes placed on the various steps of the process for each party do not hinder this objective and, instead, encourage resolution. Key to this is the conference phase of the process, which could be compromised by adherence to statutory timeframes. 5.5 Other considerations are: • Strict timeframes around the issue of a disclosure notice and a SOP may encourage Inland Revenue staff to front-load the dispute, by including material in the NOPA which should otherwise have been placed in the SOP. This would lessen the possibility of a speedy resolution of the dispute, and the costs (including UOMI) would be largely unchanged. • Disputes that take the longest are generally more complex and can have the highest potential revenue impact. Single statutory timeframes would need to take into account these cases and, as a result, may cause unnecessary delays in smaller disputes. • Because the statutory marker (the issue of a NOR) is followed by the administrative conference phase, there are dangers in applying a strict timeframe on the issuing of a SOP. For example, if the Commissioner were to have a set number of months to produce a SOP, the taxpayer could be motivated to ensure that the conference phase was a protracted one. This is because the longer the conference phase lasted, the less time the Commissioner would have to draft the SOP. Possible solutions 5.6 Fixing the perceived problem again comes down to whether the system could be improved more meaningfully by administrative change or legislative amendment. Several options are discussed below. Administrative options 5.7 As we noted earlier, administrative solutions have the advantage of providing a degree of certainty to taxpayers, while allowing the Commissioner to deal with the process in a way that ensures maximum flexibility to address difficult circumstances. 5.8 The revised SPSs state that the period between the receipt of a taxpayer’s NOR and the issue of the Commissioner’s SOP will be, on average, approximately seven months, subject to the facts and the complexity of the dispute. The seven month period is broken down as follows: 28 • one month to consider the taxpayer’s NOR and initiate the conference phase; • three months for the conference phase itself; • three months following the conclusion of the conference to prepare a disclosure notice and SOP. 5.9 If meeting the recommended timeframe is not possible (for example, if the facts or law are complex, the dispute could be precedential or Crown Law involvement is necessary), approval must be obtained from a senior manager and the taxpayer must be advised of the new estimated date for the issue of the SOP. Taxpayer-initiated disputes 5.10 There is little difference in theory between the way a taxpayer-initiated dispute is conducted and one that is initiated by the Commissioner. For taxpayer-initiated disputes, the Commissioner must issue a NOR within two months of receipt of a NOPA. The taxpayer then has a further two months to reject the NOR. If the Commissioner’s NOR is rejected and the Commissioner wishes to continue with the dispute, the conference phase will begin. The revised SPS suggests an average four-month conference period for taxpayer-initiated disputes (one month following the receipt of a taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR to set up the conference and three months for the conference itself). Again, this is subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute. Will administrative practices change? 5.11 Under the suggested change, it is anticipated that there will be fewer exceptions to the administrative guidelines being met because: • any amendment to soften the application of the EER (discussed in the previous chapter) will go some way to relieving pressure on the production of the SOP; and • the publication of the revised SPSs will create clearer, more detailed guidance for Inland Revenue staff, which should result in more emphasis being placed on meeting the recommended deadlines. The Commissioner expects any decision to extend the deadline would be more than just a “rubber stamping” of an investigator’s decision to extend time. Legislative amendment 5.12 In Chapter 3 we raised the possibility of legislating for the conference, and concluded that it was not desirable at this stage. Not legislating for timeframes would, from a practical perspective, be more consistent with this view. 29 5.13 While legislation would reduce flexibility in the administration of a dispute, on the positive side, taxpayers would know that their dispute would not be left to sit indefinitely. The Commissioner would know that documents have to be produced by a certain date (with consequences for not doing so) and would be able to allocate resources in a manner that progresses all disputes within a consistent timeframe. 5.14 Although our preference is for an administrative approach, the following discussion looks at how legislated timeframes may work, should that option be preferred. The legislative option 5.15 Any statutory timeframe would need to be flexible enough to cater for both very complex disputes and disputes where the statutory time-bar is likely to be a serious consideration. 5.16 Bearing in mind that timeframes would also need to allow time for both the conference and the drafting of the SOP, the most feasible legislative option would appear to be to codify the current administrative timeframes for these phases. As mentioned above, Inland Revenue currently anticipates that a total of seven months is needed between the receipt of a taxpayer’s NOR and the issue of the Commissioner’s SOP. 5.17 While we have noted that a statutory timeframe could provide an incentive for taxpayers to lengthen the conference phase, seven months (including the conference phase) is a reasonable length of time for the Commissioner to ascertain the cooperativeness or otherwise of a particular taxpayer. 5.18 Another possible risk with a single legislated timeframe is that relatively simple disputes could be delayed until the end of the seven-month period. If the conference is shortened or is seen as unnecessary, this statutory timeframe effectively allows the Commissioner up to seven months to draft the SOP, which is unduly long. This risk needs to be factored against the certainty that a back-stop date for this part for the process would provide for taxpayers. Extending the deadline 5.19 There will always be disputes where a lengthy conference phase is necessary and in the best interests of all parties. Imposing a strict timeframe on these disputes could result in the Commissioner being forced to abridge a constructive conference in order to allow time to draft a SOP. This could mean that settlement negotiations (with the potential to end the dispute) could be abandoned in favour of an option that would add both time and costs to the dispute. 30 5.20 To ensure that a legislative approach retained some administrative flexibility for the most complex cases, one option could be to use the seven-month timeframe and give the Commissioner the ability to extend this, perhaps by a maximum of two months. A two-month period is based on an assumption that the majority of documentation should be complete or nearing completion within the original seven months. Any extension should therefore be of a sufficient time to allow completion of these documents without causing unnecessary further delay. 5.21 In the event that this further period was needed, the Commissioner would, before the seven-month deadline, advise the taxpayer of: • the decision to extend the deadline; • the reasons for doing so; and • the revised deadline. 5.22 Internal guidelines may need to be drafted to ensure that the “easy” option of extending for two months is not used as a default. Any decision to extend the deadline should still ensure that the disclosure notice and SOP are issued at the earliest opportunity. Taxpayer-initiated disputes 5.23 For taxpayer-initiated disputes, there is currently no obligation on the Commissioner to produce a SOP at the same time as the disclosure notice. As a result, if a time limit is to be set for the issue of the disclosure notice, it may not need to factor in time for drafting the Commissioner’s SOP. 5.24 However, factored against this consideration is that, generally speaking, taxpayer-initiated disputes are received with little warning. Although the Commissioner has a statutory requirement to respond to a taxpayer’s NOPA (by way of NOR) within two months, it can be difficult to undertake an entire investigation within this timeframe. Any statutory timeframe for the conference may therefore need to take into account the fact that the initial investigation may not be complete at the time the Commissioner’s NOR is issued. Use-of-money interest 5.25 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission argues that the possible imposition of UOMI (in the event that increased tax is payable following the outcome of the dispute) can be a major factor in the overall cost of a tax dispute. The submission considers that there should be scope to suspend UOMI when inaction by the Commissioner has caused a delay in a dispute. 31 5.26 The timeframes set out in the revised SPSs have been set because they are considered to be reasonable for completing the relevant steps in the process, without sacrificing thoroughness or quality. More rigid adherence to these timeframes in future should result in fewer delays in the process. 5.27 We do not favour a legislative suspension of UOMI for the delays in the process that do nevertheless arise. UOMI is a “no fault” concept, designed to be administratively workable by ensuring that exceptions are kept to a minimum. Practically speaking, any provision that suspended UOMI would need to relate back to a particular statutory “event” – for example, the taxpayer’s NOR. If UOMI were to be suspended within the administrative timeframe for the issue of a SOP, this would effectively penalise the Commissioner even if the length of the conference phase or complexity of the dispute provided an acceptable rationale for the administrative timeframe not being adhered to. 5.28 We note, in any event, that it is the Commissioner’s practice to exercise a degree of discretion when quantifying UOMI. Generally, where an undue delay in the process is attributable to Inland Revenue, an appropriate remission of UOMI will be made to reflect this. 5.29 The imposition of a statutory deadline on the Commissioner for issuing a SOP would mean that no consideration would need to be given to the suspension of UOMI. This is because the likely consequence of any failure to meet a statutory timeframe would be that the Commissioner was deemed to accept the position set out in the taxpayer’s NOR. Other minor regulatory amendments 5.30 We have identified the following issues concerning timeframes in the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations where changes could be made: • amending Regulation 11 to reduce the time that the Commissioner has to file a Notice of Defence from 40 working days to 25 working days. This would align the filing requirement in the TRA with that of the High Court; and • amending Regulation 28 to require the TRA to set a date for a directions hearing within 35 working days of the filing of the notice of claim (at present, this date has to be at least 90 days after filing or another date agreed by the parties). The directions hearing in the TRA was introduced prior to the “track” system for cases being introduced in the High Court. However, it seems appropriate to bring the timing requirements for tax cases in line with those for case management conferences of “standard track” cases in the High Court. In any event, there does not appear to be great justification for having timing discrepancies between the TRA and the High Court, given that both can be the hearing authority of first instance for tax cases. 32 Chapter 6 DISPUTABLE DECISIONS This chapter proposes amending the TAA to clarify that the Commissioner’s decision whether or not to agree to a taxpayer’s opt-out request (and certain other matters) are not “disputable decisions”. It also suggests making the exceptional circumstances discretion a disputable one. 6.1 A disputable decision should be one that has a direct bearing on the quantum of tax payable by a taxpayer. An assessment is the most obvious example of this, but other decisions made by the Commissioner have a potentially similar effect. These decisions should be afforded a relatively simple and clear appeal right, such as the challenge proceedings set out in Part VIIIA. 6.2 By contrast, administrative decisions made by the Commissioner should – as with every government agency – be subject to administrative review applications. No special system is required in the tax legislation to achieve this. 6.3 The courts have determined that a taxpayer can use the challenge procedures set out in Part VIIIA to challenge any decision of the Commissioner that is “disputable”. The definition of “disputable decision” covers an assessment and any other decision made by the Commissioner under a tax law, except for decisions specifically excluded by the definition. If a decision made by the Commissioner is excluded from the “disputable decision” definition, the only option available to a taxpayer is to have the decision reviewed through a judicial review application. 22 6.4 The specific examples raised in this chapter relate to the list of exceptions to the “disputable decision” definition contained in section 138E. 23 However, this review also provides an opportunity to look at the definition more generally. We would be particularly interested in any submissions on whether the current definition imposes undue compliance costs by effectively requiring taxpayers to issue a NOPA in response to a decision made by the Commissioner that does not itself make an amended assessment imminent. 22 Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC at para. 30-31. 23 One exception from the “disputable decision” definition is decisions that cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA. Section 138E contains the relevant list. 33 Opting out of the disputes process 6.5 As mentioned in previous chapters, we anticipate that agreements under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) to opt out of the disputes process will become more common in future. 6.6 Under the current drafting of section 138E, a decision of the Commissioner to enter into an opt-out agreement is “disputable”. By their very nature, opt- out agreements are consensual and freely entered into by the parties. We therefore do not consider that the best interests of the disputes process are served by providing taxpayers with the ability to challenge this decision. 6.7 If the Commissioner does not agree to enter into an opt-out agreement, the remaining steps of the disputes process will follow and, generally (assuming neither party accepts the position of the other in the interim), lead to an assessment. That assessment can be challenged by the taxpayer in the normal way, so the taxpayer does not “lose” as a result of the Commissioner’s procedural decision regarding the opt-out. 6.8 As a result, we propose an amendment to section 138E to clarify that the Commissioner’s decision whether or not to enter into an opt-out agreement under section 89N(1)(c)(viii) is not “disputable”. Validity of NOPA and SOP 6.9 Section 138E(1)(e) lists the decisions that cannot be challenged if the decision “is left to the discretion, judgment, opinion, approval, consent or determination of the Commissioner”. This wording is consistent with the policy intent that discretionary administrative matters should not generally be subject to the challenge provisions. NOPA 6.10 Under section 89B, the Commissioner may issue one or more NOPAs in respect of a tax return or assessment. The use of the word “may” is permissive; the Commissioner is not compelled to issue a NOPA (other than possibly under the care and management provisions). The fact that the Commissioner “may” issue a NOPA suggests that this is a matter that is “left to the discretion, judgment \[or\] opinion” of the Commissioner. 6.11 However, the decision to issue a NOPA is not listed as one of the exceptions to the use of the challenge proceedings under section 138E. The result is that the issuing of a NOPA by the Commissioner is arguably a “disputable decision”. This means that, in theory, a taxpayer could issue a NOPA in response to the Commissioner’s NOPA. Such an outcome is clearly procedurally circular and in substance contrary to the scheme and purpose of the disputes process. The disputes process is designed so that taxpayers do have a right of response to the Commissioner’s NOPA, through their NOR. 34 SOP 6.12 Section 89M(3) states that the Commissioner must, unless the dispute is taxpayer-initiated, provide the taxpayer with a SOP at the same time as the disclosure notice is issued. 6.13 Section 89M is one of the provisions listed in section 138E(1)(e), meaning that discretionary decisions made under it are not “disputable”. However, the use of “must” in section 89M(3) effectively compels the Commissioner to provide the disputant with a SOP. Therefore, issuing a SOP is arguably not discretionary. The result is that the taxpayer can, in theory, respond with a NOPA. 6.14 As with the previous issue, an ability to respond to a SOP with a NOPA is circular and unintentional. The disputes process already provides an avenue for taxpayers to respond to the Commissioner’s SOP. 6.15 We therefore consider that section 138E should be amended to clarify both of these issues. Definition of “disputable decision” 6.16 An overlap has been identified in the definition of “disputable decision”. Subparagraph (iv) of the definition provides that a decision is not a “disputable decision” if it “is left to the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3)”. However, decisions left to the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 89K and 89M are also excluded from being “disputable” by the operation of section 138E. 6.17 The definition of “disputable decision” and section 138E should be amended so that all discretionary-type matters are listed in one place (section 138E) rather than in the definition itself. Exceptional circumstances 6.18 The Commissioner has the ability under section 89K to determine whether to allow a taxpayer to provide documents out of time. Late submissions will be allowed if the Commissioner is satisfied that the lateness is as a result of “exceptional circumstances”. This decision is not a “disputable decision”. Given the policy rationale for a decision to be “disputable”, and the implications for the taxpayer if the “exceptional circumstances” test is not satisfied, we consider that a decision by the Commissioner that the test has not been satisfied should be disputable. Proposed amendments to the definition of “exceptional circumstances” generally, and its relationship with the disputable decision definition, are discussed in more detail in the following chapter. 35 Chapter 7 EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES This chapter suggests that the definition of “exceptional circumstances” be amended so that taxpayers who have demonstrated an “intention to dispute” can also submit documents after the response period. It also suggests that decisions should continue to be made by the Commissioner and those decisions should be “disputable”. 7.1 The consequences of not meeting a statutory timeframe set out in the disputes process are serious: the defaulting party is deemed to accept the position adopted by the other. As a result, a taxpayer who fails to issue a NOPA, respond in time to the Commissioner’s NOPA, disclosure notice, SOP or assessment within the statutory timeframe will generally be liable for the tax, penalties and interest sought by the Commissioner. Similarly, if Inland Revenue fails to respond to a taxpayer NOPA in time, the Commissioner will be deemed to accept the revised tax position proposed. If this deemed acceptance occurs, the dispute is at an end. 7.2 The exception to this rule is if “exceptional circumstances” apply. The exceptional circumstances rules are ameliorating provisions that blunt the otherwise harsh effects of statutory timeframes. If exceptional circumstances exist, a notice issued by the taxpayer or Commissioner that is issued out of time will be treated for the purposes of the TAA as if it had been given within the applicable response period. 24 7.3 The idea of an exceptional circumstances test will always give rise to an inherent tension. Although statutory timeframes are considered essential to ensure that the disputes process is navigated in a timely and efficient manner, there will be situations when a late response is justified and the party to the dispute should not be unduly penalised for failing to meet a deadline. However, ameliorating provisions should not be so weak as to allow a taxpayer with any excuse to issue notices out of time. To do so would give rise to ongoing uncertainty about the tax position and additional administrative and other costs. The key is therefore in finding a system that best accommodates the two competing objectives. 24 Section 89K. 36 Current law 7.4 For taxpayers, the tests for exceptional circumstances are set out in sections 89K(3) and 138D(2). Section 89K(3) applies to the “dispute documents” – that is, the NOPA, NOR and SOP. Section 138D(2) applies to a challenge in a hearing authority to a disputable decision. 7.5 Under section 89K, the Commissioner has a discretion to accept late documents if an event beyond the taxpayer’s control provides them with a “reasonable justification” for not meeting the deadline. 7.6 For acts or omissions of agents of disputants, an exceptional circumstance exists only if it results from an event outside the control of the agent, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. 7.7 In both cases, the Commissioner also has a discretion to accept documents if the lateness is minimal. The Commissioner interprets this discretion as meaning he will generally accept documents that are only one to two days late and if the other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) are satisfied. 25 7.8 The tests in section 138D are broadly similar to those in section 89K. A key difference, however, is who makes the decision on whether exceptional circumstances exist. Under section 89K, the decision is made by the Commissioner whereas, under section 138D, the decision is made by the hearing authority. Most case law on exceptional circumstances focuses on section 138D, with an acknowledgement that the existence of exceptional circumstances should be applied consistently wherever it is used in the TAA. 26 7.9 Because it is always the taxpayer that issues challenge proceedings, the exceptional circumstances test that applies to the Commissioner applies only to “dispute documents”, and is only relevant if the Commissioner is late in filing a NOR (this being the only timeframe for the Commissioner’s documents). 7.10 Section 89L, which applies to the Commissioner, focuses on whether circumstances beyond the control of Inland Revenue provide a reasonable justification for lateness. An exceptional circumstance also includes a change in tax law made during the response period. To be eligible to issue a NOR after the response period, the Commissioner must apply to the High Court, within the two-month response period, for an order that exceptional circumstances exist. 25 SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, para 201. See also further examples of the exercise of this discretion in Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 8, No. 3, 1996, Questions and Answers. 26 Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752; Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005; Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 17,470 (CA); Hollis v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570; and Balich v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230. 37 7.11 There have been numerous cases that involve an application to the hearing authority under section 138D. The Court of Appeal, in CIR v Fuji Xerox New Zealand Ltd outlined the approach it considered should be taken in considering when exceptional circumstances exist: 27 • Identification – The hearing authority must identify the events or circumstances relied on by the disputant and ascertain whether they were beyond the disputant’s, or their agent’s, control. • Evaluation – For the events that are beyond the control of the taxpayer, or their agent, the hearing authority must then evaluate whether those events provide a reasonable justification for not commencing the challenge proceedings within the response period. • Discretion – If the events do provide a reasonable justification, the hearing authority retains a residual discretion not to allow the challenge to commence. Problems with the current rules 7.12 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission considers that: • The existing exceptional circumstances test is too strict, and the test that applies to agents is even stricter. This may result in genuine disputes being unable to be advanced because the taxpayer cannot convince the Commissioner to exercise his discretion (under section 89K) in their favour. • The Commissioner can apply to the High Court if exceptional circumstances are considered to exist, whereas the decision on whether the taxpayer has exceptional circumstances is made by the Commissioner. Associated with this is that any decision of the Commissioner is not “disputable”, meaning that taxpayers must have the decision judicially reviewed to have any chance of it being overturned. • There is a disparity between the tests that apply to the Commissioner and the taxpayer. The Commissioner has an additional “exceptional circumstance” if there is a change in tax law during the response period. 28 7.13 This chapter considers these concerns in turn. However, as a starting point, we note that we do not believe that the tests that apply to the Commissioner and the taxpayer should be in perfect symmetry. The Commissioner is a statutory office, with the wider responsibility for revenue collection through the efficient operation of the tax system. This role makes it appropriate that any possible failure to meet statutory requirements be considered by a court. For the taxpayer, the concern is instead for the right mechanism being in place so that there can be an objective consideration of the issue. 27 (2002) 20 NZTC 17,470. 28 Section 89L(3)(b). 38 Intention to dispute 7.14 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission argues that the discretion to accept late documents should be extended to circumstances when there is evidence of an intention to dispute, or when an error has been made and the time delay is not significant in the circumstances. This idea has merit because taxpayers with a genuine grievance should not generally be precluded from pursuing the matter. 7.15 The idea of a test based on an intention to dispute has its genesis in case law. The principal case in New Zealand is Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR. 29 Although Gisborne Mills was decided before the introduction of the current disputes process, it nevertheless provides support for the proposition that continual assertion of a contrary position is sufficient to maintain a dispute. 7.16 The taxpayers in Gisborne Mills were members of a consortium of exporters. The Commissioner assessed on the basis that a particular tax incentive was no longer available. Another exporter successfully pursued a challenge to the ruling to the High Court. Despite the other exporter receiving a favourable decision from the Court, the Commissioner refused to retrospectively amend the taxpayer’s assessments because they had not made a formal challenge. The taxpayers sought to have that decision of the Commissioner judicially reviewed. 7.17 The High Court (Robertson J) upheld the taxpayer’s application and referred the decision back to the Commissioner. An important part of the Court’s reasoning was that the taxpayers: • had “consistently asserted that they were entitled to the export incentive...”. This was “in marked distinction to a person who, never having contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation, endeavours to take advantage of a matter when they become aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer”; and • had “in an informal way been involved in the \[previous case\] and were, throughout the period, objectors in fact, if not in law”. Possible test 7.18 Although “intention to dispute” is a difficult concept to articulate in legislation, there are merits in having a test that provides some leeway to a taxpayer who misses a deadline but who nevertheless has demonstrated that they have an unresolved grievance. This test could co-exist with the current exceptional circumstances test, so that late documents could be accepted either when there was a clear intention to dispute before the end of the response period, or when exceptional circumstances existed. 29 (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. 39 7.19 While an intention test is inherently subjective, it could be interpreted by reference to objective criteria set out in the legislation. Any list of possible indicators should not be exhaustive, because it is impossible to anticipate the number of circumstances that may apply to individual taxpayers. 7.20 The central tenet of any test should be that the taxpayer demonstrates they have, before the deadline, clearly communicated an intention to formally dispute the matter on certain grounds and have not subsequently modified that position. 7.21 To support this general proposition it may be helpful to consider the following further factors: • The taxpayer has responded to any Inland Revenue correspondence (whether by phone or in writing) and has attended scheduled meetings regarding the dispute and consistently asserted their contrary position regarding the substantive issues. • The taxpayer has complied with other parts of the disputes process and their overall tax obligations (for example, if the late document in question is the taxpayer’s SOP, the fact that they have filed a timely NOR should count in their favour). • The taxpayer has corresponded with other relevant parties regarding the dispute – for example, the Minister of Revenue, the Ombudsman or Inland Revenue’s Complaints Management Service. 7.22 An application would not be accepted if the degree of lateness was unjustified in the circumstances, or it was considered to be designed to defeat the application of the time period or to frustrate the disputes process itself. An example might be a taxpayer who contacts the Commissioner close to a deadline to confirm they intend to dispute, but then does nothing further for some considerable time, effectively rendering the timeframe meaningless. To counter such risk, new rules may be needed to extend the Commissioner’s statutory time-bar if the Commissioner cannot complete the disputes process as a result of delay that is clearly attributable to a taxpayer’s actions. 7.23 In addition, a taxpayer who sought to retrospectively take advantage of a favourable court decision for another taxpayer would not have an intention to dispute if they had not previously kept their own dispute “live”. This approach is consistent with the Court’s view in Gisborne Mills. 7.24 We consider that taxpayers who engage tax agents should still be able to use the “intention to dispute” test. It may even be that the Commissioner will view the engagement of a tax agent specifically to manage the dispute as evidence in determining whether there was actually the requisite intention to dispute. This would also ensure that taxpayers are not unduly prejudiced by seeking the assistance of tax agents. 40 7.25 We have considered whether an “intention to dispute” test should contain a final date after which documents would not be accepted and the Commissioner’s tax position would be deemed to be accepted. The problem with this approach is that there is a risk this date could become the default date for all filings. 7.26 As a result, we consider that this is a matter best left to the discretion of the Commissioner, possibly subject to a requirement that the progress of the dispute is not unduly delayed. Taxpayers will still have the two-month response period in which to prepare their documents and will still be able to have their circumstances considered under the “exceptional circumstances” test in the event of situations genuinely beyond their control (such as sudden illness or a natural disaster affecting the taxpayer’s locality). We therefore suggest that the combined test should be a matter that the Commissioner considers upon application from a taxpayer. If this suggestion is adopted, administrative guidelines as to the application of the test may be needed. Agents and the current exceptional circumstances test 7.27 We believe that the current exceptional circumstances test for agents works well. Although it imposes a higher standard on tax agents, it is not usual for the law to “expect more” from people who are acting in a professional capacity in a highly skilled environment. The recent TRA decision in Case Z25 shows that agents should be able to rely on the exceptional circumstances test in appropriate situations. 30 How should “exceptional circumstances” decisions be made? 7.28 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission considers that taxpayers should have a general ability to apply to the Court for an extension of time (as the Commissioner has under section 89N(3)). 7.29 We do not agree that a hearing authority should be the first port of call for taxpayers who claim exceptional circumstances (or an intention to dispute). There will always be cases when there is obviously an exceptional circumstance that has prevented the timely production of the relevant document. There is no need to involve the courts in these cases; a decision to accept late documents can be made more cheaply and easily by the Commissioner. Similarly, when the taxpayer clearly has an intention to dispute, the suggested indicators would mean that the Commissioner was in a good position to make the necessary decision. 30 Taxation Review Authority NZTRA No 022/09 Dec No 5/2010, Hearing: 21 January 2010; Decision: 11 February 2010. 41 7.30 The question therefore is whether the taxpayer should be able to appeal an exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion. Under current law, an exceptional circumstance decision is not a “disputable decision”. The only option for a taxpayer who disagrees with the Commissioner’s decision on the existence of an exceptional circumstance is therefore to have that decision judicially reviewed. 7.31 The Court of Appeal has confirmed that the established principles of judicial review in tax cases (being, essentially, dishonesty or deliberate maladministration) should not be widened, and that the use of judicial review in other than extreme cases is an abuse of process. 31 As a result, judicial review places a very high burden of proof on to a taxpayer who is looking to have a decision reviewed by the Court, and is also likely to involve considerable expense (both for the taxpayer and the Commissioner seeking to defend the decision). 7.32 As discussed in the previous chapter, disputable decisions for tax purposes should generally be decisions that relate to matters that directly impact on the tax liability. 7.33 In our view, judicial review is too cumbersome a tool to deal with what should be a fairly simple administrative matter that would normally be made by the Commissioner in the first instance. The preferable approach is to allow instead for the consideration of exceptional circumstances to be a disputable decision. 7.34 Making the Commissioner’s decision on exceptional circumstances “disputable” has a number of advantages: • It is analogous to a “typical” disputable decision in that it directly impacts on the quantum of tax payable by the taxpayer. Deemed acceptance of the Commissioner’s decision results in all tax, interest and penalties becoming payable immediately. • The provisions by which disputable decisions are challenged in a hearing authority are well understood by the Commissioner and taxpayers (and their agents). • The general jurisdiction of the TRA is well-equipped to deal with challenges of this kind. 7.35 Making an exceptional circumstances decision disputable may involve the following consequential changes: • A rule to confirm that, if the matter was decided in favour of the taxpayer (so that the dispute continued), it would then fall back into the relevant stage of the disputes process for that process on the substantive issue to continue. 31 Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR (2009) 24 NZTC (23,340). 42 • A suspension of the time-bar (and any relevant intermediate disputes process timeframes) for the period between when the Commissioner’s decision is made and resolution of the matter by the courts. Change in the law 7.36 Section 89L(3)(b) clarifies that a change in tax law is a circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner. This section is phrased as being “for the avoidance of doubt” and was introduced to provide for circumstances when the Commissioner is confronted with a new law but there is insufficient time to consider its application to the dispute in question. 7.37 As the Commissioner is an officer of the executive branch of government, a change in law is undoubtedly beyond the control of the Commissioner, which explains the fact that it is phrased as only being for the avoidance of doubt. 7.38 There is equally little doubt that a change in tax law (however affected) would also be a circumstance beyond the control of a taxpayer. Therefore, we consider there is scope for the provision to be removed or be extended so that it also applies to the taxpayer. 43 Chapter 8 DEALING WITH SMALL CLAIMS This chapter suggests that: • the administrative opt-out process, as governed by the new opt-out guidelines, should effectively deal with all small claims; • the existing small claims jurisdiction of the TRA should be repealed; and • it is not necessary to introduce a specialist tribunal for “very small” tax disputes. 8.1 The fact that, in recent years, fewer tax cases reached the courts is consistent with the Richardson Committee’s aim of increasing the number of tax disputes that are resolved before the parties have to resort to the courts. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that taxpayers are unwilling to pursue small claims against the Commissioner because they find the disputes process too onerous. This occurs when the costs of the disputes process outweigh the amount of tax at stake and the taxpayer therefore concedes or settles the dispute. 8.2 The result of imposing the full disputes process on relatively small claims may be that some legitimate disputes are not being aired. This is likely to have repercussions for the integrity of the tax system, because the affected taxpayers may come to have less faith in its overall fairness. 8.3 This chapter looks at options for improving the small claims processes, including a review of the existing small claims jurisdiction of the TRA and the role of the bilateral opt-out process. The small claims jurisdiction 8.4 To provide an avenue for small claims to be dealt with quickly and efficiently, the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA was established in 1996. This was supplemented by the release, in 1998, of standard practice statement INV-140, which sets out the Commissioner’s criteria for fast- tracking “small, simple disputes” to resolution. 44 8.5 Section 89E allows a taxpayer to elect for the dispute to be heard in the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction where the proposed adjustment is $30,000 or less. This election can be made in the taxpayer’s NOPA (for a taxpayer-initiated dispute) or their NOR (for a Commissioner-initiated dispute). 32 If the taxpayer makes this election, it is irrevocable. 33 8.6 The election effectively circumvents the remainder of the disputes process through an exception to completing the full process, under section 89N, which applies when an election is made. 8.7 There is no separate set of rules that govern proceedings in the TRA when it is acting in its small claims jurisdiction. Taxpayers have the right to represent themselves in the general jurisdiction of the TRA, and this remains true for the small claims jurisdiction. Perceived problems with the small claims jurisdiction 8.8 In addition to the $30,000 threshold, there are other limitations on the small claims jurisdiction. It can only hear disputes when: 34 • the facts are clear and not in dispute; and • there is no significant legal issue, or there are no other taxpayers that may be affected by the result. 8.9 These other limitations are fairly substantial in practice. There are very few tax cases involving no disputed facts. Often cases will turn on fact patterns, or the parties’ interpretation of factual matters. Equally, for cases when the facts are genuinely clear, it is often at least arguable that there is a “significant” legal issue at stake. Regarding the application to other taxpayers, the Commissioner certainly has the ability to argue that the fact pattern present in a particular case could be repeated across, for example, an industry group. Such an argument may result in the small claims jurisdiction being unavailable to a disputant even where the tax effect is small and the facts clear. 32 In the circumstances set out in section 138O(1) of the TAA, the Commissioner may challenge the taxpayer’s election and apply to the TRA to have the proceedings transferred to either the general jurisdiction of the TAA or the High Court. Similarly, under section 138O(2), the TRA itself can require the proceedings to be transferred to its general jurisdiction. 33 Section 89E(2). 34 Section 13B, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. 45 8.10 Another perceived disadvantage of electing the small claims jurisdiction (from both parties’ perspective) is that any decision of the TRA acting in its small claims capacity is final – that is, there is no right of appeal to the High Court. 35 There is no appeal right from the TRA acting in its general jurisdiction if the amount of tax involved is less than $2,000 or the amount of the net loss is less than $4,000. 36 However, by electing to have the case heard by the small claims jurisdiction, a taxpayer is effectively extending this general prohibition on appeals for any tax amounts between $2,000 and $30,000. 8.11 Perhaps as a result of these factors, there have been only six disputes taken to the small claims jurisdiction since its establishment in 1996. Comments from Judge Barber also suggest that, even on the few occasions the small claims jurisdiction has been used, it is not necessarily the best forum for those disputes. 37 INV-140 8.12 The former administrative “fast-track” procedure, set out in standard practice statement INV-140, is also of limited value. This is because it effectively replicates the small claims jurisdiction requirements of the facts being undisputed and the case not involving any significant legal issues. It also operates on a lower monetary threshold ($15,000) and introduces an additional requirement that the issue is non-recurrent for the particular taxpayer. It is anticipated that the revised SPSs will supersede INV-140. What is a small claim? 8.13 There is no “one size fits all” model for determining what constitutes a small claim. For a small business owner, a tax dispute of $10,000 could have a material impact on the business while, for a large enterprise, a dispute of over $100,000 may not necessary be of major consequence in terms of the balance sheet or shareholder value. Equally, a large enterprise may consider it worthwhile pursuing a tax dispute for a relatively small sum because of the precedential value the outcome may have for it in subsequent tax periods. 8.14 That said, there needs to be effective procedures in place to identify disputes that do not justify application of the entire disputes process. Given that small disputes are proportionately more likely to affect SMEs (who bear a relatively higher proportion of tax compliance costs), these costs should, wherever possible, be kept to a minimum. 35 Section 26A(2), Taxation Review Authority Act 1994. 36 Section 26A(1). 37 Judge Barber Observations from the bench, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 2007 Conference, page 3. 46 Possible solutions Administrative opt-out 8.15 Under the proposed opt-out guidelines, the Commissioner will agree to opt- out of the disputes process when a meaningful conference has taken place and the tax in dispute is less than $75,000. Implementation of these guidelines will result in small claim disputants effectively having a “fast track” to the TRA. 8.16 Implementation of the opt-out guidelines is likely to result in fewer taxpayer elections to use the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA. As a result, there is a strong case for removing the small claims jurisdiction altogether. This would be achieved by removing a taxpayer’s ability to elect to use this jurisdiction, and repealing the appropriate provisions of the Taxation Review Authority Act and Taxation Review Authorities Regulations. 8.17 The opt-out route may be preferable to the small claims jurisdiction, both because taxpayers will retain their appeal rights and because a facilitated conference should be a valuable forum for ensuring that all information and arguments are exchanged and explored. Removing the existing restrictions 8.18 Another possible approach to improving the process for small claims would be to amend the rules that stipulate when a taxpayer can elect to use the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA. In particular to: • increase the financial limit to $75,000; and • allow the small claims jurisdiction to decide factual disputes. 8.19 The lack of appeal rights would still make the election to the small claims jurisdiction more of a “gamble” for taxpayers. However, if appeals were allowed, the jurisdiction would hardly differ from the general TRA jurisdiction. 8.20 As we have noted, implementation of the opt-out guidelines should result in most disputes of under $75,000 being fast-tracked in any event. Taxpayers whose dispute is less than $75,000 will know from the outset that they will be eligible for fast-track treatment following a meaningful conference. 47 Making the small claims jurisdiction compulsory 8.21 The idea of bolstering these changes by making the small claims jurisdiction compulsory for disputes under a certain amount is not favoured. Compulsion would create genuine access to justice issues, assuming the restriction on appeals from the small claims jurisdiction remained. The full disputes process, or the process under an agreed opt-out, contains the most appropriate number of checks and balances to ensure that disputes are, as much as possible, resolved before they get to court. Given the uniqueness of each tax dispute, it is important to recognise that there are taxpayers whose disputes may be “small” (however that is defined) that nevertheless wish to go through the full disputes process. Very small claims 8.22 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission suggested that an area of particular concern is those disputes that are “very small”. Again, this term requires some definition, but for these purposes, we will assume that they are tax disputes where the tax at issue is $5,000 or under, which is the threshold used in Australia. 8.23 Currently, Inland Revenue has a strong emphasis on settling very small claims without the need for litigation. Although “settle” does not always equate to “compromise” (particularly in respect of core tax at stake), an approach based on care and management principles will continue to be taken for very small claims to ensure that the escalation of the dispute is proportionate to the amount at stake. 38 8.24 We consider that the new administrative opt-out process and care and management principles should effectively deal with very small claims. We are not therefore recommending any legislative change in this area. Nevertheless, what follows is a discussion of the possible options for very small claims, including the establishment of a separate tribunal for very small cases, should specific legislated approaches be considered desirable. Using the Disputes Tribunal 8.25 New Zealand already has a Disputes Tribunal for disputes where the amount is (generally) $15,000 or less. These disputes are resolved relatively quickly, with minimal cost and formality. 38 Section 6A(3). 48 8.26 Although the system has intuitive appeal for also dealing with tax disputes, we think it is unsuitable for the following reasons, all of which are inter- related: • The jurisdiction of the Disputes Tribunal is predominantly related to quasi-contractual or damage to property disputes. By contrast, tax disputes generally hinge on statutory interpretation, (irrespective of whether the dispute is on a novel point or one where the application of existing case law is necessary). • The individuals who oversee Disputes Tribunal hearings are all well- trained in matters pertinent to the Disputes Tribunal, are respected members of their local communities and have valuable mediation and fact-finding skills. However, they are not judges and it is a lot to expect for members of the community to be well-versed in the intricacies of tax law and how it should apply to a particular set of facts. • Tax law is not a discipline that easily lends itself to “rough justice”. Even small tax disputes can, because of the complexity of legislation and case law, involve fine, lengthy and sometimes precedential legal arguments. The Disputes Tribunal, where disputes are habitually resolved in less than two hours and lawyers do not represent either party, is not an appropriate forum for this type of legal argument. 8.27 On the other hand, the Disputes Tribunal can be an effective forum for resolving factual matters. In theory, if a tax dispute was for a small amount and turned only on its facts (when both parties agree that the outcome will be settled if certain factual findings are made), the Disputes Tribunal would be a good place to have these disputes resolved quickly and efficiently. However, any advantage of moving such disputes to the Disputes Tribunal would be outweighed by the inconvenience of different tax disputes going to different authorities, depending on their nature. In addition, as purely factual disputes are now part of the opt-out guidelines, they should be able to be heard by the TRA without undue delay. A specialist tribunal for very small claims 8.28 One option suggested in the NZICA-NZ Law Society submission is establishing a separate tribunal or authority for the hearing of very small tax claims. Such tribunals (or divisions of the main authorities) appear in various guises in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. 8.29 These countries allow for appeals to be made from decisions of the relevant hearing authority, although appeals from informal procedure cases in Canada are restricted to errors of law and matters akin to breaches of natural justice. 49 Australia 8.30 Australia has a tribunal known as the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal (STCT). This Tribunal, which is a branch of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, hears tax disputes when the amount of tax in dispute is less than A$5,000. If a taxpayer wishes to challenge a decision of the Australian Tax Office, they complete an application form (available from the STCT website) that requires them to provide their personal details, the amount of tax in dispute, a copy of the decision they are disputing and their reasons for disagreeing with the decision. In sending in the application form, there is a non-refundable filing fee, currently set at A$68 (which can be waived in the case of hardship). On receipt of this application form, the ATO must provide the STCT (and the taxpayer) with all documents that it has used to arrive at its decision. 8.31 Any hearing by the STCT is preceded by a conference between the taxpayer and the ATO that is facilitated by a Tribunal Member or Conference Registrar. If this conference is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute, the matter will be heard by the STCT by way of a public, but informal, hearing. United Kingdom 8.32 The United Kingdom and Canada both have broadly comparable fast-track procedures to take small claims to a relatively informal hearing body. 8.33 In the United Kingdom, the recently established Tax Chamber of the First- tier Tribunal will generally be the initial forum for all tax disputes. These disputes are divided into categories, depending on their level of complexity. The simplest cases are decided “on the papers” without any hearing. In such cases, taxpayers and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs produce the documentary evidence they believe supports their interpretation of events and the law. This is considered by the Tribunal and the parties are advised of the outcome. Where a hearing is requested by the taxpayer, or a “paper” classification is otherwise inappropriate, the case will be heard under the “basic” category. This provides for an informal hearing before the Tribunal where evidence is presented and witnesses called by the parties. The Tribunal aims to inform the parties of its decision at the conclusion of the hearing. 39 There is no filing fee. 39 There are actually four classifications of case in the First-tier Tribunal. In addition to “paper” and “basic”, a case can also be heard in the first instance as a “standard” or “complex” case, depending on its complexity or value. These latter two classifications are not discussed here because they are less likely to be used for very small disputes. 50 Canada 8.34 In Canada (assuming the taxpayer’s original objection has been rejected by the Canadian Tax Authority), a taxpayer can elect to have their appeal against an assessment heard by the Tax Court of Canada’s “informal procedure”. The informal procedure is only available if the disputed federal tax is not more than C$12,000, the disputed loss is no more than C$24,000 or interest is the only matter in dispute. An informal hearing does not have to follow legal or technical rules of evidence and the decision of the Court has no precedential value. The filing fee for using the informal procedure is C$100, which is less than the fees payable for using the “general procedure”. Application to New Zealand 8.35 An obvious difference between the countries mentioned above and New Zealand is that the taxpayer is appealing against a decision of the relevant tax authority. In other words, these jurisdictions operate on a fundamentally different structure, whereby the revenue authority issues an amended assessment and a dispute ensues from that. By contrast, in New Zealand, the bulk of the dispute takes place before the assessment being issued. The policy rationale for this difference is well documented. 8.36 Although it could be argued that for very small claims, the dispute could be more easily dispensed with by an independent body, the approach to issuing a NOPA (as outlined in the revised SPSs) should greatly assist taxpayers by ensuring that impartial decisions are taken earlier in the process than previously. This approach should therefore result in better choices being made around abandoning disputes with either a low prospect of success or when the costs of pursuing marginal cases are likely to outweigh the benefits of taking them through the disputes process. 8.37 The revised SPSs, in relation to the guidelines on NOPA size, should also ensure that the documents that are produced by the Commissioner in very small claims are concise, so that responding to them does not place an undue compliance cost on the taxpayer concerned. 8.38 Another key disadvantage in adding another disputes tribunal layer into the New Zealand system is the associated costs. The benefits of having a separate, informal disputes forum for very small claims do not appear to outweigh the costs associated with the establishment and ongoing administration of such a body. Given that claims of up to $75,000 are likely to be fast-tracked to the TRA in any event, taxpayers can take some comfort from the fact that compliance costs should be minimised in all “smaller” disputes. 8.39 The TRA also has a good deal of flexibility in its ability to set its own processes. It is a commission of enquiry, rather than governed by strict court rules, and taxpayers can represent themselves. This flexibility provided to the TRA should continue to ensure that very small claims that do make it to hearing are dealt with efficiently. 51 Filing fees 8.40 In the interests of access to justice for small claims, the current TRA filing fee of $400 may be considered disproportionately large. However, given the amount of time that taxpayers will generally spend on the dispute, coupled with the cost of any professional advice in reaching the hearing stage (even if the opt-out is used), we do not consider the fee to be prohibitive. In any case, Regulation 10A of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations allows the taxpayer to apply to the Registrar to have the filing fee waived in cases of hardship. 52 Chapter 9 TEST CASES This chapter looks at the procedures surrounding test cases. It concludes that the Australian approach of having a separate test-case panel and taxpayer-funding for test cases is not desirable in New Zealand. Instead, it discusses the options of either test- case designation (that is, the dispute that is to be the test case) and the identity of the “affected” parties being determined by the High Court, or relying on existing court rules to perform the same function as the test-case provisions. 9.1 Occasionally, a number of taxpayers will have disputes with Inland Revenue that revolve around similar arrangements or transactions. 9.2 If the circumstances of the individual taxpayers are materially identical, it makes sense to have one case (referred to in this chapter as the “test case”) that is taken through the disputes process, with the outcome of that dispute being determinative for other taxpayers in the same situation (referred to in this chapter as the “affected cases”). 9.3 By having one case determine the outcome of others, all parties will have swifter resolution of the dispute. In addition, costs may be lower – as all affected cases can (in theory) contribute to the costs of the test case and the Commissioner will need to prepare just one case. The burden on the courts associated with hearing near-identical cases will be similarly relieved. However, current legislation and administrative practices fall short of fully achieving these objectives. Reasons for a test-case procedure 9.4 Before discussing solutions to these problems, we note that there are two main reasons justifying the existence of a formal test-case procedure: • the benefit and cost savings of having a number of disputes decided more quickly than would be the case if each dispute were to run its own individual course; and • test cases are arguably a good way of clarifying any uncertainty in the existing legislation (for example, it might be important to take a dispute that features a particular pattern of facts through the court system so that Inland Revenue and a particular industry group get a clear understanding of how the legislation applies). 53 9.5 The first reason is undeniable. Access to more timely and cost-effective justice is universally recognised as a desirable outcome of any judicial process. The objectives are of equal importance to each other, since there seems little point in having swift justice if it is prohibitively expensive – while a low cost solution that results in lengthy delay appears equally unattractive. 9.6 The idea that test cases provide legal clarity appears to be at least partially based on the notions that the law is static and the relationship between the disputing parties is effectively equal. The reality of the New Zealand parliamentary system is that, if the Government of the day believes that a decision of the courts does not reflect good policy (or the policy intent behind the provisions in question), it has the capacity to sponsor a legislative amendment so that the law reflects the position it is seeking to determine. The clarification of a legislative provision by the courts will therefore provide certainty in respect of law in force at the time relevant for the particular dispute, but will not always provide the parties with lasting clarity on legal implications of the arrangement in question. We therefore consider that the first objective is the more relevant one in considering possible changes to the test-case process. Current test-case rules 9.7 Section 138Q gives the Commissioner the power to designate a challenge as a test case if he “considers that determination of the challenge is likely to be determinative of all or a substantial number of the issues involved in one or more other challenges”. Designated test cases are always heard in the High Court. 9.8 Once a case has been designated as a test case, the Commissioner may stay proceedings for other cases that are considered to be subject to the outcome of the test case. This stay can only be issued if the other case has not itself been determined by a hearing authority (that is, it is in a pre-court phase of the disputes process). 40 A disputant has the right to challenge this stay. 41 Factors that the courts will consider relevant in considering the taxpayer’s challenge are: 42 • A taxpayer should not lightly have access to the courts denied, even for a time. • The closer the similarity in facts between the test case and the subject case, the more likely it is that the stay will be granted. • The more cases riding on the test case, the more likely it is that the stay will be granted. 40 Sections 138R(1) – (2). 41 Section 138R(3). 42 See Bage Investments Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,531; CIR v T 11/6/03, Williams J, HC Auckland, CIV 2003-404-3355; and B v CIR; CIR v Multiple taxpayers \[2004\] 2 NZLR 86 (para 36). 54 • The more tax involved, the less likely it is that the stay will be granted. • The longer the period between the events leading to the tax dispute and the likely resolution of that dispute if the case is “parked”, the less likely it is that the stay will be granted. • The more devastating the consequences of the unwanted stay on the taxpayer, the less likely it is that the stay will be granted. 9.9 However, when there is agreement that the test case will cover all of the material issues at stake, there must be very strong reasons for the Commissioner’s stay to be set aside. 43 When a stay applies, relevant statutory time limits are frozen. 44 9.10 Section 89O provides that a taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree to suspend proceedings subject to the resolution of a test case. This agreement is different from the stay issued unilaterally by the Commissioner under section 138R (see preceding paragraphs), in that this agreement can occur at any stage during the disputes process, whereas the stay generally only applies to cases when an amended assessment has already been issued. When a suspension of proceedings is agreed under section 89O, it applies until either the test case is resolved or the particular taxpayer’s dispute is otherwise resolved. 45 The Commissioner may issue an amended assessment to the “suspended” taxpayer that is consistent with the outcome of the test case. 46 9.11 Neither the Commissioner nor an affected taxpayer (either suspended or stayed) are bound by the outcome of the test case, meaning that any amended assessment issued by the Commissioner in accordance with the outcome of the test case can itself be challenged. Perceived problems with the test-case procedure 9.12 The existing test-case procedure appears to be causing some difficulties for both taxpayers and the Commissioner. Taxpayers 9.13 The NZICA-NZ Law Society submission raises the following concerns with the operation of the current test-case legislation: • The test-case designation is entirely in the hands of the Commissioner. • The Commissioner can take too long to determine whether a case should be treated as a test case. 43 CIR v Erris Promotions; Wilson & Black Associates Ltd v CIR; CIR v West Coast Developments Ltd \[2003\] 1 NZLR 506, para 30. 44 Section 138R(7). 45 Section 89O(3). 46 Section 89O(4). 55 • The procedure is seldom used and there is little guidance on how it would be used. • Some cases that are of potential precedential value do not appear before the courts because of “burn-off”. The Commissioner 9.14 From the Commissioner’s perspective, the following difficulties arise: • Taxpayers are often reluctant to have their case designated as a test case and will judicially review their selection. • Taxpayers are not bound by the test-case decision, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the procedure (in terms of time and cost savings to both parties). • If a designated test case is settled, further delay is caused while the remaining parties have to go through the test-case process again under a new designated case. Alternatively, delay will simply arise by reason of the time taken to settle. Possible solutions Test-case panel 9.15 In Australia there is a test-case litigation program\[me\] that applies to tax cases. To quote from the ATO website: Under the test case litigation program\[me\], the ATO provides financial assistance to taxpayers whose litigation is likely to be important to the administration of Australia’s revenue and superannuation systems. The aim of the program\[me\] is to develop legal precedent – that is, legal decisions that provide guiding principles on how specific provisions we administer should be applied more broadly. We are guided in the decision to fund such cases by the criteria contained in this guide and by a test case litigation panel. The panel includes members of the accounting and legal professions, to ensure that we fund issues of importance to the community. 9.16 Their criteria for funding are: • there is uncertainty or contention about how the law operates; • the issue is of significance to a substantial section of the public or a particular industry; and • it is in the public interest for the case to be litigated. 56 9.17 Taxpayers or an industry group generally apply for funding through a formal application process. 9.18 The programme is available to taxpayers: • that have a case that has commenced or is about to commence; • that have a potential case that is not yet fully developed; or • where there is a potential issue, but no live case at present. These cases are generally identified by associations that represent industry groups. The ATO, sometimes with the assistance of the relevant association, will attempt to identify a suitable case to test the issue and that taxpayer will then apply for test case funding. 9.19 For these taxpayer-initiated cases, the programme generally also covers appeals (by either party) to the Full Federal Court (but not the High Court). The ATO can also initiate test cases when it has identified an issue it feels needs clarification. ATO-initiated cases receive public funding without the need for the taxpayer to submit an application. 9.20 Public funding may also be available to taxpayers when the ATO loses in the original hearing authority and appeals against that decision. This funding may be available irrespective of whether the original hearing was part of the programme and is available for ATO appeals up to the High Court level. 9.21 The test case panel is an advisory body only. The chair of the panel is the ATO’s Chief Tax Counsel, who makes the final decision on whether funding is offered. The current panel comprises six people, four of whom are external. The panel meets four or five times a year where applications are generally considered. 9.22 Funding of test cases is generally formalised through the taxpayer and the ATO entering into a test case funding deed. This deed can cover funding for solicitors’ fees, counsels’ fees and disbursements up to a level that allows the taxpayer to match, but not exceed, the number and seniority of the counsel instructed by the ATO. Should the Australian approach apply in New Zealand? 9.23 There are a number of reasons for favouring the introduction of a similar programme in New Zealand: • It would promote clarity of law in complex areas. The early recognition of complex issues would allow both taxpayers and Inland Revenue some certainty on how the law applies – even in law that is relatively recently enacted. 57 • Taxpayer funding is more likely to result in taxpayers volunteering to either be the test case or be bound by the outcome. • Provided the Commissioner invariably followed the recommendation of a test case panel, the process would arguably be more transparent and acceptable to taxpayers. 47 9.24 Countered against these arguments are the following major disadvantages: • If the purpose of a test-case process is to aid cost reduction and timeliness rather than development of the law, there is more limited justification for funding some taxpayers and not others. • New Zealand is a small jurisdiction with a limited pool of independent persons qualified to sit on a panel. This is especially problematic for cases that involve a large number of prominent taxpayers. • There would be a fiscal cost associated with taxpayer funding of all or a substantial part of the costs of both parties to a protracted piece of litigation. There are policy concerns around the circumstances in which government funds should be diverted to assisting tax disputes. • There appear to be no major advantages over a court making the decisions, which may have substantial experience in test-case designation (discussed below). To introduce a separate body would appear to be an unnecessary duplication of resources. • The panel would need to be established through legislation. As a statutory body, its decisions would be subject to judicial review. Although we consider that the judicial review of the decisions of an independent panel would be rarer than the review of decisions by the Commissioner, this is by no means guaranteed. Therefore, in practical terms, the situation may not be materially advanced from the current position of these decisions being made by the Commissioner. 9.25 On balance, we consider that the disadvantages for having a taxpayer-funded test-case programme outweigh the advantages. Test-case matters decided by the courts 9.26 One of the major stumbling blocks of the current system appears to be that the test-case designation is made unilaterally by the Commissioner. Another possible way of tackling the issue of test-case designation and application may therefore be to replace the Commissioner’s power and instead have the matter determined directly by the courts. 47 In this respect it is worth noting that the ATO has, on occasion, declined to follow a funding recommendation by its Panel, see Review of Tax Office Management of Part IVC litigation, The Inspector General of Taxation, 28 April 2006, para 6.103. 58 9.27 Any such system should first allow the parties to reach decisions of their own accord. As a result, the affected taxpayers and the Commissioner should be afforded the opportunity to agree to a particular taxpayer dispute being a test case for a wider set of affected cases (irrespective of what stage in the disputes process these various taxpayers were currently in). To be consistent with the policy of expeditious resolution of disputes, there would need to be timeframes that governed the reaching of this agreement. 9.28 Failure to reach an agreement by the set deadline would enable an application to be made to the Court for test-case designation. As test cases are required to be heard by the High Court (and it seems sensible that this should continue), that Court would be the most appropriate forum for the application. 9.29 To avoid the parties filing simultaneous applications at the earliest possible opportunity, the Commissioner could be given a certain timeframe within which to file the relevant application. If the Commissioner failed to file within the allotted timeframe, the filing right would pass to the taxpayers concerned. 9.30 The original application (regardless of who it was ultimately filed by) would cover: • the taxpayer or taxpayers to be designated as the test case; and • the identity of the affected taxpayers. 9.31 The responding party could object to the application by one or both of the following methods: • arguing that the cases are inappropriate for test-case designation at all (this would need to be based on a notion that no one case, or set of cases, would be determinative of any other of the cases contained in the original application); and/or • arguing that the wrong taxpayer had been nominated as the test case and/or the list of affected taxpayers was incorrect (in that it named too many or too few taxpayers). 9.32 The High Court would then determine all matters under contention (that is, would designate a test case and the specific affected cases). Given that any such proceedings would not be determinative of the substantive proceedings, there may be a strong argument that the parties’ costs for the High Court and any subsequent appeals should lie where they fall. 9.33 Under this approach, the affected cases would be suspended and determined by the outcome of the test case. 59 9.34 The advantages of such an approach would be that: • The parties have the ability to discuss test-case designation to see if a mutually agreeable position can be found. • If there is disagreement, both parties have the opportunity to articulate their views on how, or if, the test scenario should apply to the circumstances. • The decision on test-case designation is made by an independent party. • High Court judges have experience in this type of process. Rule 10.12 of the High Court Rules 2008 allows a judge to consolidate proceedings if there are various cases that share common characteristics. Also, Rule 4.24 allows for representative action proceedings. 48 In practice, the effect of either of these provisions may be largely identical to test-case designation. If the rules for test-case designation were to effectively mirror one or both of these rules, the process should be familiar to the Court and therefore adopted with a minimum of disruption. 9.35 The disadvantages of such a system are: • There will invariably be disputes when there is disagreement on test- case designation and the scope of the affected cases. In such instances, there will be another delay to the substantive proceedings while the test-case designation is decided by the courts. Countered against this is the fact that current test-case designations made unilaterally by the Commissioner are frequently subject to judicial review in any event. • The system requires that all relevant taxpayers agree amongst themselves who the test-case taxpayer/s should be and who will be bound by the decision. • Such a system potentially places an additional burden on the court system, and there will be delays in every case while a hearing time before the High Court is obtained and then the Judge’s decision is released. • Decisions of the High Court on test-case designation would themselves be subject to appeal and hence further delay. Although it is possible to make a decision of the Court on this issue final, there are always access to justice concerns with such an approach. 48 McGechan on Procedure, Rule 2.24 synopsis. 60 Remove the test-case provisions 9.36 As mentioned previously, the High Court (High Court Rule 10.12 and 4.24) and the corresponding rules in the District Court (Rule 3.72.1 and 3.33.5), of which the TRA forms a part, have the ability to either consolidate two or more proceedings if the Court sees that there is a suitable number of similarities between them or allow one or more persons to sue or be sued on behalf of all persons with the same interest in the subject matter (known as “representative action”). 9.37 The courts have these powers and there is some established judicial guidance on when it is appropriate to use them. 49 Also, either party can apply for an order under either of these rules by way of interlocutory application. 50 9.38 One possibility is therefore to dispense with a separate statutory test-case procedure and leave it to the appropriate court to determine the circumstances in which consolidation of proceedings, representative action or the hearing of multiple cases simultaneously, would be appropriate. 9.39 Leaving matters entirely to the courts would appear to have the following advantages: • There would be no “additional” dispute between the parties; the substantive case for each taxpayer would appear before the court. • The TRA already has the ability to refer cases to the High Court, if appropriate. 51 Similarly, the Commissioner has the right to apply to the High Court to have any challenge proceedings transferred to the High Court if he thinks that Court is a more appropriate forum for the dispute. 52 The net result (of proceedings going straight to the High Court and then being either consolidated by the Court or heard as a representative action) would be the same test-case designation but without the need for the introduction of new rules. • The parties to a consolidated hearing or a representative action are bound by the substantive decision of the hearing authority. 49 See for example Medlab Hamilton Ltd v Waikato District Health Board (2007) 18 PRNZ 517, Callplus Ltd v Telecom New Zealand Ltd (2000) 15 PRNZ 14 in respect of consolidation and Houghton v Saunders \[2009\] NZCCLR 13; (2008) 19 PRNZ 173 in respect of representative action. 50 McGechan on Procedure, High Court Rules, paragraph 10.12.02. 51 Section 24, Taxation Review Authority Act 1994. 52 Section 138N(2). 61 9.40 The major disadvantage of this system would appear to be that a dispute must have reached the court hearing stage of the process before it can be consolidated. In practice, disputes with numerous taxpayers do not follow neat time-lines. The complexity of some cases compared with others, the ability to file documents at any time during a statutory time period, resource constraints and information imbalance all contribute to some disputes progressing through the disputes resolution process faster than others. It is therefore not uncommon for some taxpayers who are potentially test cases or affected cases to be at vastly different stages of the process. Having no way of grouping these taxpayers before they all reach the point where proceedings are before a hearing authority may result in undue delay in getting the substantive issues resolved. 9.41 Countered against this is the fact that the Commissioner has a wide discretion in relation to opting out of the disputes process (as discussed in earlier chapters). If the parties were in general agreement that either consolidation or representative action was appropriate, the Commissioner could agree to fast-track the relevant disputes to the challenge stage so the relevant hearing could begin at the earliest possible time. However, this scenario depends on two factors: • that all parties agree to be part of the consolidated or representative action proceedings. If there were no such agreement, the relevant party would not agree to opt out of the disputes process, effectively forcing the Commissioner to either take the case (or cases) that had already reached the hearing authority on its own, or apply for a court order under section 89N(3) to truncate the disputes process in respect of the “later” taxpayer/s; and • that the courts will be willing to adjourn the “first” challenge to allow the remaining disputes time to “catch up”. Again, this may also depend in some measure on the cooperation of the individual taxpayer. 9.42 Because of the uncertainty in leaving test-case decisions to the existing court rules, our initial preference would be to have a formal test-case procedure that would pre-empt all of the disputes reaching the filing stage. Although this could be achieved by administrative guidelines, we believe this is an instance where clear statutory language is preferable. Status quo 9.43 One option is to maintain the status quo. Given that test cases do not arise frequently, there may be an argument for simply maintaining the current system, despite its perceived flaws. This would be particularly attractive if significant improvements could be identified through remedial changes to the current rules. Although retaining the current system (or a variant of it) remains an option, the current review provides an ideal time to focus on this issue and, if possible, introduce a system that is more agreeable to both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. 62 Chapter 10 OTHER ISSUES This chapter discusses some other possible amendments to the TAA that, although relatively minor, logically fit within the scope of this review. They are a review of the use of the word “challenge” in the TAA and amendments to the rules related to the: • exceptions to when a Commissioner must issue a NOPA (in particular, section 89C(db)); and • financial relief rules (sections 177C(5) and (6)). Use of “challenge” 10.1 There are numerous places in the TAA and the Income Tax Act 2007 in which the word “challenge” is used. 53 In the TAA, this terminology can generally be traced to wholesale changes that implemented the current disputes process. These amendments were necessary to ensure that the legislation was clear as to whether the “old” objection procedure or the “new” challenge procedure would apply to the assessment in question. 10.2 The term “challenge” in the TAA has a particular meaning that relates only to challenges under Part VIIIA. It may not, however, be sufficiently clear that a taxpayer who disagrees with an assessment by the Commissioner made under specific sections should first go through the disputes process in Part IVA. Only if the matter is unresolved after going through the standard disputes process should the assessment be challenged in a hearing authority. 10.3 Although the relevant provisions in Part VIIIA attempt to ensure that a dispute has first been through the dispute process, there is concern that sections 138B and 138C are not particularly clear. 10.4 This issue is compounded by later amendments that confer on taxpayers the right to “dispute or challenge... under Parts IVA and VIIIA”. 54 10.5 We suggest a review of both Acts to ensure that appropriate terminology is used so that the disputes process is used in all appropriate circumstances. If necessary, this may include amendments to Part VIIIA to clarify this intent. 53 See, for example, section 44(3), TAA and section DB 3, Income Tax Act 2007. 54 This language is found in Part V (Determinations). See, for example, section 91AAB(5). 63 Section 89C(db) 10.6 Section 89C effectively allows the Commissioner to bypass the entire disputes process in certain limited circumstances. When these circumstances exist, the Commissioner may simply issue an assessment to the taxpayer. 10.7 The exception contained in section 89C(db) is where: The assessment is made in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for an assessment of the taxpayer for another period that is at the time the subject of court proceedings. 10.8 The intention behind section 89C(db) is that the Commissioner and the taxpayer do not need to go through the disputes process for every tax period in which a particular dispute is relevant. For example, a taxpayer adopts a particular income tax treatment of a series of annual transactions that occurred in each of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 income years and court proceedings are underway in respect of the 2007 transactions. Rather than having to complete the entire disputes process for the 2008 and 2009 periods, the Commissioner can simply issue an assessment for those periods that is consistent with the one issued for 2007. The later two periods can then be governed by the outcome of the court proceedings. Such an approach saves the compliance costs associated with unnecessary duplication. 10.9 However, the problem with the current wording of section 89C(db) is that there is no “corresponding” provision that relates to the actions to be taken by the taxpayer in the dispute. This means that, in the example above, even though the Commissioner can issue an amended assessment without having to go through the disputes process, a taxpayer cannot challenge that assessment without issuing a NOPA. If the taxpayer issues a NOPA then the Commissioner must issue a NOR before the taxpayer can then challenge at a hearing authority through the challenge provisions. (We note that if the proposed amendments to prevent a unilateral taxpayer opt-out at this stage were to be adopted, this problem could be further exacerbated.) 10.10 The requirement for a taxpayer to issue a NOPA in these circumstances clearly goes against the objective of section 89C(db), which is to provide a fast-track directly to a hearing authority for disputes that are essentially identical to those ones already being heard. Having all of the disputes at the hearing authority also provides the hearing authority with the opportunity to consolidate the proceedings if it considers such an approach desirable. A consequential amendment may also be necessary to section 138B to ensure that a disputant is immediately entitled to challenge the Commissioner’s assessment in these circumstances. 64 Suggested change 10.11 We suggest amending the TAA to clarify that a taxpayer does not have to issue a NOPA for an assessment made under section 89C(db) and can instead directly move to the challenge proceedings relating to that assessment. Sections 177C(5) and (6) 10.12 This issue appears to be a simple oversight created by a mismatch between the TAA and the Income Tax Act 2007. It can be summarised as follows: • Section 177C(5) and (6) requires tax losses to be extinguished at the same time as outstanding tax is written off. • A “net loss”, as defined in section YA of the Income Tax Act, factors in losses removed under section 177C(5). • An “assessment” as defined in section 3 of the TAA includes a determination of a “net loss” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. • Section 89C required a NOPA to be issued whenever the Commissioner is proposing to amend an assessment. 10.13 The result is that, under the current rules and unless a contrary position is agreed with the taxpayer, a NOPA is required to be issued by the Commissioner when tax losses are extinguished, even though the “main” decision – to write-off the tax debts – is not “disputable” by operation of section 138E. It seems illogical for there to be a situation where the Commissioner makes a non-disputable decision that is generally favourable to a taxpayer (that is, to write off the overall tax debt), but a mandatory side effect of that decision (to also extinguish tax losses) has to be subject to the disputes process. Suggested change 10.14 We suggest amending section 89C to clarify that the Commissioner does not need to issue a NOPA in circumstances where the Commissioner has made a decision to write-off tax debt under section 177C. Such an amendment would clarify that write-off decisions are not intended to be subject to the dispute process and would also capture any extinguishment of tax losses under sections 177C(5) and (6). 65 Annex THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCESS The disputes process was introduced in 1996 in response to the recommendations of the Richardson Committee. 55 The objection procedures at that time were perceived to be deficient, in that they did not adequately support the early identification and prompt resolution of issues leading to tax disputes. The Richardson Review recommended that a comprehensive approach to tax disputes be developed with the following objectives: • every practical effort be made to ensure that assessments are correct before they are issued; • any dispute be identified at the earliest practical time; • communication between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue be direct and open to ensure that all information relevant to the dispute is available as soon as possible; and • appropriate independent advice within Inland Revenue be provided at the earliest practical time. In response, a pre-assessment phase was introduced, comprising a set of prescribed steps to facilitate the “all cards on the table” approach to tax dispute resolution. This annex describes in detail the legislative steps that make up the disputes resolution process. How does a dispute arise? A dispute may arise when a taxpayer and Inland Revenue have not reached agreement on a tax position taken in a taxpayer’s self-assessment, and often follows an audit of the taxpayer. If no agreement has been reached on some or all of the issues identified, Inland Revenue will begin the disputes process by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). Alternatively, a taxpayer may dispute his or her own assessment or disputable decision made by the Commissioner by issuing a NOPA. 55 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994. 66 The time-bar The TAA imposes time limits for increasing assessments. If a taxpayer has furnished a return and made an assessment, the Commissioner may not amend the assessment to increase the amount assessed if four years have passed from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the return. 56 The Commissioner is prevented from refunding amounts of overpaid income tax after four years from the end of the year in which the original assessment was made. 57 The Commissioner cannot refund amounts of overpaid GST after four years from the end of the taxable period in which tax was assessed. 58 The time-bar does not apply if the Commissioner is of the opinion that a return is fraudulent, wilfully misleading or does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. 59 The disputes process Once a dispute has begun, the issuing of a correct assessment is intended to be achieved through a series of steps prescribed in Part IVA. Once an assessment is issued, the challenge process, involving litigation in the courts, as set out in the TAA begins. The main legislative elements of the pre-assessment phase of the disputes resolution process are: • Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA); • Notice of Response (NOR); and • Disclosure notice and Statement of Position (SOP). There are also two important administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. The current application of all these elements is explained in more detail below. The Notice of Proposed Adjustment The NOPA is the first formal step in the disputes process. 56 See section 108 and for GST assessments, section 108A. 57 See section RM, Income Tax Act 2007. 58 See section 45, GST Act 1985. 59 See section 108(2). 67 The content of a NOPA is prescribed. It must contain sufficient detail to reasonably inform the recipient of: 60 • the adjustments or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; • the tax laws on which the adjustments are based; • a statement of the facts giving rise to the adjustments; and • a statement of how the law applies to the facts. The purpose of the NOPA is to ensure that the party receiving the notice is aware of the arguments on which the other party is relying. Reducing these points to writing emphasises the need to review the positions of Inland Revenue or the taxpayer and is intended to foster open and frank discussion early in the resolution process in terms of the “all cards on the table” objective. Providing adequate information also ensures that the NOPA can be responded to fully. The taxpayer may dispute his or her own assessment by issuing a NOPA within two months after the date of the notice of assessment. Acceptance of Notice of Proposed Adjustment If the adjustment is accepted in writing, or the adjustment is deemed to have been accepted, because either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer has not responded in time, the disputes process ends and an amended assessment is issued or the assessment stands. 61 No further challenge may be made to that adjustment. 62 A late response by a taxpayer is deemed to have been received within the response period if exceptional circumstances apply. Exceptional circumstances are discussed in detail in Chapter 7 of this document. The Notice of Response If the taxpayer or Inland Revenue disagrees with one or more of the proposed adjustment in a NOPA, the taxpayer must notify the other party by issuing a NOR within two months of the date of issue of the NOPA. 63 The NOR is the vehicle used by the recipient of the NOPA to formally reply to the proposed adjustment. 60 See section 89F. 61 See sections 89H and also 89J. 62 See section 89I. 63 Section 89AB defines “response period”. For these purposes, this is two months from the date of issue of the originating document. 68 The content of the NOR must: 64 • specify the facts or legal arguments in the NOPA that the recipient considers to be in error and why they are in error; • specify the facts and tax laws that are relied on by the recipient and how the law applies to the facts; and • state the adjustments to a figure referred to in the NOPA as a result of the above factors. Small claims election A taxpayer may indicate in his or her NOPA or NOR (in a dispute initiated by the Commissioner) that he or she wishes to be heard before the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). 65 The TRA’s jurisdiction includes the determination of small claims where the facts are clear and not in dispute, the tax to pay or tax effect is below $30,000 and no significant legal issues or precedent are involved. The taxpayer is bound by the decision of the TRA. Conference Conferences between the Commissioner and the taxpayer were administratively prescribed following a recommendation by the Richardson Committee. The purpose of the conference, of which there may be more than one, is to facilitate the resolution of any disputed facts and issues that have been raised in the NOPA and NOR. Disclosure notice If the dispute is not resolved because the NOR is not accepted, the Commissioner may issue a disclosure notice. For disputes initiated by the Commissioner, the disclosure notice must be accompanied by a SOP. The disclosure notice is an important document because it triggers the application of the evidence exclusion rule. The evidence exclusion rule is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 64 See section 89G(2). 65 See section 89E. 69 The Statement of Position Each party’s SOP must: 66 • give an outline of the facts on which the party intends to rely; • give an outline of the evidence on which the party intends to rely; • give an outline of the issues that the party considers will arise; and • specify the propositions of law on which the party intends to rely. Statement of Position in Commissioner-initiated disputes If the Commissioner initiates the dispute, then the Commissioner must issue a SOP at the same time that a disclosure notice is issued. 67 The taxpayer must file his or her own SOP within two months of the disclosure notice. 68 The taxpayer may apply to the High Court for further time to issue the SOP provided that the taxpayer applies within two months and it is unreasonable to reply because the issues in dispute had not previously been discussed. 69 If the taxpayer fails to respond to the Commissioner’s SOP and the taxpayer has not applied to the High Court for more time in which to reply, the taxpayer will be considered to have accepted the proposed adjustment as detailed in the Commissioner’s SOP or NOPA. 70 The Commissioner has a right of reply to the taxpayer’s SOP 71 but must exercise this right within two months of the date of issue of the taxpayer’s SOP. Any additional information in the reply then becomes part of the Commissioner’s SOP. 72 The Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an extension of time to reply to the taxpayer’s SOP. 73 The extension may be granted if the Commissioner applies before the expiry of the two-month period in which to respond to the taxpayer’s SOP and it is unreasonable to reply within the period owing to the number, complexity or novelty of the matters raised in the taxpayer’s SOP. 74 The need to apply to the High Court may arise when the taxpayer’s SOP refers to facts, issues, evidence or propositions of law that have not previously been disclosed and it is necessary for the Commissioner to obtain and consider these matters. 66 See sections 89M(4) and 89M(6). 67 See section 89M(3). 68 See section 89M(5). 69 See section 89M(11). 70 See section 89M(7) TAA. 71 See section 89M(8) TAA. 72 See section 89M(9) TAA. 73 See section 89M(10) TAA. 74 Ibid. 70 Statement of Position when the taxpayer initiates the dispute If the taxpayer has initiated the dispute, the taxpayer may issue a statement of position within two months of the date that the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice. 75 It is standard practice for the Commissioner to issue a SOP in reply – generally within three months of receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP. The taxpayer does not have a right to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP. However, the Commissioner and the taxpayer may agree to additional information being added, at any time, to their SOPs. 76 Adjudication A dispute that is not resolved by the end of the SOP phase is generally referred to the Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit. The function of this Unit is to consider the dispute impartially and independently of the audit function. The Adjudication Unit makes the assessment decision on behalf of the Commissioner. As a result, if the Unit finds in favour of the taxpayer, the dispute will conclude. On the other hand, if the Unit finds that an adjustment is necessary, an assessment consistent with that finding will be issued. Assessment An assessment as amended by the Commissioner is issued after completion of the disputes process, or the original assessment stands. Post-assessment challenge A taxpayer is entitled to challenge an assessment by beginning proceedings in a court within the two-month response period. 77 75 See section 89M(5) TAA. 76 See sections 89M(13) and 89M(14) TAA. 77 See section 138B(1). 71 Figure 2: Process for a dispute initiated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Taxpayer who is required to file return must make an assessment CIR issues NOPA? s 89B(1) May elect small claims jurisdiction of TRA Taxpayer issues NOR? rejecting NOPA s 89G(1) CIR accepts NOR?

Introduction 1.1 The Capital Market Development Taskforce recommended pursuing opportunities to develop New Zealand as an exporter of high-value middle and back-office services for fund management companies in its final report to Government in December 2009. One of the areas the Capital Market Development Taskforce identified where New Zealand could export financial market services was an Asia Pacific funds domicile. 1 Our location in the Asia-Pacific region gives us the opportunity to develop a regulatory and tax regime that will support high-value middle and back-office functions to parts of the international financial services industry, such as funds management, and raise New Zealand’s profile as a successful niche player in financial services. 1.2 The Government has therefore established a private sector advisory group to report back on how New Zealand can successfully position and market itself as an international funds domicile. The Government is also interested in how this positioning might create opportunities for strengthening New Zealand’s funds management industry and capital markets, and raise New Zealand’s profile as a successful niche player in financial services. 1.3 New Zealand generally operates a source-based taxation system where residents are taxed on their worldwide income and non-residents are taxed on their New Zealand-sourced income. However, non-residents investing in foreign assets through a portfolio investment entity (PIE) are currently taxed on income from the PIE as if they were residents. This treatment is inconsistent with how those investors would be taxed if they invested directly in those foreign assets and so is conceptually inconsistent with New Zealand’s source-based taxation system. 1.4 A proposal to exempt foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE from New Zealand tax was raised in the report, Creating Wealth for New Zealanders. 2 This proposal was again raised during the Job Summit in January 2009. 1.5 Any decision to proceed with a proposal to allow a zero percent tax rate for non-resident investing in a PIE will need to weigh up potential benefits, costs and risks. 1 A domicile is the legal “home” of a managed fund. These domiciles play a critical role in the international funds management infrastructure and generate local economic activity in funds administration. 2 Stobo C., September 2008. 2 1.6 This issues paper seeks feedback on the benefits, costs and risks of options for allowing a zero percent tax rate for non-resident investors in a PIE. Under the changes suggested, non-resident investors would be taxed in the same way as investments that are made directly. This would be consistent with applying a source-based taxation model. Officials are interested in feedback on the perceived benefits and compliance costs of the options outlined. In particular: • Whether the funds management industry has a preferred option. • Whether and why a minimum level of New Zealand-sourced income is useful under an option that is generally restricted to vehicles investing in foreign- sourced income. • The appropriate level for the minimum threshold exemption. • Whether the minimum threshold level should be an income or asset test. • Whether the risks outlined in pages 4–7 to exempt foreign-sourced income derived by non-residents through a PIE are real risks, and the perceived likelihood of them occurring. • The likelihood of the proposed benefits outlined in pages 3–4 occurring.

Benefits and risks of applying source-based taxation to non-resident PIE investors 2.1 Certain sectors of the financial services industry consider that, with the appropriate tax treatment in place, they could market investments in foreign assets through New Zealand PIEs to non-resident investors, resulting in the following benefits. Consistency with New Zealand’s source-basis taxation model 2.2 Introducing a tax exemption for foreign-sourced income derived by a non- resident through a PIE would ensure consistency with New Zealand’s source- basis taxation model. 2.3 New Zealand generally operates a source-basis taxation system where residents are taxed on their worldwide income and non-residents are taxed on their New Zealand-sourced income. However, non-residents investing in foreign assets through a PIE are currently taxed as if they were a New Zealand resident. This treatment is inconsistent with the way that investors would be taxed if they invested directly, and is inconsistent with our source- basis taxation system. Cost reductions for existing New Zealand firms who manage foreign funds 2.4 Currently, very few New Zealand firms manage investments for non-resident investors. This is due to the intensely domestic orientation of the local financial services industry. However, the financial services industry estimates that a tax exemption, such as that suggested in this issues paper, would result in $1 million a year cost savings based on the difference between foreign and local administration costs. Creation of new firms and relocation of foreign-based activity to New Zealand 2.5 It has been suggested that the tax exemption (in combination with some other regulatory measures) could lead to a percentage of global market back-room and administrative services being migrated to New Zealand. New Zealand is seen as being a suitable base for these services because of the regulatory framework, political stability, lack of corruption and exchange controls, and the difference in time zones which allows New Zealand to process overnight transactions which are made that day in Europe or the United States. 4 2.6 The financial services industry estimates that New Zealand could gain a market share of these activities after 10 years of development. Assuming revenues of 1 percent of assets under management and a 30 percent profit margin, this could create approximately NZ$1 billion of profits and approximately NZ$300 million in taxes. Spin-offs for local investors 2.7 The development of an “export”-focussed investment industry could have positive spin-off effects for New Zealand investors accessing the benefits of scale in the new funds. This could lead to a decrease in aggregate fees charged for fund administration and investment management services. 2.8 The potential benefits and costs of the suggested changes require further investigation. They include weighing the value of these potential back-room and administrative services against the fiscal costs and potential fiscal risks of implementing an exemption for foreign-sourced income derived by a non- resident through a PIE. Fiscal implications 2.9 The estimated fiscal cost of exempting foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE from New Zealand tax will depend upon the amount of foreign-sourced income currently derived by non-residents through managed funds. 2.10 Information provided by the funds management industry indicates that as at December 2008, overseas investments accounted for 40 percent ($22 billion) of total funds invested of $56 billion. With respect to the residency of investors, officials understand that less than 1 percent of investors in the New Zealand funds management industry are non-residents. Therefore, using the fair dividend rate of 5 percent as a measure of the returns earned on these investments, the estimated fiscal cost would be less than $10 million per annum. 3 2.11 In carrying out a cost-benefit analysis, thought needs to be given to administrative and compliance costs associated with the suggested changes. These will depend on the detail of the particular option selected, should the Government decide to proceed. 3 Estimated fiscal cost = $21,000,000,000 foreign investments made by managed funds \* 5% FDR \* 1% non- resident investors \* 30% current NZ tax rate. In addition to the cost of exempting the foreign-sourced income of non-residents from New Zealand tax, some of the proposals include a de minimis exemption for certain investments in New Zealand assets. Allowing non-residents to have a zero percent tax rate in respect of New Zealand-sourced income will have an additional fiscal cost, depending on the de minimis limit selected. 5 Ability for investors to re-characterise New Zealand-sourced income 2.12 Generally, income derived by an investor from a PIE is excluded income. This means an investor is able to claim tax deductions relating to that income – for example, management fees and interest incurred in borrowing to purchase units in the PIE. 2.13 In order to provide an exemption for foreign income derived by a non- resident investor in a PIE, PIE income that relates to offshore investments and that is allocated to a non-resident investor could be deemed to be foreign- sourced income of the investor. This would not be assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes. As a result, there would be no allowable deductions arising from the PIE investment to offset against any other New Zealand-sourced income. The technical position achieved would be consistent with a non-resident investing directly in foreign investments and with source-based taxation. 2.14 However, because of the fungibility of money, exempting foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE from New Zealand tax could still give rise to a practical fiscal risk. Even if a deduction is not technically available, it may be difficult to trace where funds have been applied. 2.15 This risk exists already with branch activities and is not an issue specific to exempting foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE from New Zealand tax. The ability for New Zealand investors to re-characterise as non-resident investors 2.16 There are also concerns that New Zealand investors could restructure to take advantage of the exemption. 2.17 A New Zealand investor who invests in a PIE that invests in foreign investments would currently have a prescribed investor rate (PIR) based on their marginal tax rate up to a maximum of 30%. However, if the changes suggested in this issues paper were to go ahead, the New Zealand investor could establish a foreign company which then invests in the PIE. The foreign company would be a controlled foreign company (CFC). 2.18 Under the new international tax rules, passive income derived by a CFC is attributable to and taxed in New Zealand. The definition of passive income does not include PIE income. As a result, it would constitute active income and no New Zealand tax would be collected. 2.19 This issue could be addressed by amending the definition of “passive income”. However, if the CFC were an Australian company, it would be a grey list entity and therefore not subject to the attribution rules. 6 2.20 One potential solution to this issue could be to limit the exemption to individual non-resident investors or to exclude CFCs and non-resident trustees of trusts with a New Zealand settlor. 2.21 This solution could be viewed as undesirable as it would prevent the zero percent rate applying to many investors to whom it should apply – for example, foreign companies with no New Zealand shareholders. Manipulation of expenses between investor classes 2.22 There are also concerns that investors could restructure their apportionment of deductible expenses to take advantage of the exemption. This is unlikely to be possible within an investor class because of the comprehensive rules regarding attribution of income and expenses to individual investors. However, it may be possible between investment classes. This would occur where deductible expenses are disproportionately applied to investor classes which hold New Zealand-sourced assets as against classes which invest in foreign assets. International tax policy concerns with a tax exemption for offshore funds 2.23 The 1998 OECD report, Harmful Tax Competition − An Emerging Global Issue, outlined the factors used to identify harmful tax practices as: • A low or zero effective tax rate on the relevant income. • Ring-fencing to restrict the tax benefits to non-residents or prevent non- residents from accessing the domestic market. Ring-fencing effectively protects the sponsoring country from the harmful effects of its own incentive regime, so that the regime only has adverse effects on foreign tax bases. As a result, the country offering the regime may bear little or none of the financial burden of its own preferential tax legislation. • A lack of transparency in the way the regime is designed and administered. Non-transparency is a broad concept that includes favourable application of laws and regulations, negotiable tax provisions, and a failure to make administrative practices widely available. • A lack of effective exchange of information in relation to taxpayers benefiting from the operation of the preferential tax regime. 2.24 The OECD report recommended that member countries refrain from adopting new measures or extending the scope of existing measures that constitute harmful tax practices. As an OECD member, New Zealand is obligated to refrain from introducing any tax regime that contravenes the principles set out above. 7 2.25 The proposal to have a zero percent tax rate for non-resident investors in a PIE also raises wider international relationship issues. One of the conclusions from the April 2009 G20 summit was that member countries agreed to enforce sanctions on “tax haven” countries that are noncompliant with Article 26 of the OECD model tax convention for income and capital. Article 26 deals with tax information-sharing agreements between countries. Member countries also asked the OECD to publish a list of tax havens and their compliance with the information-sharing regulations. Therefore, the ramifications of introducing a harmful tax practice are wider than New Zealand’s OECD membership responsibilities, and we should adopt a cautious approach in this area as: • the boundaries of what is harmful tax competition are not clear cut; • there is more scrutiny when introducing new regimes compared with extending or retaining existing regimes; and • the proposals raise concerns about New Zealand’s ability to meet its disclosure of information obligations. 2.26 The risks associated with New Zealand’s international tax obligations will need to be considered carefully when suggesting different options for exempting foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE from New Zealand tax. 8 3. Potential solutions 3.1 Two high-level options have been identified for exempting foreign-sourced income derived by a non-resident through a PIE: • A PIE with resident and non-resident investors and only foreign- sourced income. The non-resident investors would have a zero percent portfolio investor rate (PIR) for all income. Resident investors would have standard PIRs. • A look-through global investment option that would allow a PIE to have both resident and non-resident investors and New Zealand and foreign-sourced income. The PIE would apply a different tax rate to different types of income derived by non-resident investors and it would therefore be necessary to track income from different sources, apportion expenditure to that income and allocate it to investors as if each stream were the only income derived by the PIE. 3.2 These options are discussed in more detail below. Option 1: PIE with resident and non-resident investors and foreign- sourced income 3.3 This option would allow resident and non-resident investors to invest in a PIE that derived only foreign-sourced income, with perhaps some allowance for a minimum threshold of investment in New Zealand equity and debt. The non- resident investors would have a zero percent PIR for all income of the PIE, including the minimum income threshold from New Zealand sources discussed below. 3.4 Income that relates to offshore investments and that is allocated to a non- resident would be deemed to be foreign-sourced income. A CFC and non- resident trustee of a trust settled by a New Zealand resident would be treated as residents for the purposes of applying the exemption. 3.5 In exploring the type and level of New Zealand-sourced income that could be allowed under a minimum threshold exemption, officials have compared the treatment a non-resident investor would receive if the investment were made directly with that received if the investment were made through the PIE. If the non-resident would be more favourably treated when investing through the PIE, we propose a restriction on that income. For example: • Interests in land. A non-resident investing directly in an interest in New Zealand land pays New Zealand tax on any lease payments. A non-resident would be more favourably treated if they had a zero rate in a PIE with New Zealand-sourced income derived from an interest in land. Officials therefore propose that a PIE that holds a direct interest in land in New Zealand not be eligible for this treatment. 9 • New Zealand equity. If a non-resident invests directly in shares in a New Zealand company, and receives a fully imputed dividend, the dividend will generally have borne New Zealand tax of 30%. Where a dividend is not fully imputed, the non-resident investor will be subject to NRWT at 15% or 30%, depending on the double tax agreement that applies. A non-resident would be more favourably treated if they had a zero rate in a PIE which received non-fully imputed dividends. Officials therefore suggest that investments in New Zealand equities be excluded. However, it may be that a minimum holding would be acceptable if this was required to reduce administrative costs or to allow existing “global equity” or “balanced managed” type funds to participate. Any minimum threshold could be based either on the value of assets or on income. If asset-based, the PIE could hold no more than, say, 5 percent of the value of all its assets in New Zealand equities which distribute unimputed dividends. If an income-based test is applied, income from other entities that is neither fully imputed dividends nor excluded income would not be allowed to exceed 5 percent of all income derived by the PIE in a year. The income-based test is more sensitive in targeting investments that do not give rise to a concern but it is more administratively complex. Officials are interested in feedback on these alternatives and the possible level of a minimum threshold exemption. • NZ financial arrangements. Interest paid to non-residents investing in New Zealand debt instruments is subject to an approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2 percent or NRWT. A restriction on investments in New Zealand financial arrangements by a PIE with zero-rated non-resident investors is therefore required. Officials propose a minimum level of New Zealand-sourced income from debt for administrative and liquidity purposes. The Government is looking at the feasibility of introducing an exemption from AIL and NRWT for New Zealand bonds issued to non- residents. The restriction on investments in New Zealand financial arrangements would be reviewed if the policy in relation to AIL changed. Financial arrangements involving hedging instruments, as defined by NZ IAS 39, would not affect the amount of New Zealand assets that the PIE can hold. The policy behind this is to allow for a PIE to hedge against foreign-exchange risk in New Zealand, as this hedging would otherwise occur offshore, with no benefit to New Zealand. 10 3.6 Provisions would be required to deal with a breach of the requirement to have only foreign-sourced income (outside the allowed minimum levels). Option 2: Look-through global investment option 3.7 This option would allow a PIE to have both resident and non-resident investors and New Zealand and foreign-sourced income. There would be no restriction on the New Zealand-sourced income but the PIE would apply a different PIR to different types of income derived by non-resident investors, as follows: Type of income Prescribed investor rate to apply to non-resident investors Foreign-sourced income 0% PIR Income from New Zealand equity 0% PIR if the income has borne tax at a 30% rate In other cases, the PIE would apply a PIR of 15% or 30%, depending on the appropriate double tax treaty rate New Zealand financial arrangements PIR of 2% on interest allocated to the non-resident Income from interest in New Zealand land and other types of New Zealand sourced income 30% PIR 3.8 Income that relates to offshore investments and that is allocated to a non- resident would be deemed to be foreign-sourced income. A CFC and non- resident trustee of a trust settled by a New Zealand resident would be treated as residents for the purposes of applying the exemption. 3.9 It would be necessary to track income from different sources, apportion expenditure to that income and allocate it to investors as if each stream were the only income derived by the PIE. However, the PIE may establish its own rules (restrictions on the types of investors or investments) to reduce the number of permutations. The rules could also allow the use of minimum rather than actual PIRs. For example, a PIE which invested in New Zealand equity could apply a PIR of 15% (in relation to income of a non-resident of a treaty country) rather than separating income taxable at 15% from that taxable at 0%. 3.10 Despite the fact that there will be no tax liability in relation to foreign- sourced income under this option, the PIE would still be required to calculate and attribute net income, losses and tax credits to investors as if there were a tax liability. This is required to enable New Zealand to meet its exchange of information obligations under double tax agreements, to enable Inland Revenue to verify that the income of the PIE is from a foreign-source, and to cater for those taxpayers who have been incorrectly treated as non-resident. 11 Proposed approach and submission points 3.11 Each option discussed above has a number of advantages and disadvantages. 3.12 Option one is a more flexible vehicle and is still relatively simple. Existing funds are more likely to fit within the criteria and an individual moving from non-resident to resident status can remain with the fund. However, this option has the disadvantage that ensuring the de minimis rules are not breached involves some compliance and administrative costs. 3.13 Option two should maximise marketing opportunities for the funds management industry, allowing non-residents to invest through a PIE in New Zealand assets at the right tax rate and receive the benefit of no New Zealand tax on disposal of New Zealand shares. For example, an Australian investing in New Zealand debt through the PIE, who currently is taxed at 30%, would be taxed at 2%. 3.14 Option two also provides maximum flexibility to use existing funds, allowing fund managers to tailor funds to accommodate the degree of complexity they can handle. There is also no requirement to monitor minimum thresholds under this option. 3.15 Option two does, however, have significant disadvantages. There is administrative complexity for the PIE in tracing different sources of income and apportioning expenditure. The legislation is likely to be complex and this option also has the highest administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Finally, the marketing advantage may be overstated as it is unlikely that the tax paid by the PIE is creditable in a foreign jurisdiction. As a result, there may be a disincentive to invest in New Zealand assets through a PIE. 3.16 Officials are interested in feedback on the perceived benefits and compliance costs of the options outlined. In particular: • Whether the funds management industry has a preferred option. • Whether and why a minimum level of New Zealand-sourced income is useful under option one. • The appropriate level for the minimum threshold exemption under option one. • Whether the minimum threshold level should be an income or asset test. • Whether the risks outlined in pages 4–7 to exempt foreign-sourced income derived by non-residents through a PIE are real risks, and the perceived likelihood of them occurring. • The likelihood of the proposed benefits outlined in pages 3–4 occurring.

Introduction 1.1 This issues paper discusses two different post-Budget depreciation related issues, and officials’ proposed solutions to them. 1.2 The first issue is about the depreciation of building fit-out in non-residential buildings in light of the Inland Revenue interpretation statement Residential rental properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property (IS 10/01). This statement concluded that many items in a residential rental property are part of the building and so must be depreciated at the building depreciation rate. 1.3 Although the statement applies only to residential buildings, its principles could be interpreted to apply more broadly. This has created some uncertainty. It seems that the current practice is for taxpayers to generally claim depreciation deductions for items of non-residential building fit-out separately from the building itself. 1.4 To address this, we propose to clarify the law on when expenditure on non- residential fit-out can be depreciated separately from the building. We propose that this would be allowed if an item is described in the Commissioner’s depreciation determination asset category “Building Fit-out (when in books separately from building cost)” or if the item is an item of plant. We also propose a rule that will allow people who have not separately identified items of fit-out in their non-residential building to continue to depreciate a portion of their building’s tax book value at the old building depreciation rate. 1.5 The second issue discussed is about uncertainty in how the grandparenting of depreciation loading applies to certain situations. 1.6 As part of the Budget 2010 tax package, depreciation loading was removed on a prospective basis from assets purchased after 20 May 2010. The specific rule introduced in Budget night legislation stated that an item would be eligible for depreciation loading if it was acquired, or there was a binding contract for its purchase or construction, on or before 20 May 2010. However, since this legislation was enacted we have become aware of situations, such as when a person builds an asset themselves, where the application of this rule is unclear. 1.7 To provide additional clarity we are proposing to introduce a new grandparenting rule. This new rule would mean that, for an item of depreciable property to be eligible for depreciation loading, its owner would need to have either acquired the item on or before 20 May 2010, or alternatively, had both intended to and actually begun purchasing or constructing the item on or before 20 May 2010. 2 1.8 Officials are interested in feedback on these proposals, and if the attached draft legislation gives effect to the proposed policies. Submissions on problems related to these issues but are not addressed by our proposals are also welcomed and will be taken into account when we make formal recommendations to the Government on any legislative changes. How to make a submission 1.9 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury to contact you about your submission to discuss the points it raises. Submissions should be made by 1 September 2010 and be addressed to: Post-budget depreciation issues C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Post-budget depreciation issues” in the subject line. 1.10 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you think any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act, you should indicate this clearly. 3 2. Building fit-out: a review for non-residential buildings Introduction 2.1 In March 2010, Inland Revenue released interpretation statement Residential rental properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property (IS 10/01), which outlined the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view that many items in a residential rental property must be depreciated at the building depreciation rate because they are not separate items of depreciable property. Although the statement applies only to residential buildings, its principles could be interpreted to apply more broadly. 2.2 Following this, the Budget 2010 tax changes set the depreciation rate for buildings that have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more to 0% from the beginning of the 2011/12 income year. This has highlighted the question of whether building fit-out is depreciable in a non-residential context. 2.3 The current depreciation rules require taxpayers to consider whether an item of depreciable property is part of a building or, instead, a separate item of depreciable property – such as plant, machinery, or equipment. It would seem that the current practice is for taxpayers to generally claim depreciation deductions for items of non-residential building fit-out separately from the building. This practice has come into focus given the Inland Revenue interpretation statement on residential buildings referred to above. 2.4 For these reasons, we are proposing to clarify the law on when expenditure on non-residential fit-out can be depreciated separately from the building structure. Under this proposal, items of non-residential building fit-out could be separately depreciated if the item is described in the Commissioner’s depreciation determination asset category “Building Fit-out”, or alternatively, if the item is an item of plant. We are also proposing a rule that will allow people who have not separately identified items of fit-out in a non residential building to continue to depreciate a portion of the building’s tax book value at the old building rate. The appropriate policy setting 2.5 A key goal of the tax system, including depreciation rules, is to tax different forms of investment as neutrally as possible to avoid distortions to investment decisions. Therefore, there are strong grounds for depreciation rates to mirror economic depreciation (how assets fall in market value through time) as closely as possible. 2.6 It is difficult to set depreciation rates to precisely match economic depreciation given incomplete information and variations in depreciation rates between assets. Therefore, current depreciation rates are an attempt to reasonably approximate the average decline in the value of assets over time. 4 Current practice identifying an item of depreciable property 2.7 For accounting and valuation purposes, many taxpayers separate components of an asset where the component has a cost that is significant in relation to the asset of which it forms part, and where it has a materially different useful life-span. Therefore, components of non-residential building fit-out are generally depreciated separately from the building for accounting purposes. 2.8 Certain aspects of the tax depreciation rules support this practice. Many taxpayers use separate depreciation rates for items of building fit-out (the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has published depreciation rates for approximately 90 general items of building fit-out - including: lifts, internal walls, plumbing, electrical wiring, ceilings, carpets, fitted furniture, air conditioning systems) 1 . Currently, the Commissioner determines an asset’s useful life-span after receiving advice from interested parties and a registered valuer. The depreciation rate is then set by using the estimated useful life in the relevant formula. This generally results in higher depreciation rates than would have applied if the asset was depreciated as part of the building. 2.9 Strictly speaking, tax depreciation (according to principles developed by the Courts in cases relating to deductions for repairs and maintenance) generally requires that the relevant item be identified; and that for a component of the item to be considered separately, it must be a distinct physical item capable of operating on its own. It will always be a question of fact and degree whether a particular improvement is considered a separate item of depreciable property. 2.10 Inland Revenue’s interpretation statement IS 10/01 (Residential rental properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property) sets out the Commissioner’s view of the law as it relates to the fit-out of residential buildings. The statement sets out a three-step test 2 that the Commissioner will apply to determine whether an item can be depreciated separately or whether it is properly depreciated as part of the residential building. Although the statement applies only to residential buildings, if its principles were to apply more widely this could result in a number of items of non- residential fit-out, that are currently being depreciated separately, being considered part of the building, and non-depreciable for certain buildings from the beginning of the 2011/12 income year. This could have implications for current practice and could introduce a significant tax bias against fit-out of non-residential buildings. 1 See Appendix A for the Commissioner’s complete list of items in the asset category building fit-out. 2 Step 1: Determine whether the item is in some way attached or connected to the building. If the item is completely unattached, then it will not form a part of the building. An item will not be considered attached for these purposes, if its only means of attachment is being plugged or wired into an electrical outlet (such as a freestanding oven), or attached to a water or gas outlet. If the item is attached to the building, go to step 2. Step 2: Determine whether the item is an integral part of the building, such that the building would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item. If the item is an integral part of the building, then the item will be a part of the building. If the item is not an integral part of the residential rental property, go to step 3. Step 3: Determine whether the item is built-in or attached or connected to the building in such a way that it is part of the “fabric” of the building. Consider factors such as the nature and degree of attachment, the difficulty involved in the item’s removal, and whether there would be any significant damage to the item or the building if the item were removed. If the item is part of the fabric of the building, then it is part of the building for depreciation purposes. 5 Different rules for residential and non-residential fit-outs 2.11 We propose that a distinction be made for tax depreciation purposes between non-residential and residential fit-out. We think that a distinction is necessary because building fit-out is likely to constitute a greater portion of the value for non-residential buildings than for residential buildings. In addition, we consider that non-residential fit-out is generally less permanent than residential fit-out due to tenant-specific requirements and changes of use. 2.12 We consider that these differences justify residential and non-residential building fit-out being treated differently for income tax purposes. Under this approach whether an item of residential fit-out qualifies as a separate depreciable item will be governed by current law – guided by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s interpretation statement IS10/01 (Residential rental properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property). A separate set of rules would govern whether commercial and industrial fit-out is able to be depreciated separately from the building. A proposal outlining a new set of rules is discussed below. The proposal for non-residential building fit-out 2.13 The proposal is to clarify the law to allow expenditure on non-residential fit- out to be separately depreciable from the building structure. Non-depreciable structure 2.14 We consider that the building structure includes: the foundations; the building frame; floors; external walls, cladding, windows, and doors; stairs; the roof; and load-bearing structures such as pillars and load-bearing internal walls. Expenditure on these components of a building would be non- depreciable for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more from the beginning of the 2011/12 income year. Depreciable fit-out 2.15 The law would be changed to clarify that fit-out associated with commercial, industrial, recreational and certain short-term accommodation (for example: motels, hotels, rest homes, and hospitals) would be able to be separately depreciated. The items of fit-out that would be separately depreciable are described in the Commissioner’s “Building Fit-out” asset category. The rates of depreciation for these items would not change as a result of this review. A list of the items in this category is contained in Appendix A. Items that are not contained in this list that are not part of the non-depreciable building structure (described above) would continue to be depreciable at the default rate. 6 2.16 In addition to the general building fit-out category, officials also propose to clarify that plant, where the plant is integrated into the fabric of the building, can also be separately depreciated at the appropriate depreciation rate. For example, wool scouring plant might be so integrated into the fabric of the building housing the plant that it would be part of the building under the Commissioner’s 3 step test (described in footnote 2). Specifically allowing an item of plant to be depreciated separately from the building would ensure that the law aligns with current practice for depreciating items of non- residential building fit-out. The boundary between residential and non-residential 2.17 Under the approach described above, it is necessary to define the boundary between residential and non-residential. We propose to base the boundary on a legislative concept of “dwelling”. The depreciation status of an item of fit- out for a building meeting the definition of “dwelling” would be treated under the current law, while the depreciation status of an item of fit-out for a building that does not meet this definition would be treated under the separate rules for commercial and industrial fit-out. 2.18 The key aspects of the proposed definition of “dwelling” are that: • it would include any building, premises, structure including any parts of these items; and • it must be used predominantly as a place of residence or abode for any individual; and • it does not include a commercial dwelling. 2.19 As described above, a dwelling would be defined broadly and would be concerned with the functional aspects of the structure. That is, the structure must be predominantly used as a place of accommodation, but it would not be limited to buildings that are a person’s primary place of residence or home. There would be no requirement for any degree of permanency of occupation in order for particular premises to fall within the ambit of ‘dwelling’. Nor would the concept of “dwelling” require full time use. However, the definition will specifically exclude commercial dwellings such as hotels, motels, rest homes and hospitals. 2.20 Under this approach second homes that taxpayers use predominantly for themselves but are rented out infrequently or sporadically (these can be described as “holiday homes”) and timeshare apartments would fall within the definition of “dwelling” and would not, therefore, qualify for the separate commercial and industrial fit-out rules. This is because the provision of accommodation in these situations cannot be described as commercial in nature. 7 Mixed purpose building fit-out 2.21 For mixed purpose buildings, certain items of fit-out are typically shared between non-residential and residential spaces. Examples of these kinds of items include lifts, electrical cabling, fire protection, and sewerage and water reticulation. 2.22 The issue arises whether the depreciation status of items of fit-out that serve both the residential and non-residential areas of a building should be subject to the current law or the proposed new rules for commercial and industrial fit-out. We propose a dominant purpose test whereby a taxpayer will be entitled to depreciate, as an item of fit-out separate from the building, these shared items of fit-out if the dominant purpose of the building is to provide non-residential space. However, if the building provides mainly residential space, then the depreciation status of the shared components of the building will be determined by the current law as it applies to residential property. The following are examples of how this test would apply in practice: A four storey building has three floors of commercial space and a penthouse apartment on the top floor. A lift serves all 4 floors. As the dominant purpose of the building is to provide commercial space, the depreciation status of the lift would be determined under the proposed new rules for commercial and industrial fit-out. This means that the lift would be a separate item of depreciable property and the costs associated with the lift would be spread over 25 years. The lift would be an item of depreciable fit-out because the dominant purpose of the building is to provide commercial space. However, the depreciation status of the fit-out of the penthouse apartment would be determined under current law. A 10 storey residential apartment block has a commercial café on the top floor and a bicycle shop on the ground floor. A lift serves all 10 floors. As the dominant purpose of the building is the provision of residential accommodation, the depreciation status of the lift would be determined under the current law. However, the depreciation status of the fit-out associated exclusively with the café and the bicycle shop would be determined under the proposed new rules for commercial and industrial fit-out. Implications for repairs and maintenance 2.23 The cost of repairing or maintaining assets is generally treated as a deductible expense in the year such expenditure is incurred. However, if the work adds to or improves the asset, this may constitute capital expenditure, with the cost having to be capitalised and, if it is associated with a depreciable asset, depreciated over future years. The application of these general principles to particular circumstances has been the subject of numerous court cases. Therefore, defining the boundary between repairs and maintenance (R&M) and capital expenditure precisely is very difficult. Ultimately, as with other issues associated with the capital/revenue boundary, it will be a question of fact. We do not propose to alter this boundary as part of this review. 8 Transitional rule – a non-residential fit-out pool 2.24 During the course of this review, we have been advised that a number of taxpayers have not separately identified and depreciated items of building fit- out. This is likely to have occurred where taxpayers have sought to minimise tax compliance costs – particularly where the value of the fit-out component was sufficiently low to make its separate identification uneconomic. There was nothing wrong with the choice these taxpayers made. The issue arises as to how to treat the fit-out once building depreciation is removed on these buildings from the 2011/12 income year. 2.25 While the fit-out should continue to be depreciable, in practice it will be difficult to work out how much of the building’s value is attributable to the fit-out. Taxpayers could in theory sell and reacquire the fit-out and then depreciate each item separately. An alternative approach would be for the tax rules to deem a sale and immediate reacquisition at market value. However, this would impose significant compliance costs on these taxpayers. 2.26 Instead, we propose a transitional rule that would allow a one-off adjustment. Under this approach, taxpayers that are currently depreciating commercial and industrial fit-out as part of the building, would create a building fit-out depreciation pool of 15 percent of the building’s adjusted tax book value. The pool would be depreciated at 2% straight line (equivalent to the current building depreciation rate). Taxpayers would only be permitted to elect to create a fit-out pool once - from the start of the 2011/12 income year. 2.27 Under this proposal there would be no deduction allowed for losses on the value of the pool when the pool is sold or scrapped. Also, it is proposed that there be no depreciation recovery on the pool when the building is sold. This reduces the need for more complex and arbitrary judgements to assign disposal proceeds between building and building fit-out pool. Draft legislation 2.28 Draft legislation that attempts to reflect the policy outlined above is contained in Appendix B. 9 3. Implementation issues for grandparenting depreciation loading Introduction 3.1 Depreciation loading accelerates the depreciation of eligible items by 20%. It only applies to items that meet certain criteria; for example, the item must not have been used in New Zealand before, it must not be a building or depreciable intangible property, and it must have been purchased after the beginning of the 1995/96 income year. 3.2 As part of the Budget 2010 tax package, depreciation loading was removed on a prospective basis from assets purchased after 20 May 2010. In other words, if a person was committed to purchasing an item of depreciable property on or before 20 May, it was intended that the item should continue to be eligible for loading. The specific rule introduced in Budget night legislation stated that an item would be eligible for depreciation loading if it was acquired, or there was a binding contract for its purchase or construction, on or before 20 May 2010. 3.3 Since this legislation was enacted, we have been made aware of two main situations where the application of this rule is unclear. The first of these is when a person begins to build an asset themselves, but had yet to finish it, prior to 20 May. The second is when a person enters into multiple contracts for a single item of depreciable property, with at least some of the contracts being binding on or before 20 May. 3.4 We are proposing a new grandparenting rule that would clarify how depreciation loading should apply in these situations. The rule should better reflect the policy intention that an asset should be eligible for depreciation loading if there was a commitment for its purchase or construction on or before 20 May. The proposal 3.5 The proposed rule is that, for an item of depreciable property to be eligible for depreciation loading, its owner would need to have: a) acquired the item on or before 20 May 2010; or b) intend, on or before 20 May, to purchase or construct the item, and a. enter into a binding contract in relation to the purchase or construction of the item on or before 20 May 2010; or b. start construction of the item themselves on or before 20 May 2010. 10 3.6 Under this rule, intention could be demonstrated by the person having documentation that evidences that they had decided to purchase or construct the item (such as board approval for an item’s purchase or an approved purchase order). Alternatively, the person could sign a statutory declaration that states they intended to purchase or construct the item on or before 20 May 2010. This declaration would then have to be sent to the Commissioner. 3.7 It is important to note that, while having the kind of evidence mentioned above would usually be sufficient, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must still be satisfied that the person actually had the intention to build or purchase the item on or before 20 May 2010. For example, the relevant manager of a company approves the purchase of a $1,000,000 item on 10 May 2010. However, the company’s usual process for a purchase of that size is that it needs to be approved by the board of directors, and this does not happen until 30 May. In this example it is unlikely that the company would have the requisite intention to purchase the item on or before 20 May, as it had yet to finish its usual process for approving such a purchase by then. 3.8 In this context, construction would mean that the physical process of assembly had started. It would also include physical processes necessary to begin assembly, for example earthworks that are needed to lay the foundations of a dam. However, it would not include activities such as applying for resource consents or drawing up plans for the item. This is because these steps are often part of the process of determining whether to start or continue a project, and so do not necessarily imply commitment. 3.9 Finally, this rule would only determine whether an asset is eligible for depreciation loading. For an asset to actually qualify for the accelerated depreciation rate that the loading provides, it would also have to meet the general depreciation loading criteria, such as being previously unused in New Zealand and not being a building.
