It provides an analysis of options to address concerns that New Zealand foreign trusts may be vulnerable to misuse for avoidance or evasion of foreign tax, or for money laundering and other criminal purposes. The analysis in this RIS was informed by the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Inquiry) which undertook an extensive independent review of the policy and operation of the foreign trust rules. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a RIS for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. To ensure that amendments recommended by the Inquiry and accepted by the Government could be implemented in line with the application time frames recommended by the Inquiry, and to provide for the amendments to be considered by select committee, this RIS was prepared under time constraints. We have consulted with other relevant government agencies, but not more widely, on the proposals. However, it is noted that as part of its review, the Inquiry invited submissions from the public and received 23 submissions. The policy option recommended would impose additional costs on New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts. However it is considered that as they will reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts, these additional costs are justified. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for business to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Policy and law concerning the taxation of trusts 1. New Zealand tax law distinguishes between different types of trusts. Foreign trusts are trusts with no New Zealand resident settlor (the person who settles assets on the trust) 2. New Zealand’s rules for taxing trusts were introduced in 1988, as part of a wider package of international tax reforms. Most countries tax trusts on the basis of the residence of the trustee (which was New Zealand’s previous approach). However, from 1988, New Zealand’s rules for the taxation of trusts have been based on the residence of the settlor, not the residence of the trustees. That is, New Zealand taxes a trust on its worldwide income if the settlor is a New Zealand resident - regardless of the residence of the trustees. 3. The general idea behind this approach is that even though the trustees have legal ownership of the assets, the settlor is really the economic “power behind the throne” because they set up the trust by transferring the assets to the trust and appointing the trustees. Taxation based on the settlor’s residence makes it difficult for New Zealand residents to avoid tax by holding their assets through overseas trustees. 4. From this starting point, it naturally follows that a trust with a foreign settlor is a foreign trust even when the trustees are resident in New Zealand. A foreign trust that derives foreign sourced income will not be taxed in New Zealand on that income (assuming no New Zealand resident beneficiaries). 5. There is now a foreign trust industry in New Zealand as a result of non-resident settlors being able to accumulate assets and income in a foreign trust with no New Zealand tax. New Zealand advisors (and their overseas agents) help foreigners establish and manage foreign trusts for a fee. Foreign trusts with New Zealand trustees are marketed on the basis of New Zealand’s settlor-based tax rules, and stable regulatory environment based on common law. Current tax disclosure and record-keeping requirements 6. Since 2006, foreign trusts which have a New Zealand resident trustee have been required by the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to disclose certain information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue upon establishment. There is currently no formal registration process or register for foreign trusts. 7. The information that is required to be disclosed upon establishment is the name or identifying particulars of the foreign trust, the name of a New Zealand trustee, and whether there is an Australian settlor. 8. New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts are also required to keep certain records in relation to the foreign trust, including the trust deed, and (if they are known) the names and addresses of settlors who make a settlement on the trust and beneficiaries who receive a distribution. 9. These records must be provided to Inland Revenue on request. If the information provided upon initial disclosure has changed, the New Zealand resident trustee of a foreign trusts must update the information, but annual filing with Inland Revenue is not otherwise required. 2 Sanctions for non-compliance 10. Under current law, an intentional breach of a requirement to supply information to Inland Revenue can result in a fine of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. 11. As noted above, foreign trusts are not taxable in New Zealand if they earn no New Zealand sourced income. However, the current rules provide that if a foreign trust does not have a qualifying resident foreign trustee for an income year and information requested by Inland Revenue is not provided, then if a conviction occurs the foreign trust will be subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. A foreign trust will have a qualifying resident foreign trustee if one of its trustees is a member of a specified professional body (such as the New Zealand Law Society or Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). 12. This means that where a trustee of a foreign trust is convicted of intentionally not providing information to Inland Revenue in relation to that foreign trust, the foreign trust will not be subject to New Zealand tax as long as one of its trustees is a New Zealand lawyer or chartered accountant. Audit activity and information sharing 13. Inland Revenue currently performs some audit activity in relation to foreign trusts. A key reason for these audits is to ensure that the trusts do not in fact have New Zealand settlors (as if they do have a New Zealand settlor the trust is taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income), and that the record-keeping requirements of the TAA are complied with. 14. Where Inland Revenue finds information that is of interest to other authorities (overseas tax authorities or domestic law enforcement agencies) in the course of these audits, Inland Revenue will pass this information on where authorised. 15. Inland Revenue shares information about foreign trusts with overseas tax authorities with whom New Zealand has a treaty which has tax information exchange provisions. This information is shared upon request from the overseas tax authority or where Inland Revenue considers that the information may be of interest to that tax authority. Where the settlor of a foreign trust is Australian, Inland Revenue provides this information automatically to the Australian Taxation Office. 16. The circumstances in which Inland Revenue shares information about foreign trusts with domestic law enforcement agencies are relatively limited (for example, information can be shared if it concerns individuals or if it is requested by Police and it relates to serious crime). Problem definition and recent developments 17. Concerns have been raised that the existing disclosure and record-keeping requirements in relation to foreign trusts are insufficient particularly in light of expanding obligations to exchange information with our treaty partners. These concerns may have the potential to impact on New Zealand’s international reputation. 18. In particular, in April 2016, information about the ‘Panama Papers” was released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The Panama Papers comprise approximately 11.5 million confidential documents of a Panama based law and trust services firm, Mossack Fonseca. The documents, which are said to date back as far as the 1970s, were 3 obtained in early 2015. Allegations reported in the media include tax evasion, money laundering, and other illicit activities. 19. References in the Panama Papers to New Zealand foreign trusts and, in particular, allegations that New Zealand foreign trusts may be used in structures which are established to hide assets and evade or avoid foreign tax, added to the above concerns. Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules 20. The Government commissioned an Inquiry (the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules) into whether New Zealand’s foreign trust disclosure rules and their enforcement are sufficient to ensure New Zealand’s reputation is maintained. The terms of the Inquiry can be found at Appendix 1. 21. The Inquiry conducted an extensive review of the disclosure rules relevant to foreign trusts. The Inquiry reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on 20 June 2016. This report can be found at Appendix 2. 22. The Foreign Trust Inquiry made a number of recommendations. These fell into three broad categories: • Registration and increased disclosure recommendations that would be administered by Inland Revenue. • Anti-money laundering (AML) law and implementation recommendations. • Increased information sharing between New Zealand government agencies about foreign trusts for enforcement purposes. 23. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the AML requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a RIS for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. For this reason the options considered in this RIS do not attempt to address the AML concerns raised in the Inquiry. 24. We note that other options were considered by the Inquiry. These options included extending Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) obligations to foreign trusts, and having a public register for trusts. All these options were rejected by the Inquiry. We have considered the Inquiry’s recommendations on these options and we agree with the conclusions for the reasons given by the Inquiry. Scale of the problem 25. There are about 12,000 foreign trusts with a New Zealand resident trustee that have been disclosed to Inland Revenue. 26. In 2014, it was estimated that the value of the fees collected in respect of foreign trusts, plus employment income for third party employees and principals for each foreign trust provider entity, amounts to approximately $24 million per annum, on average. This figure 4 5 has been calculated from Inland Revenue data. (Other reported estimates of fee income resulting from the industry range from $20 million1 to $50 million2 per annum.) 27. The contribution to the New Zealand tax take, in terms of income tax on fee income, goods and services tax, and PAYE paid on behalf of third party employees and principals for each foreign trust provider entity, is around $3 million per annum, on average. This figure has been calculated from Inland Revenue data. OBJECTIVES 28. The main objective is to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived)3 in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. 29. The Inquiry also proposed changes to reduce the potential for foreign trusts to be used for money laundering and other illicit purposes. Reducing the potential for foreign trusts to be used for money laundering and other illicit purposes is not an objective against which the options considered in this RIS are assessed. However, the Inquiry considered that increased disclosure requirements would be likely to partially address this issue. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the AML requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a regulatory impact statement for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. 30. All the options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the following criteria: (a) Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information Ensuring that New Zealand is able to maintain its reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information, particularly in light of the recent expansion of international obligations (in terms of number of treaty partners, the amount of information, and frequency of exchange). (b) Maintaining an open economy The options should ensure that New Zealand maintains an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector. (c) Fairness and integrity (including perceptions of fairness and integrity) The options should ensure that the law is seen as treating people fairly and consistently and should not allow people to avoid their tax obligations (including any foreign tax obligations). 1 IFSDG, “Exporting Financial Services: A Report from the International Funds Services Development Group” (IFSDG, 2011) at 47. Cabinet established the IFSDG in March 2010 to look at financial services opportunities for New Zealand. The estimate is said to be from industry sources in 2009. Refer to www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=10844389. The Inquiry noted that while it did not find any direct evidence of misuse, it is reasonable to conclude that there are cases where foreign trusts are being used in this way. •2 6 (d) Coherency of the tax system - The options should be consistent with other fundamental principles of the tax system. (e) Efficiency of compliance and administration - The options should, to the extent possible, minimise compliance costs for foreign trusts and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 31. In this context, we consider that more weight should be given to criteria (a), (c) and (d). For example, where there is a conflict between maintaining New Zealand’s reputation and minimising compliance and administrative costs, there should be relatively more weight attached to maintaining New Zealand’s reputation. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 32. Three options have been considered in this RIS: Option 1: Retain the status quo Option 2: Implement the changes recommended by the Inquiry that relate to registration, increased disclosure, and increased information sharing with some refinements (Inland Revenue’s recommended option). Option 3: Repeal the tax exemption for foreign trusts. Option 1 33. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 1 Main objective 34. The status quo does not meet the objective of reducing the potential for perceived misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 35. Although New Zealand’s current disclosure requirements are sufficient to meet the existing obligations for exchanging tax information under treaties, given the recent international movements towards increased information sharing between tax jurisdictions, in the current environment these rules may not be sufficient to maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. Maintaining an open economy 36. The status quo is consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, where those activities are legitimate. Fairness and integrity 37. Perceived or actual misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand in order to avoid tax obligations in other jurisdictions could impact negatively on fairness and integrity. 38. The impact on coherency of the tax system is mixed. The tax exemption for foreign trusts is consistent with New Zealand’s framework for taxing trusts. However, the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts seem insufficient in light of recent international trends. Efficiency of compliance and administration 39. The compliance costs for foreign trusts under current rules are very low. 40. In terms of administrative costs, there are currently some costs for data entry and the exchange of information. Inland Revenue also runs an audit project on foreign trust providers. Option 2 41. This option would implement a package of changes relating to registration, increased disclosure, and information sharing. This package essentially follows the Inquiry’s recommendations, with some minor modifications as indicated. The Inquiry’s recommendations are contained in Appendix 1. Registration and initial disclosure 42. Under option 2 the current disclosure process would be formalised as a registration process. The resident trustee of the trust would be required to declare that the person establishing the foreign trust, the settlor(s) and the trustees have been advised of, and have agreed to provide the information to comply with, the applicable record-keeping requirements in the TAA, the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act and Regulations, and the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) requirements (once enacted). 43. To ensure that sufficient information is provided to Inland Revenue, more information would be required to be disclosed upon establishment of the trust, and in particular, the name, email address, foreign residential address, country of tax residence and Tax Identification Number of: i. the settlor or settlors ii. the protector (if there is any) iii. non-resident trustees iv. any other natural person who has effective control of the trust (including through a chain of control or ownership ) v. beneficiaries of fixed trusts, including the underlying beneficiary where a named beneficiary is a nominee. 44. In addition to the above disclosure, the trust deed would also be required to be filed with the registration form, and, in the case of discretionary trusts4, any class of beneficiary not listed in the trust deed should be described on the registration form. Coherency of the tax system 4 A discretionary trust is a trust where the beneficiaries have no fixed entitlement to distributions from the trust. 7 On-going disclosure requirements 45. There would also be on-going disclosure requirements under option 2. Foreign trusts would be required to file an annual return with Inland Revenue that includes any changes to the information provided at registration, the trust’s annual financial statement, and the amount of any distributions paid or credited and the names, foreign address, Tax Identification Number and country of tax residence of the recipient beneficiaries. 46. Inland Revenue considers that, as part of option 2, the annual return should include the amount of any settlements on the trust in the relevant period and the names, foreign address, Tax Identification Number and country of tax residence of that settlor. This information is currently required to be kept as part of the existing record keeping requirements. It would be more useful if this information was directly provided to Inland Revenue. When a trust qualifies for the tax exemption 47. The exemption from New Zealand tax on foreign-sourced income should apply only to a foreign trust with a resident trustee that has registered and fulfilled the associated disclosure obligations at that time. 48. The Inquiry also recommended that the qualifying resident trustee safe harbour should be reviewed. Inland Revenue considers that, as part of option 2, the qualifying resident trustee safe harbour should be removed. 49. The qualifying resident trustee safe harbour was introduced in 2006, as part of amendments which introduced the current disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. We understand that, at that time, it was considered that this safe harbour would encourage foreign trusts to use a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer as a trustee, and that having a trustee who is a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer would be an appropriate check to prevent non-compliance. However, the current qualifying resident trustee safe harbour does not provide a clear and appropriate signal about the importance of complying with the disclosure rules. Registration and annual filing fees 50. Fees for registration and annual filing would be charged. This recognises that foreign trusts benefit from New Zealand’s regulatory environment and that there are costs involved to the Crown, both in processing registrations and returns and in enforcing the rules relating to foreign trusts. Charging fees would recompense the Crown for those costs. The Inquiry’s recommendations note that a fee of $500 for registration and then annually would be reasonable. We note that the registration and filing fees recommended by the Inquiry would be higher than those for companies, limited partnerships, and charities under New Zealand law.5 Inland Revenue considers that further analysis is required to determine the quantum. Further, we consider that, as part of option 2, it may be appropriate for the level of fees to be modified in future by Order in Council. This would allow those fees to be relatively easily changed if necessary to recognise the costs involved in administering foreign trusts, and is consistent with the approach taken in relation to setting registration and filing fees for companies. ^ The fee for registering a company is $150, and the fee for registering a limited partnership is $270. The annual filing fee for companies and charities is approximately $50, and the annual levy for limited partnerships is $20. 8 Information sharing with relevant agencies 51. Under option 2 the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police would be able to search the register of foreign trusts. These agencies may need the information contained on the register for law enforcement purposes. The list of agencies with access to the register could be expanded in the future if there is good cause for it. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 2 Main objective 52. Obtaining more information about the settlor and beneficiaries and providing it to other authorities (overseas tax authorities and domestic enforcement agencies) would help ensure that foreign trusts are not misused. More disclosure in relation to foreign trusts and access to the information by relevant agencies would make it difficult for these vehicles to be used to avoid foreign tax. This option meets the main criteria. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 53. By increasing the information available to Inland Revenue that can be shared with New Zealand’s treaty partners, option 2 would maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. This would be an improvement on the status quo. Maintaining an open economy 54. We consider this option is consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, where activities are legitimate. While there would be some increase in compliance costs for this industry, as noted below, these are not significant given the current record-keeping requirements and in some cases, the similar requirements for AEOI and AML legislation. 55. In terms of maintaining an open economy, we consider that option 2 is no better or worse than the status quo. Fairness and integrity 56. The impact on fairness and integrity (including on perceptions of fairness and integrity) is expected to be positive. The requirements are likely to provide increased integrity, and the registration requirements will signal the increased disclosure requirements. This would be an improvement on the status quo. Coherency of the tax system 57. The impact on coherency of the tax policy framework and disclosure rules would be an improvement on the status quo. 58. This option would retain the tax exemption for foreign trusts, which is consistent with New Zealand’s framework for taxing trusts. 9 10 59. Increasing the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts would be consistent with recent trends for increased disclosures to tax authorities for the purposes of detecting tax avoidance and evasion. Efficiency of compliance and administration 60. There may be additional compliance costs for foreign trusts. However we do not consider that these will be significant. 61. Much of the information that would be required to be provided is already required to be collected by the New Zealand-resident trustee in accordance with existing record-keeping requirements. 62. At the moment, identity and address information of settlors and beneficiaries is required to be collected, although only “if known”. The new information that foreign trusts will be required to collect mainly relates to identity and address information about the settlor and beneficiary (including the Taxpayer Identification Number for those persons). We note that these information requirements would be broadly in line with the type of information disclosure standards that will be required under the proposed AEOI requirements. 63. The foreign trust would also need to do a new annual return to Inland Revenue rather than simply keeping records. 64. In some (but probably not most) cases, this information may be required to be provided under AEOI or AML legislation. However, we anticipate that entities will be able to use the same information collected for multiple regulatory regimes. Accordingly, while we acknowledge duplication in those cases might potentially increase compliance costs, we consider that compliance costs arising from duplication are relatively minimal. 65. Under option 2, there will be some increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue as a result of redesigning the current disclosure statement, a new annual return, and additional data entry. These costs are likely to be under $1 million. There may also be some additional resources required for increased exchange of information with domestic law enforcement agencies and overseas treaty partners. The costs relating to additional data entry and enforcement could depend on the numbers of foreign trusts. 66. Overall, in terms of efficiency of compliance and administration, option 2 would be slightly worse than the status quo. Option 3 67. This option would repeal the tax exemption for foreign trusts. This option was suggested by some submitters to the Inquiry. The Inquiry did not recommend this option. 68. We note that it is possible for foreign trusts to be established in New Zealand for legitimate purposes that do not include foreign tax abuse or illicit activity. However, taxing foreign trusts on their worldwide income would deter the use of trusts even if they are used only for legitimate reasons. ll Assessment against objective and criteria - option 3 Main objective 69. This option would meet the main objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 70. To the extent that this option deters the use of foreign trusts, there would be no relevant activity and therefore no impact on New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. This is an improvement on the status quo. Maintaining an open economy 71. This option would not be consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, as this would deter the use of foreign trusts in New Zealand in situations where they are used for legitimate reasons. This may adversely impact New Zealand’s financial services sector. This would be worse than the status quo. Coherency of the tax system 72. This option is not consistent with other fundamental principles of the tax system, which does not tax foreign-sourced income of non-residents and therefore lacks coherence. Accordingly, this would be worse than the status quo. Fairness and integrity 73. The impact of this option on New Zealand’s on fairness and integrity is likely to be mixed. Overall, to the extent that foreign trusts are (or are perceived to be) misused for foreign tax avoidance or illicit purposes, this would have a positive impact. On the other hand, to the extent that foreign trusts are used for legitimate purposes, this option may have a negative impact as, in the context of New Zealand’s other rules, this approach may be perceived as inconsistent. It is not clear that option 3 is better or worse than the status quo. Efficiency of compliance and administration 74. If this option significantly reduces the likelihood of foreign trusts operating in New Zealand, which we would expect to happen, this would reduce administrative costs to Inland Revenue, and compliance costs for foreign trusts. In this respect it would be an improvement on the status quo. CONSULTATION 75. Inland Revenue has consulted with The Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Internal Affairs, and the New Zealand Police. They have raised no concerns with the proposals in the preferred option (option 2). 76. To ensure that amendments recommended by the Inquiry and accepted by the Government could be implemented in line with the application timeframes recommended by the Inquiry, while still being subject to select committee scrutiny, the time period for preparing this RIS has been shortened. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has not consulted more widely on the proposals. 77. However, in forming its recommendations, the Inquiry invited public submissions, and received 23 submissions, including from Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society, Transparency International, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, accounting firms, trust and company services providers, and individuals. The Inquiry also consulted with the Privacy Commissioner. 78. Part 11 of the Inquiry’s report summarised the submissions made to it. 79. Most of the submitters who commented on the taxation of foreign trusts considered that settlor-based approach for taxing trusts (which results in the tax exemption for foreign trusts) should continue, but that there should be some changes to disclosure requirements. Two submitters considered that the trust should be taxed on its worldwide income if there is a resident trustee. One submitter suggested abolishing foreign trusts. 80. Most submitters who commented on the current disclosure rules considered the current disclosure regime to be inadequate. The Inquiry noted that not all submissions were explicit about what disclosure obligations should be changed. One submitter thought that providing the extra information that is obtained for Australian settlors would be sufficient, while others wanted more extensive disclosure, including details of settlors and beneficiaries and annual income statements and distribution information. 81. The Inquiry noted that a number of submissions considered that the upcoming requirements to provide information under AEOI should help address shortfalls in disclosure, and that some thought that AEOI would be a complete solution. However, the Inquiry concluded in Part 6 that, for a significant number of foreign trusts, AEOI will not result in any material increase in the amount of information required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue agrees that the AEOI due diligence and reporting requirements seem likely to have only limited application to foreign trusts. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 82. The following table summarises the consideration of the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used: Better than the status quo x No better than the status quo xx Worse than the status quo ?

We do not recommend option 1 (the status quo) as that does not meet the stated objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion and money laundering and other illicit purposes. 84. We consider that option 2 would address the concerns relating to foreign tax avoidance or evasion. It may partially address the concerns relating to money-laundering and other illicit purposes. Accordingly, the recommended option in this RIS will meet the objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. 85. We recommend option 2 (increased disclosure, largely following the Inquiry’s recommendations) over option 3 (repeal of the tax exemption for foreign trusts), on the basis that option 2 will address the concerns regarding misuse of trusts without imposing excessive administrative costs. While option 3 would also meet the stated objective, it does not satisfactorily meet the criteria in relation to an open economy and the coherency of the tax system. Option 2 will increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for trust and company service providers. However, at this stage we consider that the administrative costs are relatively minimal. We do not consider that the increased compliance costs, which relate to additional information and the obligation to file annual returns, are likely to be significant. This increased information is broadly similar to the type of information that trust and company service providers (TCSPs) would be expected to provide where AEOI and AML obligations apply. Accordingly, requiring this information does not seem unreasonable. IMPLEMENTATION 86. Legislative change would be required to implement option 2. Legislative amendments required to implement option 2 could be included in a bill to be introduced in August 2016. This bill is expected to be enacted by the end of 2016. 87. Transitional provisions for existing foreign trusts are planned to provide them with enough time to comply with the proposed requirements. It is proposed that new foreign trusts would need to comply with the amended rules from the date of enactment, and that existing foreign trusts would have until 30 June 2017 to comply with the registration requirements. This transitional provision would allow existing trusts approximately six months to either collect the information required or to wind-up. New foreign trusts would need to comply with the annual filing obligation from date of enactment. Existing foreign trusts would need to comply with the annual filing obligation in relation to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2017. 14 88. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed changes. Some systems changes would be required to implement option 2. No changes to FIRST (Inland Revenue’s mainframe IT system) would be required. A revised form upon registration and a new annual disclosure form would also be required. 89. In implementing option 2, Inland Revenue would work with TCSPs to ensure that they and their clients understand the changes and their new obligations. As the industry is reasonably small, we consider that this is achievable. 90. Inland Revenue will continue with its current audit and education programme in relation to TCSPs. 91. Implementation of a searchable register of foreign trust registrations would require Inland Revenue to operate a manual spread-sheet database, which will be shared with other government agencies authorised by legislation. 92. Commentary on the proposed legislative changes would be released when the Bill is introduced. In addition, a special report and a Tax Information Bulletin containing further explanation of the amendments would be published once the Bill is enacted. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 93. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place takes under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post­ implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would be prioritised in the context of the current Tax Policy Work Programme, and any proposals would go through the GTPP. 94. The Inquiry recommended that the registration requirement be the responsibility of Inland Revenue initially, but the Government may want to consider if another department, such as the Companies Office, may be a more appropriate department at a later time. 95. Inland Revenue agrees with the Inquiry’s recommendation to review the position in future (after the existing rules have bedded in). It is possible that there may be efficiencies from another department other than Inland Revenue administering the registration of foreign trusts. This review would need to include consideration of: a. ensuring that information sharing between the other department and Inland Revenue is adequate (given that Inland Revenue may need to share information with its overseas counterparts, and to enforce the sanction of taxing the foreign trust’s income); and b. ensuring that the other department has the appropriate ability to investigate foreign trusts (both under legislation and operationally). 96. As part of this future review, Inland Revenue would report back to Ministers on the operation of the new disclosure rules. 97. The Inquiry also recommended that a review be undertaken of the current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between three agencies (Inland Revenue, the Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs) to determine the financial and efficiency gains and other implications (including secrecy considerations) of sharing strategic intelligence and other information between agencies. 98. Inland Revenue agrees in principle that there should be a review. It may be appropriate to include other regulatory agencies as well. In terms of timing, we consider that this should be considered in light of: a. current work on reforming the secrecy provisions in the TAA; and b. the timing of Phase II of AML/CFT and other priorities. 15 Regulatory Impact Statement Design of START - legislative issues Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis o f options to address three legislative issues that have arisen in relation to transferring tax types from Inland Revenue’s current computer system (FIRST) to Inland Revenue’s future computer system (START). The three issues relate to: • use-of-money interest (UOMI) and transfers of tax; • Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by removing the new due date concept; and • the administration of the grace periods concept (which provides for additional time for payment of a debt before late payment penalties are imposed) throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START. The options considered are intended to simplify the transition from FIRST to START while at the same time ensuring that the integrity of the tax system is preserved. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad- base, low-rate tax system. Legislative change is required before February 2017 because this is when GST is planned to be transitioned from FIRST to START. This feature presented a timing constraint on the amount of consultation and the extent of the analysis that could be undertaken. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury who are supportive of the recommendations set out in this RIS. Wider consultation was not conducted due to timing constraints (legislative change is required before February 2017 as this is when GST would be transitioned from FIRST to START). A key gap in the analysis is that Inland Revenue does not hold sufficient data to provide an estimate of the fiscal impact of the options relating to transfers of tax and amending the rules for new and increased assessments. A key risk is if the transition o f GST to START is delayed, then FIRST will operate inconsistently with the new legislation. Conversely, if the new legislation is delayed and GST is transitioned to START before the legislation is enacted, START would not be compliant with the existing legislation as it would be programmed in anticipation of the legislative amendments being passed. None of the policy options would impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles.

The RIS begins with generic background and objectives sections. These are followed by a regulatory impact analysis section which provides an overview o f each of the problems and their associated options for change. Within the overview tables in this section the following symbols are used:   - Significant improvement over the status quo   - Partial improvement over the status quo   - No improvement over the status quo In order to enhance readability, detailed analysis on each of the proposals has been shifted into a set o f three appendices, one for each proposal. Common consultation, conclusion, implementation and review sections follow the regulatory impact analysis section. 3 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 1. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get it right and difficult to get it wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The ways in which individuals work have changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casual in nature as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 5. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 6. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 7. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 4 8. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers o f complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorities. 9. However, Business Transformation (BT) is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. 10. As part of BT, FIRST will be replaced with a commercial-off-the-shelf tax and social policy software package from FAST Enterprises, referred to as START.1 The revenue system will be transitioned to START in the following stages: • Stage 1 - GST (early 2017) • Stage 2 - income and business taxes • Stage 3 - social policy • Stage 4 - any remaining taxes and duties 11. While thinking about how to transition the revenue system to START, three problems have been identified which relate to: • Use-of-money interest (UOMI) and transfers of tax. Put simply, taxpayers are able to receive more UOMI from Inland Revenue on overpayments/refunds o f tax than they are entitled to in some circumstances. Underpayment UOMI payable to Inland Revenue on underpayments is also reduced in some circumstances. These outcomes adversely impact the integrity and coherence o f the current rules and give rise to both efficiency and fairness concerns • Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner after the original due date (removal of the new due date concept) to remove the requirement for setting a new due date for payment to avoid having to customise the configuration of START to create a new due date in such situations. • The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START. Different tax types will be transitioned to START in different stages. This means that there will be a period in which tax 1 START stands for ‘Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology’ and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GENTAX software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 5 types will be administered from two different systems. This raises an issue with respect to late payment penalty grace periods, as the current rules require the Commissioner to look at the taxpayer’s payment history across multiple tax types in determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. This would give rise to administrative complexity and cost for Inland Revenue as tax types transition from FIRST to START. 12. Some background and more detail on each of these problems are provided in the appendices at the end of this document. OBJECTIVE 13. The main objective of the options is to simplify the transition from FIRST to START while ensuring the integrity of the tax system is preserved. 14. The transition from FIRST to START is simplified where START is customised as little as possible. 15. The integrity of the tax system is preserved when: • Taxpayers receive the amount of UOMI they are entitled to, and can continue to legitimately transfer excess tax to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI. • Taxpayers understand how interest and penalties are calculated, their interactions with Inland Revenue are minimised, and revenue collection is improved. • The Commissioner is able to administer a “grace periods” concept efficiently and accurately in a way that does not present difficulties or complexities for taxpayers. 16. All options are assessed against the following criteria: (a) Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. (b) Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance cost impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. (c) Sustainability of the tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes. 17. Legislative change is required before February 2017 as this is when GST is planned to be transitioned from FIRST to START. This feature presented a timing constraint on the extent of the analysis and consultation that could be undertaken. 6 18. It is also noted that we do not have sufficient data to provide an estimate of the fiscal impact of the options relating to transfers o f tax and amending the new due date rules for new and increased assessments. 19. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with the recommended changes. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 20. Officials have developed options to address the above three problems. Each o f these problems and the options to resolve them are summarised below. Further detail on these problems and their associated options is contained in the appendices at the end of this document. UOMI and transfers of tax 21. There are two issues associated with UOMI and transfers of tax: • Issue 1: When an amount transferred to a previous period exceeds the amount owing in that period, UOMI on the excess may start to accrue earlier than if the amount had remained in the original period. This will occur whenever the effective date for the transfer is earlier than the “date interest starts” under the UOMI rules. This is because FIRST incorrectly pays interest from the transfer date, rather than the applicable date under the UOMI rules. Taxpayers aware o f this inconsistency are able to make use of it by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. This is a system and administrative issue as FIRST is incorrectly applying the law. START is able to correctly apply the law with manual administrative processes for staff. Appendix A contains an example that illustrates this issue. • Issue 2: FIRST transfers overpayments of tax at the effective transfer date of a refund, rather than the effective transfer date of an overpayment. Thus where an overpayment has been transferred to satisfy a debt in a previous period, UOMI on that debt will stop accruing earlier than intended because that debt would be treated as having been paid off earlier - that is, at the refund effective transfer date, rather than the overpayment transfer date. Appendix A contains an example that illustrates this issue. 22. These issues arise because FIRST is unable to track the source of a credit (a positive balance for the taxpayer) - for example, what period it arose from and whether it arose from a refund or an overpayment. As a result, FIRST pays UOMI on credits (i.e. refunds or payments) added to a period from the date they are added (rather than the correct date under the UOMI rules), and transfers of overpayments are made at the refund date, rather than the payment date. A further cause of issue 2 is that there is a lack o f clarity in the law - basically the law allows a GST overpayment to be transferred at the effective date of a GST refund. The law is clear in relation to transfers of other tax types. 7 Options and analysis 23. Appendix A contains detailed analysis of the options. 24. The status quo does not meet the objective as START would need to be customised in order to apply the status quo (i.e. START would need to be customised to incorrectly apply the law just as FIRST does) and taxpayers would be able to receive more UOMI than they are entitled to. The status quo has the following implications: • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers with knowledge of the inconsistencies would gain an unfair advantage. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Taxpayers would incur compliance costs, and Inland Revenue would incur administration costs resulting from tax being transferred to prior periods that are not in debt or dispute. • Sustainability of the tax system: Taxpayers would continue to be able to artificially manipulate UOMI calculations. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 - Amend the transfer rules to prevent transfers of tax to previous periods that exceed the amount of debt or amount in dispute in that period. Amend the transfer and UOMI rules as they relate to GST to ensure the law achieves the policy intent. Meets the main objective. Fairness & equity:   Compliance and administration:   Sustainability:   Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo. Option 2 - Configure START to correctly apply the current law. Amend the transfer and UOMI rules as they relate to GST to ensure the law achieves the policy intent. Partially meets the main objective. Fairness & equity:   Compliance and administration:   Sustainability:   Overall comment: Improvement on status quo. Recommendation 25. Option 1 was recommended over option 2 as it prohibits excess transfers of tax to prior periods which would prevent taxpayers artificially manipulating UOMI calculations in relation to all tax types. Although taxpayers would be prevented from gaming the system with option 2, this would only be in relation to tax types administered by START. Therefore, if option 2 were chosen, taxpayers would continue be able to game the system in relation to some tax types until 2021 when all tax types have been transitioned to START. Although there would be no harm in allowing excess transfers of tax to prior periods once all tax types were administered by START, such a transfer would serve no purpose. It might also be beneficial to limit these transfers in order to prevent mistakes (i.e. the taxpayer might mistype the period they wished to transfer to). 8 Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 26. If a taxpayer does not file a tax return, or if a taxpayer files an incorrect tax return, the Commissioner may, subject to limits on her powers, make an assessment for the amount of tax that ought to be imposed. When this occurs, a new (and later) due date that is 30 or more days after the notice of assessment date is generally set for the payment of the resulting tax liability. This allows the taxpayer time to pay the increased tax liability. 27. Interest applies from the day after the original due date for the payment of the tax. However, late payment penalties on the increased assessment are imposed on the day after the new due date for the outstanding tax liability if the taxpayer does not pay the tax outstanding plus interest in full by the new due date. These rules result in different due dates in relation to a single tax period which adds complexity. 28. In addition, any excess tax or amount that becomes refundable (this can be for another tax type or period) between the notice of assessment and the new due date is generally refunded to the taxpayer who is then required to repay the relevant amount to the Commissioner shortly afterwards (by the new due date). This increases compliance costs and effort for taxpayers and increases the risk of incurring additional UOMI and late payment penalties if the taxpayer does not pay the relevant amount in time. 29. There are differences in the way Inland Revenue’s current FIRST system and the new START system operate. In FIRST a new due date has to be created for each new or increased assessment in order to allow time for the taxpayer to pay the resulting tax before late payment penalties are imposed. START’s core functionality operates on a taxable period basis that allows for a period of time for payment before late payment penalties apply without requiring a new due date to be established each time the Commissioner makes an (re-)assessment for a taxable period. This reduces complexity and reflects the fact that the relevant assessment relates to the original due date of the period and would have been due to be paid on the original due date. However, implementing the current legislative framework for setting new due dates for each new or increased assessment in START requires significant customisation and limits the ability to use some of START’s core functionalities. 30. During the course of the BT Programme there would be a period of “co-existence” in which some tax and social policy products would be administered in START and others would be administered in FIRST (“the Coexistence Period”). The amendment outlined in option 2 below would only apply to tax types administered in START. This means that during the Coexistence Period taxpayers would be treated differently depending on the tax type that the Commissioner assessed or re-assessed and whether this tax type was administered in FIRST or in START. Options and analysis 31. Appendix B contains detailed analysis of the options. 9 OptionsAnalysis against the objectives O p tio n 1 - M a in ta in th e s ta tu s q u o a n d c u s to m is e S T A R T a n e w d u e d a te is se t f o r a (re -)a s s e s s m e n t 3 0 d a y s o r m o r e a f te r th e n o tic e o f (r e -)a s s e s s m e n t a n d la te p a y m e n t p e n a ltie s a re a p p lie d fr o m t h e d a y a f te r th e n e w d u e d a te .

Recommendation 32. Officials recommend option 2 because it would avoid heavy customisation o f START, minimise compliance costs for some taxpayers and improve revenue collection. The administration of the grace periods concept through the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 33. During the course of the BT Programme, there will be a period of “co-existence”, in which some tax and social policy products will be administered in START and others will be administered in FIRST (“the Coexistence Period”). 34. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity would reside in two systems, it would be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a late payment penalty grace period.

Recommendation 36. Officials recommend option 3 on the basis that it would allow accurate and consistent application of the grace periods concept throughout the coexistence period and it would not give rise to any issues with respect to compliance and administration. CONSULTATION 37. Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury who are supportive o f the options chosen in this RIS. 38. Wider consultation was not conducted owing to time constraints - legislative change is required before February 2017 because this is when GST will be transitioned from FIRST to START. Officials have commenced limited consultation with CAANZ on the proposals to test their reaction. CAANZ has indicated it supports the grace periods proposal. Officials are still to hear back from them in relation to the other two proposals. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS UOMI and transfers of tax 39. Inland Revenue prefers option 1, which is to amend the transfer rules and UOMI rules to limit transfers of tax to prior periods and to ensure the law achieves the policy intent, for the following reasons: 11 • It would prevent taxpayers from artificially manipulating UOMI calculations in order to obtain a benefit. This would result in a fiscal gain as Inland Revenue would no longer be paying UOMI to taxpayers who are not entitled to it. • It would address inconsistencies in the legislation and improve clarity. • It will prevent taxpayers accidentally transferring excessive amounts to prior periods. Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 40. Inland Revenue prefers option 2 for the following reasons: • It would simplify the design of START in relation to new and increased assessments. • It would avoid customisation of START to minimise long term costs of the system. • It would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers who wish to have credits applied to a debt and improve revenue collection. The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 41. Inland Revenue prefers option 3 for the following reasons: • It would allow for an accurate and consistent application of the grace periods concept throughout the Coexistence Period. • It would not give rise to any system integrity issues. • It does not require systems to be developed to integrate FIRST and START. IMPLEMENTATION 42. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required in order to give effect to these proposals. It is proposed that these amendments be included in the Taxation (Provisional Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is expected to be introduced later this year and receive Royal assent by the end of 2016. 43. When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 44. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed changes. The proposals would have minor systems implications for Inland Revenue but may result in some additional 12 administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate the changes. There would also be some staff costs associated with the UOMI and transfers o f tax proposals, which is examined in further detail below. These costs are expected to be insignificant and would be met as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. UOMI and transfers of tax 45. It is important to note that these proposals would only apply to START, not to FIRST. This is because FIRST is unable to apply these amendments because of deficiencies in the FIRST system. It is not feasible to incur costs to amend FIRST when all tax types would be transitioned to START within a few years of the enactment of the legislation. In order to ensure compliance with the legislation, preventing transfers of excess tax to prior periods and ensuring transfers of overpayments to cover a debt in a prior period are made at the correct date would be dealt with administratively by Inland Revenue staff for all other tax types until such time as those tax types are transferred to START. 46. This is not expected to impose a significant administrative burden because: • Taxpayers are unlikely to attempt to transfer excess tax to prior periods once aware it is no longer legal. • Transfers of overpayments to cover debts in prior periods is relatively uncommon as taxpayers generally pay off their debts before paying upcoming tax liabilities in order to reduce their exposure to penalties and interest. Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 47. The proposal for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner would only apply to START and not to FIRST due to system constraints in the way FIRST operates. This means that the proposal would apply to assessments and re-assessments of tax types as and when they transition to START. The existing rules would continue to apply for assessments of tax types that have not yet transitioned to START. The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 48. The proposal for the administration of grace periods would require legislative amendment to ensure that the Commissioner is able to only look at compliance history that exists within the system from which the tax type in question (the tax type in respect of which there has been a payment default) is being administered. 49. As this legislative amendment would allow for each system to administer grace periods independently of the other, this proposal is not expected to impose a significant administrative burden. This is because it would remove the need for grace periods to be managed manually across the two systems. 13 14 Implementation risks 50. A key implementation risk would arise if the application dates of the legislation do not align with the transition of GST to START. This would have the following implications: • If the legislation is in force and GST has not transitioned to START, then FIRST would be operating contrary to the law. This risk could be managed administratively for the transfers o f tax and new due date proposals - i.e. Inland Revenue would simply limit transfers of tax to prior periods and not assign a new due date to new/increased assessments. The grace periods proposal would be drafted in such a way that a delay in the transition of GST to START would have no impact. • If the legislation is not in force but GST has transitioned to START, START would be operating contrary to the law as it would be coded in anticipation o f the legislative amendments being passed. This could be managed administratively by backing out what START does, but would involve significant manual work and significant costs. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 51. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. APPENDIX A - UOMI AND TRANSFERS OF TAX Background - status quo GST periods, refunds and overpayments 2 1. GST registered persons must file a GST return and pay any tax owing generally by the 28th of the month following the end of their taxable period. Taxable periods are one month, two months or six months. 2. A GST refund arises where GST inputs/expenses exceed GST outputs/sales. Instead of the taxpayer paying the GST output amount and claiming back the GST input amount, these amounts are netted off and the taxpayer receives a refund without making a payment. This is distinct from a GST overpayment - which occurs when the taxpayer pays more than is necessary to satisfy their tax liability. Use-of-money interest 3. UOMI is applied to underpayments and overpayments of tax to compensate one party for the use of the other party’s money and to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. If taxpayers pay too much tax, they receive interest at 1.62% per annum from the Commissioner until the excess is refunded by the Commissioner or applied to another tax liability, whereas if the taxpayer pays too little tax, they must pay the Commissioner interest at 8.27% per annum on the outstanding balance until the balance is paid. Taxpayers do not receive UOMI on prepayments of tax. 4. There are rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 which determine the date interest starts for the purposes of credit (paid by Inland Revenue to the taxpayer) and debit (paid by the taxpayer to Inland Revenue) UOMI. 5. For underpaid tax, UOMI generally begins on the day after the due date for payment of the tax. 6. For overpaid tax and GST refunds, UOMI generally begins on the latest of: • The day after the due date for payment; • The day after the payment is made; or • The day after the tax return is provided. 7. UOMI stops being charged on underpaid tax on the date that the tax is paid or credited as paid (for example, when the taxpayer transfers tax from a period that is overpaid in order to satisfy the underpayment). 2 Taxpayers with an annual turnover from a taxable activity exceeding $60,000 must register for GST. Taxpayers with a turnover below this threshold or bodies corporate may choose to register. 15 8. UOMI stops being earned on overpaid tax when it is refunded by the Commissioner or applied to another tax liability. Transfers of excess tax 9. Taxpayers are able to transfer excess tax to another tax period or to another tax type or even to other taxpayers. This enables taxpayers to transfer overpaid tax to a period/tax type that has been underpaid, in order to reduce UOMI on that underpaid tax. The transfer rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 restrict what date a taxpayer may choose to transfer excess tax. Tax may be transferred: • On any date after the end of the GST return period in which the refund arose (for a GST refund). • On any date that occurs on or after the date the excess tax is paid (for an overpayment of tax). • A day after the end o f the accounting year in which the amount was deducted (for tax deducted on the taxpayer’s behalf - i.e. PAYE and RWT). 10. Put simply, a taxpayer is only able to transfer excess tax once they become entitled to it. GST refunds have an earlier effective transfer date than overpayments because the first of the month is in effect when the GST refund arose for the previous month. 11. The transfer effective date is very important as it affects when UOMI on a prior period underpayment stops being charged. For example, if a taxpayer owed $200 for the June GST period, and was entitled to a GST refund of $200 in the July GST period which he wished to transfer to the June period, the effective transfer date for this refund would be 1 August. UOMI on the June underpayment would cease at 1 August, as this is when the July refund is transferred to satisfy the June debt3. Problem definition 12. There are two issues with the current tax rules. Issue 1 - excess UOMI on “overpayments” 13. Taxpayers are able to receive more UOMI from Inland Revenue on “overpayments” than they are entitled to in some circumstances. Example 14. Bob files his 2014 income tax return and is due a refund of $8,000 arising from tax being withheld at source at incorrect rates. He requests that this refund is transferred to his 2013 taxable period, which has a nil balance. The $8,000 is transferred as its earliest effective 3 For the purposes of this example assume no penalties or interest accrued on the $200 debt, so that the $200 payment fully satisfied it. Transfers are first applied to any interest or late payment penalties that have accrued on the debt, before being applied to the debt. 16 date of 1 April 2014 (the day after the end of the accounting year in which the amount was deducted - see paragraph 9). 15. FIRST treats this transfer date of 1 April as a payment date and pays UOMI on the $8,000 balance from 2 April 2014 (the day after the “payment” was made). This is a misapplication of the rules as interest should begin on 8 February 2015 (the day after the due date for payment of tax for the 2014 period). 16. However, as FIRST is unable to track the source of payments, it sees a “payment” being made on 1 April and therefore the only UOMI rule it could apply would be the “day after the payment is made” rule (FIRST couldn’t use the “day after tax return is provided” or “day after due date for payment” rules as it is unable to track that the payment actually comes from a refund in the 2014 taxable period). As a result, Bob is paid almost a year’s worth of interest to which he is not entitled (interest is paid from 2 April 2014 rather than 8 February 2015). 17. Taxpayers aware of this inconsistency are able to make use of it by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. Issue 2 - reduced UOMI on underpayments 18. Taxpayers are able to reduce the amount of UOMI payable to Inland Revenue on underpayments of GST in some circumstances. Example 19. Vicki has a debt of $600 for her June GST period. She files her July GST return on 28 August, and mistakenly overpays (also on 28 August) by $600. Vicki requests that this $600 overpayment is transferred to the June period. Based on the intended application of the transfer rules, the effective date for this transfer is any date from 28 August. 20. FIRST treats the transfer as having been made on the 1st of August (which is the refund transfer date). As a result, UOMI that Vicki had to pay the IRD on her $600 June debt ceases on the 1st of August,4 rather than on the 28th of August (this is the correct date under the UOMI rules). 4 For the purposes of this example assume no penalties or interest accrued on the $600 debt, so that the $600 payment fully satisfied it. 17 Scale of the problem 21. A large number of tax agents manufacture UOMI by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. 22. Without any legislative change, taxpayers could continue to “game the system” by artificially increasing the amount of UOMI paid to them by Inland Revenue. This practice effectively allows taxpayers who have knowledge of this inconsistency to push the tax burden disproportionately onto other taxpayers. This was not intended. The amount of underpayment UOMI taxpayers must pay to Inland Revenue would also be reduced in some circumstances, although taxpayers are unable to manipulate this. Options and analysis 23. Two options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Amend the transfer and UOMI rules (Officials’ preferred option). • Option 2: Configure START to apply the current law. Option 1 24. Under this option, the following amendments would be made to the UOMI and transfer rules: • Taxpayers would be prevented from transferring tax to a prior period that exceeds the amount of debt or amount in dispute in that period. This would prevent taxpayers from obtaining credit UOMI on overpayments transferred to prior periods. • The difference between a GST refund and GST overpayment would be clarified for the purposes of the transfer rules. This would prevent taxpayers from being able to reduce underpayment UOMI by obtaining the GST refund effective transfer date for an overpayment. 18 • The difference between a GST refund and GST overpayment would be clarified for the purposes of the UOMI rules. This would enhance clarity in the legislation. 25. It is important to note that, unlike START, FIRST is unable to prevent transfers o f excess tax to prior periods. By the application date of the above amendments, only GST would have transitioned to START. For all other tax types, these amendments would be manually administered by Inland Revenue staff (see paragraphs 45 and 46 in the main report for further information). Assessment against objective and criteria - option 1 • Main objective: This option would meet the main objective for two reasons. First, START would not need to be customised in order to prevent transfers o f tax to prior periods that exceed that amount in debt or dispute in that period, as this option is available within START’s default settings. Second, taxpayers would only receive the amount of UOMI to which they are entitled and would continue to be able to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI by transferring refunds/overpayments to satisfy debts in prior periods. • Fairness and equity: This option would improve equity as it would prevent taxpayers from obtaining UOMI artificially, therefore preventing taxpayers with knowledge o f this from obtaining an unfair advantage over other taxpayers. This option meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option would reduce compliance costs as taxpayers will no longer incur compliance costs associated with moving tax between periods in order to artificially manipulate UOMI. This option would result in a minor and temporary increase in administrative costs arising from Inland Revenue staff having to manually administer these amendments in relation to tax types that have not transitioned to START at the application date o f the legislation. This option partially meets this criterion. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option would improve the sustainability o f the tax system as it prevents taxpayers from artificially manipulating UOMI calculations. It also prevents underpayment UOMI from ceasing earlier than it should. This option meets this criterion. 26. Option 1 represents a significant improvement on the status quo. Option 2 27. Under this option START would be configured to correctly apply the current law (i.e. START would be able to track the source of a credit so will know what period a payment came from, and would therefore be able to pay UOMI from the correct date). The law would only be applied correctly for tax types that are administered in START (tax types will be transitioned to START in stages as outlined in paragraph 10 in the main report), and therefore would not frilly prevent the problems outlined until all tax types have transitioned to START. 19 Amendments would also be made to the transfer and UOMI rules in relation to GST (bullet points 2 and 3 of paragraph 24 of Appendix A). Assessment against objective and criteria - option 2 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective. START would not need to be customised in order to be able to track the source of a credit as this is part of START’s inherent functionality. Taxpayers would receive more UOMI than they are entitled to on other tax types until those tax types are transitioned to START. Taxpayers could continue to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI by transferring refunds/overpayments to satisfy debts in prior periods. • Fairness and equity: This option would improve equity as it would prevent taxpayers from obtaining credit UOMI artificially, however it only partially meets this criterion as taxpayers would be able to artificially obtain UOMI on tax types until they are transferred to START. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option would reduce compliance costs (albeit delayed because of the timeline for transitioning other tax types to START) as taxpayers would no longer incur compliance costs associated with moving tax between periods in order to artificially manipulate UOMI. This option would only result in very minor administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate changes. This option partially meets this criterion. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option would improve the sustainability of the tax system as it prevents (albeit delayed in relation to tax types other than GST) taxpayers from artificially manipulating credit UOMI calculations. This option partially meets this criterion. 28. Option 2 represents an improvement on the status quo. Fiscal implications of the options Options Fiscal impact Option 1 Prevent transfers of excess tax, amend the UOMI and transfer rules. This option results in an unquantifiable fiscal gain resulting from: - preventing taxpayers obtaining credit UOMI they are not entitled to; and - ensuring underpayment UOMI taxpayers must pay to Inland Revenue on underpayments is not artificially reduced. Option 2 - Configure START to apply the current law. This option also results in an unquantifiable fiscal gain resulting from the above; however it would be slightly delayed given that not all tax types will immediately transition to START. 20 APPENDIX B -DUE DATES FOR NEW AND INCREASED ASSESSMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER Background - status quo 1. The transition from FIRST to START provides opportunities to streamline and improve the way taxpayers and Inland Revenue interact. However, it also presents some challenges due to the different ways FIRST and START operate. One area of opportunity and challenge is the setting of new due dates for new or increased assessments by the Commissioner and the resulting complexities. 2. The new due date is required to be set 30 or more days after the date of the notice of the assessment. Administrative practice is to set the new due date 60 days after the assessment. Interest starts on the day after the original due date for the payment of the tax. Late payment penalties, however, are imposed on the day after the new due date for the outstanding tax liability if the taxpayer does not pay the tax outstanding plus interest in frill by the new due date. These new due date rules result in different due dates in relation to a single tax period which adds complexity to the calculation o f interest and penalties. 3. The following diagram shows the differing dates for the calculation of UOMI and penalties for a January 2016 GST return that is not paid and is then reassessed on 16 March 2016. 4. The following diagram shows how a refund can be released even when the taxpayer has been assessed for a period that has passed its original due date for payment and will be required to pay the assessed amount shortly, and is already incurring UOMI. 21 28 Feb 2016 Jan 2016 GST return filed 16 Mar 2016 Increased assessment 7 May 2016 Mar 2016 GST return filed 14 May 2016 Mar 2016 GST return processed 27 May 2016 Due date for Jan 2016 GST reassessment $100 assessment paid $50 assessment increase not yet due Return showing $75 refund filed $75 refund released $50 (+ UOMI) payment required Problem definition 5. Implementing the current legislative framework for setting new due dates in START would require significant customisation and would limit the ability to use some of START’s core functionalities. START has the ability to automatically apply any excess tax or credit that becomes refundable to satisfy a debit amount in the system. This limits underpayment UOMI charged to a taxpayer and also reduces the interaction they are required to have with Inland Revenue. 6. START does this by looking at taxable periods that have passed their due date and whether there is any outstanding amount in relation to these previous periods. However, this period based approach means that the system does not distinguish between a debt (an amount that has passed its due date for payment) and a debit (an amount that relates to a taxable period that has passed its original due date, but that itself is not yet due to be paid). 7. Although this system configuration can be supressed, it would mean significant customisation and manual processing. This would also impact other desirable features of START, such as real-time balancing of taxpayer accounts which provides transparency for taxpayers of what they are required to pay at any time. Options and analysis 8. The status quo and an option for change have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo by customising START to allow the setting of a new due date for new and increased assessments (status quo). • Option 2: Amend the law so that no new due date is set for a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner for taxable periods that have passed their original due date for payment, but allow time for payment of the assessed amount before late payment penalties are applied (officials’ preferred option) Option 1 9. This option would involve implementing the existing new due date rules for new and amended assessments in START and customising START to the extent needed to allow for 22 different due dates (original and new due date(s)) to be created and managed within a single tax period. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option would not meet the main objective as it would require significant customisation of START to an extent that it would limit the use of some o f the core functionalities of START. Manually managing transfers and the application o f credits against liabilities within START would be required. Owing to the significant complexity involved in manually managing transactions there is potential for error. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers have time to pay a tax liability resulting from a new or increased assessment before late payment penalties are applied. Taxpayers who have a refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will have this refunded to them then be required to make a separate payment on the due date. Taxpayers who are aware of this can ask for the refund to be transferred to meet their liability which may result in lower UOMI than if they have the amount refunded then repaid. This only partially meets the criteria. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Under this option any excess tax or other credit that becomes refundable to the taxpayer in the period between the notice of assessment and the new due date for payment will continue to be refunded to the taxpayer, despite the fact that the taxpayer will be required to make payment of the tax resulting from the notice of assessment to Inland Revenue shortly after receiving this refund (i.e. by the new due date). Manual managing o f some transfers and the application of credits in payment of tax and other liabilities would be required, which gives rise to increased resourcing and administrative costs to Inland Revenue. This does not meet the criteria. • Sustainability of the tax system: Due dates and the calculation of interest and penalties for new and increased assessments will continue to be complex. Taxpayers are at a higher risk of incurring penalties and increased interest because overpayments of tax are refunded to the taxpayer unless the taxpayer requests otherwise even where a payment is due shortly after the refund. This does not meet the criteria. Option 2 10. This option would involve a legislative change that the Commissioner would not set a new due date for new or increased assessments. However, the current way interest is calculated would be retained and the date for applying late payment penalties would also be unchanged as they would be imposed 31 or more days after the (re-)assessment. 11. During a Coexistence Period some tax types and social policy products will be administered in START and others in FIRST. In relation to this option this means that during the Coexistence Period taxpayers would be treated differently depending on the tax type that the Commissioner has assessed or re-assessed. For tax types that are administered in START no new due date would be set and refunds or credits becoming available would be applied to the tax liability from the assessment date. Relevant assessments of tax types that are 23 administered in FIRST would receive a new due date for payment. Credits and refunds that become available between the assessment date and the new due date would not be applied to offset the new or increased tax liability unless the taxpayer requests otherwise but would be refunded to the taxpayer. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option would meet the objective as it would avoid customisation and minimise complexity of START and allow Inland Revenue to leverage the inherent system functionality. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers who have no refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will continue to have time to pay tax resulting from a new or increased assessment before late payment penalties are applied. These taxpayers will have the same financial outcome as under the status quo. However, taxpayers who have a refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will have this applied to satisfy their tax liability automatically when it becomes available. This means that these taxpayers would effectively “pay” earlier than is required under status quo; however, this may reduce their UOMI liability. Any further excess credits available would be refunded to the taxpayer. This is an improvement on the status quo. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Compliance costs are reduced for taxpayers whose refunds are applied to satisfy the tax liability arising from a new or increased assessment, instead o f receiving a refund and having a payment obligation shortly after. This option would enable Inland Revenue to take advantage of START’s core functionalities in relation to automatic handling of transfers and application of credits to satisfy liabilities within the system and does not require any additional resources and accordingly does not give rise to the efficiency concerns raised in respect of option one. This is a significant improvement on the status quo. • Sustainability of the tax system: Due dates, interest and penalty calculations within a tax period that had a new or increased assessment would be simplified and easier to follow for taxpayers. Revenue collection will be improved. This is an improvement on the status quo. 12. This option represents an improvement on the status quo. Fiscal implications of the options OptionsFiscal impact Option 1 - Maintain the status quo None Option 2 - Amend the law A small unquantifiable fiscal loss of UOMI due to automatic application of credit or refund to tax liability is largely offset by an earlier resolution of the tax obligation. 24 APPENDIX C - ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRACE PERIODS CONCEPT Background status quo Late payment penalty grace periods 1. The current legislative framework for penalties sets out that a late payment penalty will be imposed if a taxpayer does not pay on time.5 However, where the taxpayer has punctually paid all taxes due in the two years prior to the default in question, the Commissioner must first issue a notice to the taxpayer specifying a further date for the unpaid tax, before a late payment penalty can be imposed. This gives the taxpayer a grace period in which to pay the amount owing before the imposition of late payment penalties.6 2. The application o f the late payment penalty grace period is determined on the basis o f the taxpayer’s previous compliance in terms o f the payment of tax across all relevant tax types (such as GST, income tax and PAYE deductions).7 3. The transition from FIRST to START will be done on a tax-type by tax-type basis, with GST being transferred to START in early 2017 and income tax, FBT and PAYE being transferred in 2018. This raises an issue with respect to the late payment penalty grace period, as the current legislative framework for the application o f the penalty requires the Commissioner to consider the taxpayer’s compliance history across all applicable tax types. Problem definition 4. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity will reside in two systems, it will be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. Without significant manual intervention, or an integration of FIRST and START, Inland Revenue will not be able to administer the current grace period rule. Scale of the problem 5. The manual intervention necessary to look across both systems to see all applicable tax types would require significant resources on the part of Inland Revenue. 6. By way o f illustration, the number of customers who could have been eligible for a late payment penalty grace period in respect of the due date of 20 November 2015 was 603,867. If this were to occur during the Coexistence Period (with the status quo retained), this would require 603,867 manual interventions to correctly administer the grace periods rules. 5 A financial penalty for late payment of tax is automatically imposed at 1% on the initial date the tax was due to be paid, at 4% seven days later, and at 1% each month after that. 6 If the taxpayer does not make payment within that notified further period, the late payment penalty is imposed as usual from the day after the original due date. 7 The late payment penalty grace period applies to all tax types except the following: child support, student loan scheme, tax credits (formerly known as rebates), certain types of provisional tax, KiwiSaver voluntary employer contributions and complying fund debt referred to Inland Revenue from the Financial Markets Authority. 25 26 Options and analysis 7. Two options for change and the status quo have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the stated objectives. The options are: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo by manually managing grace periods across FIRST and START (status quo) • Option 2: Integrate FIRST and START to deliver customer level grace periods (integration approach). • Option 3: Amend the law (officials’ preferred option). 8. Within the third option, there are two “sub-options” with respect to the way in which the selected legislative amendment makes provision for the consideration of payment behaviour history. The two “sub-options” are outlined below, as part of the analysis of the third option. Option 1 9. This option would involve continuing to apply the existing grace period rules until all tax types have been transitioned and the implementation of START is complete. As the current rules require a taxpayer’s compliance history across all tax types to be considered, this option would require Inland Revenue to manually manage customer-level grace periods across FIRST and START. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option partially meets the objective because, while it does not require any additional configuration to the START system and will not present difficulties or complexities for taxpayers, it would require significant manual intervention. • Fairness and equity: Retaining the current grace period regime throughout the Coexistence Period maintains equity among taxpayers as, in all cases, the applicability of a grace period will be determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s compliance across all tax types, irrespective of whether the tax type in question is being administered through FIRST or START. This option meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option does not meet this objective in that manually managing grace periods across the two systems would give rise to increased resourcing and administrative costs to Inland Revenue. In addition, it is considered that this option poses a risk to the integrity of Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system due to the significant complexity of and difficulties inherent in manually managing grace periods across two systems, and the risks associated with this. Manually managing grace periods across two systems gives rise to significant potential for error, which could also inadvertently result in different treatment among taxpayers. 27 • Sustainability of the tax system: This option preserves the application of the current grace periods rules and therefore will not give rise to any difficulties for taxpayers or to the potential for tax-driven outcomes. There is, however, the potential for this option to give rise to an integrity risk for Inland Revenue, in that manually managing grace periods across two systems will generate significant potential for error. This option partially meets this criterion. Option 2 10. The Integration Approach involves continuing to apply the existing grace period rules and integrating FIRST and START to the extent needed to identify all late payments and determine the appropriate application of grace periods. 11. Integrating FIRST and START for the purpose of managing grace periods would require real-time interfaces in FIRST and START to enable the real-time transfer o f information, which would require new code to be written. The new code and real-time interfaces developed for this purpose would only be used for the duration of the Coexistence Period. As this option requires START to be reconfigured, this option does not meet this objective. Assessment against criteria 12. As this option does not meet the overarching objective, it is not a viable option and accordingly does not need to be assessed against the criteria. 13. This option would not lead to any improvement on the status quo. Option 3 14. This option involves amending the legislation to allow grace periods to be managed independently in each of the two systems. 15. The proposed legislative amendment would mean that when a taxpayer defaults on a payment, the Commissioner would only look at information regarding the taxpayer’s previous behaviour that is contained in the system (FIRST or START) from which the tax type in question is being administered when determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. 16. The previous behaviour information that is contained in START will be dependent on the form in which compliance history is brought across to START. The two options for the way in which taxpayer compliance history is brought across to START are outlined below. (a) Customer level indicator 17. The first option with respect to the transfer of compliance history to START is to bring across an indicator that would show when the taxpayer is next entitled to a grace period, based on the date that they last paid late. The indicator would encompass the taxpayer’s payment history from February 2015 (two years before GST is brought across to START) to February 2017 in respect of income tax, GST, FBT and PAYE. 18. Although the taxpayer’s payment history across all these tax types will inform the indicator date (the date at which the taxpayer will next be entitled to a grace period) it will not be possible to identify the tax type in respect of which the default has occurred. 19. During Stage 1 of START, this indicator would be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period when they default on a GST payment (where the GST period in issue is a period after the date on which GST was transferred to START). Where the taxpayer defaults on a payment in respect of a tax type that is still being administered through FIRST, the compliance history that exists in FIRST at that time will be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. 20. It should be noted that the indicator will be a “snapshot” of the taxpayer’s compliance history from February 2015 to February 2017. Information relating to the taxpayer’s compliance regarding income tax, PAYE and FBT after February 2017 will not be able to be taken into account in determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period when they default on a GST payment after this date. As time passes, there will accordingly be a “compliance history relevance tail-off’ in terms of the indicator for the purposes of determining whether the taxpayer will be entitled to a grace period for products remaining in FIRST in respect of defaults in payments of GST. 21. The intention is that a new “compliance indicator” will be brought across when income tax is transitioned to START. Assuming that income tax is transitioned to START in April 2018 (noting that this is only a proposed date), this second indicator would encompass the taxpayer’s payment history from April 2016 (two years before income tax is brought across to START) to April 2018 in respect of income tax, FBT and PAYE. The second indicator would “top up” the relevant compliance history encompassed by the first indicator from February 2019 (the end date of the indicator brought across with GST) to April 2020 (two years from the date on which the second compliance indicator is brought across). As GST will have been operated from START from February 2017, the information that is brought across by the second indicator will not encompass GST. The information relating to the taxpayer’s compliance with respect to GST payments will be required to “supplement” the information on the second indicator. This is illustrated on the diagram below. 28 22. Compliance information with respect to periods that occur after the tax type in question has transitioned to START will only exist in START and will not be visible in FIRST. (b) Individual tax type compliance history 23. The second option with respect to the transfer of compliance history to START is to only bring across compliance history that relates to the specific tax type that is being transferred. For stage one, only the customer’s compliance history that relates to GST would be transferred across to START. This option would mean that, if a taxpayer misses a payment date, the Commissioner would only look at the taxpayer’s previous behaviour regarding payments made in respect of the tax type in question, and any other tax types administered from the same system, when determining whether or not to impose a penalty. 24. During stage 1 o f the implementation o f START, this would mean that the timeliness o f a taxpayer’s GST payments would be considered in isolation from all other tax types. As the Business Transformation Programme continues and more tax types are moved from FIRST to START, a more holistic view o f the timeliness o f a taxpayer’s payment history would once again be considered when deciding whether to apply a late payment penalty. 25. Compliance information with respect to periods that occur after the tax type in question has transitioned to START will only exist in START and will not be visible in FIRST. Required legislative amendments 26. Irrespective of which of the compliance history options is selected, the third option will require legislative amendment to ensure that the Commissioner is able to only look at the compliance history that exists within the system from which the tax type in question (the tax type in respect of which there has been a payment default) is being administered. 29 Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option will not require any additional configuration to START, irrespective of which of the compliance history options is selected. This option therefore meets the objective. • Fairness and equity: This option raises an issue with respect to horizontal equity in that, during the period in which different tax types are administered out of different systems, some taxpayers will be able to benefit from a grace period to which they would previously not have been entitled. The way in which this could arise is illustrated by the following hypothetical examples:8 (i) The date is 31 August 2017. Taxpayer 1 is a small business owner who fails to pay their GST liability by the 28 August 2017 due date. They were two weeks late in paying their PAYE liability by the 20 June 2017 due date. As the PAYE period in which they defaulted occurred after GST and the compliance history indicator was transferred to START, this will not be able to be considered in determining whether Taxpayer 1 will be entitled to a grace period in respect of their late payment of GST for the period ended 28 June 2017. Taxpayer 1 will accordingly be entitled to a grace period to which they would not, under the current system, have been entitled. (ii) The date is 31 August 2017. Taxpayer 2 is a small business owner who fails to pay their PAYE liability by the 20 August 2017 due date. They were also two weeks late in paying their GST liability by the 28 June 2017 due date. As the GST period in which they defaulted occurred after GST was transferred to START, this will not be able to be considered by FIRST in determining whether Taxpayer 2 should be entitled to a grace period in respect of their late payment of PAYE for the period ended 20 August 2017. Taxpayer 2 will accordingly be entitled to a grace period to which they would not, under the current system, have been entitled. (iii) The date is 30 June 2017. Taxpayer 3 is a small business owner who fails to pay their PAYE liability (of one period) by the 20 June 2017 due date. They were two weeks late in paying last year’s income tax liability, due 7 April 2016. A late payment penalty will automatically be imposed, as PAYE and income tax will still be being administered within the FIRST system. Taxpayer 3 will not be entitled to a grace period, as they were late in paying the income tax they owed last year. Viewed against the previous two examples, this scenario illustrates how, under option 3, taxpayers’ entitlements to a grace period will to some extent be dependent on the tax type in respect of which they have made a late payment and the system through which this tax type is being administered. It should be noted that option (b) with respect to the way in which compliance history is brought across to START gives rise to a slightly greater issue with respect to horizontal 8 It is assumed, for the purpose of these scenarios, that the taxpayer has not defaulted on any payments other than those stated in the examples. 30 equity (in that the number o f scenarios in which a taxpayer could be afforded a grace period to which they would, under the current system, have previously not been entitled is greater). This is illustrated by a comparison of the two compliance history options in the following example: (iv) The date is 28 June 2017. Taxpayer 4 fails to pay their GST payment due on 28 June 2017. They previously defaulted on their income tax payment due on 7 April 2016. If option (a), the compliance history indicator, is selected as the way in which compliance history should be transferred to START, Taxpayer 4 will not be entitled to a grace period, as information relating to their payment history in respect of all tax types (including income tax) from February 2015 to February 2017 will have been transferred to START. If option (b), the individual tax type compliance history, is selected as the way in which compliance history should be transferred to START, Taxpayer 4 will be entitled to a grace period, as only historical information concerning their payment behaviour with respect to GST will be brought across to START. In light of this, it is considered that the preferred option with respect to the way in which compliance history is transitioned to START is option (a), the customer-level indicator. It is noted, however, that the legislative amendment option with the customer-level indicator does not result in an improvement to the status quo with respect to the fairness and equity criterion. The fact that some taxpayers will be able to benefit from a grace period to which they would not otherwise have been entitled means that this option only partially meets the fairness and equity criterion. The status quo meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: As this option will enable grace periods to be managed independently in each system, it will not give rise to any compliance or administration issues. This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo, as it will not require any manual management and will therefore not require any additional resources. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option will not give rise to any difficulties for taxpayers or to the potential for tax-driven outcomes. This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it does not give rise to the potential for error as a result of manual intervention. 27. Overall, this option would represent an improvement on the status quo. 31 Fiscal implications of the options OptionsFiscal impact Option 1 - Status quo This option does not result in any fiscal impact as it maintains the current grace periods legislative provisions. Option 2 - Integration Approach This option does not result in any fiscal impact as it maintains the current grace periods legislative provisions. Option 3 - Officials’ preferred option This option results in a fiscal loss in that it gives rise to instances where a taxpayer could be granted a grace period to which they would not, under the current rules, have been entitled. A fiscal loss will be incurred in each year of the Coexistence Period, as follows: • June 2015 - June 2016: $0.1 million • June 2016 June 2017: $1.5 million • June 2017 - June 2018: $1.3 million • June 2018 - June 2019: $0.1 million • June 2019 - June 2020: $0.1 million The fiscal loss detailed above has been calculated on the basis of option (a), the customer-level indicator, being selected as the way in which compliance history is brought across to START. Option (b), the individual tax type compliance history option, would result in a slightly higher fiscal cost due to it resulting in a greater number of instances in which a taxpayer could be afforded a grace period to which they would not have been entitled. 32 Regulatory Impact Statement Implementing New Zealand’s commitment to Automatic Exchange of Inform ation (AEOI) Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis o f options to determine how best to give effect to New Zealand’s commitments to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange o f Financial Account Information in Tax Matters. The AEOI standard is a global framework for cooperation between countries in the detection and prevention o f tax evasion. Specifically, the AEOI standard responds to international concerns that individuals and entities can relatively easily evade their tax obligations by concealing their wealth in ‘off-shore’ financial accounts. New Zealand’s international commitments to implement the AEOI standard were made in 2014 and in 2016 Cabinet supplemented those commitments with a decision to commence AEOI obligations from 1 July 2017. For this reason, this RIS is concerned solely with implementing AEOI and detailed design matters. Three implementation options and the status quo are assessed in this RIS. The exact form that these options will take in practice depends on the specific design features that are ultimately decided upon. Given this and the fact that there is limited data about who may be impacted and how they may be affected by AEOI it is not possible to accurately estimate some o f the costs involved (such as compliance costs) and benefits associated with each o f the options. Even so, we have undertaken several rounds o f consultation with financial institutions and their representative bodies (the most affected by AEOI), government agencies, and the general tax community, and the feedback from consultation has helped to inform our high- level assessment o f the nature and extent o f the costs and benefits. It is acknowledged that implementing the AEOI will involve potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. Additionally, the AEOI initiative will only be successful if jurisdictions implement AEOI on the same timeline and w ith consistent rules. I f some jurisdictions are allowed to lag behind or implement to a lesser standard, the off-shore tax evasion problem is likely to simply relocate to those jurisdictions. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis undertaken. The preferred option is to adopt a balanced approach to implementation that seeks to minimise compliance costs and administrative where possible, provided those choices do not result in New Zealand failing to meet international expectations. None o f the policy options considered would restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles. Emma Grigg Policy Director, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13 May 2016 2 1 The OECD Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange o f Financial Account Information (MCAA) 2 Determining these jurisdictions will be subject to a separate process, as explained at paragraphs 120 and 121 below. 3 AEOI forms part of the wider picture o f a focus on cross-border tax compliance, both internationally (for example, the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative which primarily relates to multinational enterprises) and domestically (for example, GST and online shopping). 3 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) deals with the question o f how best to give effect to New Zealand’s commitments to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange o f Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (in short, Automatic Exchange o f Information, or AEOI). 2. New Zealand’s international commitments to implement the AEOI standard were made on: • 7 May 2014, by joining in a general declaration o f support for the AEOI initiative issued at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting; • 3 June 2014, by signing an administrative instrument1 that sets out the terms for AEOI exchanges (the jurisdictions we will exchange with are still to be specified2); and • 16 November 2014, by reiterating our commitment at the November 2014 G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane. 3. These commitments were general in nature. In February 2016, Cabinet supplemented the commitments with a decision that the start date from which AEOI obligations will apply in New Zealand will be 1 July 2017. From this date, financial institutions must start collecting the information needed for subsequent exchange. Although 1 July 2017 is later than the start date adopted by most other jurisdictions, it aligns with Australia’s start date. International considerations 4. AEOI is a global framework for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention o f tax evasion.3 Specifically, AEOI responds to international concerns that individuals and entities can, with relative ease, evade their tax obligations by concealing their wealth in ‘off-shore’ financial accounts. 5. Jurisdictions implementing AEOI must: • enact legislation that will impose obligations on financial institutions to collect and report information to their local tax authority on accounts held or (in certain circumstances) controlled by non-residents; and • establish the legal mechanisms (primarily tax treaties) necessary for exchanging that information with other jurisdictions. 6. The exchanged information will be used by the receiving jurisdiction to ensure that their tax residents have correctly reported off-shore income for tax purposes. 7. This RIS pertains solely to the above requirement to enact legislation. It contains only passing references to certain necessary associated processes (for example, the publishing o f New Zealand-specific lists o f exchange partners and excluded entities/accounts) and legal mechanisms for exchange. 8. The AEOI initiative will only be successful if jurisdictions implement AEOI on the same timeline and with consistent rules. I f some jurisdictions lag behind or implement to a lesser standard, the off-shore tax evasion problem is likely to simply relocate to those jurisdictions. 9. Accordingly, the G20 has taken a strong stance on ensuring that jurisdictions implement AEOI on a consistent and timely basis. Similar to the global standard for Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing o f Terrorism (AML/CFT), the AEOI standard constitutes ‘soft law’ (that is, international recommendations that are effectively mandatory, rather than just ‘best practice’). 10. As regards consistency, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange o f Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum) has been tasked by the G20 with conducting peer reviews and on-going monitoring to ensure that jurisdictions implement the standard as it is set out in the OECD documentation. 11. As regards timing, the G20 and OECD have identified a target group o f 101 countries that must implement AEOI on a timeline that will enable first exchanges to be completed by 30 September 2018. The target group includes all G20 and OECD member countries, and any other jurisdictions that have been identified as having or operating as an international finance centre are expected to implement AEOI on a similar timeline. As an OECD member country, New Zealand is included in the target group. 12. To clarify, 1 July 2017 will be the start date from which New Zealand financial institutions are to begin collecting information for subsequent reporting to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue must then exchange that information with tax treaty partners by 30 September 2018. 13. All 101 jurisdictions in the above target group have committed to implement AEOI according to the G20 requirements. A small number o f these, referred to as ‘early adopters’, have committed to complete their first exchanges a year earlier than the September 2018 deadline. 14. Jurisdictions outside o f the target group do not face implementation deadlines as they are not considered to pose a significant risk in the context o f off-shore tax evasion.4 Domestic considerations 15. The principal benefit for New Zealand in implementing AEOI lies in the information we will receive reciprocally from our treaty partners. This information will be available to 4 Many o f these jurisdictions may nevertheless implement AEOI. In the main, they are smaller developing countries. International organisations concerned with implementing the global Post-2015 Development and Financing for Development agendas are factoring AEOI implementation into their work programmes, as a key aspect o f the ‘domestic resource mobilisation’ element o f that agenda 4 Inland Revenue to verify that its tax residents are correctly reporting off-shore financial assets and/or income. 16. To the extent that this facilitates a reduction in tax evasion (either through evasion actually detected, or more generally by deterring such activity), New Zealand will derive fiscal benefits. AEOI can generally also be expected to enhance voluntary tax compliance, through improved taxpayer perceptions that everyone is paying their fair share o f tax. 17. New Zealand has been a strong supporter o f all international initiatives to improve transparency and international cooperation in tax matters. There will be reputational benefits for New Zealand from being seen to be compliant with international standards. 18. It is acknowledged that AEOI implementation will impose potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. However, failure to implement AEOI, or to implement AEOI to a lesser standard so as to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs would damage New Zealand’s international reputation. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) 19. New Zealand’s enabling legislation will largely involve imposing obligations on financial institutions. These obligations are set out in a key element o f the AEOI standard referred to as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). 20. The rules set out in the CRS (as clarified and supplemented in the accompanying OECD commentary) are complex. In broad terms, incorporating the CRS into New Zealand domestic law will involve imposing due diligence and reporting obligations on New Zealand financial institutions in respect o f their financial accounts. 21. Due diligence will be undertaken to identify the tax residence of: • the account holders; and • the controlling persons o f accounts held by certain passive entities. 22. The due diligence procedures are highly prescriptive. In very generalised terms: • in respect o f pre-existing accounts (accounts already open as at 1 July 2017), financial institutions will generally be allowed to rely on documentation already held for other purposes (particularly that collected for AML/CFT or other ‘know- your-customer’ purposes) to determine the tax residence o f each account holder and (where relevant) controlling person; • in respect o f new accounts (accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017), financial institutions will generally determine tax residence by obtaining a self-certification from each account holder and (where relevant) controlling person; and • the passive entity account holders to be ‘looked through’ to determine their controlling persons are those that (i) are not themselves financial institutions, and (ii) have assets that primarily produce or are held for the production o f passive 5 income (such as interest or dividends) entities that meet these criteria are referred to as passive non-financial entities (passive NFEs). 23. Financial institutions will be required to report (on an annual basis) the following information to Inland Revenue: • In respect o f account holders or controlling persons that have been identified as tax residents o f jurisdictions that have implemented AEOI,5 they must generally report: identity information such as name, address, and (in defined circumstances) date o f birth and tax identification number; and financial account information such as account balances and interest, dividends and other income earned. • If they have been unable to determine the status o f an account, they are required to report the account as an ‘undocumented account’ in defined circumstances. 24. The CRS also requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and address non-compliance. This includes appropriate anti­ avoidance rules, document retention requirements, auditing programmes, and sanctions to deal w ith identified non-compliance. Jurisdictions are specifically required to follow up on any undocumented accounts that are reported. 25. The CRS contains exclusions for certain categories o f financial institution and financial account that are considered to pose a low risk o f facilitating or being used for tax evasion. However, in some cases the criteria for exclusion are not automatic, and require submissions to be made by the financial institutions concerned. These criteria are very stringent. The application o f the criteria in such cases will be dealt with as a stage two implementation matter. The process will involve Inland Revenue calling for submissions, and if possible making the necessary determinations before the end o f 2016. New Zealand’s precedents and existing mechanisms 26. New Zealand has had an active exchange o f information programme for many years. This primarily operates on the basis o f responding to specific requests for information, but certain categories o f information are subject to automatic exchange. As yet, we only automatically exchange financial account information with one country the United States (US), pursuant to their 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative. 27. FATCA operates on a similar basis to AEOI, in that New Zealand financial institutions are required to identify accounts held o r controlled by US tax residents or citizens6 5 Note that the option o f a ‘wider approach’, which would capture non-residents from all jurisdictions, not just those in jurisdictions we will exchange information with is elaborated on below in this report. 6 The reference here to ‘citizens’ is a key point of difference from AEOI. AEOI only applies to tax residents, reflecting the fact that most countries only tax the worldwide income o f persons who are tax resident. The US, however, also applies this approach to citizens, regardless of whether they are also tax residents of the US. 6 7 Financial account information on those accounts is then reported to Inland Revenue, which automatically exchanges the information with the US. 28. The framework legislation for FATCA in New Zealand is contained in Part 1 1B o f the Tax Administration Act 1994. The detailed rules are set out in an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the US that has been given legislative effect in New Zealand b y Order in Council. 29. Part 11B o f the Act contemplates entering into similar arrangements with other countries. Strictly, therefore, New Zealand legislation already provides for automatic exchange o f financial account information with countries other than the US. However, the legislation as currently framed requires entering into further arrangements through treaties similar to the US IGA. This does not match the approach taken by the G20 and OECD for AEOI. 30. FATCA and AEOI rely in part on information already required to be collected by financial institutions from account holders, particularly under AML/CFT ‘know-your- customer’ requirements. However, the overlap between the AML/CFT requirements is not an exact match for those applying under the CRS. For example, under New Zealand’s AML/CFT laws a financial institution may not collect all o f the information required by the CRS in respect o f discretionary trusts. Accordingly, in some areas, the AEOI due diligence obligations will require information to be obtained that is not required under AML/CFT laws. 31. Although AEOI exchanges can be made under other tax treaties, international expectations are that most, if not all, AEOI exchanges will take place under the OECD/Council o f Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convention). New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012. OBJECTIVES 32. The policy options considered in this RIS will be assessed against the following objectives: (a) To implement AEOI in a way that ensures consistency with the requirem ents o f the CRS and its accompanying commentary so as to enable New Zealand to: (i) meet international expectations; (ii) comply with the international deadline o f 30 September 2018 for completing first exchanges; and (iii) successfully undergo Global Forum peer review. (This objective reflects the aim o f achieving sustainability and fairness in an international environment that is focused on establishing a global level playing field through implementation consistency.) 8 (b) To implement AEOI in a manner that maximises the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits. (This objective is primarily concerned with efficiency and sustainability.) (c) To implement AEOI in a manner that minimises the compliance costs that will be imposed on financial institutions. (This objective is primarily concerned with fairness and efficiency.) (d) To implement AEOI in a manner that minimises the administrative costs that will be imposed on New Zealand regulatory agencies. (This objective is primarily concerned with efficiency.) 33. These objectives are lis te d in descending order o f importance. 34. Objective (a) is the overarching consideration, given that New Zealand’s implementation o f the AEOI standard will be subject to peer review and other international scrutiny. The identification o f deficiencies would damage New Zealand’s international reputation and result in international and domestic pressure to take immediate remedial action. M ore generally failure to implement AEOI correctly could result in suspicion o f New Zealand’s motives, potentially leading to greater scrutiny o f the off-shore activities o f N ew Zealand tax residents and adding to the cost for New Zealanders o f doing business internationally. 35. Objective (b) reflects the objective o f the AEOI standard, which is to facilitate the detection and prevention o f off-shore tax evasion. Implementation is not just about compliance with an international imperative. The ultimate purpose o f AEOI is to improve tax compliance and provide fiscal benefits to jurisdictions. It is important that this objective be viewed as a key focus. 36. Objectives (c) and (d) reflect acknowledgement that implementing AEOI will impose potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs on New Zealand regulatory agencies. However, implementation decisions to reduce compliance and/or administrative costs should only be made if that is achievable without lowering the overall effectiveness o f the standard in New Zealand or being seen as undermining the multilateral initiative. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 37. Four policy options have been considered for implementing the AEOI standard described above: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo that is, do not implement AEOI. • Option 2: A low cost approach that is, to implement AEOI on the basis o f design decisions that favour minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue over meeting international expectations. • Option 3: A balanced approach that is, to implement AEOI on the basis o f implementation decisions that strike a balance between minimising compliance 7 As noted, AEOI due diligence depends to a significant degree on information obtained for AML/CFT purposes. However, there are gaps where AEOI due diligence obligations go beyond AML/CFT requirements. 9 costs for financial institutions and minimising administrative costs for New Zealand regulatory agencies and meeting international expectations. • Option 4: A high cost approach - that is, to implement AEOI on the basis o f implementation decisions that favour meeting international expectations over minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 38. The ‘Implementation’ section o f this RIS discusses key design features o f AEOI. Some o f these features are specifically referred to in the analysis o f the options below in order to highlight key differences between the options. Option 1: Maintain the status quo 39. Option 1 would not meet any o f the objectives and is not considered to be tenable. A decision not to implement AEOI would mean New Zealand defaulting on commitments and result in international (and domestic) criticism and reputational damage. Option 2: Low cost approach 40. This option would involve making design decisions that would favour minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue over meeting international expectations. 41. Examples would involve lenient phase-in options (as discussed in paragraphs 120 to 121) not contemplated by the CRS and limiting due diligence for CRS purposes to existing due diligence requirements under AML/CFT laws (as discussed in paragraphs 115 to 117).7 42. Option 2 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. Objective (a) - Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 43. Design decisions that favour minimising compliance costs as described above would in most cases fall short o f the CRS requirements, and would result in failed peer review. 44. The consequences o f failing peer review have not been articulated by the G20 or OECD. At a minimum New Zealand would face reputational damage. At the extreme, it is possible that we could face international sanctions. In any case, New Zealand would come under intense pressure to rectify any deficiencies, effectively meaning that any damage incurred will have been for little gain. 45. Therefore, option 2 does not meet this objective. Objective (b) - Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 10 46. The benefits to New Zealand from implementing AEOI primarily lie in the reciprocal information other jurisdictions will provide to Inland Revenue about New Zealand tax residents. Lowering the standard and quality o f the information New Zealand provides to other jurisdictions will not directly affect this benefit. 47. However, it is possible that some jurisdictions might respond by refusing to provide information to New Zealand. 48. Aside from the benefit o f reciprocal information, AEOI implementation will provide other benefits such as reputational benefits and enhancing voluntary compliance in tax matters. These benefits would be adversely compromised. 49. Therefore, this option partially meets the objective. Objective (c) - Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 50. As noted above, this option would be aimed at minimising compliance costs for financial institutions so meets the objective. Objective (d) - Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 51. This option would be aimed at minimising administrative costs for Inland Revenue so meets the objective. Option 3: A balanced approach 52. Option 3 recognises that it is possible to implement AEOI in a way that enables New Zealand to meet international expectations while making choices that seek to minimise compliance costs and administrative costs. 53. The CRS is set by the OECD, and implementation will largely involve incorporating its rules (as clarified and supplemented by the OECD commentary) directly into domestic law. However, the CRS itself provides implementing jurisdictions with a number o f options that can be taken. Adopting these options may assist in reducing compliance costs and administrative costs. 54. Outside o f the options specifically contemplated by the CRS, other decisions could be taken under option 3 which would bear a low risk o f exposure to international criticism. Key examples include: • the timing for phasing in certain due diligence obligations (such as allowing 24- months to complete due diligence o f pre-existing entity accounts, rather than the 12-months provided by Australia see paragraphs 106 to 109), and • allowing a transitional period in respect o f enforcement - during which financial institutions identified as not complying with their obligations could mount a ‘reasonable endeavours’ defence and be allowed a reasonable period o f time to rectify any errors (see paragraph 121). 55. Option 3 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. 11 Option (a) - Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 56. Design decisions under this option would be made on the basis o f mitigating compliance costs and administrative costs wherever possible. In some cases, this may involve a judgement call whether CRS requirements would or would not be met. 57. The transitional approach to enforcement demonstrates this point. Although the CRS generally leaves the design o f an effective enforcement regime up to jurisdictions, the terms o f reference and methodology for peer reviews have not yet been set by the Global Forum. 58. Decisions made on the basis o f option 3 would therefore involve some potential risk that peer review will determine that CRS requirements have not been met. However, the risk o f reputational damage arising from the identification o f deficiencies in peer review would be low, given that the decision was made on the basis o f a judgement call that CRS requirements were met. 59. Therefore, this objective is met. Option (b) - Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 60. The balanced approach to implementation should have no adverse implications in terms o f the benefits likely to accrue to New Zealand from AEOI implementation so meets the objective. Option (c) - Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 61. The balanced approach to implementation would represent an attempt to minimise compliance costs to the extent possible so this objective is met. Option (d) - Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 62. The balanced approach to implementation would represent an attempt to minimise administrative costs to the extent possible, so meets this objective. Option 4: High cost approach 63. Option 4 would carry the least risk o f international criticism. In contrast to option 3, which involves making some judgment calls as to whether CRS requirements have been met, option 4 would involve a greater focus on meeting those requirements. However, this approach would result in the imposition o f some compliance costs on financial institutions that could otherwise have been mitigated. 64. For example, under this approach, the transitional approach to enforcement would not be contemplated. 65. Option 4 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. 12 Option (a) — Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 66. Under this option, all design decisions would be made on the basis o f meeting CRS requirements, so this objective would clearly be met. Option (b) - Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 67. The high cost approach to implementation will have no adverse implications in terms o f the benefits likely to accrue to New Zealand from AEOI implementation. Therefore, this objective is met. Option (c) - Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 68. The high cost approach to implementation would not attempt to minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions so this objective is not met. Option (d) - Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 69. The high cost approach to implementation would not attempt to minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on financial institutions so this objective is not met. Administrative impacts 70. In order to implement AEOI, a secure technology platform capable o f receiving, storing and aggregating information from financial institutions in accordance with the CRS and exchanging it with other tax authorities is needed. Additionally, guidance and support must be provided to financial institutions to enable them to meet their obligations in full. Inland Revenue will also be responsible for the effective enforcement o f AEOI. Social, environment or cultural impacts 71. There will be no negative social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any o f the options identified above. CONSULTATION 72. Several rounds o f consultation were undertaken with affected parties including financial institutions and their representative bodies, the umbrella groups such as the New Zealand Law Society and Chartered Accountants o f Australia and New Zealand and a number o f Government agencies, including those concerned with New Zealand’s privacy laws and anti-money laundering/countering the financing o f terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. 73. In February 2016, an Officials’ issues paper entitled Implementing the global standard on automatic exchange o f information was released for public consultation. 21 submissions were received on the paper. 74. None o f the submissions received on the issues paper proposed that New Zealand not proceed with implementation. This suggests that there is widespread acceptance o f the need to implement AEOI to meet international expectations and to carry through w ith the commitment New Zealand has already made to implement AEOI. 75. The submissions often expressed a wide divergence o f views as to how AEOI should be implemented. However, some common themes emerged, including: • A strong preference for New Zealand to align its implementation decisions, where possible, with those taken internationally and in particular with Australia. Alignment with Australia seems particularly relevant in the context o f N ew Zealand banks that are owned by Australian parents. But it is also relevant for financial institutions that have trans-Tasman financial products or an Australian client base. • A strong preference that, where the CRS permits implementing jurisdictions to provide financial institutions w ith a choice o f due diligence and reporting procedures, that choice should be available to institutions. • A strong preference that financial institutions should not be required to obtain or report information about accounts unless the information is specifically required under the CRS or because o f a choice that they have made. This point essentially responds to an OECD suggestion that implementing jurisdictions could consider going further than the CRS requirements in certain areas - for example by making it mandatory to collect tax identification numbers or date o f birth information in all cases (whereas the base expectation under the CRS is that for pre-existing accounts financial institutions do not need to go beyond reasonable endeavours to obtain this information). A further example is whether to require reporting o f controlling persons o f passive NFEs that are New Zealand residents. The one exception to this point is the proposed application o f the ‘w ider’ approach to CRS due diligence (and reporting), outlined below. As will be noted, there was strong support for adopting the wider approach, to due diligence in particular. A strong preference that New Zealand should, where possible look to align the entities and accounts that will be excluded from CRS obligations with the entities and accounts that are excluded for FATCA. Some submitters noted that this alignment should also apply to entities and accounts that are excluded under New Zealand’s AML/CFT regime. • A strong preference that New Zealand should, where possible, look to align CRS due diligence procedures with those carried out under FATCA and New Zealand’s AML/CFT regime, so that any additional AEOI due diligence is minimised. (There was widespread acceptance that the information that needs to be reported under AEOI will be different from that reported under these other regimes.) 13 • A strong preference that New Zealand should adopt a ‘soft landing’ approach to addressing any non-compliance with CRS. (Essentially, that is, to take a light or transitional approach to penalising non-compliance.) 76. All o f the points raised in submissions and in consultation discussions have been considered. 77. Those that would lead to a high risk o f international criticism and failing peer review have generally been ruled out. In this regard, it is worth reiterating that the AEOI standard is a global standard and its success depends on consistent application across jurisdictions. 78. However, some submissions have helped to shape key design decisions. A notable example is the proposed transitional approach to enforcement. Other examples include decisions to allow optionality, to align with the FATCA reporting period, and to align with the Australian wider approach for due diligence and reporting8. 79. A number o f public sector agencies were consulted including the Treasury. Given the strong links with New Zealand’s AML/CFT laws, additional consultation was held w ith AML Regulators (the Department o f Internal Affairs, the Financial Markets Authority, and the Reserve Bank o f New Zealand). The Ministry o f Justice and the Office o f the Privacy Commissioner were specifically consulted in respect o f privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 80. Inland Revenue supports the adoption o f option 3 (the balanced approach) on the basis that it meets all o f the objectives.

Option 1 (the status quo) is not supported because it is not tenable. Options 2 and 4 are not supported because they do not meet all o f the objectives. In particular, option 2 would result in New Zealand failing to meet international expectations, whereas option 4 would meet international expectations but impose compliance costs and administrative costs that could otherwise be mitigated. 8 We note, however, that although Australia has opted to make the wider approach mandatory in all cases, New Zealand will allow the wider approach to be optional in the case o f reporting. 14 IMPLEMENTATION 82. Option 3 would involve implementing AEOI on the basis o f balanced implementation decisions that reduce compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue where possible, but only to the extent that those decisions would not jeopardise New Zealand’s ability to meet international expectations. Key design features 83. The key design features o f the preferred option are outlined below. Optionality 84. As noted above, the CRS is set by the OECD, and implementation will largely involve incorporating its rules directly into domestic law. However, the CRS itself provides implementing countries with a number o f options that can be taken. 85. For the most part it is proposed to leave these options open to the financial institution, so that they can choose the option that best suits their particular circumstances. 86. For example, for consistency the CRS sets certain default due diligence thresholds in US currency, such as a threshold o f US$1,000,000 for distinguishing between high value and lower value individual accounts9. However, the CRS allows jurisdictions to substitute their local currency. Many financial institutions might find compliance cost savings in not having to convert NZ$ balances to US$ equivalents to determine if the threshold has been exceeded (and simply treating the high value threshold as being NZ$ 1,000,000). Other financial institutions, particularly those that operate in several jurisdictions, might prefer the consistency o f applying the same threshold amount in the same currency in all the jurisdictions in which they operate. The proposed approach, in such cases, is to allow each financial institution to choose their threshold. Submissions strongly endorsed this approach. 87. In certain other cases, where consistency is important or is required by the CRS, the taking o f an option will need to be mandated in legislation (that is, not left to financial institutions to decide). Two key examples o f this are the reporting period and wider approach to due diligence, discussed below. 88. In deciding on what option to take in this regard (which all financial institutions would be required to apply) it is proposed that the decision is taken that results in the least compliance costs for financial institutions as a whole and that is consistent with CRS obligations (and in accordance with New Zealand’s international obligations). 89. Public submissions generally endorsed this approach to optionality. 90. There are also a number o f parts o f the CRS where implementing jurisdictions have the option o f requiring financial institutions to obtain and report certain information beyond the CRS base due diligence and reporting expectations. It is proposed for the most part (with the exception o f the wider approach to due diligence) that financial institutions should not be required to obtain information about accounts unless the information is In broad terms, financial institutions need to carry out more extensive due diligence procedures for high value accounts. 15 9 specifically required under the CRS or because o f a choice that they have made. Submissions strongly supported this approach to optionality Reporting period 91. The CRS due diligence and reporting obligations operate on the basis o f annual ‘reporting periods’. Jurisdictions may choose whether to adopt a calendar year or other appropriate period for this purpose. 92. Australia and most other countries have adopted the calendar year (for both CRS and FATCA). The reporting period New Zealand adopted for FATCA purposes was the tax year (that is, the year ending 31 March). 93. The majority o f submitters considered that New Zealand should adopt the tax year for CRS due diligence and reporting, to align with both the New Zealand tax year and the period used for other reporting and regulatory purposes, especially FATCA. 94. Some submitters proposed that this period be ‘optional’. However, it is implicit in the CRS that each jurisdiction will have one period governing due diligence, reporting and exchanging. 95. On balance, the tax year (that is, the period ended 31 March), would provide better domestic alignment, including with FATCA. This will allow financial institutions to better integrate their CRS systems with other existing reporting systems, so overall should assist in minimising compliance costs. 96. Moreover, when combined with the New Zealand start date o f 1 July 2017, a 31 December reporting period end date would result in a first reporting period o f only six months. A 31 March reporting period end date would result in a first reporting period o f nine months, giving financial institutions more time to complete the due diligence reviews required by the CRS in that first period. (See below under ‘initial reporting period’.) 97. For reasons o f certainty, consistency and simplicity, it is proposed to mandate the tax year as the reporting period, rather than allowing financial institutions the choice. 98. It is also proposed that financial institutions be required to report CRS information to Inland Revenue by 30 June in line w ith the FATCA reporting deadline. This will help ensure that Inland Revenue has sufficient time to then process the information for exchange by the 30 September deadline. 99. In this regard note that Australia allows until 31 July rather than 30 June. Aligning with Australia’s 31 July date would allow New Zealand financial institutions more time to report. However, it would shorten the time available for Inland Revenue to prepare the information for exchange from three months to two months. Given the possible need for Inland Revenue to identify and clarify irregularities or deficiencies with financial institution reports (particularly in the initial years o f implementation), two months would pose material risks. 16 100. The CRS contemplates due diligence reviews o f pre-existing high value individual accounts being undertaken within the first reporting period. 101. Most jurisdictions implementing AEOI will have a start date o f 1 January and will operate on the basis o f a calendar year reporting period, allowing a full 12 months to conduct these reviews. In contrast, the proposed New Zealand start date o f 1 July 2017 and reporting period end date o f 31 March will prima facie only allow New Zealand financial institutions nine months (that is 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) to complete these initial reviews. This potentially disadvantages New Zealand financial institutions as compared with financial institutions o f other countries. 102. Australia has the same 1 July start date as New Zealand, but has a reporting period end date o f 31 December. Therefore Australia’s first reporting period will only be six months. As this would prima facie only allow six months for completing due diligence o f pre-existing high value individual accounts, Australia has adopted a compromise approach that involves allowing additional time to complete the reviews o f pre-existing high value individual accounts, albeit still reporting the required information (such as account balances) in the first report. 103. The mechanism is complex, but in essence Australia will allow financial institutions to carry out due diligence on pre-existing high value individual accounts until 31 July 2018 (essentially allowing 13 months for due diligence on such accounts) provided that such accounts are reported in the first report. 104. It is proposed to adopt a similar approach for New Zealand. The 30 June deadline will apply for the purposes o f completing due diligence reviews o f pre-existing high value individual accounts and reporting the information to Inland Revenue. Under this approach, financial institutions can continue conducting due diligence on high value accounts past the 31 March reporting period end date, provided they report the information about any reportable high value accounts identified in this review to Inland Revenue by 30 June. 105. The same approach will apply for the following year, for the due diligence reviews o f pre-existing low value individual accounts and pre-existing entity accounts (that is, allowing review and reporting by 30 June 2019). Time for completing due diligence reviews of pre-existing entity accounts 106. The OECD documentation is (slightly) ambiguous on the expected time-frame for completing due diligence for pre-existing entity accounts. Most countries appear to be reading the documentation as generally allowing 24 months for these reviews. Australia initially proposed 24 months, but in their implementation legislation enacted in March 2016, ultimately only allowed 12 months. 107. The due diligence for pre-existing entity accounts is expected to be more challenging for financial institutions than due diligence for accounts held by individuals, particularly given that look-through rules apply to accounts held by passive NFEs. In this context, allowing 24 months rather than 12 months to complete these reviews would seem appropriate and broadly aligns with FATCA due diligence time-frames for reviewing such accounts. Initial reporting period 17 108. Although submissions generally call for alignment with Australia where possible, alignment with the Australian 12 month period for entity accounts may be a step too far, particularly given the tight time-frames for New Zealand’s implementation. 109. It is proposed to retain the 24 month due diligence period for completing due diligence reviews o f pre-existing entity accounts, and not to follow the Australian approach to this issue. Wider approach 110. During the development o f the CRS, private sector interests raised concerns with the OECD that the number o f jurisdictions participating in the AEOI initiative can be expected to increase over time. Each new country joining the initiative would trigger a requirement for financial institutions to conduct a new round o f due diligence reviews o f accounts. This could be prevented by treating all jurisdictions as reportable jurisdictions for due diligence purposes. This approach would have a significant compliance cost saving, and we are not aware o f any jurisdiction not adopting the wider approach to due diligence. Submissions strongly endorsed this approach. 111. For consistency, to prevent confusion for customers, and to avoid putting financial institutions that adopt the wider approach at a competitive disadvantage, it is proposed to make the wider approach for due diligence mandatory rather for all financial institutions. Submissions generally endorsed this approach. 112. The wider approach to due diligence raises the question o f what then happens to the additional information collected that does not need to be exchanged ( ‘the residual information’). 113. The residual information could be held b y the financial institutions. However, the greatest compliance cost saving would arise from financial institutions simply being allowed to report all o f the information they collect (including the residual information) to the local tax administration, even though it will not be exchanged. Under this approach, financial institutions would not be constantly required to keep track o f the jurisdictions New Zealand has entered into AEOI relationships with. Instead, financial institutions would merely report all o f the information about non-residents to Inland Revenue. This is referred to as the wider approach to reporting. Some countries, including Australia, have adopted this option. Others, such as the United Kingdom, require the residual information to be retained by financial institutions. 114. The general preference in submissions is to align with Australia, and adopting the wider approach to reporting would also be consistent with the approach o f minimising compliance costs wherever possible. Moreover, the pool o f residual information could be used by Inland Revenue to assist in, for example, confirming that the non-residents have the correct non-resident withholding rate (similar to the way that the information to be exchanged can be used) to the extent that such use is consistent with legal obligations and responsibilities. This is a delicate matter that involves balancing benefits against privacy concerns. For consistency with New Zealand’s privacy laws, it is proposed that the potential use o f the residual information by Inland Revenue be subject to full transparency. 18 115. The CRS due diligence and reporting procedures leverage o ff FATCA and AML/CFT procedures in a number o f ways. For example, CRS uses a number o f FATCA terms and concepts (such as what constitutes a financial institution and the types o f accounts that are subject to due diligence and reporting). Financial institutions are also sometimes able to use AML/CFT information to assist with CRS due diligence. However, the CRS and supporting OECD documentation are clear that there are a number o f areas where CRS due diligence and reporting procedures diverge from FATCA and AML/CFT procedures. 116. One consistent theme o f the submissions is that New Zealand should look to align CRS due diligence with FATCA and AML/CFT procedures where possible with a view to minimising compliance costs for financial institutions. 117. Although this approach has been adopted where possible (for example in aligning the AEOI and FATCA reporting periods) it is not possible in all situations. To the extent that there are any differences between regimes, the CRS must drive CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. This is because CRS is a global standard that needs to be implemented consistently worldwide. New Zealand’s compliance with this global standard will be internationally reviewed. Enforcement 118. The CRS requires effective anti-avoidance and enforcement rules to ensure compliance. This includes a specific expectation that implementing jurisdictions will have robust rules in place that will ensure self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. However, it leaves the design o f those rules up to each country. 119. In terms o f an anti-avoidance rule, we propose a similar rule to that introduced for FATCA. This would be modified (as required by the CRS) to ensure that in addition to financial institutions it applies to account holders, intermediaries, and certain other persons (in recognition o f the fact that such persons often control the information that institutions are required to obtain and report, so could take steps to circumvent CRS due diligence and reporting). The rule could apply, for example, in the case o f a financial institution that advises a customer to maintain an account with a related entity in a non­ participating jurisdiction (where there is no scope to link the accounts for due diligence purposes), so as to avoid reporting obligations while still offering services to the customer as if the account was maintained by the financial institution itself. It is proposed that this modification will also apply for FATCA purposes. 120. In terms o f enforcement rules, we propose a regime broadly based on civil penalties (rather than criminal penalties, as is the case for FATCA). We are not aware o f any other implementing country imposing specific criminal penalties for AEOI. 121. Penalties (for example, for failure to conduct due diligence or reporting) would primarily apply at the financial institution level (including a specific penalty for failure Alignment with existing regimes 19 to obtain a self-certification when opening a new account)10. However, as a transitional measure, we propose allowing a grace period through to 31 March 2019 during which time a ‘reasonable endeavours’ defence could be mounted and a reasonable period o f time allowed to rectify identified errors. After the transitional period, the penalties would be applied on a more rigorous basis. It is also proposed that undocumented new accounts are reported to be used as a tool to review and monitor compliance by financial institutions with their CRS due diligence obligations. 122. In some cases, financial institutions may experience difficulty in obtaining responses from account holders, intermediaries and other persons to requests for documentation (particularly self-certification o f tax residence). It is therefore proposed to supplement the penalties imposed on financial institutions with penalties on account holders, intermediaries, or other persons for either providing a false self-certification or (where the person fails to provide a self-certification (or material information about a change o f circumstances relating to a self-certification) with the intention o f circumventing CRS reporting. There would also be a requirement o f persons that hold accounts or funds on behalf o f another person to take reasonable steps to provide (on request) CRS information to that financial institution, with a penalty for non-compliance. 123. It is proposed that these penalties on account holders, intermediaries, and other persons, will be extended to apply to FATCA, as there is currently a gap in these areas. Stage two implementation issues 124. The AEOI standard requires implementing jurisdictions to publish a number o f lists. These are: • Reportable jurisdictions. An implementing jurisdiction must list the countries that it intends providing AEOI information to. • Participating jurisdictions. An implementing jurisdiction must also list the countries that it has an arrangement to receive AEOI information from.11 • Excluded Entities and Accounts. An implementing jurisdiction must list the specific financial institutions and accounts that it has excluded from AEOI obligations on the basis that they pose a low risk in the context o f tax evasion. 125. These lists do not need to be finalised in parallel with the implementation legislation, but will need to be in place prior to the 1 July 2017 start date, with sufficient lead time for financial institutions to develop their systems and processes. 126. The issue o f reportable jurisdictions raises potential privacy issues, given that the information to be disclosed to jurisdictions is o f a highly sensitive personal and financial nature. Frameworks for confidentiality and data safeguards are a key element o f AOEI implementation for all jurisdictions, and are the subject o f separate Global Forum reviews. However, submissions proposed that a degree o f caution should be 10 The CRS commentary is clear that there is an expectation that implementing jurisdictions will have robust provisions in place to ensure that self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. 11 Note that, during the global implementation phase, a transitional period will apply during which jurisdictions that have committed to implementing AEOI will be treated as participating jurisdictions. 20 21 exercised in the case o f jurisdictions such as those that have no previous experience in exchange o f information. Submissions strongly proposed that selection o f New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions be subject to a robust and transparent process, and Government oversight. 127. In acknowledgement o f the concerns raised in these submissions, it is proposed that the list o f reportable jurisdictions be selected by a process that will involve Inland Revenue disseminating the outcome o f Global Forum reviews and calling for submissions on genuine reasons why a jurisdiction should not be included on the list. Inland Revenue’s decisions will be subject to Government oversight through an Order in Council process for announcing and maintaining the list. 128. The issue o f determining excluded entities and accounts will also necessarily involve Inland Revenue receiving and considering submissions. However, it is proposed that the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue be authorised to announce, and maintain, the lists o f excluded entities and accounts, by Commissioner’s determination. 129. Similarly, it is proposed that the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue be authorised to announce, and maintain, the lists o f participating jurisdictions, by Commissioner’s determination. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 130. New Zealand’s implementation will be subject to international peer review and on­ going monitoring by the Global Forum. The peer review schedule has not yet been determined. 131. As the AEOI standard is determined internationally, future changes at the international level are likely particularly as countries identify issues and concerns, and make consequential adjustments to the rules to address these issues. New Zealand will need to monitor and respond to these changes. 132. Domestically, an internal review o f the AEOI legislation is also proposed 18 to 24 months after enactment. This will primarily be to evaluate if the rules are working as intended or if adjustments are needed. In particular, New Zealand’s CRS anti­ avoidance and enforcement provisions will be evaluated to determine if they are effective. In addition, it may be possible to use this opportunity to further align FATCA legislation with the AEOI legislation, as we obtain information about how the regimes (particularly the penalties provisions) are working in practice. 133. It is not appropriate to make changes to the FATCA rules as part o f the initial AEOI implementation, as AEOI consultation did not specifically seek information on this point. REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Proposed changes to business tax Agency disclosure statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address concerns taxpayers have with the tax policy settings for businesses. The concerns addressed were identified from submissions on the government discussio n document Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration and other consultation. The options considered are intended to simplify the rules and reduce compliance costs for businesses, while ensuring the rules are robust. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad-base, low-rate tax system. The options in this statement have been constrained as Ministers have asked for options that can be delivered with effect from 1 April 2017. However, some options will apply from 1 April 2018 due to the additional time needed for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to implement system changes. It is challenging to accurately forecast some of the costs (including compliance, administrative and fiscal costs) for the options due to information not being available or difficulty in estimating likely behavioural changes. Equally, it is difficult to determine the number of taxpayers who may be impacted by the proposals as various factors may influence the decision to adopt a proposal. Instead, indications of the direction and order of magnitude have been provided where appropriate. Officials have been mindful of the fiscal implications stemming from the proposals. None of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles.

To manage this large number of topics we have shifted the detailed analysis of each theme, and the component proposals within that theme, out of the Regulatory Analysis section and into a set of five appendices. The body of the RIS still contains an overview of the options considered but the detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, impacts and recommendations is contained in the corresponding appendix. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  - Fully meets objective  - Partially meets objective  - Does not meet objective Consultation section of the RIS provides a summary of our consultation approach with the feedback received on each proposal set out in corresponding appendix. 4 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 1. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The ways in which individuals work has changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casualised as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 5. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 6. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 7. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 8. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely 5 complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers of complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorities. 9. However, Business Transformation is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a lo ng-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. 10. This regulatory impact statement outlines options for simplifying the tax policy settings for businesses. 11. In March 2015 the Government released a discussion document entit led Making tax simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration. The feedback from submitters relating to business tax and other consultation/feedback from taxpayers can be grouped into five main areas: • Provisional tax is hard to get right and expensive to get wrong. This affects businesses’ ability to comply, results in compliance or administration costs, and adversely impacts perceptions of fairness. • The withholding tax regime for contractors is inflexible, out of date and open to abuse. This affects the accuracy and timing of tax payments, results in compliance or administrative costs, and adversely impacts perceptions of fairness of the tax system. • Penalties are punitive and can reduce taxpayer compliance. The current penalt y rules do not take account of businesses’ circumstances or the interaction of the use of money interest (UOMI) and penalty rules and the affect these have in conjunction with the provisional tax rules. Also an automatic penalty is frequently levied against those who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). This adversely impacts fairness by imposing excessive costs on businesses who are trying to comply, and reduces compliance. • Tax information is not used to protect businesses. Compliant businesses would be better protected if data held by Inland Revenue indicating serious debt or malpractice was shared appropriately. However, legislation currently restricts this. • Rules require accuracy regardless of costs. Tax rules that try to get to a “perfect” answer can impose undue costs when, in some instances, close enough should be good enough. 12. More detail on each of these areas is provided below and in the appendices. Problems and their magnitude 6 13. Provisio nal tax is particularly problematic for taxpayers who have relatively simple systems and who have difficulty in forecasting their income. It leaves these particular taxpayers in an uncertain position in terms of their total liability for tax and UOMI. 14. Feedback suggests this creates stress for taxpayers during and at the end of the year for something that could be well outside their ability to control. The current UOMI regime also has relatively expensive interest rates for taxpayers which can mean that UOMI can appear to be a penalty. OBJECTIVES 15. The Government is committed to making positive changes to reduce the time and costs to businesses of meeting their tax obligations. The objectives against which the options have been assessed are: • Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. • Sustainability of tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes. 16. These objectives are weighted equally. 17. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. REGULATORY ANALYSIS 18. Officials have developed options to address the above issues. These options have been grouped into the following five key themes: A. Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty and reduce costs. B. Self-management and integrity. C. Making the system fairer. D. Making markets work better through tax transparency. E. Supplementary simplification measures. 19. Each of these themes and the options under them are summarised below. Further detail on the issues and options under each theme is contained in the appendices. 7 20. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  - Fully meets objective  - Partially meets objective  - Does not meet objective A. Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty and reduce costs 21. While the consultation on the Making tax simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration discussion document sought views on issues across the tax system, the majority of submissions received identified issues with the current provisional tax rules, and expressed enthusiasm for different approaches. For example, of the 750 comments made on the 17 questions on the Green paper online forum, more than 200 comments were made in response to a single question about provisional tax. 22. While taxpayers generally agree with having to pay tax as they earn income, the perceived penalising effect of UOMI promotes general dissatisfaction with provisional tax rather than solely wit h the application of UOMI. This adversely affects the fairness of the provisio nal tax system. 23. Maintaining the current rules would continue to cause taxpayers stress and difficulties especially for those who pay provisional tax based on their best indicator of current year performance being their immediately prior income year. This increases the costs of complying with the provisio nal tax rules. 24. Another issue with the current provisional tax regime is that it attempts to approximate a pay as you earn system by assuming, wrongly in a large number of cases, that income is earned evenly throughout an income year. This means that what was intended to be a pay as you earn type system can become a pay before you have earned system which can cause cash-flow issues. This is particularly so for smaller, unsophisticated businesses. This can have a financial impact on taxpayers and increases compliance costs. 25. A final issue with provisional tax relates to close companies where all parties are related. In this situation there can be multiple taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax on different rules. In essence, there is one taxpaying group which should be subject to one rule to ease compliance and reduce the number of people subject to provisional tax. This adversely impacts the fairness of the system and increases compliance and administration costs. Options and analysis 26. The proposals to address the issues identified are: • Extend the safe harbour from UOMI; • Remove the application of UOMI; • Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax; and • Enable tax to be paid by companies as agents for shareholder-emplo yees. 8 Extend the safe harbour from UOMI 27. To address concerns about fairness of the UOMI rules, officials have considered a number of options to address the issue of provisional taxpayers’ exposure to UOMI. These options focus on the dollar threshold below which provisional taxpayers are not subject to UOMI and the scope of the threshold (who it applies to). 28. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-1. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $60,000 and expansion of safe harbour from UOMI to non- individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: revenue cost of $47 million over 4 years 3. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $70,000 and expansion of safe harbour from UOMI to non- individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher fiscal cost than option 2. 4. Increase to the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 with no extension to non-individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: marginal revenue impact Recommendation 29. Officials recommend option 2 to increase the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 and to extend it to non-individual taxpayers. This option deals with the problems of uncertainty of tax payments and reduces the stress that some taxpayers with low levels of tax payments feel over provisional tax and the application of UOMI. As a result 67,000 taxpayers will no longer be subject to UOMI. Option 2 has been chosen over the other options principally on the basis that option 3 does not fit within fiscal constraints and option 4 affects very few taxpayers. Remove the application of UOMI 30. In some cases taxpayers who use the best information available to them to pay their provisional tax payments are effectively penalised. For taxpayers who use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax, if their residual inco me tax (RIT) exceeds the safe harbour threshold and is different from the instalments paid during the year, UOMI will apply from the first instalment date. Although this seeks to compensate the party who ends up funding this difference in tax liability, it can result in taxpayers overpaying their tax to ensure they end up being the funding party so as not to incur large amounts of UOMI. 31. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-2. Options Analysis against the objectives 9 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue:  2. Remove the application of UOMI for the first two provisional tax payments for all taxpayers who use the standard uplift method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: revenue cost of $7.5 million and a cash- flow cost of $334 million over 4 years 3. Remove the application of UOMI for all provisional tax payments for all taxpayers who use the standard uplift method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: this measure has a higher revenue and cash-flow cost than option 2. 4. Remove the application of UOMI for the first provisional tax payment for all taxpayers who use the standard uplift method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: this measure has a lower revenue and cash-flow cost than option 2. Recommendation 32. Officials recommend option 2 as it reduces the exposure to UOMI for taxpayers who struggle to estimate their income during the year. This option is expected to remove 19,000 taxpayers from the requirement to pay UOMI on their first two instalments of provisio nal tax. Option 2 was selected as option 3 did not provide enough benefits to taxpayers as UOMI would still have so me t ype of penalt y aspect to it. Option 2 balances fiscal constraints with benefits to taxpayers. Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax 33. To approximate the objective that tax payments should be made when income is earned, provisional tax rules assume that income is evenly earned throughout the year. This assumption is not realistic for many taxpayers, especially those who have seasonal income who may have to make payments before they earn their income, or for businesses with varying income throughout the year. Where a taxpayer does not pay the correct amount at each instalment UOMI applies, which can act as a penalty for something that is outside their immediate control. 34. In a world with perfect foresight, most businesses would pay the amount of their actual liability during the year. The difficulty is that for most taxpayers forecasting their final income tax amounts is an art more than a science and differences will inevitably arise which were not predictable. 35. A new provisional tax method that better aligns the payment of tax with the income earning activity of a business should result in a closer match between the provisional tax payments and the end of year liability. Reducing the gap between provisional and actual liabilities could mean that UOMI is not required. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns 10 36. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-3. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Introduce the accounting income method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: Impact is expected to be neutral 3. Extend the GST ratio method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Introduce a turnover method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 37. Officials recommend option 2 as tax payments based on actual rather than forecast income, excluding shareholder salaries, will work for a large number of businesses where income accumulates over the year. This will reduce stress around year end payments and UOMI for taxpayers who use this method. Paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees 38. Provisional tax gives rise to particular concerns for small businesses and their owners. The current rules apply separate obligations to a company and each of its shareholders. At its core what is happening is that a flow of income is being derived in a single economic entity and being partitioned out at the end of the year between the company and its shareholders, normally by way of shareholder salary. Each shareholder will typically be liable for provisional tax on that income. 39. The current approach does not align with the principle that tax should be collected by the person who is able to do so most efficiently, and compliance costs minimised. 40. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix A-4. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Allow companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder-emplo yees Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  11 Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 3. Require businesses to pay tax as agent for related parties Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Exclude those associated with small businesses from paying provisional tax entirely and pay at terminal tax date Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: unquantified revenue cost due to deferral Recommendation 41. Option 2 is recommended by officials as this enables businesses and associated individuals to evaluate whether the benefits from removing associated parties from the requirement to pay provisional tax outweighs any additional costs or complexity. This option is also supported by the stakeholders consulted. B. Self-management and integrity 42. Withholding tax at source from payments to contractors reduces compliance costs for the majority of contractors, is a more accurate method of matching tax payments to when income is earned and ensures contractors pay their fair share of tax. However, the current withholding tax rules are out of date, inflexible, and don’t cover modern employment arrangements and industries. There are 130,000 contractors who are subject to withholding tax who could benefit from changes to the withholding tax rules. 43. There also are groups of contractors who are not covered by the rules having to manage their own tax obligations and incur higher compliance costs as a result. For example, at least 4,200 contractors of labour hire firms are not covered by the rules, but could have an easier means of paying their tax if withholding tax was extended to them. 1 Options and analysis 44. There are a number of options to address the issues with the current withholding tax rules. However the requirement for options to apply from 1 April 2017 has limited the feasible options available to three. 45. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix B. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 1 From an Inland Revenue audit project we know that the largest 11 labour-hire firms in New Zealand engage 4,200 contractors. The total number of contractors working for labour-hire firms will be greater than this. 12 2. Allow contractors currently in the withholding tax rules to elect their own withholding rate (with a 10% minimum) Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: one-off fiscal cost of approximately $35 million 3. Allow contractors not covered by the current withholding tax rules to enter into voluntary withholding agreements with their emplo yer Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: marginal upfront gain 4. Extend the withholding tax rules to contractors of labour hire firms Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: difficult to measure but expect a small revenue benefit 46. Other options considered but that could not be developed in the time available include: • Extending withholding to other contractors (for example, IT contractors). • Removing or amending the company exception to the schedular payment rules comprehensively. • Using banks as an intermediary for withholding rather than the payer of the contractor. 47. We consider that these measures require greater policy work and consultation than can be achieved in time for a 1 April 2017 application date. Recommendation 48. Officials recommend that options 2, 3, and 4 be adopted as they reduce overall compliance costs and provide a fairer, more sustainable tax system. As a result we consider them an improvement over the status quo. Approximately 130,000 taxpayers currently subject to withholding tax for contract work will have greater flexibility to self-manage, and at least 4,200 labour hire contractors will be brought into withholding. C. Making the system fairer 49. The current late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the init ial penalt y, of 1% the day after the due date and a further 4% imposed seven days after the due date, and an incremental penalty of 1% imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. 50. The late payment penalty does not effectively encourage all taxpayers to comply. For some taxpayers, late payment penalties can be seen as ineffective if they are imposed on people who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). The first group feel Inland Revenue is penalising them for an honest mistake and will grudgingly pay the penalty. The second cannot pay the initial 13 amount and so will not be able to pay the penalties. The third is unlikely to be motivated by a financial penalty and so other tools would likely be more effective. 51. The issues with the late payment penalty are its size, blunt application, and imposit ion on groups where it is ineffective as a collection tool. Options and analysis 52. To address concerns about the fairness and efficacy of the late payment penalty regime officials have considered a number of options focussing on the amount of penalty charged and the circumstances when a penalty should be charged. 53. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix C. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher cost than status quo but lower cost than recommended options 3. Remove the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: fiscal cost of $87 million over 4 years 4. Remove all late payment penalties and apply UOMI only Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher fiscal cost than both status quo and recommended options 5. Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: fiscal impact cannot be determined Recommendation 54. Officials recommend that options 3 be adopted as they will improve the effectiveness of the late payment penalty and thus improve the fairness and sustainability of the tax system. Once fully implemented option 3 will result in the incremental late payment penalty no longer being imposed on 65,000 taxpayers with income tax debt, 67,000 taxpayers with GST tax debt, and 23,000 families with Working for Families Tax Credit debt. D. Making markets work better through tax transparency 14 55. Tax secrecy rules mean that Inland Revenue cannot generally disclose information relating to significant business tax debt, or information relating to non-compliance with wider business legal obligations to relevant enforcement agencies. As a result businesses may be unaware of the credit risks they are dealing with, and enforcement agencies may be unaware of illegal conduct taking place. 56. In these ways tax secrecy can lead to inefficiencies and can allow non-co mpliant businesses to unfairly compete with compliant businesses. Making certain tax information available to others would assist in making markets work better. Options and analysis 57. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns which consider sharing both financial debt information and other intelligence. 58. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix D. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Share information on significant tax debt with credit reporting agencies Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 3. Share information on significant tax debt with the wider public Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 4. Share information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 5. Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact Recommendation 59. Officials recommend options 2 and 4 as these options appear to be justifiable exceptions to tax secrecy principles and would benefit market efficiency. These options address policy problem and would achieve the objectives without unreasonably disclosing tax secret information. E. Supplementary simplification measures 15 60. Research shows that tax compliance costs are relatively high for small businesses. However measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This section outlines supporting simplification measures to address these concerns and move towards a close enough is good enough tax outcome at lower compliance costs. They will reduce the amount of paperwork required by businesses and make it easier to manage their tax affairs without significantly affecting the amount of revenue collected by the government. The measures include simplified rules for businesses to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT), account for vehicles and premises, and deduct employee remuneration. They also include some threshold adjust ments to enable more small businesses access to simplified rules for filing and correcting errors. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles and premises 61. Small business owners often use their personal vehicles and homes for both business and private purposes. Currently they need to allocate all their related expenses between private and business use. The private use percentage might also vary between different items of expenditure. Because there are numerous expenses for these items, allocating these between business and personal use can create large compliance obligations compared to the amount of tax at stake. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Options and analysis 62. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-1 to this report. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional single rate for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small revenue cost 3. Compulsory single rate for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 63. Officials recommend option 2 be adopted as the calculation method for vehicles. While an optional method has some disadvantages in terms of efficiency and sustainability, officials consider the variance in the actual costs of car ownership is too wide for a compulsory single rate to be acceptably fair. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best 16 result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely that taxpayers would do this every year as vehicle expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Owners of newer and more expensive cars may see a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. A more accurate compulsory method could be developed, but this would erode the compliance cost benefits. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use premises Options and analysis 64. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-2 to this report. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional single rate for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small revenue cost 3. Compulsory single rate for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 65. Officials recommend option 2 is adopted for premises. While the method should produce a fairly accurate measure for most taxpayers, some taxpayers will be entitled to smaller deductions under the method than their actual costs. Such taxpayers may consequently regard a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely though that taxpayers would do this every year as premises expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Increase threshold for taxpayer’s self-corrections of minor errors 66. Currently if a taxpayer makes a minor error in their tax return with a tax effect of less than $500, they can self-correct the error in their next tax return. 2 However if the error results 2 Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 17 in more than a $500 tax difference, then the taxpayer must request the Commissioner to correct the error. This imposes compliance costs on the taxpayer in having to apply to the Commissioner for a small adjustment. It also imposes administration costs on Inland Revenue in having to manage these low value items. These costs are high compared with the amount of tax at stake. Options and analysis 67. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-3. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase self-adjust ment threshold to $1,000 Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 3. Increase self-adjustment threshold to $2,000 Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Revenue percentage threshold Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: negative as open to abuse Recommendation 68. Officials recommend option 2, as it provides the best balance between meeting the objectives of fairness and equity, efficiency of compliance and administration, and sustainability of the tax system. Remove requirement to renew a resident withholding tax exemption certificate annually 69. Currently some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) must renew the certificate annually. This creates relatively large compliance costs where certificates are renewed for relatively little value. It also creates an administrative burden for Inland Revenue, as all the annual exemption certificates must be renewed at the same time each year. Options and analysis 70. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-4. 18 Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Issue certificate for an unlimited period Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 3. Issue certificate for period greater than a year Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 71. Officials recommend option 2 as this meets the objectives of reducing compliance and administration costs with no impact on fairness or sustainability of the tax system. Increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT Most businesses are required to calculate and return FBT on a quarterly basis. However businesses that have combined pay as you earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis. As a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold. Consequently the business will be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs which are still significant relative to the size of the business. Options and analysis 72. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-5. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase threshold to $1 million Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small fiscal cost of approximately $0.5 million over four years 3. Increase threshold to $2 million Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: more significant fiscal cost than option 2 19 Recommendations 73. Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objective without a significant fiscal cost. Officials do not recommend option 3, as officials consider a business with combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of over $1 million is sufficiently large to be subject to the standard quarterly filing requirement. Modify the 63 day rule on employee remuneration 74. There is a special deduction and timing rule for the deferred payment of employee remuneration. Currently, in order to comply with this deferred payment rule, taxpayers need to work out what employee remuneration has been paid during the 63 day period that relates to the previous income year. This creates an additional compliance burden for taxpayers because they need to track payments accrued at year end and paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. Options and analysis 75. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-6. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional 63 day rule Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small upfront gain 3. Optional 63 day rule for different classes of employee remuneration Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small upfront gain Recommendations 76. Officials recommend adopting option 2 as it will provide compliance savings and improve efficiency by providing taxpayers with a choice. This option also has no disadvantage in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system because the same deductibility and timing rule will apply to all employee remuneration rather than different rules for different types of employee remuneration. Simplification of fringe benefit calculation for close companies 77. Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT for that benefit, subject to certain exemptions. Sole traders and partners in a partnership who use a motor vehicle in a similar 20 way are not required to register and pay FBT. Instead these taxpayers apportion their motor vehicle expenditure between the business and private use using special motor vehicle expenditure rules. These differences in treatment for what is essentially the same benefit (i.e. the private use of a motor vehicle) arise because of the different entities involved. Options and analysis 78. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-7. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Allow close companies to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small fiscal cost Recommendations 79. Officials recommend adopting option 2 as this provides consistency of treatment and will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving compliance overall. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely that taxpayers would do this every year as vehicle expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. This option also has no major disadvantages in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system. CONCLUSION 80. The recommended options under these themes collectively form a sensible tax package that would provide significant compliance cost reductions, while maintaining New Zealand’s broad base, low rate framework. CONSULTATION 81. Several forms of consultation have been undertaken in developing the options outlined in this statement. 82. In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University hosted a conference entitled Tax administration for the 21 st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier through reducing both compliance and administration costs, while balancing increased voluntary compliance against the core tax policy objectives of raising sufficient revenue and ensuring fairness and efficiency. The main points made by attendees were to give people the ability to self-manage their tax affairs through improved services and more flexible legislative frameworks, the importance of involving businesses and others in 21 the design of the rules and processes, the need to ensure that there is an overall net benefit to society of the changes not just a cost shift from Inland Revenue to businesses, and to ensure the continued maintenance of the current tax system whilst the reforms occur. 83. Following this conference the Government issued Making tax simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration which outlined the scope and direction of the review of the tax administration, and sought feedback on the future for business tax and the problems taxpayers face with the current system. The options proposed in this regulatory impact statement address the five main issues identified as part of the consultation with taxpayers and feedback on the green paper. These issues are outlined under the status quo and problem definit ion sect ion above. 84. The Government has decided not to issue a discussion document on the options in this regulatory impact statement, which would normally occur as part of the policy development process. However, in developing these options, Ministers have asked officials to undertake selected consultation with key players, including the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, Business New Zealand, selected labour hire firms, selected credit reporting agencies, and a small group of accountants. Feedback from these consultations has informed the development of the options. 85. Also, once the Government announces the changes it is expected that an issues paper will be released seeking public feedback on the detailed design of each of the proposals. IMPLEMENTATION 86. It is proposed to include the recommended options in a bill to be introduced in July 2016 and enacted by the end of the year. 87. All the recommended options (apart from the accounting income method and paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees) will apply from 1 April 2017. The accounting income method and paying provisional tax on behalf of related individuals’ options will apply from 1 April 2018. 88. The new provisional tax option using an accounting income method has an implementation date of 1 April 2018 as both Inland Revenue and external suppliers will have changes to make to systems and products that will require a lead in time of between 12 to 18 months. 89. The migration of income tax processing from Inland Revenue’s heritage system to the new technology platform is a good transition point for the introduction of a new provisional tax calculation method. This period will also allow external suppliers to develop and modify products to use the new method. 90. The option of paying tax on behalf of shareholder-emplo yees is required to be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new platform in order to reduce the implementation costs. The new platform is expected to be deployed for income tax on 1 April 2018 and this option will apply from then. The compliance cost saving this option offers may also be useful for other types of income paid out by companies to related parties, and as an alternative to Resident Withholding Tax. Depending on the uptake of this option, officials may recommend 22 its extension to other income types in the future. It may also be useful to extend it to partnerships in the future, based on a similar assessment. This wider use of the paying tax as agent proposal is not addressed in this RIS. 91. The removal of the incremental late payment penalty for GST will apply from when the new platform begins to administer GST, which is scheduled to be taxable periods beginning February 2017. The first GST returns filed will be due after the 1 April 2017 application date of the new penalty rules. For income tax and Working for Families Tax Credits the removal of the incremental late payment penalty will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 2017. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 92. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a mult i-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 93. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 94. Also, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme a benefit management strategy has been developed and endorsed. The strategy provides the framework for managing benefit s within the programme, and: • defines benefit components; • details how programme benefits will be quantified and measured; • documents how progress will be tracked; and • describes what governance arrangements will be in place. 95. Both internal and external stakeholders will be actively involved in the on-going assessment of timeframes, benefits identification and benefits realisation for each stage of the transformation programme. 23 APPENDIX A – CHANGES TO PROVISIONAL TAX TO INCREASE CERTAINTY AND REDUCE COSTS Status Quo and problem definition There are around 300,000 provisional taxpayers in New Zealand: • 24% of Government revenue comes from provisional tax • 75% of provisional taxpayers are individuals • 75% of provisional tax payments come from companies • The top 5% of companies represent approximately 43% of the total provisional tax collected. Currently taxpayers have three options for calculating provisional tax: • The standard (or uplift) option which is based on the prior year’s residual inco me tax (RIT) of the taxpayer plus 5%, or the year previous to the prior year RIT plus 10%; or • The estimation option where the taxpayer makes an estimate of their current year tax liability and pays provisional tax based on that estimate; or • The GST ratio option which is available only to a small subset of taxpayers and is based on a ratio of RIT from the prior year to total GST taxable supplies for that year applied to GST taxable supplies for the current year. Comprehensive UOMI applies to instalments under the standard and estimation methods. The UOMI calculation divides the RIT for the taxpayer by the three provisional tax instalments and compares this to the provisional tax payments made by the taxpayer, charging or paying UOMI on the resulting shortfall or surplus. The current rates of UOMI are 9.21% for underpayments and 2.63% for overpayments. This results in taxpayers tending to overpay tax on the first instalment to avoid negative UOMI impacts. Feedback indicates attitudes to provisional tax fall on a spectrum fro m taxpayers who find provisional tax difficult and stressful to those who are happy with the current rules. One consistent trend from taxpayers consulted was that they had issues with the application of UOMI, which looks more like a penalty rather than a time value of money charge when taxpayers have unexpected income during the year. This causes taxpayers stress and increased compliance costs. A reduction or elimination of the negative impacts of UOMI to taxpayers would reduce these negative perceptions of provisional tax. This is especially so for those who are committing to a minimum level of tax payments based on the prior year plus an uplift where the application of UOMI can be particularly harsh. Another issue with the current provisional tax regime is that it attempts to approximate a pay as you earn system by assuming, wrongly in a large number of cases, that income is earned 24 evenly throughout an income year. This means that what was intended to be a pay as you earn type system can become a pay before you have earned system which can cause cash-flow issues. This is particularly so for smaller, unsophisticated businesses. A final issue with provisional tax relates to close companies and partnerships. In this situation there can be multiple taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax where in essence, there is one taxpaying group which should be subject to one rule to ease compliance and reduce the number of people subject to provisional tax. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. Options The proposals to address the issue are: 1. Extend the safe harbour from UOMI; 2. Remove the application of UOMI; 3. Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax; and 4. Enable tax to be paid by close companies and partnerships as agent for shareholders and partners. 1 – Extend the current safe harbour from UOMI UOMI applies from the first provisional tax date unless the taxpayer is an individual (i.e. a natural person) and their RIT is less than $50,000, in which case UOMI will apply only from the terminal tax date. One way of alleviating the concern expressed by some taxpayers around the application of UOMI would be to either increase the RIT threshold at which UOMI is imposed and/or extend the threshold to include other groups of taxpayers. Taxpayers wit h smaller amounts of tax to pay are relatively unsophisticated and are committing to pay a minimum amount of tax using previous years’ assessments as a proxy for their current year tax liability. Increasing the threshold will take more taxpayers out of the UOMI regime which should reduce stress and increase certainty around their tax payments. In addition, the application of the safe harbour could be extended to non-individuals who have low levels of income and are likely to be unsophisticated taxpayers. There are a number of levels that the RIT threshold could be increased to. At the time the threshold was increased to $50,000, it was forecast that 97% of individual taxpayers would fall within the new safe harbour. This means even a small movement in the threshold could remove almost all individuals from the application of UOMI. 25 This also suggests any further increase in the safe harbour RIT threshold would have limited appeal unless it was extended to other types of taxpayers, specifically, non-individual taxpayers. Non-individuals were previously excluded from the safe harbour regime because of concerns around income shifting between individuals and related entities to ensure that no UOMI was payable. It was also possible for related parties to switch income from one party to another to ensure that provisional tax was also not payable due to the application of the provisional tax threshold (i.e., those with residual income tax of less than $2,500 are not subject to provisio nal tax). Whilst the rules will require some protection mechanisms to restrict taxpayers’ ability to undertake this switching, the benefits to most taxpayers will outweigh these restrictions. In addition, since these rules were reviewed the prospect of increased visibility through more comprehensive systems should enable any potential gaming to be identified. This proposal increases the threshold before UOMI will apply from $50,000 to $60,000 and expands the scope of this rule to non-individuals as well as individuals. This will reduce the number of taxpayers subject to UOMI by an additional 67,000 taxpayers, the majorit y being non-individuals. The object of the change is to remove smaller taxpayers fro m the UOMI rules, reducing their stress and increasing certainty around their tax liabilities. Several thresholds were considered. The option of increasing the threshold to $60,000 of RIT and the extension of the rule to non-individuals fitted within the fiscal parameters. A $60,000 level reduces the application of UOMI to individuals to very small numbers, while the extension removes a significant number of non-individuals from the UOMI rules. A higher RIT level such as $70,000 or $80,000 would remo ve more taxpayers from the UOMI rules, but would have addit io nal cost and would result in some reasonably sophisticated taxpayers being included within the rules. This would defeat the intention of removing those taxpayers who can struggle with predicting their income. Another option would have been to retain the $50,000 threshold but extend the rules to non- individuals. The number of taxpayers that are within the $50-60,000 band of RIT is approximately 4,000. Consequently the proposal is to increase the safe harbour threshold from $50,000 to $60,000 and make this available to non-individuals as well as individuals. This proposal deals with the issues around certainty of tax payments and the stress some taxpayers feel over provisional tax and the application of UOMI. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 26 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Not met The application of UOMI will continue to have a penal effect rather than a use of funds effect. The application of UOMI to taxpayers who use the standard method will continue to have an impact on fairness aspects. Not met Taxpayers will continue to experience uncertainty in the application of UOMI to them, creating compliance costs. Not met Some taxpayers will continue to view provisional tax in a negative light with the current rules providing uncertainty as to the total tax liability including interest. No impact 2. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $60,000 and expansion of safe harbour fro m UOMI to non- individuals Met Provides more fairness to those taxpayers who have limited tax knowledge by removing uncertainty as to the application of UOMI for relatively small amounts of tax. Met For smaller taxpayers, reduces compliance costs of having to deal with provisional tax and unexpected UOMI costs. Inland Revenue will have less administration costs from taxpayer contact around provisional tax as this proposal will reduce the number of taxpayers subject to interest. Met Provides more certainty for taxpayers on the applica tion o f UOMI. This measure will cost $47 million over four years. 27 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $70,000 and expansion of safe harbour fro m UOMI to non- individuals Not met Higher threshold brings more sophisticated taxpayers into the safe harbour. These taxpayers should have sufficient ability to determine their tax position without safe harbour which creates unfairness to those who cannot. Partially met Reduces compliance costs for some taxpayers, and for taxpayers who have no real issues wit h provisional tax as their business processes include forecasting and budgeting. Partially met Provides more certainty on the application of UOMI for some, but makes little difference to those at the top end of the scale. This option would have a greater fiscal cost than option 2 which makes this less viable for government. 4. Increase to the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 with no extension to non- individuals Not met Changes to the safe harbour to increase it to $60,000 without extending it to non- individuals would not have a large effect on taxpayers because of the narrow group of taxpayers that would benefit. This provides an inequity to taxpayers because of the vehicle of choice they have made for predominately non-tax reasons (e.g. limited liability). Not met Increases administration costs for Inland Revenue in having to change systems for a very small group of taxpayers. Reduced compliance costs for the limited number of taxpayers who are affected, but may not outweigh the costs. Met Marginal revenue impact 28 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – increase the current safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 and extend the application of the safe harbour to non-individuals. Both these measures will reduce stress and compliance costs for taxpayers who have tax liabilities at relatively low levels. As a result, 67,000 taxpayers will no longer be subject to UOMI. 2 – Application of UOMI At present, for those taxpayers who use the standard method of calculating, provisional tax instalments are based on 105% of the prior year or 110% of the year preceding the prior year. Notwithstanding this uplift method, if a taxpayer’s RIT exceeds the safe harbour threshold and is different from the instalments paid, comprehensive UOMI will apply from the first instalment date. Where taxpayers have used the standard or uplift method of calculating provisional tax they have committed to a minimum amount of tax payments no matter what their actual income is. This could be more or less than the tax payments required on their current year income. Currently UOMI seeks to compensate the party who ends up funding this difference (i.e., the taxpayer or the government). The issue here is that the funding party may not be apparent until the end of the income year. This can result in taxpayers overpaying their tax to ensure they end up being the funding party and not incurring large amounts of interest. Alternatively, if the taxpayer doesn’t overpay early instalments they are effectively penalised from using the best information available to most taxpayers, being the prior year results plus a growth factor, on which to base their current year payments. This is one instance where UOMI can be a penalty rather than a use of funds charge. The first option is to remove UOMI from taxpayers who pay based on the standard method for the first two instalments giving taxpayers the ability to pay the correct amount of tax and reduce or eliminate UOMI. This option will apply to large and small taxpayers but will be of main benefit to those larger taxpayers who fall outside the $60,000 RIT safe harbour. These taxpayers will tend to be more sophisticated and should be able to pay their total tax liability by the last instalment date and have no exposure to UOMI as long as they have committed to and paid a certain level of tax during the income year. Again this option deals with the issues around certainty of tax payments and exposure to UOMI for taxpayers who struggle to estimate their income. This option provides them with certainty around tax payments and overall liability in respect of those payments. Another option considered was to only impose UOMI fro m the terminal tax date, extending the safe harbour rules to all taxpayers using the standard uplift method. This option is not recommended due to fiscal concerns and the fact that this group of taxpayers is reasonably sophisticated and should be able to calculate a reasonable tax liability to ensure that UOMI is eliminated or reduced from the last instalment date. This would also increase the fiscal costs of the solution which would have made the proposal uneconomic. 29 Consideration was also given to imposing UOMI from the second instalment date as this should be sufficient time for a business to understand how their income was tracking for the income year. However, this would effectively require everyone to estimate their income from the second instalment date. This would defeat the intent to make things more certain for taxpayers who cannot reasonably estimate their income for the year and is not recommended. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 30 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Not met The application of UOMI will continue to have a penal effect rather than a use of funds effect for those taxpayers who have unexpected income. The application of UOMI to taxpayers who use the standard method will continue to have an impact on fairness aspects. Not met Taxpayers will continue to experience uncertainty in the application of UOMI to them, creating compliance costs. Taxpayers who commit to paying a minimum amount of tax through the standard method will continue to view UOMI as a penalty. Not met Some taxpayers will continue to view provisional tax in a negative light with the current rules providing uncertainty as to the total tax liability including interest. No impact 2. Remove the application of UOMI for the first two provisio nal tax instalments for taxpayers who use the standard method Met Taxpayers who commit to making a minimum level of tax payments during a year based on the best information available on their performance should not be penalised by the application of UOMI where the actua l liability is different. Increases the fairness to taxpayers of unexpected changes in income. Met Makes provisional tax simpler for the majority of provisional taxpayers who currently use the standard method to calculate their provisional tax. Reduces administration costs as Inland Revenue will have a better picture of provisional tax payments that will be payable for a year. Met Increases certainty for taxpayers in terms of their total liability to tax and UOMI for a year. This measure has a revenue cost of $7.5 million and a cash-flow cost of $334 million over four years. 3. Remove the application of Not met Not met Met This measure has a prohibitive cash-flow and 31 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue UOMI to terminal tax for taxpayers who use the standard method The current safe harbour removes those who have lower levels of RIT from the application of UOMI. This is to ensure that those on those lower levels have certainty around UOMI. To allow all taxpayers to have this concessionary treatment is not appropriate as some taxpayers are sophisticated and should be able to manage their tax payments accordingly. Reduces the compliance costs for those taxpayers using the safe harbour method. Increases the incentive to change between the standard and estimation methods for more sophisticated taxpayers, as they will determine on which basis to pay provisional tax based on the standard method or estimate. Increases certainty for taxpayers in terms of their total liabilit y for tax and UOMI for a year. revenue cost. 4. Remove the application of UOMI for the first instalment for taxpayers who use the standard method to calculate provisio nal tax Not met Removing the application of UOMI from the first instalment provides no real relief for taxpayers fro m the current provisional tax problems. This would continue to have issues around fairness of the application of UOMI, albeit they would be reduced slightly. Not met Doesn’t reduce compliance costs of taxpayers overly as it only relieves interest from one payment. Will still require taxpayers to either overpay from the second instalment or risk the application of UOMI, or to estimate their liabilit y. Not met Still results in uncertainty for taxpayers regarding their total liabilit y for provisional tax payments and UOMI, which does not change perceptions of provisio nal tax. This measure would have a lower cost both in terms of revenue and cash-flow than the recommended option. 32 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – remove UOMI from the first two instalments of provisional tax where taxpayers use the standard uplift method. This will provide certainty to all taxpayers who use the standard uplift method. This option is expected to remove 19,000 taxpayers from the requirement to pay UOMI on their first two instalments of provisional tax. 3 – Calculation method for provisional tax There are three methods for the calculation of provisional tax. The standard method based on an uplift of the prior year’s RIT, an estimate made by the taxpayer and the GST ratio method which is only available to a small subset of taxpayers. UOMI is charged as if income is earned evenly over an income year, which is not a realistic proposition for many taxpayers. Whilst there are a number of options to bring tax payments more in line with the earning of income, there are difficulties and restrictions on doing this. One difficulty is the assumption that income is either cumulative or static. Businesses can have fluctuations in inco me fro m pro fit to loss between mo nths, unlike salary and wage earners who have accumulating income throughout the year. Methods that work well for accumulating income aren’t effective where a business alternates between profit and loss from month to month. Officials considered three options to more closely align the calculation of provisional tax with the income earning process. The first option is basing provisional tax instalments on a taxpayer’s accounting results for a period. This method uses actual calculations from actual results and has been titled the “accounting income method”. This proposal introduces a new method of calculating provisional tax instalments for smaller taxpayers. It allows them to base provisional tax instalments on their accounting results for a two month period. Essentially this provides for a pay as you go type of payment which bases payments on actual results rather than forecast income, excluding shareholder salaries. For businesses with accumulating income throughout an income year, this method should provide the correct amount of tax payments for a year. For those with fluctuating profits and losses, an overpayment issue may still arise. However, as this is one of a choice of methods, another method may be more appropriate for taxpayers with that profile. Under this option the number of provisional tax payments is increased from three to six to more closely align payments with the income earning of a taxpayer. The option will not be permitted for larger taxpayers at this point in time as there are concerns about the accuracy of the option for those with large tax adjustments around year end. Work will continue on this option to assess its suitability for use with larger taxpayers. The second option is an extension of the GST ratio method. This method takes the RIT from the prior year and divides it by the GST taxable supplies for that same year to calculate a ratio 33 that is applied to current year GST taxable supplies to give an approximation of an annual tax liability. This method can work well where the taxpayer has static tax adjustments to accounting profits during a year which results in that ratio being reasonably static. It also relies on constant margins. This method works well for taxpayers with lower turnovers, but as turnover grows this ratio can become inaccurate. This is the reason that the GST ratio method is only available to a limited subset of taxpayers and its acceptance by taxpayers is also very low with only 2-3,000 taxpayers currently using this method. A third option to more closely link tax payments with the earning of income is a turnover method, which is used in the Australian pay as you go instalment system. In essence this is very similar to the GST ratio method used in New Zealand. The turnover method again uses a ratio which is the RIT for a taxpayer divided by total turnover or revenue in the same year. Instead of using a GST reference point, the turnover method uses the accounting notion of turnover or income to generate a ratio which is then applied to the actual turnover for the current period to determine provisional tax instalments. This method has advantages in that it deals with volatility between profits and losses during a year much better than the other options, as it works on an average tax rate throughout the year rather than a result for a particular period. Again, however, it has disadvantages in that, similar to the GST ratio method, it relies on static tax adjustments and margins to be accurate. There is the potential that the higher the turnover, the more inaccurate this method could become. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 34 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo 2. Introduce the accounting income method Met Provides a more fair and equitable way for small businesses to calculate provisio nal tax by moving to a more “pay as you go” type system. Met Moves the calculation of provisional tax to a process that is more aligned to normal business processes. Should ease compliance for small businesses and also provide Inland Revenue with better informa t ion to effectively administer those taxpayers. Met Links the payment of tax with ordinary business processes, providing greater certainty to taxpayers on the timing of tax payments and the earning of income. No impact 3. Extend the GST ratio method Partially met The extension of the GST ratio method to a larger group of taxpayers may assist to provide a closer pay as you go mechanism than the current provisional tax methods. However for taxpayers who have non- static margins or tax adjustments, issues wit h over or underpayment can still arise. In addit ion, the conclusio n at the time the GST ratio method was introduced was that the larger the turnover, the less accurate the method was. This would still leave Not met A GST ratio method has some compliance costs associated with it that may result in higher costs than a pure uplift method. The possibility of overpayments for larger taxpayers could also create larger compliance costs through the overpayment of tax where margins or tax adjustments are not static. Not met The possibility of taxpayers having overpayments under the GST ratio option could make the system unstable and inherently unfair to taxpayers. No impact 35 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue unfairness within the system. 4. Introduce a turnover method Met Provides a method that better approximates a pay as you go system. Not met The method works off a prior year ratio of RIT to total income. It requires taxpayers to apply that ratio to actual turnover in the current year. This increases compliance costs compared to current methods. Issues will remain with overpayments, which will increase compliance costs. Not met Similar issues to the GST ratio in respect of overpayments destabilising the overall structure of the system. No impact 36 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – Introduction of an accounting income method. The introduction of a new method that more closely aligns to the income earning pattern of the taxpayer will allow for a more pay as you go type system for business taxpayers. This will allow them to more accurately pay tax during the year in a way which matches their income seasonality rather than on a straight line basis. This will have a number of advantages for taxpayers regarding the funding of tax payments and removal of the application of UOMI. This will reduce compliance costs and increase certainty for taxpayers. 4 – Paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees A typical small company will be owned by one or more related parties – often a husband and wife, or one or more family trusts, or a combination of these. There will typically be a number of transactions between the company and its owners (and other related parties); salaries, dividends, interest, and sometimes payment for things like the rent of premises. The company and each of the owners and related parties will have their own liability to account for provisio nal tax. Both calculating and paying provisional tax creates compliance costs for those who are liable; and as outlined earlier there is significant concern amongst small businesses about those compliance costs. Tax compliance costs incurred by business reduce the ability of those businesses to grow, which has negative impacts on economic growth and emplo yment. While compliance concerns are the key issues with the status quo, a wider efficiency argument also arises. Some individuals who might like to set up in business on their own could be discouraged from doing so because of the complexity of provisional tax. Inefficiency will always arise where tax influences behaviour. Some taxpayers consider the application of provisional tax rules to them in their current form to be unfair, because of the work required to calculate and pay, and the risk of exposure to UOMI. The degree of public concern expressed about provisional tax means that it is arguably not sustainable in the long term – hence the focus in this paper on alternatives. This also gives rise to a minor revenue risk – a self-assessment system requires voluntary engagement by taxpayers, and some may disengage if they perceive the rules as unfair or too complex. Current rules do allow taxpayers to transfer provisional tax to others, but the amount transferred must be excess tax, and the transferee remains a provisional tax payer. In 2014 there were approximately 305,000 companies which paid income out to shareholders without deduction of tax at source. Four options to address the issue were looked at. The first option is to retain the status quo and accept that tax operates on the basis of legal form. If individuals want to put their business activities in a separate company, they 37 inevitably create a requirement for transactions – with tax consequences – between that company and themselves. The second option is to allow a model which acknowledges that a single economic entity exists. Where a company and its shareholder-employees opt in to this approach the company will be able to make tax payments on behalf of shareholders, which may enable them to stay outside provisio nal tax. The third option would require companies with shareholder-emplo yees to operate a model which acknowledges that a single economic entity exists. Companies will be required to make tax payments on behalf of shareholder-employees, to ensure they are no longer subject to provisional tax on their shareholder salaries. The fourth option is to exempt shareholder salaries from provisional tax and require tax on these payments to be paid at terminal tax date. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. Consultation Participants in the pre-announcement consultation saw the proposal to allow a company to pay tax on behalf of its shareholder-emplo yees as an improvement over the status quo. One accountant observed that it provided the opportunity to create a mini-tax pool inside a group of related entities, although another with access to a tax pool thought the approach might not add much to what they could already do. Accountants noted that some compliance work would remain for them, as they would still need to calculate the tax liability of each entity and individual in the same way as if they had all remained subject to provisional tax, but that the removal of direct provisional tax liabilities and the requirement to engage with Inland Revenue in relation to each taxpayer would deliver some compliance cost savings. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) considered that companies should have the ability to choose to pay tax as an agent of shareholder employees (option 2), rather than being required to (option 3). They saw option 2 as giving businesses the ability to choose this option if it suited them and they felt comfortable using it, but allowing them to remain with the status quo if it did not. They thought that the mechanism could be simpler than if it was compulsory, because it would not need to cover every possible circumstance. CAANZ expressed enthusiasm about removing provisio nal tax from shareholder salaries entirely (option 4) but acknowledged that it would give rise to fairness and revenue concerns and was not a realistic option. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 38 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Shareholder-emplo yees who receive salaries fro m companies, and which is not taxed at source, are liable to pay provisional tax, just as individuals who receive other income not taxed at source are Not met The current system has compliance costs which are of significant concern to business and government. Partially met The fairness of the status quo approach supports sustainability, but the degree of concern around the compliance costs of provisional tax does not support sustainability. No impact 2. Allow companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. Met Fairness will be maintained provided these rules are implemented in such a way that tax paid on behalf of related parties is paid at the time that those related parties would have paid it themselves if these rules had not applied. Partially met This option allows shareholder-emplo yees to be ent irely remo ved fro m provisio nal tax. However, calculat ions of their underlying tax liability are still required, to enable the correct amount of tax to be paid on their behalf. Some companies will also incur compliance costs in determining whether to opt into these rules or not. Met This option is both fair and reduces the compliance cost impact of provisio nal tax. The non-compulsory nature means it is unlikely to be opposed by business. No impact (provided this option is implemented in a way which ensures that no revenue leakage occurs.) Monitoring is likely to be required in initial years. 39 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3. Require companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. Partially met The reservation immediately above applies. Some may also consider it unfair that taxpayers in this situation are required to pay tax through an agency relat ionship, whereas situations where income is received from an unrelated party do not require an agency relationship. Partially met The reservation immediately above applies. The compulsory nature of this option also means that some taxpayers who may be happy with the status quo will be required to use it and will identify themselves as incurring additional compliance costs. However, there will be no compliance costs incurred in choosing whether or not to implement this option, and administration will be simplified. Partially met This option is both fair and reduces the compliance cost impact of provisio nal tax. However, there may be objections to the compulsory nature of this option. No impact Subject to the condit ion described above. 4. Exclude shareholder salaries fro m provisio nal tax entirely and allow tax to be paid at terminal tax date. Not met Those who fall under this rule would have a timing advantage and remo val o f interest benefit over those who derive non-source deducted income from non-associated sources, and those who derive income subject to source deduction, as both groups pay tax as income is earned. Met There would be a significant reduction in compliance cost as a result of removing those associated with small business from provisional tax. Not met While the timing advantage this option would create would not threaten the broad base, low rate philosophy which underpins the New Zealand tax system, this kind of difference would still create a risk that other provisional taxpayers would seek similar concessions and undermine the key concept of paying tax on income as it is earned.. Revenue cost Introduction of this option would delay the receipt of revenue compared with the status quo. It could also encourage greater amounts to be paid out to shareholders – and so taxed at lower rates – instead of being retained in the company. 40 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – allo wing companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. As this mechanism may give rise to additional cost or complexity for some, the most efficient overall outcome will be achieved by allowing each business to evaluate the costs and benefits of using it. This also provides a gradual uptake path for those businesses initially reluctant to use something new, but may become more comfortable once the mechanism has been in place for a period of time and is better-understood. Also, option 2 is supported by the stakeholders this was discussed with. 41 APPENDIX B – SELF-MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRITY Status quo and problem definition Withholding at source systems are widely considered to be the foundation of an effective tax system. Such systems impose an obligation on an independent third party (for example, an emplo yer or financial inst itution) to withho ld an amount of tax from a payment of income. Withholding at source systems: • remove taxpayers from the obligations around provisional tax or at least reduce those obligations to a level where safe harbour from UOMI may apply; • are a more cost-effective way for both taxpayers and the revenue agency to interact; • provide a timely flow of income to the government; • reduce the likelihood of non-payment that might otherwise arise where the taxpayer reports the income but is unable to pay some or all of the tax assessed; and • can significantly reduce the ability for taxpayers to understate their income. New Zealand has a number of domestic withholding taxes, most notably PAYE and RWT. The “schedular payments” rules are another example of withholding. The schedular payment rules apply a withholding tax for payments made to contractors who are in a set of limited industries (and even for these limited industries, the coverage is patchy). The schedular payment rules are intended to supplement the standard PAYE rules and provide a more efficient means of collecting tax for contractors. There are currently approximately 130,000 contractors who are subject to withholding tax. The rules require withholding at flat rates. These rates have not been reviewed since 1979 and for the majorit y o f taxpayers, the amounts withheld do not match their final tax liability (the current rates generally over-withhold on contractors). The withholding rules do not generally apply to companies. A contractor can also apply to Inland Revenue to obtain a certificate of exempt ion fro m withho lding. There are significant issues with the schedular payment rules. The rules are neither comprehensive in scope nor simple in application. Although the withholding tax rules for schedular payments have not changed for many years, the labour market has undergone significant shifts. While the proportion of people who are self-employed (with no employees) has not changed much over the last 20 years, the industry make-up of these self-emplo yed persons is changing. There has been a decrease in those working in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, and an increase in the professional, scientific, and technical services and administrative and support services. 42 The current withholding tax rules generally do not apply to these modern, professional industries. This means more self-employed people are working in industries not covered by the withholding tax rules. 3 In addition, using a company structure has become increasingly popular with contractors. Payments to companies are generally not subject to withholding tax under the schedular payment rules. 4 The diagram below illustrates the increasing use of companies as a vehicle through which to carry out a business over the period 2000-2014. 3 Household Labour Force Survey. This work is based on/includes customised Statistics New Zealand’s data which are licensed by Statistics New Zealand for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. 4 Companies in the agricultural, horticultural, and viticulture industries and non-resident contractor companies are subject to withholding under the schedular payment rules. 43 5 These out of date rules are creating issues. Many modern contractors are not subject to the withholding rules and are instead required to manage their own tax obligations (including provisio nal tax). Contractors subject to the withholding rules face an inflexible set of rules that prescribe flat rates of withholding and do not give them the tools to self-manage their obligations. These contractors also have the opportunity to suppress income and operate totally or partially in the hidden economy. Investigators within Inland Revenue are reporting that there are compliance issues with contractors not subject to withholding. These contractors are not paying their fair share of tax and are claiming social policy benefits they are not entitled to. This imposes greater costs and creates inefficiencies. Source deductions are a more efficient means of collecting tax for both contractors as well as Inland Revenue. It costs Inland Revenue $0.28 to collect $100 of tax fro m wit hheld PAYE inco me compared with $2.28 for $100 of income tax from non-withheld income. The out of date rules are imposing greater costs on both contractors and the government. This regulatory impact statement considers three measures to address these issues that are feasible to implement with a 1 April 2017 application date. Options and analysis The options to address the issue are: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Allow contractors subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate. 5 Business Demography Statistics. This work is based on/includes customised Statistics New Zealand’s data which are licenced by Statistics New Zealand for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. 44 3. Allow contractors not subject to the schedular payment rules to voluntarily elect into the withho lding rules. 4. Extend withholding to labour-hire firms. The three measures 2, 3, and 4, are not mutually exclusive. Measures not considered There are a number of other options that would address these issues that are not considered in this regulatory impact statement. This includes: • Extending withholding to other directly engaged contractors (for example, IT contractors). • Removing or amending the company exception to the schedular payment rules. • Using banks as an intermediary for withholding rather than the payer of the contractor. These options are not considered in this regulatory impact statement because officials do not consider them feasible to implement by 1 April 2017. These measures require greater policy work and consultation than can be achieved in time for a 1 April 2017 application date. Option 2 - Electing own withholding rate At present the schedular payment rules specify flat rates of withholding to be applied to payments to contractors. These rates will often not match the contractor’s actual income tax liability. Contractors can obtain a special tax code to alter their rate; however the process can be cumbersome and requires an application to Inland Revenue with supporting information. This option would allow contractors to select their own withholding rate without needing to apply to Inland Revenue. This means that an application for a special tax code will no longer be needed to alter the rate applied to a schedular payment. Option 3- Voluntary withholding agreements Contractors not covered by the schedular payment withholding rules are not currently able to have tax withheld on a payday basis. This measure will allow contractors to opt in to withholding through voluntary agreements. The proposal will require both the contractor and the payer to agree before withholding would apply. This will enable these contractors to have greater flexibility to manage their tax obligations. Option 4 - Extending withholding to labour-hire firms A labour-hire firm is a firm that arranges for workers to do work for clients. The labour-hire firm receives payment from the client and on-pays the worker. 45 Workers engaged through labour-hire firms are often contractors for the labour-hire firm and the current withholding rules do not generally apply to them. There are at least 4,200 contractors of labour hire firms that are required to manage their own tax obligations and have to deal with provisional tax. These contractors also have opportunities for non-compliance (whether deliberate or accidental). Investigators within Inland Revenue are reporting that there are compliance issues with some labour-hire firm contractors not paying their fair share of tax and claiming social policy benefits they are not entitled to. This option would extend the current withholding tax rules to these contractors. The contractors would be able to elect their own withholding rate (as per option 2) and tax would be deducted at this rate and paid to Inland Revenue. If the contractor picks a rate that generally matches their final tax liability they will not be required to pay provisional tax. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 46 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Not met Some contractors are not paying their fair share of tax and are claiming social policy benefits they are not ent it led to. Contractors and employees are often doing very similar work, yet have very different rules apply to them. Not met Contractors not subject to withholding have to manage their own tax obligations. Contractors subject to withholding face inflexible rules and are not given effective tools to self-manage. Does not decrease compliance costs for payers (unlike options 2 and 3). Higher processing and enforcement costs for Inland Revenue. Not met Some employers and contractors are structuring to avoid the rules and avoid paying their fair share of tax. No impact 2. Electing own withholding rate Met Contractors in the schedular payment rules are currently generally over-deducted from resulting in a cash-flo w cost to them that other contractors do not have. This change will make it easier for them to have the correct amount deducted. Met Contractors that are subject to withholding will be given more flexibility to pick the correct rate of withholding. Their compliance costs will decrease as they will not have to apply for a special tax code to change their rate of withholding and therefore can more easily get their tax obligations right from the start. Payers of contractors may have an increase in compliance costs as they will have to more frequently change withholding rates. However, this is expected to be small and outweighed by the decrease in compliance costs for contractors. Inland Revenue will have less administration costs from administering special tax code applications and end of year tax bills and refunds. No impact The measure is expected to have an initial upfront fiscal cost of approximately $54 million (of which $19 million is recovered in following two years). This upfront cost arises primarily because the majority of contractors in the schedular payment rules are currently over- withheld and receive a tax refund in the following year. This over- withholding provides a one year fiscal benefit to the government. The proposal is expected to 47 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue decrease the number of contractors who are over- withheld and therefore reduce this fiscal benefit to the government. 3. Voluntary withholding agreements Met Contractors will be able to voluntarily choose to have withholding apply and so have similar treatment to emplo yees. Met Compliance costs for contractors who enter voluntary agreements will decrease as they have an easier means to pay their tax. Administratio n costs for Inland Revenue will decrease for these contractors as well. No impact Marginal upfront gain. 4. Extending withholding to labour-hire firms Met Contractors working for labour-hire firms will not be able to avoid paying their fair share of tax and claim social policy benefits they are not ent it led to. This option would make the treatment of employees and contractors more similar for tax purposes. Met Will reduce compliance costs for labour-hire firm contractors as they will have an easier means to pay their tax. Compliance costs will increase for labour-hire firms. However, this is expected to be less than the decrease in compliance costs for contractors and as a result overall compliance costs are expected to decrease. Large labour-hire firms have reported that the compliance costs of the proposal for them would be low, while smaller firms have reported that the compliance costs would be higher. Reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue in processing and enforcement for labour-hire firm contractors. Met Contractors working for labour-hire firms will not have the opportunity to structure to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Some contractors may attempt to avoid the rules by contracting with clients directly; however following consultation wit h labour-hire firms we consider that this impact will be low. The impact of this option is difficult to measure as it relies on estimations of the hidden economy. A conservative estimate shows a revenue benefit of $5 million-$10 million a year. 48 Minimum rates of withholding One design decision for the electing own withholding rate proposal is whether or not to require contractors to have a minimum rate of withholding. With a minimum rate, contractors who want to have a rate of withholding below the minimum will need to apply for a special tax code. The key advantage of a minimum rate is that it reduces the fiscal risk that contractors may attempt to defer or avoid paying their tax through picking artificially low rates. The key disadvantage is that it limits choice for contractors and therefore imposes withholding tax on compliant contractors who may prefer provisional tax. With a minimum rate of 10%, the fiscal impact of the proposal is expected to be approximately $54 million (with $19 million of this recovered in the subsequent two years). With no minimum rate this increases to approximately $111m (with $39 million recovered in subsequent two years). Consultation Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted on these measures with industry groups and businesses, including small and large labour-hire firms. These groups were generally supportive of the measures and believed they would reduce overall compliance costs. Larger labour-hire firms have said that compliance costs of the proposals would be relatively low, while smaller labour-hire firms have reported that compliance costs would be relatively greater for them. In their submissio ns, labour-hire firms said the labour-hire rules need to apply consistently across all labour-hire industries, and that it is unlikely that labour-hire contractors will change their behaviour to avoid the rules by contracting directly with clients. The analysis and rules recommended in this regulatory impact statement reflect these submissions. One concern raised by submitters was that the electing own withholding rate proposal could significantly increase compliance costs for withholders if contractors repeatedly alter their withho lding rates. We are proposing to address this through requiring the consent of the withholder to further changes in a contractor’s withholding rate if the contractor has previously changed their withholding rate twice within one year. Recommendations Inland Revenue supports options 2, 3, and 4. These three measures take the first step in modernising the withholding rules for contractors and can be implemented by 1 April 2017. These three options will reduce overall compliance costs and provide a fairer, more sustainable tax system. As a result we consider them an improvement over the status quo. Approximately 130,000 taxpayers currently subject to withholding tax for contract work will have greater flexibility to self-manage and at least 4,200 labour hire contractors will be brought into withholding. 49 APPENDIX C – MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER Status quo and problem definition Taxpayers are required to pay the right amount of tax on time. To encourage taxpayers to pay on time, late payment penalties are imposed on overdue tax. The late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the initial late payment penalty and the incremental late payment penalty. The initial late payment penalty is also applied in two steps: a one per cent penalty imposed the day after the due date and a four per cent penalt y imposed on the seventh day if the tax remains outstanding. An incremental late payment penalty of one per cent is imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. In addition, UOMI is imposed from day one on the outstanding amount and any initial and incremental late payment penalties. Interest is calculated on a daily basis on the amount of underpaid tax (including late payment penalties) but is not included in the calculation of the late payment penalty, and does not compound. The current rate for the underpayment of tax is 9.21% per annum. In some circumstances late payment penalties are not imposed such as where the taxpayer is under a formal instalment arrangement, the taxpayer is providing information to the Commissioner to consider debt relief, where the unpaid tax is below $100 or in certain circumstances where the underlying tax assessment is being disputed by the taxpayer. In addition there is a grace period for taxpayers who have been compliant for the previous two years. These taxpayers are not charged late payment penalties if the payment is made up quickly. Total debt is approximately $5.15 billion 6 , with penalties and interest representing a significant proportion of the total debt book. Many of these accumulated late payment penalties are written off by Inland Revenue as uncollectible. In past surveys, taxpayers have advised Inland Revenue that their reasons for incurring late payment penalt ies are due to administrative error, short-term and long-term cash-flow problems. The late payment penalty does not effectively encourage all taxpayers to comply. For some taxpayers, late payment penalties can be seen as ineffective if they are imposed on people who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). The first group feel Inland Revenue is penalising them for an honest mistake and will grudgingly pay the penalty. The second cannot pay the initial amount and so will not be able to pay the penalties. The third is unlikely to be motivated by a financial penalty and so other tools would be more effective. The issues with the late payment penalty are its size, blunt application, and imposit ion on groups where it is ineffective as a collection tool. 6 Inland Revenue Annual Report, 2015. 50 Together, the late payment penalties and UOMI mean taxpayers incur a combined rate of approximately 27% in the first year. This combined penalty and interest rate is less in subsequent years as only the monthly incremental late payment penalty is imposed. UOMI rates are based on the Reserve Bank rates and fluctuate depending on the market. In previous years UOMI has been set at over 14% per annum, resulting in a combined penalty and interest rate of over 30% in the first year. This also has a significant impact on the amount of uncollectible penalties that are added to the tax debt book. Under the current penalty and interest rules, within two years (without repayments), penalties and interest compound to more than 50% of the original tax owed. Inland Revenue’s research has shown that for many indebted SME taxpayers, once the component of the penalties and interest reaches this point, they feel overwhelmed by their debt and become disengaged. At this point, imposing any additional late payment penalties becomes counterproductive as their imposit ion may further discourage the taxpayer from complying. Working for Families Tax Credits (WFFTC) shares many income tax administrative and enforcement rules including filing requirements, terminal tax date, and the penalty (i.e. late payment penalty) rules. Therefore, WFFTC recipients face similar issues to taxpayers regarding how quickly penalties and interest accumulate. However, unlike income tax, WFFTC has a different purpose; to financially support families’ day-to-day living costs. Currently, the late payment penalty rules can subject many indebted low income recipients to significant stress and anxiety as they struggle to afford to repay their WFFTC debt (due to overpayments), while watching their debt quickly grow to an unmanageable level. As a consequence much of this debt is written off. New Zealand’s current combined penalty and interest rate is significantly higher than most commercial lending institutions in New Zealand, as well as other OECD countries, including Australia. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. This limitation extends to the scope of the options as well as their design – that is, whether the option could apply to all tax types or just specific tax types such as GST or Working for Families. It is difficult to estimate the behavioural impact any changes to the penalty rules might have on both compliant and non-compliant groups of taxpayers. Any financial penalty that is imposed and consequently paid by the taxpayer is revenue to the government. Due to the difficulty in estimating the behavioural impact of any changes, officials are unable to fully estimate the fiscal cost of any changes in the late payment penalty rules. Inland Revenue is deploying a new IT system (START) which will supersede the legacy system (FIRST) over the course of the next few years. To avoid having to amend both the legacy system and build the new rules into START, any changes to late payment penalties will only apply to taxes as they migrate to START. 51 Options and analysis Options to address the issue are: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty. 3. Remove the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty. 4. Remove all late payment penalties and apply UOMI only. 5. Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances. Option 1 – Retain the status quo The high combined rate leads to increasing debt and high compliance costs for the taxpayer and high administration costs for Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will continue to struggle to constructively engage with indebted taxpayers. The lack of flexibility around the late payment penalty rules will prevent Inland Revenue from being able to effectively support newly indebted taxpayers. Option 2 – Reduce the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty Attempting to have a meaningful incremental late payment penalty will st ill result in a higher than desirable combined penalty and interest rate. For example, based on current UOMI rates, an incremental late payment penalty rate of 0.5% will result in the combined penalty and interest rate of approximately 21% per annum, in the first year. On its own, a reduced incremental late payment penalty is unlikely to provide a significant compliance benefit over the status quo, as taxpayers are unlikely to be further encouraged to comply by anticipating a reduced incremental late payment penalty if they do not comply. In addition, these unpaid incremental late payment penalties will continue to be added to the tax debt book. This option will continue to maintain a financial incentive for indebted taxpayers to enter into instalment arrangements, in order to avoid the imposition of the monthly incremental late payment penalty. Overall, this option, in effect, maintains the current incremental late payment penalty framework, including continuing to penalise taxpayers long after the debt was due, and in most cases imposing an additional financial penalty which is unlikely to encourage the taxpayer to comply. Option 3 – Remove the 1% incremental late payment penalty Only the one-off initial late payment penalty of 1% one day after the due date and 4% after seven days will be imposed. This option results in the combined penalty and interest rate decreasing from approximately 27% per annum, to approximately 15% per annum, in the first year. 52 This revised rate is more in line with unsecured lending from traditional commercial lenders. It ensures there continues to be a financial cost to taxpayers who do not pay on time. In addit ion, this option will enable taxpayers to repay their debt in a more sustainable way, as the debt is not incurring continuous late payment penalties. Currently, indebted taxpayers that enter into instalment arrangements have their future incremental late payment penalties suppressed (not imposed). In effect, this option removes the financial incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement. However, taxpayers would continue to have an incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement before the due date, to avoid the 4% penalty. In addition, the taxpayer continues to receive certainty that Inland Revenue will also adhere to the instalment arrangement and allow the taxpayer to repay the unpaid tax, over time, without taking action to enforce the tax debt. Removing the incremental late payment penalty means indebted taxpayers no longer incur late payment penalties that might have otherwise encouraged some to pay months or years after the due date. However, the reduced combined penalty and interest rate will reduce the growth of the debt and consequently provide more opportunity to all indebted taxpayers to repay their tax debt before it becomes too big to resolve. Option 4 -Remove all late payment penalties and impose UOMI only This option removes all late payment penalties (initial and incremental) and only imposes UOMI on unpaid tax, one day after the due date. This single rate will provide a better understanding to taxpayers of the consequences of not paying on time. As UOMI is compensation to the government for the loss of the use of the money, this option does not contain any financial penalty element notwithstanding some taxpayers’ perception that UOMI is punitive. The financial consequences of non-payment would be significantly lower than under the status quo, even during the time the tax has become initially outstanding. For taxpayers struggling financially, this option will likely encourage further non- compliance. Due to their likely credit risk, the taxpayer’s marginal cost of borrowing is likely to be higher than the UOMI being imposed on tax debt. This would lead to most indebted taxpayers choosing not to pay their tax liability because it is cheaper to owe Inland Revenue than to borrow the money to pay the outstanding tax. This places Inland Revenue at a distinct disadvantage and will likely lead to an increase in Inland Revenue’s tax debt book. This option will also likely erode confidence in the integrity of the tax system as compliant taxpayers will not see non-compliant taxpayers being penalised for failing to pay tax. Option 5 – Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances This option would have Inland Revenue officers exercising discretion to decide whether to impose a late payment penalty. 53 This option would provide Inland Revenue with the legislative flexibility to impose a late payment penalty of any amount, at any time, on any taxpayer it chooses. The financial penalty would be imposed on taxpayers that have consistently demonstrated non-compliant behaviour, rather than taxpayers that have paid late due to genuine error. This option will likely have very high administration costs as Inland Revenue would be required to manually intervene and telephone all taxpayers that have not paid on time to determine the reasons for the late payment and whether a late payment penalty should be imposed. It will be very difficult for Inland Revenue to make this determination with a reasonable level of certainty. This option provides several avenues for indebted taxpayers to successfully avoid incurring a late payment penalty. Some taxpayers may take less care in making their payments on time if they feel that they could successfully argue that the late payment was due to a genuine mistake. Taxpayers may be less concerned about making their payments on time if they feel that they can successfully resist Inland Revenue’s efforts to contact them to discuss the reasons for their late payment. Taxpayers wit h more knowledge of the tax system would be more likely to be successful in not having a late payment penalty imposed. Due to this option requiring Inland Revenue to make highly subjective decisions, inconsistencies may occur. Over time, differences in treatment and other inconsistencies are likely to reduce taxpayers confidence in the integrity of the tax system. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 54 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Partially met Taxpayers in similar circumstances are treated in a similar way. However, for some taxpayers, imposing the financial penalty may be disproportionate to their circumstances and may be viewed as unfair. Once the existing debt is significant, any additional financial penalty becomes ineffective at motivating the taxpayer to actively attempt to comply. It is unfair to repeatedly impose unreasonably high financial penalties for the late payment of tax. Not met Continue to create compliance costs for taxpayers having to pay significant financial penalties in order to repay their tax debt in full. Continue to create compliance costs of stress and anxiety on taxpayers, due to the high growth of their tax debt. Higher administration and enforcement costs for Inland Revenue, to manage and recover tax debt. Not met High growth of penalties leads to many taxpayers becoming insolvent. Their continued non- compliance leads to Inland Revenue taking legal action. As a result other taxpayers become negatively affected. Some taxpayers are incurring significant penalties on their tax debt, only for them to be later written off, leading to uncertainty about how many outstanding late payment penalties are recoverable. The overall portion of financial penalties in the debt book that are unrecoverable will continue to increase. No impact 55 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 2. Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty. Partially met While the incremental late payment penalty rate is reduced, the combined penalty and interest rate may be too high to effectively encourage significantly indebted taxpayers to engage with Inland Revenue. Lacks fairness as Inland Revenue continues to impose a high combined rate, while expecting the taxpayer to be motivated to repay their tax debt. Taxpayers will continue to have a financial incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement. Partially met Taxpayers will continue to incur significant stress and anxiety in attempting to resolve their tax debt, due to the continued imposit ion o f penalties on their tax debt lo ng after it is due. Inland Revenue would likely have a small reduction in its administration and enforcement costs (compared to the status quo), due to the smaller incremental late payment penalties being added to the tax debt book. Not met Unpaid and potentially uncollectible incremental late payment penalties will continue be added to the debt book, though this will be less than the status quo. This option would likely have a negative revenue impact, lower than the recommended option. 3. Remove the 1% incremental late payment penalt y Partially met Maintains fairness between compliant and non-co mpliant taxpayers, as taxpayers will continue to have an incentive to pay their tax liability by the due date or shortly after.

Remove all late payment penalties and impose UOMI only. Not met Unfair for compliant taxpayers as the financial cost of a taxpayer’s non-compliance has been completely removed. There is no penalty imposed on taxpayers that do not pay on time. Not met Reduced compliance impact as taxpayers will have reduced growth in their tax debt. However overall, the compliance impact may increase as indebted taxpayers will have more interaction with Inland Revenue as Inland Revenue make greater attempts to encourage them to pay the tax debt. Likely increase in Inland Revenue’s administration and enforcement costs due to an increase in total tax debt being managed. Not met A UOMI only rate may lead to some compliant taxpayers deciding that it is financial justificat ion to pay other creditors instead of Inland Revenue and thus become non-compliant. The lack of a penalty for non- compliance would likely lead to an erosion of taxpayer confidence in the integrity of the tax system, as compliant taxpayers will perceive that non-compliant taxpayers are not being penalised. This option would have a higher cost than the recommended option. This makes this option less viable for the government. 5. Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances Not met Due to the level of subjectivity in the decision making process, it is highly unlikely Inland Revenue will be able to ensure consistency in Not met Taxpayers will incur higher compliance costs with increased contact with Inland Revenue to discuss Not met This option rewards taxpayers that successfully evade Inland Revenue.

These groups were generally supportive of the preferred options, as the recommended changes will result in a late payment penalty that is more fairly set and imposed. Recommendations Officials recommend option 3 - remove the 1% incremental late payment penalty. This will reduce the combined penalty and interest rate to a more sustainable level and over time will reduce the amount of unrecoverable late payment penalties in the debt book. This option continues to incentivise taxpayers to pay on the due date by continuing with the initial late payment penalty. This will also ensure that compliant taxpayers will continue to see non- compliant taxpayers being penalised for failing to pay on time. This option does remove the financial incentive for indebted taxpayers to enter into an instalment arrangement. However, the other significant benefit of an instalment arrangement remains; the certainty that while the debt is being repaid under the instalment arrangement Inland Revenue will not take action to enforce the it. Once fully implemented option 3 will result in the incremental late payment penalty no longer being imposed on 65,000 taxpayers with income tax debt, 67,000 taxpayers with GST tax debt, and 23,000 families with Working for Families Tax Credit debt. 59 APPENDIX D – MAKING MARKETS WORK BETTER THROUGH TAX TRANSPARENCY Status quo and problem definition Inland Revenue has extensive information collection powers. Revenue authorities tend to be granted wide powers to help them make sure all taxpayers comply with their tax obligations. As a counterbalance, these powers generally come with requirements on the revenue authority of tax secrecy. Tax secrecy has traditionally been considered necessary for promoting taxpayer compliance. Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy laws are broad, 7 covering all matters relating to legislation administered by Inland Revenue. Communication of these matters is not normally permitted other than for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation. Over time exceptions have been made to this strict rule, the majority of which involve cross- government information sharing. These exceptions reflect the weighing of principles of tax secrecy against the need to support economic efficiency and growth, and wider government outcomes. There are at least two areas where Inland Revenue does not currently have the power to share tax secret information, and where the sharing of this information would support economic efficiency. Specifically, there are opportunities to better inform and protect New Zealand’s business community from risks associated with its non-compliant participants. Significant tax debt Information about tax debt is tax secret. Inland Revenue does not disclose information about a taxpayer’s tax debt to others, except where a claim is lodged in court for recovery of the debt. However, there is arguably little difference between a tax debt and any other debt a taxpayer may have, especially in the context of risk posed to an indebted business’s creditors. While unpaid tax is owed to the Crown as opposed to another business, it remains a debt with a corresponding repayment obligation on the non-compliant taxpayer and will attract interest (and potentially penalties) so long as it remains outstanding. Mechanisms exist to facilitate creditors’ and potential creditors’ understanding of a business’s creditworthiness in relation to commercial debt. The lack of visibility of tax debt can have a significant impact on other businesses that have made credit decisions without full information, especially if the business with tax debt collapses and these other businesses are unsecured creditors. In addition to an information problem, the status quo raises concerns for the integrity of the tax system. Some taxpayers who are failing to resolve debt with Inland Revenue are not currently motivated to comply with their obligations despite the debt’s accumulation of interest and penalties. While these taxpayers are able to ignore significant tax debt by virtue of it being iso lated fro m their regular commercial dealings, non-compliant businesses that 7 Section 81, Tax Administration Act 1994 60 remain in business and fail to address their debt are able to unfairly compete against those who pay on time and are compliant with their tax obligations. Enforcement of wider business obligations In the course of undertaking its core duties, Inland Revenue obtains and holds information about businesses’ (and their directors’) non-compliance with non-tax legal obligations. Inland Revenue research has shown that those that are non-co mpliant with their obligations under the law in one area are likely to be non-compliant in other areas. 8 Businesses that continue to defy their obligations without detection or sanction pose significant risks to other businesses and to New Zealand’s reputation as a safe and transparent country in which to invest and do business. These businesses further represent a risk to the revenue and to the integrity of the tax system, because they are more likely to be non-compliant with their tax obligations and the tax obligations they are required to fulfil on behalf of employees. With the exception of Inland Revenue’s ability to share information with New Zealand Police in relation to serious criminal offences, Inland Revenue cannot usually share information about businesses’ and directors’ non-tax illegal conduct with agencies that enforce the relevant laws. This means that, without the sharing of information: • some cases of illegal conduct are being committed and discovered (or partially discovered) by Inland Revenue, but are never brought to the attention of the relevant enforcement agency; and • some cases of illegal conduct that are being investigated or prosecuted by another agency are not being handled as efficiently as they would be if that agency was able to request information already held by Inland Revenue. If Inland Revenue was able to share information, the likelihood of non-compliant businesses being charged or prosecuted would increase and the associated harm reduce. Reducing harm caused to compliant businesses would ultimately support greater economic efficiency by lowering the risks and costs associated with being in business in New Zealand. More efficient enforcement of wider business obligations would also strengthen the integrity of the tax system by ensuring businesses and directors, who are non-compliant in multiple areas including tax obligations, are comprehensively held to account. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. The analysis that follows is also constrained by limits of measuring the scope of the issue. It is not possible to accurately measure the number of businesses and members of the public affected by non-compliant taxpayers that are able to conceal their significant tax debt or illegal activity. Officials’ analysis relies on general assumptions including: 8 Habitual Non Complier Tier 2 Analysis, Inland Revenue. 61 • Taxpayers in significant tax debt are likely to have a number of credit arrangements with a number of businesses; and some of these businesses will be unsecured creditors who are vulnerable in the event of the taxpayer’s business collapsing. • Businesses (and their directors and management) behaving illegally are likely to pose a risk to a large number of other parties including their shareholders, creditors, and emplo yees. Options Officials have identified the following options: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Share significant tax debt informat ion with credit reporting agencies. 3. Share significant tax debt informat ion with the general public. 4. Share information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies. 5. Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations. Options 2 and 3 are not mutually exclusive with measures 4 or 5. Option 1 – Status quo Tax secrecy laws would remain as they are and Inland Revenue would be unable to provide any information to credit reporting agencies. Businesses would continue to enter into arrangements with other parties with no visibility of the other party’s tax debt. This would expose them to risk if they were extending credit to a business that was heavily indebted to Inland Revenue. Option 2 - Share information on significant tax debt with credit reporting agencies Tax secrecy laws could be amended to permit the disclosure of certain tax debt information to credit reporting agencies, for use in credit ratings. This option would provide members of the business community who are seeking credit information on a taxpayer with a more complete understanding of that taxpayer’s creditworthiness. To target the option toward tax debt that poses the most risk to other businesses, officials recommend this disclosure be limited to significant income tax and GST debt, and unpaid PAYE, KiwiSaver, student loan and child support deductions. 9 The scope of “significant” debt would be the subject of various legislative criteria. The criteria would be designed to ensure credit reporting was only an option when disclosure would be proportionate given the level of risk accompanying the debt. The detail of the 9 Note, this proposal includes employer debt relating to employee deductions employers have failed to remit to Inland Revenue; it is not proposed that social policy debt be reported to credit agencies. 62 criteria would likely take into account factors including age and size of debt and the likelihood of it being repaid. It is recommended that in all cases Inland Revenue should be required to have attempted to resolve the debt prior to disclosure, and that disclosure not be permitted if debt is under an instalment arrangement or is in dispute. Finally, prior to information being disclo sed it is recommended that the affected taxpayer is given thirty days’ notice, and that this notice is served on the taxpayer personally to ensure its effectiveness. This option would require rigorous safeguards to ensure the accuracy and security of information being disclosed to credit reporting agencies. One advantage of this option is that credit reporting agencies already have robust processes in place as they are already in the business of dealing with debt information on a commercial scale. Inland Revenue would need to establish its own corresponding processes. One limitation attached to this option is that within the time available, officials have been unable to comprehensively work through privacy issues around credit reporting significant tax debt of individuals. Specifically, more work is required to determine the consistency of this proposal with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004, which contains obligations for credit reporting agencies’ use of individual information. Therefore this option would only initially be available for significant tax debt attached to non-individual taxpayers. Despite this limitation, officials believe the option remains well targeted to the policy problem. While individuals are capable of developing significant business tax debt and causing harm to other businesses, a large proportion of the significant debt informat ion problem stems fro m non-individual taxpayers. Officials continue to work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to better understand the issues around credit reporting individuals’ significant tax debt. Option 3 - Share information on significant tax debt with the general public This option could make use of similar criteria as described for option 2, with the difference being that debt information would eventually be published rather than used in determining credit ratings. The information would be available for general access, for example using a searchable website. This option would allow a broader range of people to gain information than would be the case under option 2. Disclosure to a wider range of people comes with potential compliance benefits through strongly incentivising the repayment of the debt. On the other hand, the option is not as well targeted to the policy problem as option 2, as many people without a legitimate interest in a taxpayer’s creditworthiness, and to whom the taxpayer’s debt does not represent a risk, would have access to the information. The option would also lack some of the robust safeguards that accompany the use of credit reporting agencies. This option is likely to expose taxpayers to an inappropriate level of reputational risk without much further benefit to market efficiency. Option 4 - Share serious offences information with the registrar of companies This option would involve a new exception to tax secrecy rules to allow Inland Revenue to share information with the Registrar of Companies in relation to certain serious offences 63 (meaning offences with a maximum sentence of imprisonment of 5 years or more) under the Companies Act 1993. These offences relate to serious harmful conduct by company directors and management. Inland Revenue would be able to share information with the Registrar, either proactively or in response to a request, when: • there is reasonable suspicion (on the part of the initiating agency) that a serious offence has been, is being, or will be committed; • Inland Revenue considers the information being shared will prevent, detect, or provide evidence of, a serious offence that has been, is being, or will be committed; and • Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to communicate it, and communication is in the public interest. This option would be developed to closely resemble Inland Revenue’s current ability to share information with New Zealand Police in relation to serious crime. Due to the serious nature of the offences involved, it is not expected there will be a large number of shares taking place. Option 5 - Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations Exceptions to tax secrecy legislation could be developed to enable Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies for the enforcement of business obligations under various pieces of legislation. For example, Inland Revenue could share information generally to ensure other agencies’ registry records match information held by Inland Revenue, or Inland Revenue could share information in relation to lower level offences. Due to Inland Revenue’s wide information gathering powers it is very likely that it holds much of this information and that it would be useful to other agencies. That being said, sharing tax secret information for the purpose of aiding other agencies’ enforcement activity will often not be an appropriate use of taxpayers’ information or Inland Revenue’s resources, and exceptions to tax secrecy legislation should only be developed where they can be strongly justified. Sharing information below the serious offence threshold is likely to be an inappropriate use of the information and of Inland Revenue’s resources. It should be noted that there are non-criminal provisions, under the Companies Act and other legislation, that carry serious sanctions or serve an essential policy purpose despite not being serious criminal offences. There may be justification for including such provisions alongside serious criminal offences in future information sharing arrangements. For example, in developing these options officials considered the sharing of information in relation to two further Companies Act provisions: • The requirement for a company to have a director based in New Zealand, which is intended to prevent the abuse of shell companies; and 64 • The Registrar of Companies’ power to prohibit a director of a failed company from being a director of, or taking part in the management of, another company for up to ten years. Ultimately these provisions have not been included in the recommended option because expanding information sharing beyond a serious criminal offence standard requires further analysis and this analysis could not be completed in the available time. Options not considered Share serious offences information with a range of agencies There are a number of enforcement agencies other than New Zealand Police and the Companies Office that investigate and prosecute serious offences, some involving business and director conduct. Information sharing with these agencies may also have the potential to improve market efficiency. Given the limited time available to advance policy options for this package, officials have prioritised work on information sharing with the Registrar of Companies for serious director offences. The nature of these offences means this particular sharing proposal has strong potential to better protect compliant participants in the business community. Inland Revenue is also likely to have information that is relevant to the investigation and prosecution of these offences. The Government discussion document Making tax simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act discusses the future of cross government information sharing. The Government is currently considering how to better use agencies’ information, and in particular how to use information more effectively to combat organised crime. The document seeks feedback on the extent to which Inland Revenue should increase information sharing with other government agencies. This feedback will inform future decisions on extending information sharing for other serious offences. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 65 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue impact 1.

Potentially posit ive Compliant businesses will be less subject to harm from habitually non-compliant businesses and directors. 67 Consultation Officials have consulted with a range of private and public sector stakeholders including the Corporate Taxpayers Group, credit reporting agencies, large accounting firms, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). Those consulted were broadly supportive of the policy intent underlying the options of credit reporting of significant tax debt and sharing information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies. The majority of stakeholders consulted stressed that, given the potential consequences attached to sharing taxpayers’ information for these purposes; there should be high thresholds and sensible criteria for disclosure. Specifically regarding the option of credit reporting of significant tax debt, as stated above the OPC has assisted officials’ understanding of issues surrounding credit reporting of individuals’ information and officials will continue to work through these issues with OPC. Specifically regarding options for information sharing with enforcement agencies, several stakeholders expressed a desire for an overarching framework for cross-Government information sharing of tax secret information. These stakeholders were supportive of sharing in relation to serious criminal offences, including company director offences, but were concerned that information sharing policy was being developed on an ad hoc basis. These comments have shaped officials’ analysis around not including non-criminal Companies Act offences alongside serious director offences in option 2 without further work. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – share significant tax debt information with credit reporting agencies. Although this option would, at least initially, be limited to disclosure of non- individuals’ information it would help to remedy the current information problem that exists for businesses that require information on other businesses’ creditworthiness. The reporting of certain tax debts would allow these businesses to make more optimal lending decisions and leave them less vulnerable to the effects of other businesses collapsing with significant tax debt. The use of credit reporting agencies for the disclosure of this information would target the policy response to the problem and avoid unjustified disclosure of information. Officials also recommend option 4 – share serious offence information with the Registrar of Companies. This option would lead to more efficient enforcement of serious director offences by the Registrar and reduce harm to the business community and wider public. The detection of this offending and sanction of seriously non-compliant directors would also benefit the tax administration system because it is likely that some of these directors are also not complying with their tax obligations. As stated above, officials have prioritised sharing with the Registrar of Companies because improved enforcement of serious offences under the Companies Act would be especially beneficial for improving market efficiency. Officials recommend further work around the development of a clear framework for this sharing to occur. 68 APPENDIX E – SUPPLEMENTARY SIMPLIFICATION MEASURES Research shows that tax compliance costs are relatively high for small businesses. However, measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This section outlines supporting simplification measures that will reduce the amount of paperwork required by businesses, and make it easier to manage their tax affairs without significantly affecting the amount of revenue collected by the government. The measures include simplified rules for businesses to calculate FBT, account for vehicles and premises, and deduct employee remuneration. They also include some threshold adjustments to enable more small businesses access to simplified rules for filing and correcting errors. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. 1 – Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Status quo and problem definition Small business owners often use their personal vehicles and homes for both business and private purposes. Currently they need to allocate their expenses between private and business use. The private use percentage might also vary between different items of expenditure. Because there are numerous expenses for these items, allocating these between business and personal use can create large compliance obligations compared to the amount of tax at stake. The following options (other than the status quo) have been considered for addressing this issue. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Options and analysis The options to address this issue are: Option 1 – retain the status quo Option 2 – optional single rate method This method would be optional and extend and modify the current per kilometre option for calculating business use deductions so it could be used regardless of kilometres travelled (the current rules only allow the method to be used if business use is less than 5,000 km). Under this option: • Taxpayers would deduct a fixed amount per kilometre travelled for business purposes based on rates published by Inland Revenue. This would be instead of deducting actual costs. 69 • The rates would be set by reference to industry figures, and based on the average per kilometre cost for the average vehicle. The rates would also assume a fixed amount of private use in respect of the fixed cost element, so no apportionment between actual business and private use would be required • The rate would be divided into 2 tiers. The first tier would provide for the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and per kilometre costs. The second tier would provide for the recovery of the per kilometre costs only. • Taxpayers would keep a logbook for a 3 month representative test period to determine the vehicle’s business kilometres as a proportion of the total distance travelled. Taxpayers could then multiply that fraction by the total distance travelled each year to give the business kilometres. Taxpayers would also be able to choose the current method of recording and using their actual business kilometres for an income year. Option 3 – Compulsory single rate method This option is the same as option 2, except the method would be compulsory. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 70 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Met Completely fair, as the business proportion of actual expenses is deductible. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the number of expenses and the small amount of tax. Not currently time-consuming to administer. Met The actual calculation can be complicated. No impact 2. Optional single rate for Vehicles Met Generally fair, as the rate will be approximately accurate for most vehicles and owners of more expensive vehicles can elect to deduct based on their actual expenses. However owners of older cars may be able to claim greater deductions than their actual expenditure. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. However some taxpayers may elect to calculate their deductions under both this method and the other currently available methods so they can claim the greater amount. This would increase the tax calculations for such taxpayers. The measure will impact sole traders who use their vehicle for both business and personal purposes. There are up to 3,500 such taxpayers. Met The actual calculation is easier, rates will be broadly accurate for most taxpayers, and there is a significant cost floor for vehicle use. Small cost Taxpayers with older vehicles may be able to deduct more than their actual expenditure, while taxpayers with newer or more expensive vehicles can elect not to use the method. The estimated fiscal cost for this option is $700,000 per year. 71 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3.Compulso ry single rate for vehicles Not met The method will be unfair for taxpayers with newer or more expensive vehicles, as the variability of vehicle costs (especially depreciation) means that an average rate could be significantly less than their actual expenses. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. The measure will impact the same number of taxpayers as option 2, although taxpayers will not be able to opt out of it. Met The calculation is easier than the status quo. There should not be any fiscal cost or savings, as the rates will be set based on the average vehicle expenditure. No impact There should not be any fiscal cost or savings, as the rates will be set based on the average vehicle expenditure. 72 Recommendations Officials recommend that option 2 be adopted – optional single rate for vehicles. While an optional method has some disadvantages in terms of efficiency and sustainability, officials consider the variance in the actual costs of car ownership is too wide for a compulsory single rate to be acceptably fair. Owners of newer and more expensive cars may see a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. A more accurate compulsory method could be developed, but this would erode the compliance cost benefits. 2 – Simplified calculation of deductions for business use of premises. Options and analysis Options to address this issue are: Option 1 – Retain the status quo Option 2 – Optional single rate method Under this option, the deduction for business use of premises would be calculated by multiplying the number of square metres of the premises used primarily for business purposes by a single rate. A different rate would apply depending on whether the taxpayer owned or rented their premises. Taxpayers would also claim a deduction for their actual rates, mortgage interest or rental costs, based on the percentage of the premises used primarily for business purposes. This method would be optional. Option 3 Compulsory single rate method This option is the same as option 2, except the method would be compulsory. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 73 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo for premises Met The business proportion of actual expenses is deductible. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the number of expenses and the small amount of tax. Met Generally sustainable. However the actual calculation can be complicated. No impact 2. Optional single rate for premises Met The rate should be fairly accurate and taxpayers will still have the option to deduct based on actual expenses. Some taxpayers may be able to claim greater deductions than their actual expenditure. This is not expected to be significant however, due to the small variance in utility charges. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. However some taxpayers may elect to calculate their deductions under both this method and the actual cost method so they can claim the greater amount. This would increase the tax calculations for such taxpayers. The measure will impact sole traders who use their premises for both business and personal purposes. There may be up to 3,500 such taxpayers. Met The actual calculation is easier. Small cost Taxpayers could elect to use this method only if it increased their deductions compared with the actual cost method. There is insufficient data to estimate this cost, however it is expected to be fiscally immaterial due to the small variance in utility charges. 3. Compulsor y Single rate for premises Met The rate for utilities etc should be fairly accurate across taxpayers and the more Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation.

Some taxpayers may be entitled to slightly greater or lesser deductions than their actual expenditure however. taxpayers as option 2, although taxpayers will not be able to opt out of it. housing expenditure. 75 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 for premises. While the method should produce a fairly accurate measure for most taxpayers, some taxpayers will be entitled to smaller deductions under the method than their actual costs. Such taxpayers may consequently regard a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely though that taxpayers would do this every year as premises expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand.. CAANZ submitted that the premises single rate method should be optional. CAANZ also suggested consideration be given to a flat deduction for dual use premises. However Officials consider that a flat deduction would be too inaccurate, given that it would not be proportionate to the size of the premises used for business purposes. Accordingly this suggestion was not included in the options above. 3 – Increase threshold for taxpayer self-corrections of minor errors Status quo and problem definition If a taxpayer makes a minor error in their tax return with a tax effect of less than $500, they can self-correct the error in their next tax return. 10 However, if the error results in more than a $500 tax difference, the taxpayer must request the Commissioner to correct the error. This imposes compliance costs on the taxpayer in having to apply to the Commissioner for a small adjustment. It also imposes administration costs on Inland Revenue in having to manage these low value items. These costs can be high compared with the amount of tax at stake. Options and analysis Options for addressing the issue are to retain the status quo, to increase the self-adjust ment threshold to $1,000, to increase the threshold to $2,000, or set the threshold as a percentage of taxpayer tax or turnover. The option to increase the threshold to $1000 represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $3,571 for a company, $3,030 for an individual and $7,667 for GST. The option to increase the self-adjustment threshold to $2000 represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $7,142 for a company, $6,060 for an individual and $15,333 for GST. 10 Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 76 The option to set the self-correction threshold as a percentage of the taxpayer’s tax or turnover would mean a corporate taxpayer with a $50 million tax liability could make a $1 million adjustment if the threshold for self-correction was set at 2% of tax. This represents $3.57 million of income or $7.667 million for GST. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 77 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Generally fair. Not met Inefficient, as taxpayers must apply to Inland Revenue to self-correct small errors. Met No impact 2. Increase threshold to $1,000 Met Met More efficient, as taxpayers can self-correct larger errors. The measure will affect all taxpayers who make low value minor errors. Met Although less Inland Revenue oversight of error correction slightly increases the potential for abuse. No impact 3. Increase threshold to $2,000 Met Met As above, except a greater efficiency increase and impact with the greater threshold. Partially met As above, although the impact on sustainability increases with the greater threshold. No impact 4. Revenue percentage threshold Not met Unfair as large taxpayers will be able to self-correct larger errors, but arguably fair given the relative significance of the error to the business. Met As above. Partially met As above, except there could be a significant impact on sustainability for large taxpayers, as they could make significant tax adjustments without Inland Revenue oversight. Measure may be abused There might be an impact if large taxpayers abuse the measure to defer income; however this is not possible to estimate. 78 Consultation We consulted on the proposal with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. CAANZ and Business New Zealand both supported an increase to the threshold, but considered it needed to be greater to benefit larger business. Corporate Taxpayer Group suggested setting the threshold as a percentage of tax or turnover while CAANZ suggested tiered thresholds based on turnover. Corporate Taxpayer Group also suggested including a requirement to notify Inland Revenue of any corrections made. Officials considered this option (included as option 4 in the table on the previous page), but do not recommend it. This is because it would have a significant impact on sustainability for large taxpayers, as they could make significant tax adjustments without Inland Revenue agreement. Recommendations Officials recommend Option 2, as it provides the best balance between meeting the objectives of fairness and equity, efficiency of compliance and administration, sustainability of the tax system and revenue. 4 – Remove the requirement to renew RWT exemption certificates annually Status quo and problem definition Currently some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) must renew the certificate annually. 11 Taxpayers have argued that this is creating relatively large compliance costs for those who are required to renew for relatively little value. It is also creating an administrative burden for Inland Revenue, as all the annual exemption certificates must be renewed at the same time each year. Options and analysis The following two options, plus the status quo, have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to retain the status quo. Option 2 – Issue certificate for an unlimited period This option would apply for all the available grounds of exemption, except for the taxpayer income estimation option. Inland Revenue would have the discretion to issue exemption certificates for a shorter period in exceptional circumstances. 11 Annual renewal is currently required by Inland Revenue if the applicant is applying for a RWT exemption certificate on the grounds that it has tax losses, a refund of over $500 RWT or estimated annual gross income of over $2 million. Applications on other grounds (such as annual gross income over $2 million in the prior year) do not require annual renewal. 79 There is an integrity concern that a taxpayer might no longer be eligible for an RWT certificate, but because they are not required to renew this is not known to Inland Revenue. We consider that this can be adequately mitigated by including a simple “tick the box” declaration on a taxpayer’s tax return. This would require the taxpayer to confirm that they are still eligible to hold their exemption certificate on the basis on which it was granted. Taxpayers will still be required to surrender their exemption certificates when they fail to meet the basis for eligibility on which they were granted. Inland Revenue will also retain its ability to cancel an exemption certificate. Option 3 – Issue certificate for a period greater than a year This option would ensure that taxpayers did not indefinitely retain exemption certificates they were no longer entitled to. However, a large number of exemption certificates are currently issued for an unlimited period (e.g. to charities, banks and entities with annual gross inco me over $2 million) and this option would not change this practice. Also a fixed period would still impose a level of compliance obligation in having to periodically reapply for the certificate. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 80 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Met Not met Inefficient, as annual applications impose compliance costs on taxpayers and administration costs on Inland Revenue. Met No impact 2. Issue certificate for an unlimited period Met Met More efficient, as fewer taxpayers will be required to apply annually. The measure will affect taxpayers who are required to file annually, other than those applying under the income estimation method. There are currently less than 500 such taxpayers. Met Any integrity concerns can be addressed by requiring taxpayers to indicate in their annual returns whether they are still eligible to hold their certificates. No impact 3. Issue certificate for fixed periods longer than a year Met Partially met More efficient than option 1 but less efficient than option 2, as renewing certificates will impose compliance costs on taxpayers and administration costs on Inland Revenue. Met No impact 81 Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. The Corporate Taxpayer Group supported option 2, and recommended it be expanded to other types of exemption certificate (e.g. non-resident contractors withholding tax). CAANZ also supported option 2 in conjunction with the “tick the box” declaration. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objectives and improves efficiency with no significant impact on fairness or sustainability of the tax system. 5 – Increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT Status quo and problem definition Most businesses are required to calculate and return fringe benefit tax (FBT) on a quarterly basis. However businesses that have combined pay as you earn (PAYE) and emplo yer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis. 12 As a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold. Consequently the business will be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs which are still significant relative to the size of the business. Options and analysis Three options have been considered for addressing this issue, namely; retain the status quo, or to increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT or from $500,000 to $2 million of PAYE/ESCT. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 12 Sections RD 60 and RD 61 of the Income Tax Act 2007 82 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Not met Inefficient, as quarterly filing imposes a significant compliance cost compared with the amount of FBT. Met No impact 2. Increase threshold to $1 million No impact on fairness Met More efficient, as only annual filing is required. This will affect 1,500 taxpayers. Met The same amount of FBT will be payable. However the payment of FBT will be a deferral as it will be payable in a lump sum rather than 4 quarterly instalments. Small fiscal cost The fiscal cost of this for close companies is estimated to be $0.5 million over four years. Other taxpayers will still pay their FBT in the same fiscal year. 3. Increase threshold to $2 million No impact on fairness Met More efficient, as only annual filing is required. This will affect 2,100 taxpayers. Met Same as option 2. Small fiscal cost, greater than option 2. 83 Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. They did not have any comments. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objective without a significant fiscal cost. Officials do not recommend option 3, as officials consider a business with combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of over $1 million is sufficiently large to be subject to the standard quarterly filing requirement. 6 – Modify the 63 day rule on employee remuneration Status quo and problem definition There is a special deduction and timing rule for the deferred payment of employee remuneration. Currently, in order to comply with this deferred payment rule, taxpayers need to work out what employee remuneration has been paid during the 63 day period that relates to the previous income year. This creates an additional compliance burden for taxpayers because they need to track payments accrued at year end and paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. Options and analysis The following options have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to retain the status quo. Option 2 – Make the 63 day deferred payment rule optional If taxpayers did not want to apply the deferred payment rule, then they would deduct an amount for all employee remuneration on an “incurred and paid in an income year” basis. This would mean that taxpayers would not need to track employment remuneration payments made within 63 days of the end of the income year and could use the accruals in their financial accounts as a basis for working out the amount of their deduction for emplo yee remunerat ion. Option 3 – Taxpayers choose which employee remuneration is subject to the 63 day rule Taxpayers could choose which types of employee remuneration are subject to the 63 day rule and which types are subject to the ordinary incurred and paid test. Types of employee remuneration include salary and wages, holiday pay and bonus payments. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 84 Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table below. Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Existing rule applies to all taxpayers. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the need to track employee payments paid within 63 days of end of income year. Met The rule is well-established. However actual calculation can be time-consuming particularly for large emplo yers. No impact 2. Optional 63 day rule Met Taxpayers will choose whether to apply the existing deferred payment rule or not. Taxpayers will weigh up increased deductions under the existing rule against the compliance costs associated with the existing rule. Met More efficient as taxpayers will have a choice whether to continue applying the existing rule or use the information in their financial accounts. Administratively Inland Revenue will not monitor what option taxpayers elect. Met Taxpayers wanting to continue with the existing rule will not be affected and those not wanting to do the calculation required under the existing rule can apply the simpler rule. Small upfront gain No change to overall amount of deduction over time. 3. Optional 63 day rule for different classes of employee remunerat ion Met Taxpayers will choose whether to apply the existing deferred payment rule to different classes of employee remuneration. Taxpayers will weigh up the benefit of an increased deduction under the existing rule against the compliance costs associated with the existing rule. Partly met Taxpayers will have a choice whether to continue applying the existing rule or use the information in their financial accounts for different types of employee remuneration. Administratively Inland Revenue will not monitor what option taxpayers elect. Met Same reasons as above, except that taxpayers will be using different timing rules and deductibility for the same type of expenditure. Small upfront gain No change to overall amount of deduction over time. 85 Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. CAANZ were supportive of the proposal whilst the Corporate Taxpayer Group suggested that the 63-day period should be increased to 90 days. A change to the existing 63-day period has not been considered as part of this proposal because the proposal is a simplification measure. Increasing the day period to 90 days whilst it may increase the deduction amount, does not simplify the calculation. Recommendations Officials recommend adopting option 2 – optional 63 day rule. This option will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving the efficiency by providing taxpayers with a choice. This option also has no disadvantages in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system because the same rule is being applied to all types of employee remuneration rather different rules for different types of employee remuneration as proposed under option 3. 7 – Simplification of fringe benefit calculation for close companies Status quo and problem definition Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT for that benefit, subject to certain exemptions. Sole traders and partners in a partnership who use a motor vehicle in a similar way are not required to register and pay FBT. Instead these taxpayers apportion their motor vehicle expenditure between the business and private use using special motor vehicle expenditure rules. These differences in treatment for what is essentially the same benefit (i.e. the private use of a motor vehicle) arise because of the different entities involved. Options and analysis The following options have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to maintain the status quo. Option 2 – Use motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT This option will allow close companies who pay their FBT on an income year basis to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT. These companies could choose not to pay FBT for a motor vehicle being available for private use for shareholder-emplo yees. Instead they would measure the business and private use of the motor vehicle and then make an adjustment to the amount of motor vehicle expenditure deducted. The option is available where the only benefit provided is 1 or 2 motor vehicles for private use to shareholder- emplo yees. 86 Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table below. Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Not met Existing rule treats close companies like other companies who provide benefits to their employees. However close companies are often similar to sole traders and partnerships that use different rules. Not met Inefficient to comply with due to having to register and pay FBT when close companies provide sole benefit to their shareholder- emplo yees. Not met Generally sustainable as the existing rule treats close companies like other companies that provide fringe benefits. However close companies can structure motor vehicle arrangements to minimise or avoid FBT liability. No impact 2. Option for close companies to use motor vehicle expenditure rules Met Provides an option to enable close companies to be treated the same way as a sole trader when accounting for the use of a motor vehicle. Met More efficient as close companies will have a choice whether to register for and pay FBT or use the motor vehicle expenditure rules. Met Generally sustainable as provides a choice for close companies as to how they account for the private use of a motor vehicle by their shareholder- emplo yees. Small fiscal cost Attributable to a reduction in FBT paid over time. 87 Consultation Limited consultation with a small number of tax advisers indicates that option 2 would be well-received and would assist with addressing the perceived mismatch in treatment between a sole trader using a motor vehicle for private use and a shareholder-employee in a close company using a vehicle for private use. It was also suggested that this option would increase compliance as it will be viewed as a simpler basis for calculating the private use of the motor vehicle. Recommendations Officials recommend adopting option 2 – option for close companies to use motor vehicle expenditure rules. This option will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving compliance overall. This option also has no major disadvantage in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system. 88

It provides an analysis of options to address concerns that New Zealand foreign trusts may be vulnerable to misuse for avoidance or evasion of foreign tax, or for money laundering and other criminal purposes. The analysis in this RIS was informed by the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Inquiry) which undertook an extensive independent review of the policy and operation of the foreign trust rules. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a RIS for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. To ensure that amendments recommended by the Inquiry and accepted by the Government could be implemented in line with the application time frames recommended by the Inquiry, and to provide for the amendments to be considered by select committee, this RIS was prepared under time constraints. We have consulted with other relevant government agencies, but not more widely, on the proposals. However, it is noted that as part of its review, the Inquiry invited submissions from the public and received 23 submissions. The policy option recommended would impose additional costs on New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts. However it is considered that as they will reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts, these additional costs are justified. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for business to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Car mel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 5 July 2016 1 1 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 3 of 160 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Policy and law concerning the taxation of trusts 1. New Zealand tax law distinguishes between different types of trusts. Foreign trusts are trusts with no New Zealand resident settlor (the person who settles assets on the trust) 2. New Zealand’s rules for taxing trusts were introduced in 1988, as part of a wider package of international tax reforms. Most countries tax trusts on the basis of the residence of the trustee (which was New Zealand’s previous approach). However, from 1988, New Zealand’s rules for the taxation of trusts have been based on the residence of the settlor, not the residence of the trustees. That is, New Zealand taxes a trust on its worldwide income if the settlor is a New Zealand resident – regardless of the residence of the trustees. 3. The general idea behind this approach is that even though the trustees have legal ownership of the assets, the settlor is really the economic “power behind the throne” because they set up the trust by transferring the assets to the trust and appointing the trustees. Taxatio n based on the settlor’s residence makes it difficult for New Zealand residents to avoid tax by holding their assets through overseas trustees. 4. From this starting point, it naturally follows that a trust with a foreign settlor is a foreign trust even when the trustees are resident in New Zealand. A foreign trust that derives foreign sourced income will not be taxed in New Zealand on that income (assuming no New Zealand resident beneficiaries). 5. There is now a foreign trust industry in New Zealand as a result of non-resident settlors being able to accumulate assets and income in a foreign trust with no New Zealand tax. New Zealand advisors (and their overseas agents) help foreigners establish and manage foreign trusts for a fee. Foreign trusts with New Zealand trustees are marketed on the basis of New Zealand’s settlor-based tax rules, and stable regulatory environment based on common law. Current tax disclosure and record-keeping requirements 6. Since 2006, foreign trusts which have a New Zealand resident trustee have been required by the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to disclose certain information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue upon establishment. There is currently no formal registration process or register for foreign trusts. 7. The information that is required to be disclosed upon establishment is the name or identifying particulars of the foreign trust, the name of a New Zealand trustee, and whether there is an Australian settlor. 8. New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts are also required to keep certain records in relation to the foreign trust, including the trust deed, and (if they are known) the names and addresses of settlors who make a settlement on the trust and beneficiaries who receive a distribut ion. 9. These records must be provided to Inland Revenue on request. If the information provided upon initial disclosure has changed, the New Zealand resident trustee of a foreig n trusts must update the information, but annual filing wit h Inland Revenue is not otherwise required. 2 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 4 of 160 Sanctions for non-compliance 10. Under current law, an intentional breach of a requirement to supply information to Inland Revenue can result in a fine of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. 11. As noted above, foreign trusts are not taxable in New Zealand if they earn no New Zealand sourced income. However, the current rules provide that if a foreign trust does not have a qualifying resident foreign trustee for an income year and information requested by Inland Revenue is not provided, then if a conviction occurs the foreign trust will be subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. A foreign trust will have a qualifying resident foreign trustee if one of its trustees is a member of a specified professional body (such as the New Zealand Law Society or Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). 12. This means that where a trustee of a foreign trust is convicted of intentionally not providing information to Inland Revenue in relation to that foreign trust, the foreign trust will not be subject to New Zealand tax as long as one of its trustees is a New Zealand lawyer or chartered accountant. Audit activity and information sharing 13. Inland Revenue currently performs some audit activity in relation to foreign trusts. A key reason for these audits is to ensure that the trusts do not in fact have New Zealand settlors (as if they do have a New Zealand settlor the trust is taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income), and that the record-keeping requirements of the TAA are complied with. 14. Where Inland Revenue finds information that is of interest to other authorities (overseas tax authorities or domestic law enforcement agencies) in the course of these audits, Inland Revenue will pass this information on where authorised. 15. Inland Revenue shares information about foreign trusts with overseas tax authorities with whom New Zealand has a treaty which has tax information exchange provisions. This information is shared upon request from the overseas tax authority or where Inland Revenue considers that the information may be of interest to that tax authority. Where the settlor of a foreign trust is Australian, Inland Revenue provides this information automatically to the Australian Taxation Office. 16. The circumstances in which Inland Revenue shares information about foreign trusts with domestic law enforcement agencies are relatively limited (for example, information can be shared if it concerns individuals or if it is requested by Police and it relates to serious crime). Problem definition and recent developments 17. Concerns have been raised that the existing disclosure and record-keeping requirements in relation to foreign trusts are insufficient – particularly in light of expanding obligations to exchange information with our treaty partners. These concerns may have the potential to impact on New Zealand’s international reputation. 18. In particular, in April 2016, information about the “Panama Papers” was released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The Panama Papers comprise approximately 11.5 million confidential documents of a Panama based law and trust services firm, Mossack Fonseca. The documents, which are said to date back as far as the 1970s, were 3 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 5 of 160 obtained in early 2015. Allegations reported in the media include tax evasion, money laundering, and other illicit activities. 19. References in the Panama Papers to New Zealand foreign trusts and, in particular, allegations that New Zealand foreign trusts may be used in structures which are established to hide assets and evade or avoid foreign tax, added to the above concerns. Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules 20. The Government commissioned an Inquiry (the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules) into whether New Zealand’s foreign trust disclosure rules and their enforcement are sufficient to ensure New Zealand’s reputation is maintained. The terms of the Inquiry can be found at Appendix 1. 21. The Inquiry conducted an extensive review of the disclosure rules relevant to foreign trusts. The Inquiry reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on 20 June 2016. This report can be found at Appendix 2. 22. The Foreign Trust Inquiry made a number of recommendations. These fell into three broad categories: • Registration and increased disclosure recommendations that would be administered by Inland Revenue. • Anti-money laundering (AML) law and implementation recommendations. • Increased information sharing between New Zealand government agencies about foreign trusts for enforcement purposes. 23. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the AML requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a RIS for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. For this reason the options considered in this RIS do not attempt to address the AML concerns raised in the Inquiry. 24. We note that other options were considered by the Inquiry. These options included extending Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) obligations to foreign trusts, and having a public register for trusts. All these options were rejected by the Inquiry. We have considered the Inquiry’s recommendations on these options and we agree with the conclusions for the reasons given by the Inquiry. Scale of the problem 25. There are about 12,000 foreign trusts with a New Zealand resident trustee that have been disclosed to Inland Revenue. 26. In 2014, it was estimated that the value of the fees collected in respect of foreign trusts, plus emplo yment inco me for third party employees and principals for each foreign trust provider entity, amounts to approximately $24 million per annum, on average. This figure 4 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 6 of 160 has been calculated from Inland Revenue data. (Other reported estimates of fee income resulting from the industry range from $20 million 1 to $50 million 2 per annum.) 27. The contribution to the New Zealand tax take, in terms of income tax on fee income, goods and services tax, and PAYE paid on behalf of third party employees and principals for each foreign trust provider entity, is around $3 million per annum, on average. This figure has been calculated from Inland Revenue data. OBJECTIVES 28. The main objective is to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) 3 in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. 29. The Inquiry also proposed changes to reduce the potential for foreign trusts to be used for money laundering and other illicit purposes. Reducing the potential for foreign trusts to be used for money laundering and other illicit purposes is not an objective against which the options considered in this RIS are assessed. However, the Inquiry considered that increased disclosure requirements would be likely to partially address this issue. It should be noted that the Inquiry also recommended changes to the AML requirements. These AML amendments are currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice, alongside work currently underway to bring in Phase II of the AML regime. If these AML proposals are accepted, a regulatory impact statement for them will be completed as part of the Phase II policy proposals. 30. All the options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the following criteria: (a) Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information – Ensuring that New Zealand is able to maintain its reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information, particularly in light of the recent expansion of international obligations (in terms of number of treaty partners, the amount of information, and frequency of exchange). (b) Maintaining an open economy – The options should ensure that New Zealand maintains an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector. (c) Fairness and integrity (including perceptions of fairness and integrity) – The options should ensure that the law is seen as treating people fairly and consistently and should not allow people to avoid their tax obligations (including any foreign tax obligations). 1 IFSDG, “Exporting Financial Services: A Report from the International Funds Services Development Group” (IFSDG, 2011) at 47. Cabinet established the IFSDG in March 2010 to look at financial services opportunities for New Zealand. The estimate is said to be from industry sources in 2009. 2 Refer to www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=10844389. 3 The Inquiry noted that while it did not find any direct evidence of misuse, it is reasonable to conclude that there are cases where foreign trusts are being used in this way. 5 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 7 of 160 (d) Coherency of the tax system – The options should be consistent with other fundamental principles of the tax system. (e) Efficiency of compliance and administration – The options should, to the extent possible, minimise compliance costs for foreign trusts and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 31. In this context, we consider that more weight should be given to criteria (a), (c) and (d). For example, where there is a conflict between maintaining New Zealand’s reputation and minimising compliance and administrative costs, there should be relatively more weight attached to maintaining New Zealand’s reputation. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 32. Three options have been considered in this RIS: Option 1: Retain the status quo Option 2: Implement the changes recommended by the Inquiry that relate to registration, increased disclosure, and increased information sharing wit h some refinements (Inland Revenue’s recommended option). Option 3: Repeal the tax exemption for foreign trusts. Option 1 33. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 Main objective 34. The status quo does not meet the objective of reducing the potential for perceived misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 35. Although New Zealand’s current disclosure requirements are sufficient to meet the existing obligations for exchanging tax information under treaties, given the recent international movements towards increased information sharing between tax jurisdictions, in the current environment these rules may not be sufficient to maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. Maintaining an open economy 36. The status quo is consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, where those activities are legitimate. Fairness and integrity 37. Perceived or actual misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand in order to avoid tax obligations in other jurisdictions could impact negatively on fairness and integrity. 6 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 8 of 160 Coherency of the tax system 38. The impact on coherency of the tax system is mixed. The tax exemption for foreign trusts is consistent with New Zealand’s framework for taxing trusts. However, the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts seem insufficient in light of recent international trends. Efficiency of compliance and administration 39. The compliance costs for foreign trusts under current rules are very low. 40. In terms of administrative costs, there are currently some costs for data entry and the exchange of information. Inland Revenue also runs an audit project on foreign trust providers. Option 2 41. This option would implement a package of changes relating to registration, increased disclosure, and information sharing. This package essentially follows the Inquiry’s recommendations, wit h so me minor modifications as indicated. The Inquiry’s recommendations are contained in Appendix 1. Registration and initial disclosure 42. Under option 2 the current disclosure process would be formalised as a registration process. The resident trustee of the trust would be required to declare that the person establishing the foreign trust, the settlor(s) and the trustees have been advised of, and have agreed to provide the information to comply with, the applicable record-keeping requirements in the TAA, the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act and Regulations, and the Automatic Exchange of Informat ion (AEOI) requirements (once enacted). 43. To ensure that sufficient information is provided to Inland Revenue, more information would be required to be disclosed upon establishment of the trust, and in particular, the name, email address, foreign residential address, country of tax residence and Tax Identification Number of: i. the settlor or settlors ii. the protector (if there is any) iii. non-resident trustees iv. any other natural person who has effective control of the trust (including through a chain of control or ownership ) v. beneficiaries of fixed trusts, including the underlying beneficiary where a named beneficiary is a nominee. 44. In addition to the above disclosure, the trust deed would also be required to be filed with the registration form, and, in the case of discretionary trusts 4 , any class of beneficiary not listed in the trust deed should be described on the registration form. 4 A discretionary trust is a trust where the beneficiaries have no fixed entitlement to distributions from the trust. 7 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 9 of 160 On-going disclosure requirements 45. There would also be on-going disclosure requirements under option 2. Foreign trusts would be required to file an annual return with Inland Revenue that includes any changes to the information provided at registration, the trust’s annual financial statement, and the amount of any distributions paid or credited and the names, foreign address, Tax Identification Number and country of tax residence of the recipient beneficiaries. 46. Inland Revenue considers that, as part of option 2, t he annual return should include the amount of any settlements on the trust in the relevant period and the names, foreign address, Tax Identification Number and country of tax residence of that settlor. This information is currently required to be kept as part of the existing record keeping requirements. It would be more useful if this information was directly provided to Inland Revenue. When a trust qualifies for the tax exemption 47. The exemption from New Zealand tax on foreign-sourced income should apply only to a foreign trust with a resident trustee that has registered and fulfilled the associated disclosure obligations at that time. 48. The Inquiry also recommended that the qualifying resident trustee safe harbour should be reviewed. Inland Revenue considers that, as part of option 2, the qualifying resident trustee safe harbour should be removed. 49. The qualifying resident trustee safe harbour was introduced in 2006, as part of amendments which introduced the current disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. We understand that, at that time, it was considered that this safe harbour would encourage foreign trusts to use a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer as a trustee, and that having a trustee who is a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer would be an appropriate check to prevent non-compliance. However, the current qualifying resident trustee safe harbour does not provide a clear and appropriate signal about the importance of complying with the disclo sure rules. Registration and annual filing fees 50. Fees for registration and annual filing would be charged. This recognises that foreign trusts benefit from New Zealand’s regulatory environment and that there are costs involved to the Crown, both in processing registrations and returns and in enforcing the rules relating to foreign trusts. Charging fees would recompense the Crown for those costs. The Inquiry’s recommendations note that a fee of $500 for registration and then annually would be reasonable. We note that the registration and filing fees recommended by the Inquiry would be higher than those for companies, limited partnerships, and charities under New Zealand law. 5 Inland Revenue considers that further analysis is required to determine the quantum. Further, we consider that, as part of option 2, it may be appropriate for the level of fees to be modified in future by Order in Council. This would allow those fees to be relatively easily changed if necessary to recognise the costs involved in administering foreign trusts, and is consistent with the approach taken in relation to setting registration and filing fees for companies. 5 The fee for registering a company is $150, and the fee for registering a limited partnership is $270. The annual filing fee for companies and charities is approximately $50, and the annual levy for limited partnerships is $20. 8 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 10 of 160 Information sharing with relevant agencies 51. Under option 2 the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police would be able to search the register of foreign trusts. These agencies may need the information contained on the register for law enforcement purposes. The list of agencies with access to the register could be expanded in the future if there is good cause for it. Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 Main objective 52. Obtaining more information about the settlor and beneficiaries and providing it to other authorities (overseas tax authorities and domestic enforcement agencies) would help ensure that foreign trusts are not misused. More disclosure in relation to foreign trusts and access to the information by relevant agencies would make it difficult for these vehicles to be used to avo id foreign tax. This option meets the main criteria. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 53. By increasing the information available to Inland Revenue that can be shared with New Zealand’s treaty partners, option 2 would maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. This would be an improvement on the status quo. Maintaining an open economy 54. We consider this option is consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, where activities are legitimate. While there would be some increase in compliance costs for this industry, as noted below, these are not significant given the current record-keeping requirements and in some cases, the similar requirements for AEOI and AML legislation. 55. In terms of maintaining an open economy, we consider that option 2 is no better or worse than the status quo. Fairness and integrity 56. The impact on fairness and integrity (including on perceptions of fairness and integrity) is expected to be positive. The requirements are likely to provide increased integrity, and the registration requirements will signal the increased disclosure requirements. This would be an improvement on the status quo. Coherency of the tax system 57. The impact on coherency of the tax policy framework and disclosure rules would be an improvement on the status quo. 58. This option would retain the tax exemption for foreign trusts, which is consistent with New Zealand’s framework for taxing trusts. 9 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 11 of 160 59. Increasing the disclosure requirements for foreign trusts would be consistent with recent trends for increased disclosures to tax authorities for the purposes of detecting tax avoidance and evasion. Efficiency of compliance and administration 60. There may be additional compliance costs for foreign trusts. However we do not consider that these will be significant. 61. Much of the information that would be required to be provided is already required to be collected by the New Zealand-resident trustee in accordance with existing record-keeping requirements. 62. At the moment, identity and address information of settlors and beneficiaries is required to be collected, although only “if known”. The new information that foreign trusts will be required to collect mainly relates to identity and address information about the settlor and beneficiary (including the Taxpayer Identification Number for those persons). We note that these information requirements would be broadly in line with the type of information disclosure standards that will be required under the proposed AEOI requirements. 63. The foreign trust would also need to do a new annual return to Inland Revenue rather than simply keeping records. 64. In some (but probably not most) cases, this information may be required to be provided under AEOI or AML legislation. However, we anticipate that entities will be able to use the same information collected for multiple regulatory regimes. Accordingly, while we acknowledge duplication in those cases might potentially increase compliance costs, we consider that compliance costs arising from duplication are relat ively minimal. 65. Under option 2, there will be some increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue as a result of redesigning the current disclosure statement, a new annual return, and additional data entry. These costs are likely to be under $1 million. There may also be some additional resources required for increased exchange of information with domestic law enforcement agencies and overseas treaty partners. The costs relating to additional data entry and enforcement could depend on the numbers of foreign trusts. 66. Overall, in terms of efficiency of compliance and administration, option 2 would be slightly worse than the status quo. Option 3 67. This option would repeal the tax exemption for foreign trusts. This option was suggested by some submitters to the Inquiry. The Inquiry did not recommend this option. 68. We note that it is possible for foreign trusts to be established in New Zealand for legitimate purposes that do not include foreign tax abuse or illicit activity. However, taxing foreign trusts on their worldwide inco me would deter the use of trusts even if they are used only for legitimate reasons. 10 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 12 of 160 Assessment against objective and criteria – option 3 Main objective 69. This option would meet the main objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasio n. Maintaining New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information 70. To the extent that this option deters the use of foreign trusts, there would be no relevant activity and therefore no impact on New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information. This is an improvement on the status quo. Maintaining an open economy 71. This option would not be consistent with maintaining an open economy which welcomes an active financial services sector, as this would deter the use of foreign trusts in New Zealand in situations where they are used for legitimate reasons. This may adversely impact New Zealand’s financial services sector. This would be worse than the status quo. Coherency of the tax system 72. This option is not consistent with other fundamental principles of the tax system, which does not tax foreign-sourced income of non-residents and therefore lacks coherence. Accordingly, this would be worse than the status quo. Fairness and integrity 73. The impact of this option on New Zealand’s on fairness and integrity is likely to be mixed. Overall, to the extent that foreign trusts are (or are perceived to be) misused for foreign tax avoidance or illicit purposes, this would have a positive impact. On the other hand, to the extent that foreign trusts are used for legitimate purposes, this option may have a negative impact as, in the context of New Zealand’s other rules, this approach may be perceived as inconsistent. It is not clear that option 3 is better or worse than the status quo. Efficiency of compliance and administration 74. If this option significantly reduces the likelihood of foreign trusts operating in New Zealand, which we would expect to happen, this would reduce administrative costs to Inland Revenue, and compliance costs for foreign trusts. In this respect it would be an improvement on the status quo. CONSULTATION 75. Inland Revenue has consulted with The Treasury, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Internal Affairs, and the New Zealand Police. They have raised no concerns with the proposals in the preferred option (option 2). 76. T o ensure that amendments recommended by the Inquiry and accepted by the Government could be implemented in line with the application timeframes recommended by 11 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 13 of 160 the Inquiry, while still being subject to select committee scrutiny, the time period for preparing this RIS has been shortened. Accordingly, Inland Revenue has not consulted more widely on the proposals. 77. However, in forming its recommendations, the Inquiry invited public submissions, and received 23 submissions, including from Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society, Transparency International, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, accounting firms, trust and company services providers, and individuals. The Inquiry also consulted with the Privacy Commissioner. 78. Part 11 of the Inquiry’s report summarised the submissions made to it. 79. Most of the submitters who commented on the taxation of foreign trusts considered that settlor-based approach for taxing trusts (which results in the tax exemption for foreign trusts) should continue, but that there should be some changes to disclosure requirements. Two submitters considered that the trust should be taxed on its worldwide inco me if there is a resident trustee. One submitter suggested abolishing foreign trusts. 80. Most submitters who commented on the current disclosure rules considered the current disclosure regime to be inadequate. The Inquiry noted that not all submissions were explicit about what disclosure obligations should be changed. One submitter thought that providing the extra information that is obtained for Australian settlors would be sufficient, while others wanted more extensive disclosure, including details of settlors and beneficiaries and annual income statements and distribution information. 81. The Inquiry noted that a number of submissions considered that the upcoming requirements to provide information under AEOI should help address shortfalls in disclosure, and that some thought that AEOI would be a complete solution. However, the Inquiry concluded in Part 6 that, for a significant number of foreign trusts, AEOI will not result in any material increase in the amount of information required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue agrees that the AEOI due diligence and reporting requirements seem likely to have only limited application to foreign trusts. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 82. The following table summarises the consideration of the options from the regulatory analysis section above. Within the overview table the following symbols are used:  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo ? Unclear Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 – Status quo Does not meet the main objective Option 2 – Increased disclosure, largely following the Inquiry’s recommendations (Inland Revenue’s recommended option) Meets the main objective New Zealand’s reputation  Open economy  12 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 14 of 160 Fairness and integrity  Coherency of tax system  Compliance and administration:  Option 3 – Repeal the tax exemption for foreign trusts Meets the main objective New Zealand’s reputation  Open economy  Fairness and integrity ? Coherency of tax system  Compliance and administration:  83. We do not recommend option 1 (the status quo) as that does not meet the stated objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion and money laundering and other illicit purposes. 84. We consider that option 2 would address the concerns relating to foreign tax avoidance or evasion. It may partially address the concerns relating to money-laundering and other illicit purposes. Accordingly, the recommended option in this RIS will meet the objective to reduce the potential for misuse of foreign trusts in New Zealand (both actual and perceived) in respect of foreign tax avoidance or evasion. 85. We recommend option 2 (increased disclosure, largely following the Inquiry’s recommendations) over option 3 (repeal of the tax exemption for foreign trusts), on the basis that option 2 will address the concerns regarding misuse of trusts without imposing excessive administrative costs. While option 3 would also meet the stated objective, it does not satisfactorily meet the criteria in relation to an open economy and the coherency of the tax system. Option 2 will increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for trust and company service providers. However, at this stage we consider that the administrative costs are relatively minimal. We do not consider that the increased compliance costs, which relate to addit ional informat ion and the obligation to file annual returns, are likely to be significant. This increased information is broadly similar to the type of information that trust and company service providers (TCSPs) would be expected to provide where AEOI and AML obligations apply. Accordingly, requiring this information does not seem unreasonable. IMPLEMENTATION 86. Legislative change would be required to implement option 2. Legislative amendments required to implement option 2 could be included in a bill to be introduced in August 2016. This bill is expected to be enacted by the end of 2016. 87. Transitional provisions for existing foreign trusts are planned to provide them with enough time to comply with the proposed requirements. It is proposed that new foreign trusts would need to comply with the amended rules from the date of enactment, and that existing foreign trusts would have until 30 June 2017 to comply with the registration requirements. This transit ional provisio n would allow existing trusts approximately six months to either collect the information required or to wind-up. New foreign trusts would need to comply with the annual filing obligation from date of enactment. Existing foreign trusts would need to comply with the annual filing obligation in relation to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2017. 13 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 15 of 160 88. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed changes. Some systems changes would be required to implement option 2. No changes to FIRST (Inland Revenue’s mainframe IT system) would be required. A revised form upon registration and a new annual disclosure form would also be required. 89. In implementing option 2, Inland Revenue would work with TCSPs to ensure that they and their clients understand the changes and their new obligations. As the industry is reasonably small, we consider that this is achievable. 90. Inland Revenue will continue with its current audit and education programme in relat ion to TCSPs. 91. Implementation of a searchable register of foreign trust registrations would require Inland Revenue to operate a manual spread-sheet database, which will be shared with other government agencies authorised by legislation. 92. Commentary on the proposed legislative changes would be released when the Bill is introduced. In addit io n, a special report and a Tax Information Bulletin containing further explanation of the amendments would be published once the Bill is enacted. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 93. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place takes under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would be priorit ised in the context of the current Tax Policy Work Programme, and any proposals would go through the GTPP. 94. The Inquiry recommended that the registration requirement be the responsibility of Inland Revenue initially, but the Government may want to consider if another department, such as the Companies Office, may be a more appropriate department at a later time. 95. Inland Revenue agrees with the Inquiry’s recommendation to review the position in future (after the existing rules have bedded in). It is possible that there may be efficiencies from another department other than Inland Revenue administering the registration of foreign trusts. This review would need to include consideration of: a. ensuring that information sharing between the other department and Inland Revenue is adequate (given that Inland Revenue may need to share information with its overseas counterparts, and to enforce the sanction of taxing the foreign trust’s income); and b. ensuring that the other department has the appropriate ability to investigate foreign trusts (both under legislation and operationally). 14 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 16 of 160 96. As part of this future review, Inland Revenue would report back to Ministers on the operation of the new disclosure rules. 97. The Inquiry also recommended that a review be undertaken of the current legislative arrangements for the sharing of information between three agencies (Inland Revenue, the Financial Intelligence Unit of the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs) to determine the financial and efficiency gains and other implications (including secrecy considerations) of sharing strategic intelligence and other information between agencies. 98. Inland Revenue agrees in principle that there should be a review. It may be appropriate to include other regulatory agencies as well. In terms of timing, we consider that this should be considered in light of: a. current work on reforming the secrecy provisions in the TAA; and b. the timing of Phase II of AML/CFT and other priorities. 15 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 17 of 160 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 18 of 160 Regulatory Impact Statement Design of START – legislative issues Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address three legislative issues that have arisen in relation to transferring tax types from Inland Revenue’s current computer system (FIRST) to Inland Revenue’s future computer system (START). The three issues relate to: •use-of-money interest (UOMI) and transfers of tax; •Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by removing the new due date concept; and •the administration of the grace periods concept (which provides for additional time for payment of a debt before late payment penalties are imposed) throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START. The options considered are intended to simplify the transition from FIRST to START while at the same time ensuring that the integrity of the tax system is preserved. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad- base, low-rate tax system. Legislative change is required before February 2017 because this is when GST is planned to be transitioned from FIRST to START. This feature presented a timing constraint on the amount of consultation and the extent of the analysis that could be undertaken. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury who are supportive of the recommendations set out in this RIS. Wider consultation was not conducted due to timing constraints (legislative change is required before February 2017 as this is when GST would be transitioned from FIRST to START). A k ey gap in the analysis is that Inland Revenue does not hold sufficient data to provide an estimate of the fiscal impact of the options relating to transfers of tax and amending the rules for new and increased assessments. A k ey risk is if the transition of GST to START is delayed, then FIRST will operate inconsistently with the new legislation. Conversely, if the new legislation is delayed and GST is transit ioned to START before the legislation is enacted, START would not be compliant with the existing legislation as it would be programmed in anticipation of the legislative amendments being passed. 2 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 19 of 160 None of the policy options would impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles.

The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get it right and difficult to get it wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The ways in which individuals work have changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casual in nature as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 5. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 6. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 7. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 4 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 22 of 160 8. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers o f complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorities. 9. However, Business Transformation (BT) is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a lo ng-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. 10. As part of BT, FIRST will be replaced with a commercial-off-the-shelf tax and social policy software package from FAST Enterprises, referred to as START. 1 The revenue system will be transitioned to START in the following stages: • Stage 1 – GST (early 2017) • Stage 2 – income and business taxes • Stage 3 – social po licy • Stage 4 – any remaining taxes and duties 11. While thinking about how to transition the revenue system to START, three problems have been identified which relate to: • Use-of-money interest (UOMI) and transfers of tax. Put simply, taxpayers are able to receive more UOMI from Inland Revenue on overpayments/refunds of tax than they are entitled to in some circumstances. Underpayment UOMI payable to Inland Revenue on underpayments is also reduced in some circumstances. These outcomes adversely impact the integrity and coherence of the current rules and give rise to both efficiency and fairness concerns • Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner after the original due date (removal of the new due date concept) to remove the requirement for setting a new due date for payment to avoid having to customise the configuration of START to create a new due date in such situations. • The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START. Different tax types will be transitioned to START in different stages. This means that there will be a period in which tax 1 START stands for ‘Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology’ and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GENTAX software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 5 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 23 of 160 types will be administered from two different systems. This raises an issue with respect to late payment penalt y grace periods, as the current rules require the Commissioner to look at the taxpayer’s payment history across multiple tax types in determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. This would give rise to administrative complexity and cost for Inland Revenue as tax types transit ion fro m FIRST to START. 12. Some background and more detail on each of these problems are provided in the appendices at the end of this document. OBJECTIVE 13. The main objective of the options is to simplify the transit ion fro m FIRST to START while ensuring the integrity of the tax system is preserved. 14. The transition from FIRST to START is simplified where START is customised as little as possible. 15. The integrity of the tax system is preserved when: • Taxpayers receive the amount of UOMI they are entitled to, and can continue to legitimately transfer excess tax to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI. • Taxpayers understand how interest and penalties are calculated, their interactions with Inland Revenue are minimised, and revenue collection is improved. • The Commissioner is able to administer a “grace periods” concept efficiently and accurately in a way that does not present difficulties or complexities for taxpayers. 16. All options are assessed against the following criteria: (a) Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. (b) Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance cost impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. (c) Sustainability of the tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes. 17. Legislative change is required before February 2017 as this is when GST is planned to be transitioned from FIRST to START. This feature presented a timing constraint on the extent of the analysis and consultation that could be undertaken. 6 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 24 of 160 18. It is also noted that we do not have sufficient data to provide an estimate of the fiscal impact of the options relating to transfers of tax and amending the new due date rules for new and increased assessments. 19. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with the recommended changes. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 20. Officials have developed options to address the above three problems. Each of these problems and the options to resolve them are summarised below. Further detail on these problems and their associated options is contained in the appendices at the end of this document. UOMI and transfers of tax 21. There are two issues associated with UOMI and transfers of tax: • Issue 1: When an amount transferred to a previous period exceeds the amount owing in that period, UOMI on the excess may start to accrue earlier than if the amount had remained in the original period. This will occur whenever the effective date for the transfer is earlier than the “date interest starts” under the UOMI rules. This is because FIRST incorrectly pays interest from the transfer date, rather than the applicable date under the UOMI rules. Taxpayers aware of this inconsistency are able to make use of it by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. This is a system and administrative issue as FIRST is incorrectly applying the law. START is able to correctly apply the law with manual administrative processes for staff. Appendix A contains an example that illustrates this issue. • Issue 2: FIRST transfers overpayments of tax at the effective transfer date of a refund, rather than the effective transfer date of an overpayment. Thus where an overpayment has been transferred to satisfy a debt in a previous period, UOMI on that debt will stop accruing earlier than intended because that debt would be treated as having been paid off earlier - that is, at the refund effective transfer date, rather than the overpayment transfer date. Appendix A contains an example that illustrates this issue. 22. These issues arise because FIRST is unable to track the source of a credit (a positive balance for the taxpayer) – for example, what period it arose from and whether it arose from a refund or an overpayment. As a result, FIRST pays UOMI on credits (i.e. refunds or payments) added to a period from the date they are added (rather than the correct date under the UOMI rules), and transfers of overpayments are made at the refund date, rather than the payment date. A further cause of issue 2 is that there is a lack of clarity in the law – basically the law allows a GST overpayment to be transferred at the effective date of a GST refund. The law is clear in relation to transfers of other tax types. 7 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 25 of 160 Options and analysis 23. Appendix A contains detailed analysis of the options. 24. The status quo does not meet the objective as START would need to be customised in order to apply the status quo (i.e. START would need to be customised to incorrectly apply the law just as FIRST does) and taxpayers would be able to receive more UOMI than they are entitled to. The status quo has the following implications: • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers with knowledge of the inconsistencies would gain an unfair advantage. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Taxpayers would incur compliance costs, and Inland Revenue would incur administration costs resulting from tax being transferred to prior periods that are not in debt or dispute. • Sustainability of the tax system: Taxpayers would continue to be able to artificially manipulate UOMI calculations. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1 - Amend the transfer rules to prevent transfers of tax to previous periods that exceed the amount of debt or amount in dispute in that period. Amend the transfer and UOMI rules as they relate to GST to ensure the law achieves the policy intent. Meets the main objective. Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Significant improvement on status quo. Option 2 – Configure START to correctly apply the current law. Amend the transfer and UOMI rules as they relate to GST to ensure the law achieves the policy intent. Partially meets the main objective. Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo. Recommendation 25. Option 1 was recommended over option 2 as it prohibits excess transfers of tax to prior periods which would prevent taxpayers artificially manipulating UOMI calculations in relation to all tax types. Although taxpayers would be prevented from gaming the system with option 2, this would only be in relation to tax types administered by START. Therefore, if option 2 were chosen, taxpayers would continue be able to game the system in relation to some tax types until 2021 when all tax types have been transitioned to START. Although there would be no harm in allowing excess transfers of tax to prior periods once all tax types were administered by START, such a transfer would serve no purpose. It might also be beneficial to limit these transfers in order to prevent mistakes (i.e. the taxpayer might mistype the period they wished to transfer to). 8 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 26 of 160 Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 26. If a taxpayer does not file a tax return, or if a taxpayer files an incorrect tax return, the Commissio ner may, subject to limits on her powers, make an assessment for the amount of tax that ought to be imposed. When this occurs, a new (and later) due date that is 30 or more days after the notice of assessment date is generally set for the payment of the resulting tax liability. This allows the taxpayer time to pay the increased tax liability. 27. Interest applies from the day after the original due date for the payment of the tax. However, late payment penalties on the increased assessment are imposed on the day after the new due date for the outstanding tax liability if the taxpayer does not pay the tax outstanding plus interest in full by the new due date. These rules result in different due dates in relation to a single tax period which adds complexity. 28. In addition, any excess tax or amount that becomes refundable (this can be for another tax type or period) between the notice of assessment and the new due date is generally refunded to the taxpayer who is then required to repay the relevant amount to the Commissioner shortly afterwards (by the new due date). This increases compliance costs and effort for taxpayers and increases the risk of incurring addit ional UOMI and late payment penalt ies if the taxpayer does not pay the relevant amount in time. 29. There are differences in the way Inland Revenue’s current FIRST system and the new START system operate. In FIRST a new due date has to be created for each new or increased assessment in order to allow time for the taxpayer to pay the resulting tax before late payment penalties are imposed. START’s core functionality operates on a taxable period basis that allows for a period of time for payment before late payment penalties apply without requiring a new due date to be established each time the Commissioner makes an (re-)assessment for a taxable period. This reduces complexity and reflects the fact that the relevant assessment relates to the original due date of the period and would have been due to be paid on the original due date. However, implementing the current legislative framework for setting new due dates for each new or increased assessment in START requires significant customisation and limits the ability to use some of START’s core functionalities. 30. During the course of the BT Programme there would be a period of “co-existence” in which some tax and social policy products would be administered in START and others would be administered in FIRST (“the Coexistence Period”). The amendment outlined in option 2 below would only apply to tax types administered in START. This means that during the Coexistence Period taxpayers would be treated differently depending on the tax type that the Commissioner assessed or re-assessed and whether this tax type was administered in FIRST or in START. Options and analysis 31. Appendix B contains detailed analysis of the options. 9 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 27 of 160 Options Analysis against the objectives Option 1 – Maintain the status quo and customise START – a new due date is set for a (re-) assessment 30 days or more after the notice of (re-)assessment and late payment penalties are applied from the day after the new due date. The status quo does not meet the main objective as it will require significant customisation of START. Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Option 2 – Amend the law so that no new due date is set for new or increased assessment; and late payment penalties are applied 31 days or later after the date of the notice of assessment. Meets the main objective . Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Overall comment: Improvement on status quo. Recommendation 32. Officials recommend option 2 because it would avoid heavy customisation of START, minimise compliance costs for some taxpayers and improve revenue collection. The administration of the grace periods concept through the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 33. During the course of the BT Programme, there will be a period of “co-existence”, in which some tax and social policy products will be administered in START and others will be administered in FIRST (“the Coexistence Period”). 34. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity would reside in two systems, it would be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a late payment penalty grace period. Options and analysis 35. Appendix C contains detailed analysis of the options. Options Analysis against the objectives Option 1 – Maintain the status quo by manually managing grace periods across FIRST and START The status quo only partially meets the main objective because it would require significant manual intervention. Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  10 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 28 of 160 Options Analysis against the objectives Option 2 – Integrate FIRST and START to deliver customer level grace periods (integration approach) Does not meet the main objective As this option does not meet the overarching objective, it does not need to be assessed against the criteria. Option 3 – Amend the law Meets the main objective Fairness & equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  This option does not result in an improvement to the status quo with respect to fairness and equity, only partially meeting the criterion, whereas the status quo is fair and equitable. However, this option represents a significant improvement on the status quo with respect to the compliance and administration and sustainability criteria. Recommendation 36. Officials recommend option 3 on the basis that it would allow accurate and consistent application of the grace periods concept throughout the coexistence period and it would not give rise to any issues with respect to compliance and administration. CONSULTATION 37. Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury who are supportive of the options chosen in this RIS. 38. Wider consultation was not conducted owing to time constraints – legislative change is required before February 2017 because this is when GST will be transit io ned fro m FIRST to START. Officials have commenced limited consultation with CAANZ on the proposals to test their reaction. CAANZ has indicated it supports the grace periods proposal. Officials are still to hear back from them in relation to the other two proposals. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS UOMI and transfers of tax 39. Inland Revenue prefers option 1, which is to amend the transfer rules and UOMI rules to limit transfers of tax to prior periods and to ensure the law achieves the policy intent, for the following reasons: 11 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 29 of 160 • It would prevent taxpayers from artificially manipulating UOMI calculations in order to obtain a benefit. This would result in a fiscal gain as Inland Revenue would no longer be paying UOMI to taxpayers who are not entitled to it. • It would address inconsistencies in the legislation and improve clarity. • It will prevent taxpayers accidentally transferring excessive amounts to prior periods. Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 40. Inland Revenue prefers option 2 for the following reasons: • It would simplify the design of START in relation to new and increased assessments. • It would avoid customisation of START to minimise long term costs of the system. • It would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers who wish to have credits applied to a debt and improve revenue collection. The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 41. Inland Revenue prefers option 3 for the following reasons: • It would allow for an accurate and consistent application of the grace periods concept throughout the Coexistence Period. • It would not give rise to any system integrity issues. • It does not require systems to be developed to integrate FIRST and START. IMPLEMENTATION 42. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required in order to give effect to these proposals. It is proposed that these amendments be included in the Taxation (Provisional Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is expected to be introduced later this year and receive Royal assent by the end of 2016. 43. When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 44. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed changes. The proposals would have minor systems implications for Inland Revenue but may result in some additional 12 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 30 of 160 administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate the changes. There would also be some staff costs associated with the UOMI and transfers of tax proposals, which is examined in further detail below. These costs are expected to be insignificant and would be met as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. UOMI and transfers of tax 45. It is important to note that these proposals would only apply to START, not to FIRST. This is because FIRST is unable to apply these amendments because of deficiencies in the FIRST system. It is not feasible to incur costs to amend FIRST when all tax types would be transit ioned to START within a few years of the enactment of the legislation. In order to ensure compliance with the legislation, preventing transfers of excess tax to prior periods and ensuring transfers of overpayments to cover a debt in a prior period are made at the correct date would be dealt with administratively by Inland Revenue staff for all other tax types until such time as those tax types are transferred to START. 46. This is not expected to impose a significant administrative burden because: • Taxpayers are unlikely to attempt to transfer excess tax to prior periods once aware it is no longer legal. • Transfers of overpayments to cover debts in prior periods is relatively uncommon as taxpayers generally pay off their debts before paying upcoming tax liabilities in order to reduce their exposure to penalties and interest. Amending the rules for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner (removal of the new due date concept) 47. The proposal for new and increased assessments by the Commissioner would only apply to START and not to FIRST due to system constraints in the way FIRST operates. This means that the proposal would apply to assessments and re-assessments of tax types as and when they transition to START. The existing rules would continue to apply for assessments of tax types that have not yet transitioned to START. The administration of the grace periods concept throughout the transition of tax types from FIRST to START 48. The proposal for the administration of grace periods would require legislative amendment to ensure that the Commissioner is able to only look at compliance history that exists within the system from which the tax type in question (the tax type in respect of which there has been a payment default) is being administered. 49. As this legislative amendment would allow for each system to administer grace periods independently of the other, this proposal is not expected to impose a significant administrative burden. This is because it would remove the need for grace periods to be managed manually across the two systems. 13 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 31 of 160 Implementation risks 50. A key implementation risk would arise if the application dates of the legislation do not align with the transition of GST to START. This would have the following implications: • If the legislation is in force and GST has not transitioned to START, then FIRST would be operating contrary to the law. This risk could be managed administratively for the transfers of tax and new due date proposals – i.e. Inland Revenue would simply limit transfers of tax to prior periods and not assign a new due date to new/increased assessments. The grace periods proposal would be drafted in such a way that a delay in the transition of GST to START would have no impact. • If the legislation is not in force but GST has transitioned to START, START would be operating contrary to the law as it would be coded in anticipation of the legislative amendments being passed. This could be managed administratively by backing out what START does, but would involve significant manual work and significant costs. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 51. Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 14 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 32 of 160 APPENDIX A – UOMI AND TRANSFERS OF TAX Background – status quo GST periods, refunds and overpayments 1. GST registered persons 2 must file a GST return and pay any tax owing generally by the 28 th of the month following the end of their taxable period. Taxable periods are one month, two months or six months. 2. A GST refund arises where GST inputs/expenses exceed GST outputs/sales. Instead of the taxpayer paying the GST output amount and claiming back the GST input amount, these amounts are netted off and the taxpayer receives a refund without making a payment. This is distinct from a GST overpayment – which occurs when the taxpayer pays more than is necessary to satisfy their tax liability. Use-of-money interest 3. UOMI is applied to underpayments and overpayments of tax to compensate one part y for the use of the other party’s money and to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. If taxpayers pay too much tax, they receive interest at 1.62% per annum fro m the Commissioner until the excess is refunded by the Commissioner or applied to another tax liability, whereas if the taxpayer pays too little tax, they must pay the Commissioner interest at 8.27% per annum on the outstanding balance until the balance is paid. Taxpayers do not receive UOMI on prepayments of tax. 4. There are rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 which determine the date interest starts for the purposes of credit (paid by Inland Revenue to the taxpayer) and debit (paid by the taxpayer to Inland Revenue) UOMI. 5. For underpaid tax, UOMI generally begins on the day after the due date for payment of the tax. 6. For overpaid tax and GST refunds, UOMI generally begins on the latest of: • The day after the due date for payment; • The day after the payment is made; or • The day after the tax return is provided. 7. UOMI stops being charged on underpaid tax on the date that the tax is paid or credited as paid (for example, when the taxpayer transfers tax from a period that is overpaid in order to satisfy the underpayment). 2 Taxpayers with an annual turnover from a taxable activity exceeding $60,000 must register for GST. Taxpayers with a turnover below this threshold or bodies corporate may choose to register. 15 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 33 of 160 8. UOMI stops being earned on overpaid tax when it is refunded by the Commissioner or applied to another tax liability. Transfers of excess tax 9. Taxpayers are able to transfer excess tax to another tax period or to another tax type or even to other taxpayers. This enables taxpayers to transfer overpaid tax to a period/tax type that has been underpaid, in order to reduce UOMI on that underpaid tax. The transfer rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 restrict what date a taxpayer may choose to transfer excess tax. Tax may be transferred: • On any date after the end of the GST return period in which the refund arose (for a GST refund). • On any date that occurs on or after the date the excess tax is paid (for an overpayment of tax). • A day after the end of the accounting year in which the amount was deducted (for tax deducted on the taxpayer’s behalf – i.e. PAYE and RWT). 10. Put simply, a taxpayer is only able to transfer excess tax once they become entitled to it. GST refunds have an earlier effective transfer date than overpayments because the first of the month is in effect when the GST refund arose for the previous month. 11. The transfer effective date is very important as it affects when UOMI on a prior period underpayment stops being charged. For example, if a taxpayer owed $200 for the June GST period, and was entitled to a GST refund of $200 in the July GST period which he wished to transfer to the June period, the effective transfer date for this refund would be 1 August. UOMI on the June underpayment would cease at 1 August, as this is when the July refund is transferred to satisfy the June debt 3 . Problem definition 12. There are two issues with the current tax rules. Issue 1 – excess UOMI on “overpayments” 13. Taxpayers are able to receive more UOMI from Inland Revenue on “overpayments” than they are entitled to in some circumstances. Example 14. Bob files his 2014 income tax return and is due a refund of $8,000 arising from tax being withheld at source at incorrect rates. He requests that this refund is transferred to his 2013 taxable period, which has a nil balance. The $8,000 is transferred as its earliest effective 3 For the purposes of this example assume no penalties or interest accrued on the $200 debt, so that the $200 payment fully satisfied it. Transfers are first applied to any interest or late payment penalties that have accrued on the debt, before being applied to the debt. 16 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 34 of 160 date of 1 April 2014 (the day after the end of the accounting year in which the amount was deducted – see paragraph 9). 15. FIRST treats this transfer date of 1 April as a payment date and pays UOMI on the $8,000 balance from 2 April 2014 (the day after the “payment” was made). This is a misapplication of the rules as interest should begin on 8 February 2015 (the day after the due date for payment of tax for the 2014 period). 16. However, as FIRST is unable to track the source of payments, it sees a “payment” being made on 1 April and therefore the only UOMI rule it could apply would be the “day after the payment is made” rule (FIRST couldn’t use the “day after tax return is provided” or “day after due date for payment” rules as it is unable to track that the payment actually comes from a refund in the 2014 taxable period). As a result, Bob is paid almost a year’s worth of interest to which he is not entitled (interest is paid from 2 April 2014 rather than 8 February 2015). $8,000$0 UOMI 31 Mar 2014 31 Mar 2013 8 Feb 2015 Due date for Mar 2014 year 31 Mar 2015 1 Ap r 2014 Effective date of transfer to Mar 2013 year $0$8,000 UOMI t axp ayer not entitled to No Transfer Trans fe r 2 Ap r 2014 Day after effective date of transfer Transfer effective 1 April 2014 17. Taxpayers aware of this inconsistency are able to make use of it by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. Issue 2 – reduced UOMI on underpayments 18. Taxpayers are able to reduce the amount of UOMI payable to Inland Revenue on underpayments of GST in some circumstances. Example 19. Vicki has a debt of $600 for her June GST period. She files her July GST return on 28 August, and mistakenly overpays (also on 28 August) by $600. Vicki requests that this $600 overpayment is transferred to the June period. Based on the intended application of the transfer rules, the effective date for this transfer is any date from 28 August. 20. FIRST treats the transfer as having been made on the 1st of August (which is the refund transfer date). As a result, UOMI that Vicki had to pay the IRD on her $600 June debt ceases on the 1st of August, 4 rather than on the 28th of August (this is the correct date under the UOMI rules). 4 For the purposes of this example assume no penalties or interest accrued on the $600 debt, so that the $600 payment fully satisfied it. 17 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 35 of 160 31 Ju l 2015 1 Au g 2015 Day after July period – refund available for transfer 28 Au g 2015 Due date for July period – UOMI st art date 30 Jun 2015 -$600$600 $0$0 Before Transfer After Transfer UOMI on June underpayment stops on 1 August instead o f 28 August Transfer effective 1 August Scale of the problem 21. A large number of tax agents manufacture UOMI by transferring any overpayment or refund of tax to a prior period before seeking a refund. 22. Wit hout any legislative change, taxpayers could continue to “game the system” by artificially increasing the amount of UOMI paid to them by Inland Revenue. This practice effectively allows taxpayers who have knowledge of this inconsistency to push the tax burden disproportionately onto other taxpayers. This was not intended. The amount of underpayment UOMI taxpayers must pay to Inland Revenue would also be reduced in some circumstances, although taxpayers are unable to manipulate this. Options and analysis 23. Two options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Amend the transfer and UOMI rules (Officials’ preferred option). • Option 2: Configure START to apply the current law. Option 1 24. Under this option, the following amendments would be made to the UOMI and transfer rules: • Taxpayers would be prevented from transferring tax to a prior period that exceeds the amount of debt or amount in dispute in that period. This would prevent taxpayers from obtaining credit UOMI on overpayments transferred to prior periods. • The difference between a GST refund and GST overpayment would be clarified for the purposes of the transfer rules. This would prevent taxpayers from being able to reduce underpayment UOMI by obtaining the GST refund effective transfer date for an overpayment. 18 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 36 of 160 • The difference between a GST refund and GST overpayment would be clarified for the purposes of the UOMI rules. This would enhance clarity in the legislation. 25. It is important to note that, unlike START, FIRST is unable to prevent transfers of excess tax to prior periods. By the application date of the above amendments, only GST would have transitioned to START. For all other tax types, these amendments would be manually administered by Inland Revenue staff (see paragraphs 45 and 46 in the main report for further information). Assessment against objective and criteria – option 1 • Main objective: This option would meet the main objective for two reasons. First, START would not need to be customised in order to prevent transfers of tax to prior periods that exceed that amount in debt or dispute in that period, as this option is available wit hin START’s default settings. Second, t axpayers would only receive the amount of UOMI to which they are entitled and would continue to be able to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI by transferring refunds/overpayments to satisfy debts in prior periods. • Fairness and equit y: This option would improve equity as it would prevent taxpayers from obtaining UOMI artificially, therefore preventing taxpayers with knowledge of this from obtaining an unfair advantage over other taxpayers. This option meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option would reduce compliance costs as taxpayers will no longer incur compliance costs associated with moving tax between periods in order to artificially manipulate UOMI. This option would result in a minor and temporary increase in administrative costs arising from Inland Revenue staff having to manually administer these amendments in relation to tax types that have not transitioned to START at the application date of the legislation. This option partially meets this criterion. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option would improve the sustainability of the tax system as it prevents taxpayers from artificially manipulating UOMI calculations. It also prevents underpayment UOMI from ceasing earlier than it should. This option meets this criterion. 26. Option 1 represents a significant improvement on the status quo. Option 2 27. Under this option START would be configured to correctly apply the current law (i.e. START would be able to track the source of a credit so will know what period a payment came from, and would therefore be able to pay UOMI from the correct date). The law would only be applied correctly for tax types that are administered in START (tax types will be transitioned to START in stages as outlined in paragraph 10 in the main report), and therefore would not fully prevent the problems outlined until all tax types have transitioned to START. 19 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 37 of 160 Amendments would also be made to the transfer and UOMI rules in relation to GST (bullet points 2 and 3 of paragraph 24 of Appendix A). Assessment against objective and criteria – option 2 • Main objective: This option partially meets the main objective. START would not need to be customised in order to be able to track the source of a credit as this is part of START’s inherent functionality. Taxpayers would receive more UOMI than they are entitled to on other tax types until those tax types are transitioned to START. Taxpayers could continue to mitigate the effects of underpayment UOMI by transferring refunds/overpayments to satisfy debts in prior periods. • Fairness and equit y: This option would improve equity as it would prevent taxpayers from obtaining credit UOMI artificially, however it only partially meets this criterion as taxpayers would be able to artificially obtain UOMI on tax types until they are transferred to START. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option would reduce compliance costs (albeit delayed because of the timeline for transitioning other tax types to START) as taxpayers would no longer incur compliance costs associated with moving tax between periods in order to artificially manipulate UOMI. This option would only result in very minor administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate changes. This option partially meets this criterion. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option would improve the sustainability of the tax system as it prevents (albeit delayed in relation to tax types other than GST) taxpayers from artificially manipulating credit UOMI calculations. This option partially meets this criterion. 28. Option 2 represents an improvement on the status quo. Fiscal implications of the options Options Fiscal impact Option 1 – Prevent transfers of excess tax, amend the UOMI and transfer rules. This option results in an unquantifiable fiscal gain resulting from: - preventing taxpayers obtaining credit UOMI they are not entitled to; and - ensuring underpayment UOMI taxpayers must pay to Inland Revenue on underpayments is not artificially reduced. Option 2 - Configure START to apply the current law. This option also results in an unquantifiable fiscal gain resulting from the above; however it would be slightly delayed given that not all tax types will immediately transition to START. 20 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 38 of 160 APPENDIX B –DUE DATES FOR NEW AND INCREASED ASSESSMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER Background – status quo 1. The transit ion from FIRST to START provides opportunities to streamline and improve the way taxpayers and Inland Revenue interact. However, it also presents some challenges due to the different ways FIRST and START operate. One area of opportunity and challenge is the setting of new due dates for new or increased assessments by the Commissioner and the result ing co mplexit ies. 2. The new due date is required to be set 30 or more days after the date of the notice of the assessment. Administrative practice is to set the new due date 60 days after the assessment. Interest starts on the day after the original due date for the payment of the tax. Late payment penalties, however, are imposed on the day after the new due date for the outstanding tax liability if the taxpayer does not pay the tax outstanding plus interest in full by the new due date. These new due date rules result in different due dates in relation to a single tax period which adds complexity to the calculation of interest and penalties. 3. The following diagram shows the differing dates for the calculation of UOMI and penalties for a January 2016 GST return that is not paid and is then reassessed on 16 March 2016. UOMI applies to original assessment LPP applies to original assessment LPP applies to increase in assessment UOMI applies to increase in assessment 29 Feb 2016 Day after original due date 16 Mar 2016 Increas ed assessment 15 May 2016 New due date 16 May 2016 Day after new due date Tod ay 28 Feb 2016 Original due date 4. The following diagram shows how a refund can be released even when the taxpayer has been assessed for a period that has passed its original due date for payment and will be required to pay the assessed amount shortly, and is already incurring UOMI. 21 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 39 of 160 28 Feb 2016 Jan 2016 GST return filed 16 Mar 2016 Increas ed assessment 7 May 2016 Mar 2016 GST return filed 14 May 2016 Mar 2016 GST return process ed $100 assessment paid 27 May 2016 Due date for Jan 2016 GST reassessment $50 assessment increase not yet due Return showing $75 refund filed $75 refund released $50 (+ UOMI) payment required Problem definition 5. Implementing the current legislative framework for setting new due dates in START would require significant customisation and would limit the ability to use some of START’s core functionalities. START has the ability to automatically apply any excess tax or credit that becomes refundable to satisfy a debit amount in the system. This limits underpayment UOMI charged to a taxpayer and also reduces the interaction they are required to have with Inland Revenue. 6. START does this by looking at taxable periods that have passed their due date and whether there is any outstanding amount in relation to these previous periods. However, this period based approach means that the system does not distinguish between a debt (an amount that has passed its due date for payment) and a debit (an amount that relates to a taxable period that has passed its original due date, but that itself is not yet due to be paid). 7. Although this system configuration can be supressed, it would mean significant customisation and manual processing. This would also impact other desirable features of START, such as real-time balancing of taxpayer accounts which provides transparency for taxpayers of what they are required to pay at any time. Options and analysis 8. The status quo and an option for change have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the main objective. The options are: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo by customising START to allow the setting of a new due date for new and increased assessments (status quo). • Option 2: Amend the law so that no new due date is set for a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner for taxable periods that have passed their original due date for payment, but allow time for payment of the assessed amount before late payment penalties are applied (officials’ preferred option) Option 1 9. This option would involve implementing the existing new due date rules for new and amended assessments in START and customising START to the extent needed to allow for 22 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 40 of 160 different due dates (original and new due date(s)) to be created and managed within a single tax period. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option would not meet the main objective as it would require significant customisation of START to an extent that it would limit the use of some of the core functionalities of START. Manually managing transfers and the application of credits against liabilities within START would be required. Owing to the significant complexity involved in manually managing transactions there is potential for error. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers have time to pay a tax liability resulting from a new or increased assessment before late payment penalties are applied. Taxpayers who have a refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will have this refunded to them then be required to make a separate payment on the due date. Taxpayers who are aware of this can ask for the refund to be transferred to meet their liability which may result in lower UOMI than if they have the amount refunded then repaid. This only partially meets the criteria. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Under this option any excess tax or other credit that becomes refundable to the taxpayer in the period between the notice of assessment and the new due date for payment will continue to be refunded to the taxpayer, despite the fact that the taxpayer will be required to make payment of the tax resulting from the notice of assessment to Inland Revenue shortly after receiving this refund (i.e. by the new due date). Manual managing of some transfers and the application of credits in payment of tax and other liabilities would be required, which gives rise to increased resourcing and administrative costs to Inland Revenue. This does not meet the criteria. • Sustainability of the tax system: Due dates and the calculation of interest and penalties for new and increased assessments will continue to be complex. Taxpayers are at a higher risk of incurring penalties and increased interest because overpayments of tax are refunded to the taxpayer unless the taxpayer requests otherwise even where a payment is due shortly after the refund. This does not meet the criteria. Option 2 10. This option would involve a legislative change that the Commissioner would not set a new due date for new or increased assessments. However, the current way interest is calculated would be retained and the date for applying late payment penalties would also be unchanged as they would be imposed 31 or more days after the (re-)assessment. 11. During a Coexistence Period some tax types and social policy products will be administered in START and others in FIRST. In relation to this option this means that during the Coexistence Period taxpayers would be treated differently depending on the tax type that the Commissioner has assessed or re-assessed. For tax types that are administered in START no new due date would be set and refunds or credits becoming available would be applied to the tax liability from the assessment date. Relevant assessments of tax types that are 23 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 41 of 160 administered in FIRST would receive a new due date for payment. Credits and refunds that become available between the assessment date and the new due date would not be applied to offset the new or increased tax liability unless the taxpayer requests otherwise but would be refunded to the taxpayer. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option would meet the objective as it would avoid customisation and minimise complexity of START and allow Inland Revenue to leverage the inherent system funct ionalit y. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers who have no refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will continue to have time to pay tax resulting from a new or increased assessment before late payment penalties are applied. These taxpayers will have the same financial outcome as under the status quo. However, taxpayers who have a refund available in START in the relevant timeframe will have this applied to satisfy their tax liability automatically when it becomes available. This means that these taxpayers would effectively “pay” earlier than is required under status quo; however, this may reduce their UOMI liability. Any further excess credits available would be refunded to the taxpayer. This is an improvement on the status quo. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Compliance costs are reduced for taxpayers whose refunds are applied to satisfy the tax liability arising from a new or increased assessment, instead of receiving a refund and having a payment obligation shortly after. This option would enable Inland Revenue to take advantage of START’s core functionalities in relation to automatic handling of transfers and application of credits to satisfy liabilities within the system and does not require any additional resources and accordingly does not give rise to the efficiency concerns raised in respect of option one. This is a significant improvement on the status quo. • Sustainability of the tax system: Due dates, interest and penalty calculations within a tax period that had a new or increased assessment would be simplified and easier to follow for taxpayers. Revenue collection will be improved. This is an improvement on the status quo. 12. This option represents an improvement on the status quo. Fiscal implications of the options Options Fiscal impact Option 1 – Maintain the status quo None Option 2 – Amend the law A small unquantifiable fiscal loss of UOMI due to automatic application of credit or refund to tax liability is largely offset by an earlier resolution of the tax obligation. 24 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 42 of 160 APPENDIX C – ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRACE PERIODS CONCEPT Background – status quo Late payment penalty grace periods 1. The current legislative framework for penalties sets out that a late payment penalty will be imposed if a taxpayer does not pay on time. 5 However, where the taxpayer has punctually paid all taxes due in the two years prior to the default in question, the Commissioner must first issue a notice to the taxpayer specifying a further date for the unpaid tax, before a late payment penalty can be imposed. This gives the taxpayer a grace period in which to pay the amount owing before the imposition of late payment penalties. 6 2. The application of the late payment penalty grace period is determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s previous compliance in terms of the payment of tax across all relevant tax types (such as GST, income tax and PAYE deductions). 7 3. The transition from FIRST to START will be done on a tax-type by tax-type basis, with GST being transferred to START in early 2017 and income tax, FBT and PAYE being transferred in 2018. This raises an issue with respect to the late payment penalty grace period, as the current legislative framework for the application of the penalty requires the Commissioner to consider the taxpayer’s compliance history across all applicable tax types. Problem definition 4. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity will reside in two systems, it will be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. Without significant manual intervention, or an integration of FIRST and START, Inland Revenue will not be able to administer the current grace period rule. Scale of the problem 5. The manual intervention necessary to look across both systems to see all applicable tax types would require significant resources on the part of Inland Revenue. 6. By way of illustration, the number of customers who could have been eligible for a late payment penalty grace period in respect of the due date of 20 November 2015 was 603,867. If this were to occur during the Coexistence Period (with the status quo retained), this would require 603,867 manual interventions to correctly administer the grace periods rules. 5 A financial penalty for late payment of tax is automatically imposed at 1% on the initial date the tax was due to be paid, at 4% seven days later, and at 1% each month after that. 6 If the taxpayer does not make payment within that notified further period, the late payment penalty is imposed as usual from the day after the original due date. 7 The late payment penalty grace period applies to all tax types except the following: child support, student loan scheme, tax credits (formerly known as rebates), certain types of provisional tax, KiwiSaver voluntary employer contributions and complying fund debt referred to Inland Revenue from the Financial Markets Authority. 25 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 43 of 160 Options and analysis 7. Two options for change and the status quo have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the stated objectives. The options are: • Option 1: Maintain the status quo by manually managing grace periods across FIRST and START (status quo) • Option 2: Integrate FIRST and START to deliver customer level grace periods (integration approach). • Option 3: Amend the law (officials’ preferred option). 8. Within the third option, there are two “sub-options” with respect to the way in which the selected legislative amendment makes provision for the consideration of payment behaviour history. The two “sub-options” are outlined below, as part of the analysis of the third option. Option 1 9. This option would involve continuing to apply the existing grace period rules until all tax types have been transitioned and the implementation of START is complete. As the current rules require a taxpayer’s compliance history across all tax types to be considered, this option would require Inland Revenue to manually manage customer-level grace periods across FIRST and START. Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option partially meets the objective because, while it does not require any additional configuration to the START system and will not present difficulties or complexities for taxpayers, it would require significant manual intervention. • Fairness and equity: Retaining the current grace period regime throughout the Coexistence Period maintains equity among taxpayers as, in all cases, the applicability of a grace period will be determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s compliance across all tax types, irrespective of whether the tax type in question is being administered through FIRST or START. This option meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: This option does not meet this objective in that manually managing grace periods across the two systems would give rise to increased resourcing and administrative costs to Inland Revenue. In addition, it is considered that this option poses a risk to the integrity of Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system due to the significant complexity of and difficulties inherent in manually managing grace periods across two systems, and the risks associated with this. Manually managing grace periods across two systems gives rise to significant potential for error, which could also inadvertently result in different treatment among taxpayers. 26 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 44 of 160 • Sustainability of the tax system: This option preserves the application of the current grace periods rules and therefore will not give rise to any difficulties for taxpayers or to the potential for tax-driven outcomes. There is, however, the potential for this option to give rise to an integrity risk for Inland Revenue, in that manually managing grace periods across two systems will generate significant potential for error. This option partially meets this criterion. Option 2 10. The Integration Approach involves continuing to apply the existing grace period rules and integrating FIRST and START to the extent needed to identify all late payments and determine the appropriate application of grace periods. 11. Integrating FIRST and START for the purpose of managing grace periods would require real-time interfaces in FIRST and START to enable the real-time transfer of information, which would require new code to be written. The new code and real-time interfaces developed for this purpose would only be used for the duration of the Coexistence Period. As this option requires START to be reconfigured, this option does not meet this objective. Assessment against criteria 12. As this option does not meet the overarching objective, it is not a viable option and accordingly does not need to be assessed against the criteria. 13. This option would not lead to any improvement on the status quo. Option 3 14. This option involves amending the legislation to allow grace periods to be managed independently in each of the two systems. 15. The proposed legislative amendment would mean that when a taxpayer defaults on a payment, the Commissioner would only look at information regarding the taxpayer’s previous behaviour that is contained in the system (FIRST or START) from which the tax type in question is being administered when determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. 16. The previous behaviour information that is contained in START will be dependent on the form in which compliance history is brought across to START. The two options for the way in which taxpayer compliance history is brought across to START are outlined below. (a) Customer level indicator 17. The first option with respect to the transfer of compliance history to START is to bring across an indicator that would show when the taxpayer is next entitled to a grace period, based 27 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 45 of 160 on the date that they last paid late. The indicator would encompass the taxpayer’s payment history from February 2015 (two years before GST is brought across to START) to February 2017 in respect of income tax, GST, FBT and PAYE. 18. Although the taxpayer’s payment history across all these tax types will inform the indicator date (the date at which the taxpayer will next be entitled to a grace period) it will not be possible to identify the tax type in respect of which the default has occurred. 19. During Stage 1 of START, this indicator would be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period when they default on a GST payment (where the GST period in issue is a period after the date on which GST was transferred to START). Where the taxpayer defaults on a payment in respect of a tax type that is still being administered through FIRST, the compliance history that exists in FIRST at that time will be used to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period. 20. It should be noted that the indicator will be a “snapshot” of the taxpayer’s compliance history from February 2015 to February 2017. Information relating to the taxpayer’s compliance regarding income tax, PAYE and FBT after February 2017 will not be able to be taken into account in determining whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period when they default on a GST payment after this date. As time passes, there will accordingly be a “compliance history relevance tail-off” in terms of the indicator for the purposes of determining whether the taxpayer will be entitled to a grace period for products remaining in FIRST in respect of defaults in payments of GST. 21. The intention is that a new “compliance indicator” will be brought across when income tax is transitioned to START. Assuming that income tax is transitioned to START in April 2018 (noting that this is only a proposed date), this second indicator would encompass the taxpayer’s payment history from April 2016 (two years before income tax is brought across to START) to April 2018 in respect of income tax, FBT and PAYE. The second indicator would “top up” the relevant compliance history encompassed by the first indicator from February 2019 (the end date of the indicator brought across with GST) to April 2020 (two years from the date on which the second compliance indicator is brought across). As GST will have been operated from START from February 2017, the information that is brought across by the second indicator will not encompass GST. The information relating to the taxpayer’s compliance with respect to GST payments will be required to “supplement” the information on the second indicator. This is illustrated on the diagram below. 28 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 46 of 160 February 2015 April 2014 April 2016 February 2017 GST transition April 2018 INC, PA YE & FBT t rans it io n April 2019 FIRST START GST history in START GST history from FIRST to START Inco me ta x, FBT & PA YE hi st or y in S TA RT Inco me ta x, FBT & PA YE history from FIRST to STA RT GST history in STA RT 22. Compliance information with respect to periods that occur after the tax type in question has transitioned to START will only exist in START and will not be visible in FIRST. (b) Individual tax type compliance history 23. The second option with respect to the transfer of compliance history to START is to only bring across compliance history that relates to the specific tax type that is being transferred. For stage one, only the customer’s compliance history that relates to GST would be transferred across to START. This option would mean that, if a taxpayer misses a payment date, the Commissioner would only look at the taxpayer’s previous behaviour regarding payments made in respect of the tax type in question, and any other tax types administered from the same system, when determining whether or not to impose a penalty. 24. During stage 1 of the implementation of START, this would mean that the timeliness of a taxpayer’s GST payments would be considered in isolation from all other tax types. As the Business Transformation Programme continues and more tax types are moved from FIRST to START, a more holistic view of the timeliness of a taxpayer’s payment history would once again be considered when deciding whether to apply a late payment penalty. 25. Compliance information with respect to periods that occur after the tax type in question has transitioned to START will only exist in START and will not be visible in FIRST. Required legislative amendments 26. Irrespective of which of the compliance history options is selected, the third option will require legislative amendment to ensure that the Commissioner is able to only look at the compliance history that exists within the system from which the tax type in question (the tax type in respect of which there has been a payment default) is being administered. 29 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 47 of 160 Assessment against objective and criteria • Main objective: This option will not require any additional configuration to START, irrespective of which of the compliance history options is selected. This option therefore meets the objective. • Fairness and equity: This option raises an issue with respect to horizontal equit y in that, during the period in which different tax types are administered out of different systems, some taxpayers will be able to benefit from a grace period to which they would previously not have been entitled. The way in which this could arise is illustrated by the following hypothetical examples: 8 (i) The date is 31 August 2017. Taxpayer 1 is a small business owner who fails to pay their GST liability by the 28 August 2017 due date. They were two weeks late in paying their PAYE liability by the 20 June 2017 due date. As the PAYE period in which they defaulted occurred after GST and the compliance history indicator was transferred to START, this will not be able to be considered in determining whether Taxpayer 1 will be entit led to a grace period in respect of their late payment of GST for the period ended 28 June 2017. Taxpayer 1 will accordingly be entitled to a grace period to which they would not, under the current system, have been entitled. (ii) The date is 31 August 2017. Taxpayer 2 is a small business owner who fails to pay their PAYE liability by the 20 August 2017 due date. They were also two weeks late in paying their GST liability by the 28 June 2017 due date. As the GST period in which they defaulted occurred after GST was transferred to START, this will not be able to be considered by FIRST in determining whether Taxpayer 2 should be entitled to a grace period in respect of their late payment of PAYE for the period ended 20 August 2017. Taxpayer 2 will accordingly be entitled to a grace period to which they would not, under the current system, have been entitled. (iii) The date is 30 June 2017. Taxpayer 3 is a small business owner who fails to pay their PAYE liability (of one period) by the 20 June 2017 due date. They were two weeks late in paying last year’s income tax liability, due 7 April 2016. A late payment penalty will automatically be imposed, as PAYE and income tax will still be being administered within the FIRST system. Taxpayer 3 will not be ent it led to a grace period, as they were late in paying the income tax they owed last year. Viewed against the previous two examples, this scenario illustrates how, under option 3, taxpayers’ entitlements to a grace period will to some extent be dependent on the tax type in respect of which they have made a late payment and the system through which this tax type is being administered. It should be noted that option (b) with respect to the way in which compliance history is brought across to START gives rise to a slightly greater issue with respect to horizontal 8 It is assumed, for the purpose of these scenarios, that the taxpayer has not defaulted on any payments other than those stated in the examples. 30 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 48 of 160 equity (in that the number of scenarios in which a taxpayer could be afforded a grace period to which they would, under the current system, have previously not been entitled is greater). This is illustrated by a comparison of the two compliance history options in the following example: (iv) The date is 28 June 2017. Taxpayer 4 fails to pay their GST payment due on 28 June 2017. They previously defaulted on their income tax payment due on 7 April 2016. If option (a), the compliance history indicator, is selected as the way in which compliance history should be transferred to START, Taxpayer 4 will not be entitled to a grace period, as information relating to their payment history in respect of all tax types (including income tax) from February 2015 to February 2017 will have been transferred to START. If option (b), the individual tax type compliance history, is selected as the way in which compliance history should be transferred to START, Taxpayer 4 will be entitled to a grace period, as only historical information concerning their payment behaviour with respect to GST will be brought across to START. In light of this, it is considered that the preferred option with respect to the way in which co mpliance history is transitioned to START is option (a), the customer-level indicator. It is noted, however, that the legislative amendment option with the customer-level indicator does not result in an improvement to the status quo with respect to the fairness and equity criterion. The fact that some taxpayers will be able to benefit from a grace period to which they would not otherwise have been entitled means that this option only partially meets the fairness and equity criterion. The status quo meets this criterion. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: As this option will enable grace periods to be managed independently in each system, it will not give rise to any compliance or administration issues. This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo, as it will not require any manual management and will therefore not require any additional resources. • Sustainability of the tax system: This option will not give rise to any difficulties for taxpayers or to the potential for tax-driven outcomes. This option represents a significant improvement on the status quo as it does not give rise to the potential for error as a result of manual intervention. 27. Overall, this option would represent an improvement on the status quo. 31 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 49 of 160 Fiscal implications of the options Options Fiscal impact Option 1 – Status quo This option does not result in any fiscal impact as it maintains the current grace periods legislative provisions. Option 2 – Integration Approach This option does not result in any fiscal impact as it maintains the current grace periods legislative provisions. Option 3 – Officials’ preferred option This option results in a fiscal loss in that it gives rise to instances where a taxpayer could be granted a grace period to which they would not, under the current rules, have been entitled. A fiscal loss will be incurred in each year of the Coexistence Period, as follows: • June 2015 – June 2016: $0.1 million • June 2016 – June 2017: $1.5 million • June 2017 – June 2018: $1.3 million • June 2018 – June 2019: $0.1 million • June 2019 – June 2020: $0.1 million The fiscal loss detailed above has been calculated on the basis of option (a), the customer-level indicator, being selected as the way in which compliance history is brought across to START. Option (b), the individual tax type compliance history option, would result in a slightly higher fiscal cost due to it resulting in a greater number of instances in which a taxpayer could be afforded a grace period to which they would not have been entitled. 32 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 50 of 160 Regulatory Impact Statement Implementing New Zealand’s commitment to Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) Agency Disclosure Statement Th is Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to determine how best to give effect to New Zealand’s commitments to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters. The AEOI standard is a global framework for cooperation between countries in the detection and prevention of tax evasion. Specifically, the AEOI standard responds to international concerns that individuals and entities can relatively easily evade their tax obligations by concealing their wealth in ‘off-shore’ financial accounts. Ne w Zealand’s international commitments to implement the AEOI standard were made in 2014 and in 2016 Cabinet supplemented those commitments with a decision to commence AEOI obligations from 1 July 2017. For this reason, this RIS is concerned solely with implementing AEOI and detailed design matters. Th ree implementation options and the status quo are assessed in this RIS. The exact form that these options will take in practice depends on the specific design features that are ultimately decided upon. Given this and the fact that there is limited data about who may be impacted and how they may be affected by AEOI it is not possible to accurately estimate some of the costs involved (such as compliance costs) and benefits associated with each of the options. Even so, we have undertaken several rounds of consultation with financial institutions and their representative bodies (the most affected by AEOI), government agencies, and the general tax community, and the feedback from consultation has helped to inform our high- level assessment of the nature and extent of the costs and benefits. It is acknowledged that implementing the AEOI will involve potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. Ad dit io nally, the AEOI initiative will only be successful if jurisdictions implement AEOI on the same timeline and with consistent rules. If some jurisdictions are allowed to lag behind or implement to a lesser standard, the off-shore tax evasion problem is likely to simply relocate to those jurisdictions. Th ere are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis undertaken. The preferred option is to adopt a balanced approach to implementation that seeks to minimise compliance costs and administrative where possible, provided those choices do not result in New Zealand failing to meet international expectations. 3 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 51 of 160 None of the policy options considered would restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles. Emma Grigg Policy Director, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13 May 2016 2 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 52 of 160 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) deals with the question of how best to give effect to New Zealand’s commitments to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters ( in short, Automatic Exchange of Information, or AEOI). 2. New Zealand’s international commitments to implement the AEOI standard were made on:  7 May 2014, by joining in a general declaration of support for the AEOI initiative issued at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting;  3 June 2014, by signing an administrative instrument 1 that sets out the terms for AEOI exchanges (the jurisdictions we will exchange wit h are still to be specified 2 ); and  16 November 2014, by reiterating our commitment at the November 2014 G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane. 3. These commitments were general in nature. In February 2016, Cabinet supplemented the commitments with a decision that the start date from which AEOI obligations will apply in New Zealand will be 1 July 2017. From this date, financial institutions must start collecting the information needed for subsequent exchange. Although 1 July 2017 is later than the start date adopted by most other jurisdict ions, it aligns with Australia’s start date. International considerations 4. AEOI is a global framework for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of tax evasion. 3 Specifically, AEOI responds to international concerns that individuals and entities can, with relative ease, evade their tax obligations by concealing their wealth in ‘off-shore’ financial accounts. 5. Jurisdict ions implementing AEOI must:  enact legislation that will impose obligations on financial institutions to collect and report information to their local tax authorit y on accounts held or (in certain circumstances) controlled by non-residents; and  establish the legal mechanisms (primarily tax treaties) necessary for exchanging that information with other jurisdict ions. 6. The exchanged information will be used by the receiving jurisdiction to ensure that their tax residents have correctly reported off-shore income for tax purposes. 1 The OECD Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (MCAA) 2 Determining these jurisdictions will be subject to a separate process, as explained at paragraphs 120 and 121 below. 3 AEOI forms part of the wider picture of a focus on cross-border tax compliance, both internationally (for example, the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative which primarily relates to multinational enterprises) and domestically (for example, GST and online shopping). 3 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 53 of 160 7. This RIS pertains solely to the above requirement to enact legislation. It contains only passing references to certain necessary associated processes (for example, the publishing of New Zealand-specific lists of exchange partners and excluded entities/accounts) and legal mechanisms for exchange. 8. The AEOI initiative will only be successful if jurisdictions implement AEOI on the same timeline and with consistent rules. If so me jurisdictions lag behind or implement to a lesser standard, the off-shore tax evasion problem is likely to simply relocate to those jurisdict ions. 9. Accordingly, the G20 has taken a strong stance on ensuring that jurisdictions implement AEOI on a consistent and timely basis. Similar to the global standard for Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), the AEOI standard constitutes ‘soft law’ (that is, international recommendations that are effectively mandatory, rather than just ‘best practice’). 10. As regards consistency, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum) has been tasked by the G20 wit h conducting peer reviews and on-going monitoring to ensure that jurisdictions implement the standard as it is set out in the OECD documentation. 11. As regards timing, the G20 and OECD have identified a target group of 101 countries that must implement AEOI on a timeline that will enable first exchanges to be completed by 30 September 2018. The target group includes all G20 and OECD member countries, and any other jurisdictions that have been identified as having or operating as an international finance centre are expected to implement AEOI on a similar timeline. As an OECD member country, New Zealand is included in the target group. 12. To clarify, 1 July 2017 will be the start date from which New Zealand financial inst itutions are to begin collecting information for subsequent reporting to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue must then exchange that information with tax treaty partners by 30 September 2018. 13. All 101 jurisdictions in the above target group have committed to implement AEOI according to the G20 requirements. A small number of these, referred to as ‘early adopters’, have committed to complete their first exchanges a year earlier than the September 2018 deadline. 14. Jurisdictions outside of the target group do not face implementation deadlines as they are not considered to pose a significant risk in the context of off-shore tax evasion. 4 Domestic considerations 15. The principal benefit for New Zealand in implementing AEOI lies in the information we will receive reciprocally from our treaty partners. This information will be available to 4 Many of these jurisdictions may nevertheless implement AEOI. In the main, they are smaller developing countries. International organisations concerned with implementing the global Post-2015 Development and Financing for Development agendas are factoring AEOI implementation into their work programmes, as a key aspect of the ‘domestic resource mobilisation’ element of that agenda. 4 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 54 of 160 Inland Revenue to verify that its tax residents are correctly reporting off-shore financial assets and/or income. 16. To the extent that this facilitates a reduction in tax evasion (either through evasion actually detected, or more generally by deterring such activity), New Zealand will derive fiscal benefits. AEOI can generally also be expected to enhance voluntary tax compliance, through improved taxpayer perceptions that everyone is paying their fair share of tax. 17. New Zealand has been a strong supporter of all international initiatives to improve transparency and international cooperation in tax matters. There will be reputational benefits for New Zealand from being seen to be compliant with international standards. 18. It is acknowledged that AEOI implementation will impose potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. However, failure to implement AEOI, or to implement AEOI to a lesser standard so as to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs would damage New Zealand’s international reputation. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) 19. New Zealand’s enabling legislation will largely involve imposing obligations on financial institutions. These obligations are set out in a key element of the AEOI standard referred to as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). 20. The rules set out in the CRS (as clarified and supplemented in the accompanying OECD commentary) are complex. In broad terms, incorporating the CRS into New Zealand domestic law will involve imposing due diligence and reporting obligations on New Zealand financial institutions in respect of their financial accounts. 21. Due diligence will be undertaken to identify the tax residence of:  the account holders; and  the controlling persons of accounts held by certain passive entities. 22. The due diligence procedures are highly prescriptive. In very generalised terms:  in respect of pre-existing accounts (accounts already open as at 1 July 2017), financial institutions will generally be allowed to rely on documentation already held for other purposes (particularly that collected for AML/CFT or other ‘know- your-customer’ purposes) to determine the tax residence of each account holder and (where relevant) controlling person;  in respect of new accounts (accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017), financial institutions will generally determine tax residence by obtaining a self-certification from each account holder and (where relevant) controlling person; and  the passive entity account holders to be ‘looked through’ to determine their controlling persons are those that (i) are not themselves financial institutions, and (ii) have assets that primarily produce or are held for the production of passive 5 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 55 of 160 income (such as interest or dividends) – entities that meet these criteria are referred to as passive non-financial entities (passive NFEs). 23. Financial institutions will be required to report (on an annual basis) the following information to Inland Revenue:  In respect of account holders or controlling persons that have been identified as tax residents of jurisdictions that have implemented AEOI, 5 they must generally report: – identity information such as name, address, and (in defined circumstances) date of birth and tax identification number; and – financial account information such as account balances and interest, dividends and other income earned.  If they have been unable to determine the status of an account, they are required to report the account as an ‘undocumented account’ in defined circumstances. 24. The CRS also requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and address non-compliance. This includes appropriate anti- avoidance rules, document retention requirements, auditing programmes, and sanctions to deal with identified non-compliance. Jurisdictions are specifically required to follow up on any undocumented accounts that are reported. 25. The CRS contains exclusions for certain categories of financial institution and financial account that are considered to pose a low risk of facilitating or being used for tax evasion. However, in some cases the criteria for exclusion are not automatic, and require submissions to be made by the financial institutions concerned. These criteria are very stringent. The application of the criteria in such cases will be dealt with as a stage two implementation matter. The process will involve Inland Revenue calling for submissions, and if possible making the necessary determinations before the end of 2016. New Zealand’s precedents and existing mechanisms 26. New Zealand has had an active exchange of information programme for many years. This primarily operates on the basis of responding to specific requests for information, but certain categories of information are subject to automatic exchange. As yet, we only automatically exchange financial account information wit h one country – the United States (US), pursuant to their 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative. 27. FATCA operates on a similar basis to AEOI, in that New Zealand financial institutions are required to identify accounts held or controlled by US tax residents or citizens 6 5 Note that the option of a ‘wider approach’, which would capture non-residents from all jurisdictions, not just those in jurisdictions we will exchange information with is elaborated on below in this report. 6 The reference here to ‘citizens’ is a key point of difference from AEOI. AEOI only applies to tax residents, reflecting the fact that most countries only tax the worldwide income of persons who are tax resident. The US, however, also applies this approach to citizens, regardless of whether they are also tax residents of the US. 6 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 56 of 160 Financial account information on those accounts is then reported to Inland Revenue, which automatically exchanges the information with the US. 28. The framework legislat ion for FATCA in New Zealand is contained in Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The detailed rules are set out in an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the US that has been given legislative effect in New Zealand by Order in Council. 29. Part 11B of the Act contemplates entering into similar arrangements with other countries. Strictly, therefore, New Zealand legislation already provides for automatic exchange of financial account informat ion with countries other than the US. However, the legislation as currently framed requires entering into further arrangements through treaties similar to the US IGA. This does not match the approach taken by the G20 and OECD for AEOI. 30. FATCA and AEOI rely in part on information already required to be collected by financial inst itutions from account holders, particularly under AML/CFT ‘know-your- customer’ requirements. However, the overlap between the AML/CFT requirements is not an exact match for those applying under the CRS. For example, under New Zealand’s AML/CFT laws a financial institution may not collect all of the information required by the CRS in respect of discretionary trusts. Accordingly, in some areas, the AEOI due diligence obligations will require information to be obtained that is not required under AML/CFT laws. 31. Although AEOI exchanges can be made under other tax treaties, international expectations are that most, if not all, AEOI exchanges will take place under the OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convention). New Zealand signed the Multilateral Convention in 2012. OBJECTIVES 32. The policy options considered in this RIS will be assessed against the following objectives: (a) To implement AEOI in a way that ensures consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying commentary so as to enable New Zealand to: (i) meet international expectations; (ii) comply with the international deadline of 30 September 2018 for completing first exchanges; and (iii) successfully undergo Global Forum peer review. (This objective reflects the aim of achieving sustainability and fairness in an international environment that is focused on establishing a global level playing field through implementation consistency.) 7 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 57 of 160 (b) To implement AEOI in a manner that maximises the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits. (This objective is primarily concerned with efficiency and sustainability.) (c) To implement AEOI in a manner that minimises the compliance costs that will be imposed on financial inst itutions. (This objective is primarily concerned with fairness and efficiency.) (d) To implement AEOI in a manner that minimises the administrative costs that will be imposed on New Zealand regulatory agencies. (This objective is primarily concerned with efficiency.) 33. These objectives are listed in descending order of importance. 34. Objective (a) is the overarching consideration, given that New Zealand’s implementation of the AEOI standard will be subject to peer review and other international scrutiny. The identification of deficiencies would damage New Zealand’s international reputation and result in international and domestic pressure to take immediate remedial action. More generally failure to implement AEOI correctly could result in suspicion of New Zealand’s motives, potentially leading to greater scrutiny of the off-shore activities of New Zealand tax residents and adding to the cost for New Zealanders of doing business internationally. 35. Objective (b) reflects the objective of the AEOI standard, which is to facilitate the detection and prevention of off-shore tax evasion. Implementation is not just about compliance wit h an international imperative. The ultimate purpose of AEOI is to improve tax compliance and provide fiscal benefit s to jurisdict ions. It is important that this objective be viewed as a key focus. 36. Objectives (c) and (d) reflect acknowledgement that implementing AEOI will impose potentially significant compliance costs on financial institutions and administrative costs on New Zealand regulatory agencies. However, implementation decisions to reduce compliance and/or administrative costs should only be made if that is achievable without lowering the overall effectiveness of the standard in New Zealand or being seen as undermining the multilateral initiative. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 37. Four policy options have been considered for implementing the AEOI standard described above:  Option 1: Maintain the status quo – that is, do not implement AEOI.  Option 2: A low cost approach – that is, to implement AEOI on the basis of design decisions that favour minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue over meeting international expectations.  Option 3: A balanced approach – that is, to implement AEOI on the basis of implementation decisions that strike a balance between minimising compliance 8 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 58 of 160 costs for financial institutions and minimising administrative costs for New Zealand regulatory agencies and meeting international expectations.  Option 4: A high cost approach – that is, to implement AEOI on the basis o f implementation decisions that favour meeting international expectations over minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 38. The ‘Implementation’ section of this RIS discusses key design features of AEOI. Some of these features are specifically referred to in the analysis of the options below in order to highlight key differences between the options. Option 1: Maintain the status quo 39. Option 1 would not meet any of the objectives and is not considered to be tenable. A decision not to implement AEOI would mean New Zealand defaulting on commitments and result in international (and domestic) crit icism and reputational damage. Option 2: Low cost approach 40. This option would involve making design decisions that would favour minimising compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue over meeting international expectations. 41. Examples would involve lenient phase-in options (as discussed in paragraphs 120 to 121) not contemplated by the CRS and limiting due diligence for CRS purposes to existing due diligence requirements under AML/CFT laws (as discussed in paragraphs 115 to 117). 7 42. Option 2 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. Objective (a) – Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 43. Design decisions that favour minimising compliance costs as described above would in most cases fall short of the CRS requirements, and would result in failed peer review. 44. The consequences of failing peer review have not been articulated by the G20 or OECD. At a minimum New Zealand would face reputational damage. At the extreme, it is possible that we could face international sanctions. In any case, New Zealand would come under intense pressure to rectify any deficiencies, effectively meaning that any damage incurred will have been for litt le gain. 45. Therefore, option 2 does not meet this objective. Objective (b) – Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 7 As noted, AEOI due diligence depends to a significant degree on information obtained for AML/CFT purposes. However, there are gaps where AEOI due diligence obligations go beyond AML/CFT requirements. 9 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 59 of 160 46. The benefits to New Zealand from implementing AEOI primarily lie in the reciprocal information other jurisdictions will provide to Inland Revenue about New Zealand tax residents. Lowering the standard and quality of the information New Zealand provides to other jurisdictions will not directly affect this benefit. 47. However, it is possible that some jurisdictions might respond by refusing to provide information to New Zealand. 48. Aside from the benefit of reciprocal information, AEOI implementation will provide other benefits such as reputational benefits and enhancing voluntary compliance in tax matters. These benefits would be adversely compromised. 49. Therefore, this option partially meets the objective. Objective (c) – Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 50. As noted above, this option would be aimed at minimising compliance costs for financial institutions so meets the objective. Objective (d) – Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 51. This option would be aimed at minimising administrative costs for Inland Revenue so meets the objective. Option 3: A balanced approach 52. Option 3 recognises that it is possible to implement AEOI in a way that enables New Zealand to meet international expectations while making choices that seek to minimise compliance costs and administrative costs. 53. The CRS is set by the OECD, and implementation will largely involve incorporating its rules (as clarified and supplemented by the OECD commentary) directly into domestic law. However, the CRS itself provides implementing jurisdictions with a number of options that can be taken. Adopting these options may assist in reducing compliance costs and administrative costs. 54. Outside of the options specifically contemplated by the CRS, other decisions could be taken under option 3 which would bear a low risk of exposure to international criticism. Key examples include:  the timing for phasing in certain due diligence obligations (such as allowing 24- months to complete due diligence of pre-existing entity accounts, rather than the 12-months provided by Australia – see paragraphs 106 to 109), and  allowing a transitional period in respect of enforcement – during which financial institutions identified as not complying with their obligations could mount a ‘reasonable endeavours’ defence and be allowed a reasonable period of time to rectify any errors (see paragraph 121). 55. Option 3 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. 10 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 60 of 160 Option (a) – Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 56. Design decisio ns under this option would be made on the basis of mitigating compliance costs and administrative costs wherever possible. In some cases, this may involve a judgement call whether CRS requirements would or would not be met. 57. The transitional approach to enforcement demonstrates this point. Although the CRS generally leaves the design of an effective enforcement regime up to jurisdictions, the terms of reference and methodology for peer reviews have not yet been set by the Global Forum. 58. Decisions made on the basis of option 3 would therefore involve some potential risk that peer review will determine that CRS requirements have not been met. However, the risk of reputational damage arising from the identification of deficiencies in peer review would be low, given that the decision was made on the basis of a judgement call that CRS requirements were met. 59. Therefore, this objective is met. Option (b) – Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 60. The balanced approach to implementation should have no adverse implications in terms of the benefits likely to accrue to New Zealand from AEOI implementation so meets the objective. Option (c) – Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 61. The balanced approach to implementation would represent an attempt to minimise compliance costs to the extent possible so this objective is met. Option (d) – Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 62. The balanced approach to implementation would represent an attempt to minimise administrative costs to the extent possible, so meets this objective. Option 4: High cost approach 63. Option 4 would carry the least risk of internat ional crit icism. In contrast to option 3, which involves making some judgment calls as to whether CRS requirements have been met, option 4 would involve a greater focus on meeting those requirements. However, this approach would result in the imposit ion o f some compliance costs on financial institutions that could otherwise have been mitigated. 64. For example, under this approach, the transitional approach to enforcement would not be contemplated. 65. Option 4 has been measured against the objectives listed in paragraph 32 above. 11 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 61 of 160 Option (a) – Consistency with the requirements of the CRS and its accompanying documentation 66. Under this option, all design decisions would be made on the basis of meeting CRS requirements, so this objective would clearly be met. Option (b) – Maximise the opportunity for New Zealand to derive domestic and international benefits 67. The high cost approach to implementation will have no adverse implications in terms of the benefits likely to accrue to New Zealand from AEOI implementation. Therefore, this objective is met. Option (c) – Minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions 68. The high cost approach to implementation would not attempt to minimise the compliance costs to be imposed on financial institutions so this objective is not met. Option (d) – Minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on Inland Revenue 69. The high cost approach to implementation would not attempt to minimise the administrative costs to be imposed on financial institutions so this objective is not met. Administrative impacts 70. In order to implement AEOI, a secure technology platform capable of receiving, storing and aggregating information from financial institutions in accordance with the CRS and exchanging it with other tax authorities is needed. Additionally, guidance and support must be provided to financial institutions to enable them to meet their obligations in full. Inland Revenue will also be responsible for the effective enforcement of AEOI. Social, environment or cultural impacts 71. There will be no negative social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options identified above. CONSULTATION 72. Several rounds of consultation were undertaken with affected parties including financial inst itutions and their representative bodies, the umbrella groups such as the New Zealand Law Society and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand and a number of Government agencies, including those concerned with New Zealand’s privacy laws and anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws. 73. In February 2016, an Officials’ issues paper entitled Implementing the global standard on automatic exchange of information was released for public consultation. 21 submissions were received on the paper. 12 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 62 of 160 74. None of the submissions received on the issues paper proposed that New Zealand not proceed with implementation. This suggests that there is widespread acceptance of the need to implement AEOI to meet international expectations and to carry through with the commitment New Zealand has already made to implement AEOI. 75. The submissions often expressed a wide divergence of views as to how AEOI should be implemented. However, some common themes emerged, including:  A strong preference for New Zealand to align its implementation decisions, where possible, with those taken internationally – and in particular with Australia. – Alignment with Australia seems particularly relevant in the context of New Zealand banks that are owned by Australian parents. But it is also relevant for financial institutions that have trans-Tasman financial products or an Australian client base.  A strong preference that, where the CRS permits implementing jurisdictions to provide financial institutions with a choice of due diligence and reporting procedures, that choice should be available to institutions.  A strong preference that financial institutions should not be required to obtain or report information about accounts unless the information is specifically required under the CRS or because of a choice that they have made. – This point essentially responds to an OECD suggestion that implementing jurisdictions could consider going further than the CRS requirements in certain areas – for example by making it mandatory to collect tax identification numbers or date of birth information in all cases (whereas the base expectation under the CRS is that for pre-existing accounts financial institutions do not need to go beyond reasonable endeavours to obtain this information). A further example is whether to require reporting of controlling persons of passive NFEs that are New Zealand residents. – The one exception to this point is the proposed application of the ‘wider’ approach to CRS due diligence (and reporting), outlined below. As will be noted, there was strong support for adopting the wider approach, to due diligence in particular.  A strong preference that New Zealand should, where possible look to align the entities and accounts that will be excluded from CRS obligations with the entities and accounts that are excluded for FATCA. Some submitters noted that this alignment should also apply to entities and accounts that are excluded under New Zealand’s AML/CFT regime.  A strong preference that New Zealand should, where possible, look to align CRS due diligence procedures with those carried out under FATCA and New Zealand’s AML/CFT regime, so that any additional AEOI due diligence is minimised. (There was widespread acceptance that the information that needs to be reported under AEOI will be different from that reported under these other regimes.) 13 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 63 of 160  A strong preference that New Zealand should adopt a ‘soft landing’ approach to addressing any non-compliance with CRS. (Essentially, that is, to take a light or transitional approach to penalising non-compliance.) 76. All of the points raised in submissions and in consultation discussions have been considered. 77. Those that would lead to a high risk of international criticism and failing peer review have generally been ruled out. In this regard, it is worth reiterating that the AEOI standard is a global standard and its success depends on consistent application across jurisdictions. 78. However, some submissions have helped to shape key design decisions. A notable example is the proposed transit ional approach to enforcement. Other examples include decisions to allow optionality, to align with the FATCA reporting period, and to align with the Australian wider approach for due diligence and reporting 8 . 79. A number of public sector agencies were consulted including the Treasury. Given the strong links with New Zealand’s AML/CFT laws, addit ional consultat ion was held wit h AML Regulators (the Department of Internal Affairs, the Financial Markets Authority, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand). The Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were specifically consulted in respect of privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 80. Inland Revenue supports the adoption of option 3 (the balanced approach) on the basis that it meets all of the objectives. Consistency with the CRS Maximise the benefits for NZ Minimise compliance costs Minimise administrative costs Low cost approach     Balanced approach     High cost approach     Key:  = meets,  = partially meets,  = does not meet 81. Option 1 (the status quo) is not supported because it is not tenable. Options 2 and 4 are not supported because they do not meet all of the objectives. In particular, option 2 would result in New Zealand failing to meet international expectations, whereas option 4 would meet international expectations but impose compliance costs and administrative costs that could otherwise be mitigated. 8 We note, however, that although Australia has opted to make the wider approach mandatory in all cases, New Zealand will allow the wider approach to be optional in the case of reporting. 14 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 64 of 160 IMPLEMENTATION 82. Option 3 would involve implementing AEOI on the basis of balanced implementation decisions that reduce compliance costs for financial institutions and administrative costs for Inland Revenue where possible, but only to the extent that those decisions would not jeopardise New Zealand’s ability to meet international expectations. Key design features 83. The key design features of the preferred option are outlined below. Optionality 84. As noted above, the CRS is set by the OECD, and implementation will largely involve incorporating its rules directly into domestic law. However, the CRS itself provides implementing countries with a number of options that can be taken. 85. For the most part it is proposed to leave these optio ns open to the financial institution, so that they can choose the option that best suits their particular circumstances. 86. For example, for consistency the CRS sets certain default due diligence thresholds in US currency, such as a threshold of US$1,000,000 for distinguishing between high value and lower value individual accounts 9 . However, the CRS allows jurisdictions to substitute their local currency. Many financial institutions might find compliance cost savings in not having to convert NZ$ balances to US$ equivalents to determine if the threshold has been exceeded (and simply treating the high value threshold as being NZ$ 1,000,000). Other financial institutions, particularly those that operate in several jurisdictions, might prefer the consistency of applying the same threshold amount in the same currency in all the jurisdictions in which they operate. The proposed approach, in such cases, is to allow each financial institution to choose their threshold. Submissions strongly endorsed this approach. 87. In certain other cases, where consistency is important or is required by the CRS, the taking of an option will need to be mandated in legislation (that is, not left to financial institutions to decide). Two key examples of this are the reporting period and wider approach to due diligence, discussed below. 88. In deciding on what option to take in this regard (which all financial institutions would be required to apply) it is proposed that the decision is taken that results in the least compliance costs for financial institutions as a whole and that is consistent with CRS obligations (and in accordance with New Zealand’s international obligations). 89. Public submissions generally endorsed this approach to optionalit y. 90. There are also a number of parts of the CRS where implementing jurisdictions have the option of requiring financial institutions to obtain and report certain information beyo nd the CRS base due diligence and reporting expectations. It is proposed for the most part (with the exception of the wider approach to due diligence) that financial institutions should not be required to obtain information about accounts unless the information is 9 In broad terms, financial institutions need to carry out more extensive due diligence procedures for high value accounts. 15 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 65 of 160 specifically required under the CRS or because of a choice that they have made. Submissions strongly supported this approach to optionality Reporting period 91. The CRS due diligence and reporting obligations operate on the basis of annual ‘reporting periods’. Jurisdictions may choose whether to adopt a calendar year or other appropriate period for this purpose. 92. Australia and most other countries have adopted the calendar year (for both CRS and FATCA). The reporting period New Zealand adopted for FATCA purposes was the tax year (that is, the year ending 31 March). 93. The majorit y o f submitters considered that New Zealand should adopt the tax year for CRS due diligence and reporting, to align with both the New Zealand tax year and the period used for other reporting and regulatory purposes, especially FATCA. 94. Some submitters proposed that this period be ‘optional’. However, it is implicit in the CRS that each jurisdiction will have one period governing due diligence, reporting and exchanging. 95. On balance, the tax year (that is, the period ended 31 March), would provide better domestic alignment, including with FATCA. This will allow financial institutions to better integrate their CRS systems with other existing reporting systems, so overall should assist in minimising compliance costs. 96. Moreover, when combined with the New Zealand start date of 1 July 2017, a 31 December reporting period end date would result in a first reporting period of only six months. A 31 March reporting period end date would result in a fir st reporting period of nine months, giving financial institutions more time to complete the due diligence reviews required by the CRS in that first period. (See below under ‘initial reporting period’.) 97. For reasons of certainty, consistency and simplicity, it is proposed to mandate the tax year as the reporting period, rather than allowing financial institutions the choice. 98. It is also proposed that financial institutions be required to report CRS information to Inland Revenue by 30 June in line with the FATCA reporting deadline. This will help ensure that Inland Revenue has sufficient time to then process the information for exchange by the 30 September deadline. 99. In this regard note that Australia allows until 31 July rather than 30 June. Aligning with Australia’s 31 July date would allow New Zealand financial institutions more time to report. However, it would shorten the time available for Inland Revenue to prepare the information for exchange from three months to two months. Given the possible need for Inland Revenue to identify and clarify irregularities or deficiencies with financial institution reports (particularly in the initial years of implementation), two months would pose material risks. 16 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 66 of 160 Initial reporting period 100. The CRS contemplates due diligence reviews of pre-existing high value individual accounts being undertaken within the first reporting period. 101. Most jurisdictions implementing AEOI will have a start date of 1 January and will operate on the basis of a calendar year reporting period, allowing a full 12 months to conduct these reviews. In contrast, the proposed New Zealand start date of 1 July 2017 and reporting period end date of 31 March will prima facie only allow New Zealand financial institutions nine months (that is 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018) to complete these initial reviews. This potentially disadvantages New Zealand financial institutions as compared with financial institutions of other countries. 102. Australia has the same 1 July start date as New Zealand, but has a reporting period end date of 31 December. Therefore Australia’s first reporting period will only be six months. As this would prima facie only allow six months for completing due diligence of pre-existing high value individual accounts, Australia has adopted a compromise approach that involves allowing additional time to complete the reviews of pre-existing high value individual accounts, albeit still reporting the required information (such as account balances) in the first report. 103. The mechanism is complex, but in essence Australia will allow financial institutions to carry out due diligence on pre-existing high value individual accounts until 31 July 2018 (essentially allowing 13 months for due diligence on such accounts) provided that such accounts are reported in the first report. 104. It is proposed to adopt a similar approach for New Zealand. The 30 June deadline will apply for the purposes of completing due diligence reviews of pre-existing high value individual accounts and reporting the information to Inland Revenue. Under this approach, financial institutions can continue conducting due diligence on high value accounts past the 31 March reporting period end date, provided they report the information about any reportable high value accounts identified in this review to Inland Revenue by 30 June. 105. The same approach will apply for the following year, for the due diligence reviews of pre-existing low value individual accounts and pre-existing entity accounts (that is, allowing review and reporting by 30 June 2019). Time for completing due diligence reviews of pre-existing entity accounts 106. The OECD documentation is (slightly) ambiguous on the expected time-frame for completing due diligence for pre-existing entity accounts. Most countries appear to be reading the documentation as generally allowing 24 months for these reviews. Australia initially proposed 24 months, but in their implementation legislation enacted in March 2016, ultimately only allowed 12 months. 107. The due diligence for pre-existing entity accounts is expected to be more challenging for financial institutions than due diligence for accounts held by individuals, particularly given that look-through rules apply to accounts held by passive NFEs. In this context, allowing 24 months rather than 12 months to complete these reviews would seem appropriate and broadly aligns with FATCA due diligence time-frames for reviewing such accounts. 17 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 67 of 160 108. Although submissions generally call for alignment with Australia where possible, alignment with the Australian 12 month period for entity accounts may be a step too far, particularly given the tight time-frames for New Zealand’s implementation. 109. It is proposed to retain the 24 month due diligence period for completing due diligence reviews of pre-existing entity accounts, and not to follow the Australian approach to this issue. Wider approach 110. During the development of the CRS, private sector interests raised concerns with the OECD that the number of jurisdictions participating in the AEOI initiative can be expected to increase over time. Each new country joining the initiative would trigger a requirement for financial institutions to conduct a new round of due diligence reviews of accounts. This could be prevented by treating all jurisdictions as reportable jurisdictions for due diligence purposes. This approach would have a significant compliance cost saving, and we are not aware of any jurisdiction not adopting the wider approach to due diligence. Submissions strongly endorsed this approach. 111. For consistency, to prevent confusion for customers, and to avoid putting financial institutions that adopt the wider approach at a competitive disadvantage, it is proposed to make the wider approach for due diligence mandatory rather for all financial institutions. Submissions generally endorsed this approach. 112. The wider approach to due diligence raises the question of what then happens to the additional information collected that does not need to be exchanged (‘the residual information’). 113. The residual information could be held by the financial institutions. However, the greatest compliance cost saving would arise from financial institutions simply being allowed to report all of the information they collect (including the residual information) to the local tax administration, even though it will not be exchanged. Under this approach, financial institutions would not be constantly required to keep track of the jurisdictions New Zealand has entered into AEOI relationships with. Instead, financial institutions would merely report all of the information about non-residents to Inland Revenue. This is referred to as the wider approach to reporting. Some countries, including Australia, have adopted this option. Others, such as the United Kingdom, require the residual information to be retained by financial institutions. 114. The general preference in submissions is to align with Australia, and adopting the wider approach to reporting would also be consistent with the approach of minimising compliance costs wherever possible. Moreover, the pool of residual information could be used by Inland Revenue to assist in, for example, confirming that the non-residents have the correct non-resident withholding rate (similar to the way that the information to be exchanged can be used) to the extent that such use is consistent with legal obligations and responsibilities. This is a delicate matter that involves balancing benefits against privacy concerns. For consistency with New Zealand’s privacy laws, it is proposed that the potential use of the residual information by Inland Revenue be subject to full transparency. 18 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 68 of 160 Alignment with existing regimes 115. The CRS due diligence and reporting procedures leverage off FATCA and AML/CFT procedures in a number of ways. For example, CRS uses a number of FATCA terms and concepts (such as what constitutes a financial institution and the types of accounts that are subject to due diligence and reporting). Financial institutions are also sometimes able to use AML/CFT information to assist with CRS due diligence. However, the CRS and supporting OECD documentation are clear that there are a number of areas where CRS due diligence and reporting procedures diverge from FATCA and AML/CFT procedures. 116. One consistent theme of the submissions is that New Zealand should look to align CRS due diligence with FATCA and AML/CFT procedures where possible with a view to minimising compliance costs for financial institutions. 117. Although this approach has been adopted where possible (for example in aligning the AEOI and FATCA reporting periods) it is not possible in all situat ions. To the extent that there are any differences between regimes, the CRS must drive CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. This is because CRS is a global standard that needs to be implemented consistently worldwide. New Zealand’s co mpliance with this glo bal standard will be internationally reviewed. Enforcement 118. The CRS requires effective anti-avoidance and enforcement rules to ensure compliance. This includes a specific expectation that implementing jurisdictions will have robust rules in place that will ensure self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. However, it leaves the design of those rules up to each country. 119. In terms of an anti-avoidance rule, we propose a similar rule to that introduced for FATCA. This would be modified (as required by the CRS) to ensure that in addit io n to financial institutions it applies to account holders, intermediaries, and certain other persons (in recognition of the fact that such persons often control the information that institutions are required to obtain and report, so could take steps to circumvent CRS due diligence and reporting). The rule could apply, for example, in the case of a financial institution that advises a customer to maintain an account with a related entity in a non- participating jurisdiction (where there is no scope to link the accounts for due diligence purposes), so as to avoid reporting obligations while still offering services to the customer as if the account was maintained by the financial institution itself. It is proposed that this modification will also apply for FATCA purposes. 120. In terms of enforcement rules, we propose a regime broadly based on civil penalties (rather than criminal penalties, as is the case for FATCA). We are not aware of any other implementing country imposing specific criminal penalties for AEOI. 121. Penalties (for example, for failure to conduct due diligence or reporting) would primarily apply at the financial institution level (including a specific penalty for failure 19 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 69 of 160 to obtain a self-certification when opening a new account) 10 . However, as a transitional measure, we propose allowing a grace period through to 31 March 2019 during which time a ‘reasonable endeavours’ defence could be mounted and a reasonable period of time allowed to rectify identified errors. After the transitional period, the penalties would be applied on a more rigorous basis. It is also proposed that undocumented new accounts are reported to be used as a tool to review and monitor compliance by financial institutions with their CRS due diligence obligations. 122. In some cases, financial institutions may experience difficulty in obtaining responses from account holders, intermediaries and other persons to requests for documentation (particularly self-certification of tax residence). It is therefore proposed to supplement the penalties imposed on financial institutions with penalties on account holders, intermediaries, or other persons for either providing a false self-certification or (where the person fails to provide a self-certification (or material information about a change of circumstances relating to a self-certification) with the intention of circumventing CRS reporting. There would also be a requirement of persons that hold accounts or funds on behalf of another person to take reasonable steps to provide (on request) CRS informat ion to that financial inst itution, with a penalty for non-compliance. 123. It is proposed that these penalties on account holders, intermediaries, and other persons, will be extended to apply to FATCA, as there is currently a gap in these areas. Stage two implementation issues 124. The AEOI standard requires implementing jurisdictions to publish a number of lists. These are:  Reportable jurisdictions. An implementing jurisdiction must list the countries that it intends providing AEOI information to.  Participating jurisdictions. An implementing jurisdiction must also list the countries that it has an arrangement to receive AEOI information from. 11  Excluded Entities and Accounts. An implementing jurisdiction must list the specific financial institutions and accounts that it has excluded from AEOI obligations on the basis that they pose a low risk in the context of tax evasion. 125. These lists do not need to be finalised in parallel with the implementation legislation, but will need to be in place prior to the 1 July 2017 start date, with sufficient lead time for financial institutions to develop their systems and processes. 126. The issue of reportable jurisdictions raises potential privacy issues, given that the information to be disclosed to jurisdictions is of a highly sensitive personal and financial nature. Frameworks for confidentiality and data safeguards are a key element of AOEI implementation for all jurisdictions, and are the subject of separate Global Forum reviews. However, submissions proposed that a degree of caution should be 10 The CRS commentary is clear that there is an expectation that implementing jurisdictions will have robust provisions in place to ensure that self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. 11 Note that, during the global implementation phase, a transitional period will apply during which jurisdictions that have committed to implementing AEOI will be treated as participating jurisdictions. 20 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 70 of 160 exercised in the case of jurisdictions such as those that have no previous experience in exchange of information. Submissions strongly proposed that selection of New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions be subject to a robust and transparent process, and Government oversight. 127. In acknowledgement of the concerns raised in these submissions, it is proposed that the list of reportable jurisdictions be selected by a process that will involve Inland Revenue disseminating the outcome of Global Forum reviews and calling for submissions on genuine reasons why a jurisdiction should not be included on the list. Inland Revenue’s decisio ns will be subject to Government oversight through an Order in Council process for announcing and maintaining the list. 128. The issue of determining excluded entities and accounts will also necessarily involve Inland Revenue receiving and considering submissions. However, it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be authorised to announce, and maintain, the lists of excluded entities and accounts, by Commissioner’s determination. 129. Similarly, it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be authorised to announce, and maintain, the lists of participating jurisdictions, by Commissioner’s determination. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 130. New Zealand’s implementation will be subject to international peer review and on- going monitoring by the Global Forum. The peer review schedule has not yet been determined. 131. As the AEOI standard is determined internationally, future changes at the international level are likely – particularly as countries identify issues and concerns, and make consequential adjustments to the rules to address these issues. New Zealand will need to monitor and respond to these changes. 132. Domestically, an internal review of the AEOI legislation is also proposed 18 to 24 months after enactment. This will primarily be to evaluate if the rules are working as intended or if adjust ments are needed. In particular, New Zealand’s CRS anti- avoidance and enforcement provisions will be evaluated to determine if they are effective. I n addit ion, it may be possible to use this opportunity to further align FATCA legislation with the AEOI legislation, as we obtain information about how the regimes (particularly the penalties provisions) are working in practice. 133. It is not appropriate to make changes to the FATCA rules as part of the initial AEOI implementation, as AEOI consultation did not specifically seek information on this point. 21 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 71 of 160 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 72 of 160 REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT Proposed changes to business tax Agency disclosure statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address concerns taxpayers have with the tax policy settings for businesses. The concerns addressed were identified from submissions on the government discussio n document Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration and other consultation. The options considered are intended to simplify the rules and reduce compliance costs for businesses, while ensuring the rules are robust. The options were developed in the context of the wider tax policy framework of a clear and coherent broad-base, low-rate tax system. The options in this statement have been constrained as Ministers have asked for options that can be delivered with effect from 1 April 2017. However, some options will apply from 1 April 2018 due to the additional time needed for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to implement system changes. It is challenging to accurately forecast some of the costs (including compliance, administrative and fiscal costs) for the options due to information not being available or difficulty in estimating likely behavioural changes. Equally, it is difficult to determine the number of taxpayers who may be impacted by the proposals as various factors may influence the decision to adopt a proposal. Instead, indications of the direction and order of magnitude have been provided where appropriate. Of ficials have been mindful of the fiscal implications stemming from the proposals. No ne of the policy options restrict market competition, impair property rights, reduce incentives for small businesses to operate, or override fundamental common law principles.

To manage this large number of topics we have shifted the detailed analysis of each theme, and the component proposals within that theme, out of the Regulatory Analysis section and into a set of five appendices. The body of the RIS still contains an overview of the options considered but the detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, impacts and recommendations is contained in the corresponding appendix. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  - Fully meets objective  - Partially meets objective  - Does not meet objective Consultation section of the RIS provides a summary of our consultation approach with the feedback received on each proposal set out in corresponding appendix. 4 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 76 of 160 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 1. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 2. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 3. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 4. The ways in which individuals work has changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casualised as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 5. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 6. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 7. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 8. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely 5 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 77 of 160 complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers of complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorities. 9. However, Business Transformation is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a lo ng-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. 10. This regulatory impact statement outlines options for simplifying the tax policy settings for businesses. 11. In March 2015 the Government released a discussion document entit led Making tax simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration. The feedback from submitters relating to business tax and other consultation/feedback from taxpayers can be grouped into five main areas: • Provisional tax is hard to get right and expensive to get wrong. This affects businesses’ ability to comply, results in compliance or administration costs, and adversely impacts perceptions of fairness. • The withholding tax regime for contractors is inflexible, out of date and open to abuse. This affects the accuracy and timing of tax payments, results in compliance or administrative costs, and adversely impacts perceptions of fairness of the tax system. • Penalties are punitive and can reduce taxpayer compliance. The c urrent penalt y rules do not take account of businesses’ circumstances or the interaction of the use of money interest (UOMI) and penalty rules and the affect these have in conjunction with the provisional tax rules. Also an automatic penalty is frequently levied against those who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). This adversely impacts fairness by imposing excessive costs on businesses who are trying to comply, and reduces compliance. • Tax information is not used to protect businesses. Compliant businesses would be better protected if data held by Inland Revenue indicating serious debt or malpractice was shared appropriately. However, legislation currently restricts this. • Rules require accuracy regardless of costs. Tax rules that try to get to a “perfect” answer can impose undue costs when, in some instances, close enough should be good enough. 12. More detail on each of these areas is provided below and in the appendices. Problems and their magnitude 6 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 78 of 160 13. Provisio nal tax is particularly problematic for taxpayers who have relatively simple systems and who have difficulty in forecasting their income. It leaves these particular taxpayers in an uncertain position in terms of their total liability for tax and UOMI. 14. Feedback suggests this creates stress for taxpayers during and at the end of the year for something that could be well outside their ability to control. The current UOMI regime also has relatively expensive interest rates for taxpayers which can mean that UOMI can appear to be a penalty. OBJECTIVES 15. The Government is committed to making positive changes to reduce the time and costs to businesses of meeting their tax obligations. The objectives against which the options have been assessed are: • Fairness and equity: to support fairness in the tax system, options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: the compliance impacts on taxpayers and the administrative costs to Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. • Sustainability of tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes. 16. These objectives are weighted equally. 17. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. REGULATORY ANALYSIS 18. Officials have developed options to address the above issues. These options have been grouped into the following five key themes: A. Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty and reduce costs. B. Self-management and integrity. C. Making the system fairer. D. Making markets work better through tax transparency. E. Supplementary simplification measures. 19. Each of these themes and the options under them are summarised below. Further detail on the issues and options under each theme is contained in the appendices. 7 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 79 of 160 20. Within the overview tables the following symbols are used:  - Fully meets objective  - Partially meets objective  - Does not meet objective A. Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty and reduce costs 21. While the consultation on the Making tax simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration discussion document sought views on issues across the tax system, the majority of submissions received identified issues with the current provisional tax rules, and expressed enthusiasm for different approaches. For example, of the 750 comments made on the 17 questions on the Green paper online forum, more than 200 comments were made in response to a single question about provisional tax. 22. While taxpayers generally agree with having to pay tax as they earn income, the perceived penalising effect of UOMI promotes general dissatisfaction with provisional tax rather than solely wit h the application of UOMI. This adversely affects the fairness of the provisio nal tax system. 23. Maintaining the current rules would continue to cause taxpayers stress and difficulties especially for those who pay provisional tax based on their best indicator of current year performance being their immediately prior income year. This increases the costs of complying with the provisio nal tax rules. 24. Another issue with the current provisional tax regime is that it attempts to approximate a pay as you earn system by assuming, wrongly in a large number of cases, that income is earned evenly throughout an income year. This means that what was intended to be a pay as you earn type system can become a pay before you have earned system which can cause cash-flow issues. This is particularly so for smaller, unsophisticated businesses. This can have a financial impact on taxpayers and increases compliance costs. 25. A final issue with provisional tax relates to close companies where all parties are related. In this situation there can be multiple taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax on different rules. I n essence, there is one taxpaying group which should be subject to one rule to ease compliance and reduce the number of people subject to provisional tax. This adversely impacts the fairness of the system and increases compliance and administration costs. Options and analysis 26. The proposals to address the issues identified are: • Extend the safe harbour from UOMI; • Remove the application of UOMI; • Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax; and • Enable tax to be paid by companies as agents for shareholder-emplo yees. 8 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 80 of 160 Extend the safe harbour from UOMI 27. To address concerns about fairness of the UOMI rules, officials have considered a number of options to address the issue of provisional taxpayers’ exposure to UOMI. These options focus on the dollar threshold below which provisional taxpayers are not subject to UOMI and the scope of the threshold (who it applies to). 28. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-1. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $60,000 and expansion of safe harbour from UOMI to non- individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: revenue cost of $47 million over 4 years 3. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $70,000 and expansion of safe harbour from UOMI to non- individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher fiscal cost than option 2. 4. Increase to the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 with no extension to non-individuals Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: marginal revenue impact Recommendation 29. Officials recommend option 2 to increase the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 and to extend it to non-individual taxpayers. This option deals with the problems of uncertainty of tax payments and reduces the stress that some taxpayers with low levels of tax payments feel over provisional tax and the application of UOMI. As a result 67,000 taxpayers will no longer be subject to UOMI. Option 2 has been chosen over the other options principally on the basis that option 3 does not fit within fiscal constraints and option 4 affects very few taxpayers. Remove the application of UOMI 30. In some cases taxpayers who use the best information available to them to pay their provisional tax payments are effectively penalised. For taxpayers who use the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax, if their residual inco me tax (RIT) exceeds the safe harbour threshold and is different from the instalments paid during the year, UOMI will apply from the first instalment date. Although this seeks to compensate the party who ends up funding this difference in tax liability, it can result in taxpayers overpaying their tax to ensure they end up being the funding party so as not to incur large amounts of UOMI. 31. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-2.

Recommendation 32. Officials recommend option 2 as it reduces the exposure to UOMI for taxpayers who struggle to estimate their income during the year. This option is expected to remove 19,000 taxpayers from the requirement to pay UOMI on their first two instalments of provisio nal tax. Option 2 was selected as option 3 did not provide enough benefits to taxpayers as UOMI would still have so me t ype of penalt y aspect to it. Option 2 balances fiscal constraints with benefits to taxpayers. Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax 33. To approximate the objective that tax payments should be made when income is earned, provisional tax rules assume that income is evenly earned throughout the year. This assumption is not realistic for many taxpayers, especially those who have seasonal income who may have to make payments before they earn their income, or for businesses with varying income throughout the year. Where a taxpayer does not pay the correct amount at each instalment UOMI applies, which can act as a penalty for something that is outside their immediate control. 34. In a world with perfect foresight, most businesses would pay the amount of their actual liability during the year. The difficulty is that for most taxpayers forecasting their final income tax amounts is an art more than a science and differences will inevitably arise which were not predictable. 35. A new provisional tax method that better aligns the payment of tax with the income earning activity of a business should result in a closer match between the provisional tax payments and the end of year liability. Reducing the gap between provisional and actual liabilities could mean that UOMI is not required. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns 10 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 82 of 160 36. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix A-3. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Introduce the accounting income method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: Impact is expected to be neutral 3. Extend the GST ratio method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Introduce a turnover method Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 37. Officials recommend option 2 as tax payments based on actual rather than forecast income, excluding shareholder salaries, will work for a large number of businesses where income accumulates over the year. This will reduce stress around year end payments and UOMI for taxpayers who use this method. Paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees 38. Provisional tax gives rise to particular concerns for small businesses and their owners. The current rules apply separate obligations to a company and each of its shareholders. At its core what is happening is that a flow of income is being derived in a single economic entity and being partitioned out at the end of the year between the company and its shareholders, normally by way of shareholder salary. Each shareholder will typically be liable for provisional tax on that income. 39. The current approach does not align with the principle that tax should be collected by the person who is able to do so most efficiently, and compliance costs minimised. 40. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix A-4. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Allow companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder-emplo yees Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  11 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 83 of 160 Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 3. Require businesses to pay tax as agent for related parties Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Exclude those associated with small businesses from paying provisional tax entirely and pay at terminal tax date Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: unquantified revenue cost due to deferral Recommendation 41. Option 2 is recommended by officials as this enables businesses and associated individuals to evaluate whether the benefits from removing associated parties from the requirement to pay provisional tax outweighs any additional costs or complexity. This option is also supported by the stakeholders consulted. B. Self-management and integrity 42. Withholding tax at source from payments to contractors reduces compliance costs for the majority of contractors, is a more accurate method of matching tax payments to when income is earned and ensures contractors pay their fair share of tax. However, the current withholding tax rules are out of date, inflexible, and don’t cover modern employment arrangements and industries. There are 130,000 contractors who are subject to withholding tax who could benefit from changes to the withholding tax rules. 43. There also are groups of contractors who are not covered by the rules having to manage their own tax obligations and incur higher compliance costs as a result. For example, at least 4,200 contractors of labour hire firms are not covered by the rules, but could have an easier means of paying their tax if withholding tax was extended to them. 1 Options and analysis 44. There are a number of options to address the issues with the current withholding tax rules. However the requirement for options to apply from 1 April 2017 has limited the feasible options available to three. 45. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix B. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 1 From an Inland Revenue audit project we know that the largest 11 labour-hire firms in New Zealand engage 4,200 contractors. The total number of contractors working for labour-hire firms will be greater than this. 12 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 84 of 160 2. Allow contractors currently in the withholding tax rules to elect their own withholding rate (with a 10% minimum) Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: one-off fiscal cost of approximately $35 million 3. Allow contractors not covered by the current withholding tax rules to enter into voluntary withholding agreements with their emplo yer Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: marginal upfront gain 4. Extend the withholding tax rules to contractors of labour hire firms Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: difficult to measure but expect a small revenue benefit 46. Other options considered but that could not be developed in the time available include: • Extending withholding to other contractors (for example, IT contractors). • Removing or amending the company exception to the schedular payment rules comprehensively. • Using banks as an intermediary for withholding rather than the payer of the contractor. 47. We consider that these measures require greater policy work and consultation than can be achieved in time for a 1 April 2017 application date. Recommendation 48. Officials recommend that options 2, 3, and 4 be adopted as they reduce overall compliance costs and provide a fairer, more sustainable tax system. As a result we consider them an improvement over the status quo. Approximately 130,000 taxpayers currently subject to withholding tax for contract work will have greater flexibility to self-manage, and at least 4,200 labour hire contractors will be brought into withholding. C. Making the system fairer 49. The current late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the init ial penalt y, of 1% the day after the due date and a further 4% imposed seven days after the due date, and an incremental penalty of 1% imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. 50. The late payment penalty does not effectively encourage all taxpayers to comply. For some taxpayers, late payment penalties can be seen as ineffective if they are imposed on people who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). The first group feel Inland Revenue is penalising them for an honest mistake and will grudgingly pay the penalty. The second cannot pay the initial 13 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 85 of 160 amount and so will not be able to pay the penalties. The third is unlikely to be motivated by a financial penalty and so other tools would likely be more effective. 51. The issues with the late payment penalty are its size, blunt application, and imposit ion on groups where it is ineffective as a collection tool. Options and analysis 52. To address concerns about the fairness and efficacy of the late payment penalty regime officials have considered a number of options focussing on the amount of penalty charged and the circumstances when a penalty should be charged. 53. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix C. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher cost than status quo but lower cost than recommended options 3. Remove the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: fiscal cost of $87 million over 4 years 4. Remove all late payment penalties and apply UOMI only Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: higher fiscal cost than both status quo and recommended options 5. Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: fiscal impact cannot be determined Recommendation 54. Officials recommend that options 3 be adopted as they will improve the effectiveness of the late payment penalty and thus improve the fairness and sustainability of the tax system. Once fully implemented option 3 will result in the incremental late payment penalty no longer being imposed on 65,000 taxpayers with income tax debt, 67,000 taxpayers with GST tax debt, and 23,000 families with Working for Families Tax Credit debt. D. Making markets work better through tax transparency 14 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 86 of 160 55. Tax secrecy rules mean that Inland Revenue cannot generally disclose information relating to significant business tax debt, or information relating to non-compliance with wider business legal obligations to relevant enforcement agencies. As a result businesses may be unaware of the credit risks they are dealing with, and enforcement agencies may be unaware of illegal conduct taking place. 56. In these ways tax secrecy can lead to inefficiencies and can allow non-co mpliant businesses to unfairly compete with compliant businesses. Making certain tax information available to others would assist in making markets work better. Options and analysis 57. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns which consider sharing both financial debt information and other intelligence. 58. These options are summarised below and are outlined further in appendix D. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Share information on significant tax debt with credit reporting agencies Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 3. Share information on significant tax debt with the wider public Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 4. Share information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact 5. Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: potentially positive impact Recommendation 59. Officials recommend options 2 and 4 as these options appear to be justifiable exceptions to tax secrecy principles and would benefit market efficiency. These options address policy problem and would achieve the objectives without unreasonably disclosing tax secret information. E. Supplementary simplification measures 15 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 87 of 160 60. Research shows that tax compliance costs are relatively high for small businesses. However measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This section outlines supporting simplification measures to address these concerns and move towards a close enough is good enough tax outcome at lower compliance costs. They will reduce the amount of paperwork required by businesses and make it easier to manage their tax affairs without significantly affecting the amount of revenue collected by the government. The measures include simplified rules for businesses to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT), account for vehicles and premises, and deduct employee remuneration. They also include some threshold adjust ments to enable more small businesses access to simplified rules for filing and correcting errors. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles and premises 61. Small business owners often use their personal vehicles and homes for both business and private purposes. Currently they need to allocate all their related expenses between private and business use. The private use percentage might also vary between different items of expenditure. Because there are numerous expenses for these items, allocating these between business and personal use can create large compliance obligations compared to the amount of tax at stake. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Options and analysis 62. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-1 to this report. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional single rate for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small revenue cost 3. Compulsory single rate for vehicles Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 63. Officials recommend option 2 be adopted as the calculation method for vehicles. While an optional method has some disadvantages in terms of efficiency and sustainability, officials consider the variance in the actual costs of car ownership is too wide for a compulsory single rate to be acceptably fair. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best 16 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 88 of 160 result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely that taxpayers would do this every year as vehicle expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Owners of newer and more expensive cars may see a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. A more accurate compulsory method could be developed, but this would erode the compliance cost benefits. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use premises Options and analysis 64. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-2 to this report. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional single rate for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small revenue cost 3. Compulsory single rate for premises Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 65. Officials recommend option 2 is adopted for premises. While the method should produce a fairly accurate measure for most taxpayers, some taxpayers will be entitled to smaller deductions under the method than their actual costs. Such taxpayers may consequently regard a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely though that taxpayers would do this every year as premises expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Increase threshold for taxpayer’s self-corrections of minor errors 66. Currently if a taxpayer makes a minor error in their tax return with a tax effect of less than $500, they can self-correct the error in their next tax return. 2 However if the error results 2 Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 17 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 89 of 160 in more than a $500 tax difference, then the taxpayer must request the Commissioner to correct the error. This imposes compliance costs on the taxpayer in having to apply to the Commissioner for a small adjustment. It also imposes administration costs on Inland Revenue in having to manage these low value items. These costs are high compared with the amount of tax at stake. Options and analysis 67. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-3. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase self-adjust ment threshold to $1,000 Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 3. Increase self-adjustment threshold to $2,000 Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 4. Revenue percentage threshold Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: negative as open to abuse Recommendation 68. Officials recommend option 2, as it provides the best balance between meeting the objectives of fairness and equity, efficiency of compliance and administration, and sustainability of the tax system. Remove requirement to renew a resident withholding tax exemption certificate annually 69. Currently some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) must renew the certificate annually. This creates relatively large compliance costs where certificates are renewed for relatively little value. It also creates an administrative burden for Inland Revenue, as all the annual exemption certificates must be renewed at the same time each year. Options and analysis 70. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-4. 18 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 90 of 160 Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2.

Issue certificate for period greater than a year Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact Recommendation 71. Officials recommend option 2 as this meets the objectives of reducing compliance and administration costs with no impact on fairness or sustainability of the tax system. Increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT Most businesses are required to calculate and return FBT on a quarterly basis. However businesses that have combined pay as you earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis. As a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold. Consequently the business will be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs which are still significant relative to the size of the business. Options and analysis 72. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-5. Options Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Increase threshold to $1 million Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small fiscal cost of approximately $0.5 million over four years 3.

Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objective without a significant fiscal cost. Officials do not recommend option 3, as officials consider a business with combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of over $1 million is sufficiently large to be subject to the standard quarterly filing requirement. Modify the 63 day rule on employee remuneration 74. There is a special deduction and timing rule for the deferred payment of employee remuneration. Currently, in order to comply with this deferred payment rule, taxpayers need to work out what employee remuneration has been paid during the 63 day period that relates to the previous income year. This creates an additional compliance burden for taxpayers because they need to track payments accrued at year end and paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. Options and analysis 75. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-6. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Optional 63 day rule Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small upfront gain 3. Optional 63 day rule for different classes of employee remuneration Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small upfront gain Recommendations 76. Officials recommend adopting option 2 as it will provide compliance savings and improve efficiency by providing taxpayers with a choice. This option also has no disadvantage in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system because the same deductibility and timing rule will apply to all employee remuneration rather than different rules for different types of employee remuneration. Simplification of fringe benefit calculation for close companies 77. Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT for that benefit, subject to certain exemptions. Sole traders and partners in a partnership who use a motor vehicle in a similar 20 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 92 of 160 way are not required to register and pay FBT. Instead these taxpayers apportion their motor vehicle expenditure between the business and private use using special motor vehicle expenditure rules. These differences in treatment for what is essentially the same benefit (i.e. the private use of a motor vehicle) arise because of the different entities involved. Options and analysis 78. Officials have considered a number of options to address these concerns, which are summarised below and outlined in more detail in appendix E-7. Option Analysis against the objectives 1. Retain the status quo Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: no impact 2. Allow close companies to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT Fairness and equity:  Compliance and administration:  Sustainability:  Revenue: small fiscal cost Recommendations 79. Officials recommend adopting option 2 as this provides consistency of treatment and will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving compliance overall. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely that taxpayers would do this every year as vehicle expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. This option also has no major disadvantages in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system. CONCLUSION 80. The recommended options under these themes collectively form a sensible tax package that would provide significant compliance cost reductions, while maintaining New Zealand’s broad base, low rate framework. CONSULTATION 81. Several forms of consultation have been undertaken in developing the options outlined in this statement. 82. In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University hosted a conference entitled Tax administration for the 21 st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier through reducing both compliance and administration costs, while balancing increased voluntary compliance against the core tax policy objectives of raising sufficient revenue and ensuring fairness and efficiency. The main points made by attendees were to give people the ability to self-manage their tax affairs through improved services and more flexible legislative frameworks, the importance of involving businesses and others in 21 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 93 of 160 the design of the rules and processes, the need to ensure that there is an overall net benefit to society of the changes not just a cost shift from Inland Revenue to businesses, and to ensure the continued maintenance of the current tax system whilst the reforms occur. 83. Following this conference the Government issued Making tax simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration which outlined the scope and direction of the review of the tax administration, and sought feedback on the future for business tax and the problems taxpayers face with the current system. The options proposed in this regulatory impact statement address the five main issues identified as part of the consultation with taxpayers and feedback on the green paper. These issues are outlined under the status quo and problem definit ion sect ion above. 84. The Government has decided not to issue a discussion document on the options in this regulatory impact statement, which would normally occur as part of the policy development process. However, in developing these options, Ministers have asked officials to undertake selected consultation with key players, including the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group, Business New Zealand, selected labour hire firms, selected credit reporting agencies, and a small group of accountants. Feedback from these consultations has informed the development of the options. 85. Also, once the Government announces the changes it is expected that an issues paper will be released seeking public feedback on the detailed design of each of the proposals. IMPLEMENTATION 86. It is proposed to include the recommended options in a bill to be introduced in July 2016 and enacted by the end of the year. 87. All the recommended options (apart from the accounting income method and paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees) will apply from 1 April 2017. The accounting income method and paying provisional tax on behalf of related individuals’ options will apply from 1 April 2018. 88. The new provisional tax option using an accounting income method has an implementation date of 1 April 2018 as b oth Inland Revenue and external suppliers will have changes to make to systems and products that will require a lead in time of between 12 to 18 months. 89. The migration of income tax processing from Inland Revenue’s heritage system to the new technology platform is a good transition point for the introduction of a new provisional tax calculation method. This period will also allow external suppliers to develop and modify products to use the new method. 90. The option of paying tax on behalf of shareholder-emplo yees is required to be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new platform in order to reduce the implementation costs. The new platform is expected to be deployed for income tax on 1 April 2018 and this option will apply from then. The compliance cost saving this option offers may also be useful for other types of income paid out by companies to related parties, and as an alternative to Resident Withholding Tax. Depending on the uptake of this option, officials may recommend 22 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 94 of 160 its extension to other income types in the future. It may also be useful to extend it to partnerships in the future, based on a similar assessment. This wider use of the paying tax as agent proposal is not addressed in this RIS. 91. The removal of the incremental late payment penalty for GST will apply from when the new platform begins to administer GST, which is scheduled to be taxable periods beginning February 2017. The first GST returns filed will be due after the 1 April 2017 application date of the new penalty rules. For income tax and Working for Families Tax Credits the removal of the incremental late payment penalty will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 2017. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 92. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a mult i-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 93. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 94. Also, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme a benefit management strategy has been developed and endorsed. The strategy provides the framework for managing benefit s within the programme, and: • defines benefit components; • details how programme benefits will be quantified and measured; • documents how progress will be tracked; and • describes what governance arrangements will be in place. 95. Both internal and external stakeholders will be actively involved in the on-going assessment of timeframes, benefits identification and benefits realisation for each stage of the transformation programme. 23 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 95 of 160 APPENDIX A – CHANGES TO PROVISIONAL TAX TO INCREASE CERTAINTY AND REDUCE COSTS Status Quo and problem definition There are around 300,000 provisional taxpayers in New Zealand: • 24% of Government revenue comes from provisional tax • 75% of provisional taxpayers are individuals • 75% of provisional tax payments come from companies • The top 5% of companies represent approximately 43% of the total provisional tax collected. Currently taxpayers have three options for calculating provisional tax: • The standard (or uplift) option which is based on the prior year’s residual inco me tax (RIT) of the taxpayer plus 5%, or the year previous to the prior year RIT plus 10%; or • The estimation option where the taxpayer makes an estimate of their current year tax liability and pays provisional tax based on that estimate; or • The GST ratio option which is available only to a small subset of taxpayers and is based on a ratio of RIT from the prior year to total GST taxable supplies for that year applied to GST taxable supplies for the current year. Comprehensive UOMI applies to instalments under the standard and estimation methods. The UOMI calculation divides the RIT for the taxpayer by the three provisional tax instalments and compares this to the provisional tax payments made by the taxpayer, charging or paying UOMI on the resulting shortfall or surplus. The current rates of UOMI are 9.21% for underpayments and 2.63% for overpayments. This results in taxpayers tending to overpay tax on the first instalment to avoid negative UOMI impacts. Feedback indicates attitudes to provisional tax fall on a spectrum fro m taxpayers who find provisional tax difficult and stressful to those who are happy with the current rules. One consistent trend from taxpayers consulted was that they had issues with the application of UOMI, which looks more like a penalty rather than a time value of money charge when taxpayers have unexpected income during the year. This causes taxpayers stress and increased compliance costs. A reduction or elimination of the negative impacts of UOMI to taxpayers would reduce these negative perceptions of provisional tax. This is especially so for those who are committing to a minimum level of tax payments based on the prior year plus an uplift where the application of UOMI can be particularly harsh. Another issue with the current provisional tax regime is that it attempts to approximate a pay as you earn system by assuming, wrongly in a large number of cases, that income is earned 24 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 96 of 160 evenly throughout an income year. This means that what was intended to be a pay as you earn type system can become a pay before you have earned system which can cause cash-flow issues. This is particularly so for smaller, unsophisticated businesses. A final issue with provisional tax relates to close companies and partnerships. In this situation there can be multiple taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax where in essence, there is one taxpaying group which should be subject to one rule to ease compliance and reduce the number of people subject to provisional tax. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. Options The proposals to address the issue are: 1. Extend the safe harbour from UOMI; 2. Remove the application of UOMI; 3. Introduce a new method of calculating provisional tax; and 4. Enable tax to be paid by close companies and partnerships as agent for shareholders and partners. 1 – Extend the current safe harbour from UOMI UOMI applies from the first provisional tax date unless the taxpayer is an individual (i.e. a natural person) and their RIT is less than $50,000, in which case UOMI will apply only from the terminal tax date. One way of alleviating the concern expressed by some taxpayers around the application of UOMI would be to either increase the RIT threshold at which UOMI is imposed and/or extend the threshold to include other groups of taxpayers. Taxpayers wit h smaller amounts of tax to pay are relatively unsophisticated and are committing to pay a minimum amount of tax using previous years’ assessments as a proxy for their current year tax liability. Increasing the threshold will take more taxpayers out of the UOMI regime which should reduce stress and increase certainty around their tax payments. In addition, the application of the safe harbour could be extended to non-individuals who have low levels of income and are likely to be unsophisticated taxpayers. There are a number of levels that the RIT threshold could be increased to. At the time the threshold was increased to $50,000, it was forecast that 97% of individual taxpayers would fall within the new safe harbour. This means even a small movement in the threshold could remove almost all individuals from the application of UOMI. 25 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 97 of 160 This also suggests any further increase in the safe harbour RIT threshold would have limited appeal unless it was extended to other types of taxpayers, specifically, non-individual taxpayers. Non-individuals were previously excluded from the safe harbour regime because of concerns around income shifting between individuals and related entities to ensure that no UOMI was payable. It was also possible for related parties to switch income from one party to another to ensure that provisional tax was also not payable due to the application of the provisional tax threshold (i.e., those with residual income tax of less than $2,500 are not subject to provisio nal tax). Whilst the rules will require some protection mechanisms to restrict taxpayers’ ability to undertake this switching, the benefits to most taxpayers will outweigh these restrictions. In addition, since these rules were reviewed the prospect of increased visibility through more comprehensive systems should enable any potential gaming to be identified. This proposal increases the threshold before UOMI will apply from $50,000 to $60,000 and expands the scope of this rule to non-individuals as well as individuals. This will reduce the number of taxpayers subject to UOMI by an additional 67,000 taxpayers, the majorit y being non-individuals. The object of the change is to remove smaller taxpayers fro m the UOMI rules, reducing their stress and increasing certainty around their tax liabilities. Several thresholds were considered. The option of increasing the threshold to $60,000 of RIT and the extension of the rule to non-individuals fitted within the fiscal parameters. A $60,000 level reduces the application of UOMI to individuals to very small numbers, while the extension removes a significant number of non-individuals from the UOMI rules. A higher RIT level such as $70,000 or $80,000 would remo ve more taxpayers from the UOMI rules, but would have addit io nal cost and would result in some reasonably sophisticated taxpayers being included within the rules. This would defeat the intention of removing those taxpayers who can struggle with predicting their income. Another option would have been to retain the $50,000 threshold but extend the rules to non- individuals. The number of taxpayers that are within the $50-60,000 band of RIT is approximately 4,000. Consequently the proposal is to increase the safe harbour threshold from $50,000 to $60,000 and make this available to non-individuals as well as individuals. This proposal deals with the issues around certainty of tax payments and the stress some taxpayers feel over provisional tax and the application of UOMI. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 26 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 98 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Not met The application of UOMI will continue to have a penal effect rather than a use of funds effect. The application of UOMI to taxpayers who use the standard method will continue to have an impact on fairness aspects. Not met Taxpayers will continue to experience uncertainty in the application of UOMI to them, creating compliance costs. Not met Some taxpayers will continue to view provisional tax in a negative light with the current rules providing uncertainty as to the total tax liability including interest. No impact 2. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $60,000 and expansion of safe harbour fro m UOMI to non- individuals Met Provides more fairness to those taxpayers who have limited tax knowledge by removing uncertainty as to the application of UOMI for relatively small amounts of tax. Met For smaller taxpayers, reduces compliance costs of having to deal with provisional tax and unexpected UOMI costs. Inland Revenue will have less administration costs from taxpayer contact around provisional tax as this proposal will reduce the number of taxpayers subject to interest. Met Provides more certainty for taxpayers on the applica tion o f UOMI. This measure will cost $47 million over four years. 27 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 99 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3. Increase the safe harbour threshold to $70,000 and expansion of safe harbour fro m UOMI to non- individuals Not met Higher threshold brings more sophisticated taxpayers into the safe harbour. These taxpayers should have sufficient ability to determine their tax position without safe harbour which creates unfairness to those who cannot. Partially met Reduces compliance costs for some taxpayers, and for taxpayers who have no real issues wit h provisional tax as their business processes include forecasting and budgeting. Partially met Provides more certainty on the application of UOMI for some, but makes little difference to those at the top end of the scale. This option would have a greater fiscal cost than option 2 which makes this less viable for government. 4. Increase to the safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 with no extension to non- individuals Not met Changes to the safe harbour to increase it to $60,000 without extending it to non- individuals would not have a large effect on taxpayers because of the narrow group of taxpayers that would benefit. This provides an inequity to taxpayers because of the vehicle of choice they have made for predominately non-tax reasons (e.g. limited liability). Not met Increases administration costs for Inland Revenue in having to change systems for a very small group of taxpayers. Reduced compliance costs for the limited number of taxpayers who are affected, but may not outweigh the costs. Met Marginal revenue impact 28 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 100 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – increase the current safe harbour from UOMI to $60,000 and extend the application of the safe harbour to non-individuals. Both these measures will reduce stress and compliance costs for taxpayers who have tax liabilities at relatively low levels. As a result, 67,000 taxpayers will no longer be subject to UOMI. 2 – Application of UOMI At present, for those taxpayers who use the standard method of calculating, provisional tax instalments are based on 105% of the prior year or 110% of the year preceding the prior year. Notwithstanding this uplift method, if a taxpayer’s RIT exceeds the safe harbour threshold and is different from the instalments paid, comprehensive UOMI will apply from the first instalment date. Where taxpayers have used the standard or uplift method of calculating provisional tax they have committed to a minimum amount of tax payments no matter what their actual income is. This could be more or less than the tax payments required on their current year income. Currently UOMI seeks to compensate the party who ends up funding this difference (i.e., the taxpayer or the government). The issue here is that the funding party may not be apparent until the end of the income year. This can result in taxpayers overpaying their tax to ensure they end up being the funding party and not incurring large amounts of interest. Alternatively, if the taxpayer doesn’t overpay early instalments they are effectively penalised from using the best information available to most taxpayers, being the prior year results plus a growth factor, on which to base their current year payments. This is one instance where UOMI can be a penalty rather than a use of funds charge. The first option is to remove UOMI from taxpayers who pay based on the standard method for the first two instalments giving taxpayers the ability to pay the correct amount of tax and reduce or eliminate UOMI. This option will apply to large and small taxpayers but will be of main benefit to those larger taxpayers who fall outside the $60,000 RIT safe harbour. These taxpayers will tend to be more sophisticated and should be able to pay their total tax liability by the last instalment date and have no exposure to UOMI as long as they have committed to and paid a certain level of tax during the income year. Again this option deals with the issues around certainty of tax payments and exposure to UOMI for taxpayers who struggle to estimate their income. This option provides them with certainty around tax payments and overall liability in respect of those payments. Another option considered was to only impose UOMI fro m the terminal tax date, extending the safe harbour rules to all taxpayers using the standard uplift method. This option is not recommended due to fiscal concerns and the fact that this group of taxpayers is reasonably sophisticated and should be able to calculate a reasonable tax liability to ensure that UOMI is eliminated or reduced from the last instalment date. This would also increase the fiscal costs of the solution which would have made the proposal uneconomic. 29 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 101 of 160 Consideration was also given to imposing UOMI from the second instalment date as this should be sufficient time for a business to understand how their income was tracking for the income year. However, this would effectively require everyone to estimate their income from the second instalment date. This would defeat the intent to make things more certain for taxpayers who cannot reasonably estimate their income for the year and is not recommended. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 30 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 102 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Not met The application of UOMI will continue to have a penal effect rather than a use of funds effect for those taxpayers who have unexpected income. The application of UOMI to taxpayers who use the standard method will continue to have an impact on fairness aspects. Not met Taxpayers will continue to experience uncertainty in the application of UOMI to them, creating compliance costs. Taxpayers who commit to paying a minimum amount of tax through the standard method will continue to view UOMI as a penalty. Not met Some taxpayers will continue to view provisional tax in a negative light with the current rules providing uncertainty as to the total tax liability including interest. No impact 2. Remove the application of UOMI for the first two provisio nal tax instalments for taxpayers who use the standard method Met Taxpayers who commit to making a minimum level of tax payments during a year based on the best information available on their performance should not be penalised by the application of UOMI where the actua l liability is different. Increases the fairness to taxpayers of unexpected changes in income. Met Makes provisional tax simpler for the majority of provisional taxpayers who currently use the standard method to calculate their provisional tax. Reduces administration costs as Inland Revenue will have a better picture of provisional tax payments that will be payable for a year. Met Increases certainty for taxpayers in terms of their total liability to tax and UOMI for a year. This measure has a revenue cost of $7.5 million and a cash-flow cost of $334 million over four years. 3. Remove the application of Not met Not met Met This measure has a prohibitive cash-flow and 31 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 103 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue UOMI to terminal tax for taxpayers who use the standard method The current safe harbour removes those who have lower levels of RIT from the application of UOMI. This is to ensure that those on those lower levels have certainty around UOMI. To allow all taxpayers to have this concessionary treatment is not appropriate as some taxpayers are sophisticated and should be able to manage their tax payments accordingly. Reduces the compliance costs for those taxpayers using the safe harbour method. Increases the incentive to change between the standard and estimation methods for more sophisticated taxpayers, as they will determine on which basis to pay provisional tax based on the standard method or estimate. Increases certainty for taxpayers in terms of their total liabilit y for tax and UOMI for a year. revenue cost. 4. Remove the application of UOMI for the first instalment for taxpayers who use the standard method to calculate provisio nal tax Not met Removing the application of UOMI from the first instalment provides no real relief for taxpayers fro m the current provisional tax problems. This would continue to have issues around fairness of the application of UOMI, albeit they would be reduced slightly. Not met Doesn’t reduce compliance costs of taxpayers overly as it only relieves interest from one payment. Will still require taxpayers to either overpay from the second instalment or risk the application of UOMI, or to estimate their liabilit y. Not met Still results in uncertainty for taxpayers regarding their total liabilit y for provisional tax payments and UOMI, which does not change perceptions of provisio nal tax. This measure would have a lower cost both in terms of revenue and cash-flow than the recommended option. 32 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 104 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – remove UOMI from the first two instalments of provisional tax where taxpayers use the standard uplift method. This will provide certainty to all taxpayers who use the standard uplift method. This option is expected to remove 19,000 taxpayers from the requirement to pay UOMI on their first two instalments of provisional tax. 3 – Calculation method for provisional tax There are three methods for the calculation of provisional tax. The standard method based on an uplift of the prior year’s RIT, an estimate made by the taxpayer and the GST ratio method which is only available to a small subset of taxpayers. UOMI is charged as if income is earned evenly over an income year, which is not a realistic proposition for many taxpayers. Whilst there are a number of options to bring tax payments more in line with the earning of income, there are difficulties and restrictions on doing this. One difficulty is the assumption that income is either cumulative or static. Businesses can have fluctuations in inco me fro m pro fit to loss between mo nths, unlike salary and wage earners who have accumulating income throughout the year. Methods that work well for accumulating income aren’t effective where a business alternates between profit and loss from month to month. Officials considered three options to more closely align the calculation of provisional tax with the income earning process. The first option is basing provisional tax instalments on a taxpayer’s accounting results for a period. This method uses actual calculations from actual results and has been titled the “accounting income method”. This proposal introduces a new method of calculating provisional tax instalments for smaller taxpayers. It allows them to base provisional tax instalments on their accounting results for a two month period. Essentially this provides for a pay as you go type of payment which bases payments on actual results rather than forecast income, excluding shareholder salaries. For businesses with accumulating income throughout an income year, this method should provide the correct amount of tax payments for a year. For those with fluctuating profits and losses, an overpayment issue may still arise. However, as this is one of a choice of methods, another method may be more appropriate for taxpayers with that profile. Under this option the number of provisional tax payments is increased from three to six to more closely align payments with the income earning of a taxpayer. The option will not be permitted for larger taxpayers at this point in time as there are concerns about the accuracy of the option for those with large tax adjustments around year end. Work will continue on this option to assess its suitability for use with larger taxpayers. The second option is an extension of the GST ratio method. This method takes the RIT from the prior year and divides it by the GST taxable supplies for that same year to calculate a ratio 33 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 105 of 160 that is applied to current year GST taxable supplies to give an approximation of an annual tax liability. This method can work well where the taxpayer has static tax adjustments to accounting profits during a year which results in that ratio being reasonably static. It also relies on constant margins. This method works well for taxpayers with lower turnovers, but as turnover grows this ratio can become inaccurate. This is the reason that the GST ratio method is only available to a limited subset of taxpayers and its acceptance by taxpayers is also very low with only 2-3,000 taxpayers currently using this method. A third option to more closely link tax payments with the earning of income is a turnover method, which is used in the Australian pay as you go instalment system. In essence this is very similar to the GST ratio method used in New Zealand. The turnover method again uses a ratio which is the RIT for a taxpayer divided by total turnover or revenue in the same year. Instead of using a GST reference point, the turnover method uses the accounting notion of turnover or income to generate a ratio which is then applied to the actual turnover for the current period to determine provisional tax instalments. This method has advantages in that it deals with volatility between profits and losses during a year much better than the other options, as it works on an average tax rate throughout the year rather than a result for a particular period. Again, however, it has disadvantages in that, similar to the GST ratio method, it relies on static tax adjustments and margins to be accurate. There is the potential that the higher the turnover, the more inaccurate this method could become. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 34 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 106 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo 2. Introduce the accounting income method Met Provides a more fair and equitable way for small businesses to calculate provisio nal tax by moving to a more “pay as you go” type system. Met Moves the calculation of provisional tax to a process that is more aligned to normal business processes. Should ease compliance for small businesses and also provide Inland Revenue with better informa t ion to effectively administer those taxpayers. Met Links the payment of tax with ordinary business processes, providing greater certainty to taxpayers on the timing of tax payments and the earning of income. No impact 3. Extend the GST ratio method Partially met The extension of the GST ratio method to a larger group of taxpayers may assist to provide a closer pay as you go mechanism than the current provisional tax methods. However for taxpayers who have non- static margins or tax adjustments, issues wit h over or underpayment can still arise. In addit ion, the conclusio n at the time the GST ratio method was introduced was that the larger the turnover, the less accurate the method was. This would still leave Not met A GST ratio method has some compliance costs associated with it that may result in higher costs than a pure uplift method. The possibility of overpayments for larger taxpayers could also create larger compliance costs through the overpayment of tax where margins or tax adjustments are not static. Not met The possibility of taxpayers having overpayments under the GST ratio option could make the system unstable and inherently unfair to taxpayers.

Introduce a turnover method Met Provides a method that better approximates a pay as you go system. Not met The method works off a prior year ratio of RIT to total income. It requires taxpayers to apply that ratio to actual turnover in the current year. This increases compliance costs compared to current methods. Issues will remain with overpayments, which will increase compliance costs. Not met Similar issues to the GST ratio in respect of overpayments destabilising the overall structure of the system. No impact 36 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 108 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – Introduction of an accounting income method. The introduction of a new method that more closely aligns to the income earning pattern of the taxpayer will allow for a more pay as you go type system for business taxpayers. This will allow them to more accurately pay tax during the year in a way which matches their income seasonality rather than on a straight line basis. This will have a number of advantages for taxpayers regarding t he funding of tax payments and removal of the application of UOMI. This will reduce compliance costs and increase certainty for taxpayers. 4 – Paying tax as agent for shareholder-employees A typical small company will be owned by one or more related parties – often a husband and wife, or one or more family trusts, or a combination of these. There will typically be a number of transactions between the company and its owners (and other related parties); salaries, dividends, interest, and sometimes payment for things like the rent of premises. T he company and each of the owners and related parties will have their own liability to account for provisio nal tax. Both calculating and paying provisional tax creates compliance costs for those who are liable; and as outlined earlier there is significant concern amongst small businesses about those compliance costs. Tax compliance costs incurred by business reduce the ability of those businesses to grow, which has negative impacts on economic growth and emplo yment. While compliance concerns are the key issues with the status quo, a wider efficiency argument also arises. Some individuals who might like to set up in business on their own could be discouraged from doing so because of the complexity of provisional tax. Inefficiency will always arise where tax influences behaviour. Some taxpayers consider the application of provisional tax rules to them in their current form to be unfair, because of the work required to calculate and pay, and the risk of exposure to UOMI. The degree of public concern expressed about provisional tax means that it is arguably not sustainable in the long term – hence the focus in this paper on alternatives. This also gives rise to a minor revenue risk – a self-assessment system requires voluntary engagement by taxpayers, and some may disengage if they perceive the rules as unfair or too complex. Current rules do allow taxpayers to transfer provisional tax to others, but the amount transferred must be excess tax, and the transferee remains a provisional tax payer. In 2014 there were approximately 305,000 companies which paid income out to shareholders without deduction of tax at source. Four options to address the issue were looked at. The first option is to retain the status quo and accept that tax operates on the basis of legal form. If individuals want to put their business activities in a separate company, they 37 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 109 of 160 inevitably create a requirement for transactions – with tax consequences – between that company and themselves. The second option is to allow a model which acknowledges that a single economic entity exists. Where a company and its shareholder-employees opt in to this approach the company will be able to make tax payments on behalf of shareholders, which may enable them to stay outside provisio nal tax. The third option would require companies with shareholder-emplo yees to operate a model which acknowledges that a single economic entity exists. Companies will be required to make tax payments on behalf of shareholder-employees, to ensure they are no longer subject to provisional tax on their shareholder salaries. The fourth option is to exempt shareholder salaries from provisional tax and require tax on these payments to be paid at terminal tax date. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. Consultation Participants in the pre-announcement consultation saw the proposal to allow a company to pay tax on behalf of its shareholder-emplo yees as an improvement over the status quo. One accountant observed that it provided the opportunity to create a mini-tax pool inside a group of related entities, although another with access to a tax pool thought the approach might not add much to what they could already do. Accountants noted that some compliance work would remain for them, as they would still need to calculate the tax liability of each entity and individual in the same way as if they had all remained subject to provisional tax, but that the removal of direct provisional tax liabilities and the requirement to engage with Inland Revenue in relation to each taxpayer would deliver some compliance cost savings. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) considered that companies should have the ability to choose to pay tax as an agent of shareholder employees (option 2), rather than being required to (option 3). They saw option 2 as giving businesses the ability to choose this option if it suited them and they felt comfortable using it, but allowing them to remain with the status quo if it did not. They thought that the mechanism could be simpler than if it was compulsory, because it would not need to cover every possible circumstance. CAANZ expressed enthusiasm about removing provisio nal tax from shareholder salaries entirely (option 4) but acknowledged that it would give rise to fairness and revenue concerns and was not a realistic option. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 38 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 110 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Shareholder-emplo yees who receive salaries fro m companies, and which is not taxed at source, are liable to pay provisional tax, just as individuals who receive other income not taxed at source are Not met The current system has compliance costs which are of significant concern to business and government. Partially met The fairness of the status quo approach supports sustainability, but the degree of concern around the compliance costs of provisional tax does not support sustainability. No impact 2. Allow companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. Met Fairness will be maintained provided these rules are implemented in such a way that tax paid on behalf of related parties is paid at the time that those related parties would have paid it themselves if these rules had not applied. Partially met This option allows shareholder-emplo yees to be ent irely remo ved fro m provisio nal tax. However, calculat ions of their underlying tax liability are still required, to enable the correct amount of tax to be paid on their behalf. Some companies will also incur compliance costs in determining whether to opt into these rules or not. Met This option is both fair and reduces the compliance cost impact of provisio nal tax. The non-compulsory nature means it is unlikely to be opposed by business. No impact (provided this option is implemented in a way which ensures that no revenue leakage occurs.) Monitoring is likely to be required in initial years. 39 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 111 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3. Require companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. Partially met The reservation immediately above applies. Some may also consider it unfair that taxpayers in this situation are required to pay tax through an agency relat ionship, whereas situations where income is received from an unrelated party do not require an agency relationship. Partially met The reservation immediately above applies. The compulsory nature of this option also means that some taxpayers who may be happy with the status quo will be required to use it and will identify themselves as incurring additional compliance costs. However, there will be no compliance costs incurred in choosing whether or not to implement this option, and administration will be simplified. Partially met This option is both fair and reduces the compliance cost impact of provisio nal tax. However, there may be objections to the compulsory nature of this option. No impact Subject to the condit ion described above. 4. Exclude shareholder salaries fro m provisio nal tax entirely and allow tax to be paid at terminal tax date. Not met Those who fall under this rule would have a timing advantage and remo val o f interest benefit over those who derive non-source deducted income from non-associated sources, and those who derive income subject to source deduction, as both groups pay tax as income is earned. Met There would be a significant reduction in compliance cost as a result of removing those associated with small business from provisional tax. Not met While the timing advantage this option would create would not threaten the broad base, low rate philosophy which underpins the New Zealand tax system, this kind of difference would still create a risk that other provisional taxpayers would seek similar concessions and undermine the key concept of paying tax on income as it is earned.. Revenue cost Introduction of this option would delay the receipt of revenue compared with the status quo. It could also encourage greater amounts to be paid out to shareholders – and so taxed at lower rates – instead of being retained in the company. 40 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 112 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – allo wing companies to pay tax as agent for shareholder- emplo yees. As this mechanism may give rise to additional cost or complexity for some, the most efficient overall outcome will be achieved by allowing each business to evaluate the costs and benefits of using it. This also provides a gradual uptake path for those businesses initially reluctant to use something new, but may become more comfortable once the mechanism has been in place for a period of time and is better-understood. Also, option 2 is supported by the stakeholders this was discussed with. 41 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 113 of 160 APPENDIX B – SELF-MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRITY Status quo and problem definition Withholding at source systems are widely considered to be the foundation of an effective tax system. Such systems impose an obligation on an independent third party (for example, an emplo yer or financial inst itution) to withho ld an amount of tax from a payment of income. Withholding at source systems: • remove taxpayers from the obligations around provisional tax or at least reduce those obligations to a level where safe harbour from UOMI may apply; • are a more cost-effective way for both taxpayers and the revenue agency to interact; • provide a timely flow of income to the government; • reduce the likelihood of non-payment that might otherwise arise where the taxpayer reports the income but is unable to pay some or all of the tax assessed; and • can significantly reduce the ability for taxpayers to understate their income. New Zealand has a number of domestic withholding taxes, most notably PAYE and RWT. The “schedular payments” rules are another example of withholding. The schedular payment rules apply a withholding tax for payments made to contractors who are in a set of limited industries (and even for these limited industries, the coverage is patchy). The schedular payment rules are intended to supplement the standard PAYE rules and provide a more efficient means of collecting tax for contractors. There are currently approximately 130,000 contractors who are subject to withholding tax. The rules require withholding at flat rates. These rates have not been reviewed since 1979 and for the majorit y o f taxpayers, the amounts withheld do not match their final tax liability (the current rates generally over-withhold on contractors). The withholding rules do not generally apply to companies. A contractor can also apply to Inland Revenue to obtain a certificate of exempt ion fro m withho lding. There are significant issues with the schedular payment rules. The rules are neither comprehensive in scope nor simple in application. Although the withholding tax rules for schedular payments have not changed for many years, the labour market has undergone significant shifts. While the proportion of people who are self-employed (with no employees) has not changed much over the last 20 years, the industry make-up of these self-emplo yed persons is changing. There has been a decrease in those working in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, and an increase in the professional, scientific, and technical services and administrative and support services. 42 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 114 of 160 The current withholding tax rules generally do not apply to these modern, professional industries. This means more self-employed people are working in industries not covered by the withholding tax rules. 3 In addition, using a company structure has become increasingly popular with contractors. Payments to companies are generally not subject to withholding tax under the schedular payment rules. 4 The diagram below illustrates the increasing use of companies as a vehicle through which to carry out a business over the period 2000-2014. 3 Household Labour Force Survey. This work is based on/includes customised Statistics New Zealand’s data which are licensed by Statistics New Zealand for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. 4 Companies in the agricultural, horticultural, and viticulture industries and non-resident contractor companies are subject to withholding under the schedular payment rules. 43 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 115 of 160 5 These out of date rules are creating issues. Many modern contractors are not subject to the withholding rules and are instead required to manage their own tax obligations (including provisio nal tax). Contractors subject to the withholding rules face an inflexible set of rules that prescribe flat rates of withholding and do not give them the tools to self-manage their obligations. These contractors also have the opportunity to suppress income and operate totally or partially in the hidden economy. Investigators within Inland Revenue are reporting that there are compliance issues with contractors not subject to withholding. These contractors are not paying their fair share of tax and are claiming social policy benefits they are not entitled to. This imposes greater costs and creates inefficiencies. Source deductions are a more efficient means of collecting tax for both contractors as well as Inland Revenue. It costs Inland Revenue $0.28 to collect $100 of tax fro m wit hheld PAYE inco me compared with $2.28 for $100 of income tax from non-withheld income. The out of date rules are imposing greater costs on both contractors and the government. This regulatory impact statement considers three measures to address these issues that are feasible to implement with a 1 April 2017 application date. Options and analysis The options to address the issue are: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Allow contractors subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate. 5 Business Demography Statistics. This work is based on/includes customised Statistics New Zealand’s data which are licenced by Statistics New Zealand for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. 44 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 116 of 160 3. Allow contractors not subject to the schedular payment rules to voluntarily elect into the withho lding rules. 4. Extend withholding to labour-hire firms. The three measures 2, 3, and 4, are not mutually exclusive. Measures not considered There are a number of other options that would address these issues that are not considered in this regulatory impact statement. This includes: • Extending withholding to other directly engaged contractors (for example, IT contractors). • Removing or amending the company exception to the schedular payment rules. • Using banks as an intermediary for withholding rather than the payer of the contractor. These options are not considered in this regulatory impact statement because officials do not consider them feasible to implement by 1 April 2017. These measures require greater policy work and consultation than can be achieved in time for a 1 April 2017 application date. Option 2 - Electing own withholding rate At present the schedular payment rules specify flat rates of withholding to be applied to payments to contractors. These rates will often not match the contractor’s actual income tax liability. Contractors can obtain a special tax code to alter their rate; however the process can be cumbersome and requires an application to Inland Revenue with supporting information. This option would allow contractors to select their own withholding rate without needing to apply to Inland Revenue. This means that an application for a special tax code will no longer be needed to alter the rate applied to a schedular payment. Option 3- Voluntary withholding agreements Contractors not covered by the schedular payment withholding rules are not currently able to have tax withheld on a payday basis. This measure will allow contractors to opt in to withholding through voluntary agreements. The proposal will require both the contractor and the payer to agree before withholding would apply. This will enable these contractors to have greater flexibility to manage their tax obligations. Option 4 - Extending withholding to labour-hire firms A labour-hire firm is a firm that arranges for workers to do work for clients. The labour-hire firm receives payment from the client and on-pays the worker. 45 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 117 of 160 Workers engaged through labour-hire firms are often contractors for the labour-hire firm and the current withholding rules do not generally apply to them. There are at least 4,200 contractors of labour hire firms that are required to manage their own tax obligations and have to deal with provisional tax. These contractors also have opportunities for non-compliance (whether deliberate or accidental). Investigators within Inland Revenue are reporting that there are compliance issues with some labour-hire firm contractors not paying their fair share of tax and claiming social policy benefits they are not entitled to. This option would extend the current withholding tax rules to these contractors. The contractors would be able to elect their own withholding rate (as per option 2) and tax would be deducted at this rate and paid to Inland Revenue. If the contractor picks a rate that generally matches their final tax liability they will not be required to pay provisional tax. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 46 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 118 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Not met Some contractors are not paying their fair share of tax and are claiming social policy benefits they are not ent it led to. Contractors and employees are often doing very similar work, yet have very different rules apply to them. Not met Contractors not subject to withholding have to manage their own tax obligations. Contractors subject to withholding face inflexible rules and are not given effective tools to self-manage. Does not decrease compliance costs for payers (unlike options 2 and 3). Higher processing and enforcement costs for Inland Revenue. Not met Some employers and contractors are structuring to avoid the rules and avoid paying their fair share of tax. No impact 2. Electing own withholding rate Met Contractors in the schedular payment rules are currently generally over-deducted from resulting in a cash-flo w cost to them that other contractors do not have. This change will make it easier for them to have the correct amount deducted. Met Contractors that are subject to withholding will be given more flexibility to pick the correct rate of withholding. Their compliance costs will decrease as they will not have to apply for a special tax code to change their rate of withholding and therefore can more easily get their tax obligations right from the start. Payers of contractors may have an increase in compliance costs as they will have to more frequently change withholding rates. However, this is expected to be small and outweighed by the decrease in compliance costs for contractors. Inland Revenue will have less administration costs from administering special tax code applications and end of year tax bills and refunds. No impact The measure is expected to have an initial upfront fiscal cost of approximately $54 million (of which $19 million is recovered in following two years). This upfront cost arises primarily because the majority of contractors in the schedular payment rules are currently over- withheld and receive a tax refund in the following year. This over- withholding provides a one year fiscal benefit to the government. The proposal is expected to 47 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 119 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue decrease the number of contractors who are over- withheld and therefore reduce this fiscal benefit to the government. 3. Voluntary withholding agreements Met Contractors will be able to voluntarily choose to have withholding apply and so have similar treatment to emplo yees. Met Compliance costs for contractors who enter voluntary agreements will decrease as they have an easier means to pay their tax. Administratio n costs for Inland Revenue will decrease for these contractors as well. No impact Marginal upfront gain. 4. Extending withholding to labour-hire firms Met Contractors working for labour-hire firms will not be able to avoid paying their fair share of tax and claim social policy benefits they are not ent it led to. This option would make the treatment of employees and contractors more similar for tax purposes. Met Will reduce compliance costs for labour-hire firm contractors as they will have an easier means to pay their tax. Compliance costs will increase for labour-hire firms. However, this is expected to be less than the decrease in compliance costs for contractors and as a result overall compliance costs are expected to decrease. Large labour-hire firms have reported that the compliance costs of the proposal for them would be low, while smaller firms have reported that the compliance costs would be higher. Reduced administration costs for Inland Revenue in processing and enforcement for labour-hire firm contractors. Met Contractors working for labour-hire firms will not have the opportunity to structure to avoid paying their fair share of tax. Some contractors may attempt to avoid the rules by contracting with clients directly; however following consultation wit h labour-hire firms we consider that this impact will be low. The impact of this option is difficult to measure as it relies on estimations of the hidden economy. A conservative estimate shows a revenue benefit of $5 million-$10 million a year. 48 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 120 of 160 Minimum rates of withholding One design decision for the electing own withholding rate proposal is whether or not to require contractors to have a minimum rate of withholding. With a minimum rate, contractors who want to have a rate of withholding below the minimum will need to apply for a special tax code. The key advantage of a minimum rate is that it reduces the fiscal risk that contractors may attempt to defer or avoid paying their tax through picking artificially low rates. The key disadvantage is that it limits choice for contractors and therefore imposes withholding tax on compliant contractors who may prefer provisional tax. With a minimum rate of 10%, the fiscal impact of the proposal is expected to be approximately $54 million (with $19 million of this recovered in the subsequent two years). With no minimum rate this increases to approximately $111m (with $39 million recovered in subsequent two years). Consultation Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have consulted on these measures with industry groups and businesses, including small and large labour-hire firms. These groups were generally supportive of the measures and believed they would reduce overall compliance costs. Larger labour-hire firms have said that compliance costs of the proposals would be relatively low, while smaller labour-hire firms have reported that compliance costs would be relatively greater for them. In their submissio ns, labour-hire firms said the labour-hire rules need to apply consistently across all labour-hire industries, and that it is unlikely that labour-hire contractors will change their behaviour to avoid the rules by contracting directly with clients. The analysis and rules recommended in this regulatory impact statement reflect these submissions. One concern raised by submitters was that the electing own withholding rate proposal could significantly increase compliance costs for withholders if contractors repeatedly alter their withho lding rates. We are proposing to address this through requiring the consent of the withholder to further changes in a contractor’s withholding rate if the contractor has previously changed their withholding rate twice within one year. Recommendations Inland Revenue supports options 2, 3, and 4. These three measures take the first step in modernising the withholding rules for contractors and can be implemented by 1 April 2017. These three options will reduce overall compliance costs and provide a fairer, more sustainable tax system. As a result we consider them an improvement over the status quo. Approximately 130,000 taxpayers currently subject to withholding tax for contract work will have greater flexibility to self-manage and at least 4,200 labour hire contractors will be brought into withholding. 49 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 121 of 160 APPENDIX C – MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER Status quo and problem definition Taxpayers are required to pay the right amount of tax on time. To encourage taxpayers to pay on time, late payment penalties are imposed on overdue tax. The late payment penalty is imposed in two stages: the initial late payment penalty and the incremental late payment penalty. The initial late payment penalty is also applied in two steps: a one per cent penalty imposed the day after the due date and a four per cent penalt y imposed on the seventh day if the tax remains outstanding. An incremental late payment penalty of one per cent is imposed each month the tax remains outstanding. In addition, UOMI is imposed from day one on the outstanding amount and any initial and incremental late payment penalties. Interest is calculated on a daily basis on the amount of underpaid tax (including late payment penalties) but is not included in the calculation of the late payment penalty, and does not compound. The current rate for the underpayment of tax is 9.21% per annum. In some circumstances late payment penalties are not imposed such as where the taxpayer is under a formal instalment arrangement, the taxpayer is providing information to the Commissioner to consider debt relief, where the unpaid tax is below $100 or in certain circumstances where the underlying tax assessment is being disputed by the taxpayer. In addition there is a grace period for taxpayers who have been compliant for the previous two years. These taxpayers are not charged late payment penalties if the payment is made up quickly. Total debt is approximately $5.15 billion 6 , with penalties and interest representing a significant proportion of the total debt book. Many of these accumulated late payment penalties are written off by Inland Revenue as uncollectible. In past surveys, taxpayers have advised Inland Revenue that their reasons for incurring late payment penalt ies are due to administrative error, short-term and long-term cash-flow problems. The late payment penalty does not effectively encourage all taxpayers to comply. For some taxpayers, late payment penalties can be seen as ineffective if they are imposed on people who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). The first group feel Inland Revenue is penalising them for an honest mistake and will grudgingly pay the penalty. The second cannot pay the initial amount and so will not be able to pay the penalties. The third is unlikely to be motivated by a financial penalty and so other tools would be more effective. The issues with the late payment penalty are its size, blunt application, and imposit ion on groups where it is ineffective as a collection tool. 6 Inland Revenue Annual Report, 2015. 50 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 122 of 160 Together, the late payment penalties and UOMI mean taxpayers incur a combined rate of approximately 27% in the first year. This combined penalty and interest rate is less in subsequent years as only the monthly incremental late payment penalty is imposed. UOMI rates are based on the Reserve Bank rates and fluctuate depending on the market. In previous years UOMI has been set at over 14% per annum, resulting in a combined penalty and interest rate of over 30% in the first year. This also has a significant impact on the amount of uncollectible penalties that are added to the tax debt book. Under the current penalty and interest rules, within two years (without repayments), penalties and interest compound to more than 50% of the original tax owed. Inland Revenue’s research has shown that for many indebted SME taxpayers, once the component of the penalties and interest reaches this point, they feel overwhelmed by their debt and become disengaged. At this point, imposing any additional late payment penalties becomes counterproductive as their imposit ion may further discourage the taxpayer from complying. Working for Families Tax Credits (WFFTC) shares many income tax administrative and enforcement rules including filing requirements, terminal tax date, and the penalty (i.e. late payment penalty) rules. Therefore, WFFTC recipients face similar issues to taxpayers regarding how quickly penalties and interest accumulate. However, unlike income tax, WFFTC has a different purpose; to financially support families’ day-to-day living costs. Currently, the late payment penalty rules can subject many indebted low income recipients to significant stress and anxiety as they struggle to afford to repay their WFFTC debt (due to overpayments), while watching their debt quickly grow to an unmanageable level. As a consequence much of this debt is written off. New Zealand’s current combined penalty and interest rate is significantly higher than most commercial lending institutions in New Zealand, as well as other OECD countries, including Australia. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. This limitation extends to the scope of the options as well as their design – that is, whether the option could apply to all tax types or just specific tax types such as GST or Working for Families. It is difficult to estimate the behavioural impact any changes to the penalty rules might have on both compliant and non-compliant groups of taxpayers. Any financial penalty that is imposed and consequently paid by the taxpayer is revenue to the government. Due to the difficulty in estimating the behavioural impact of any changes, officials are unable to fully estimate the fiscal cost of any changes in the late payment penalty rules. Inland Revenue is deploying a new IT system (START) which will supersede the legacy system (FIRST) over the course of the next few years. To avoid having to amend both the legacy system and build the new rules into START, any changes to late payment penalties will only apply to taxes as they migrate to START. 51 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 123 of 160 Options and analysis Options to address the issue are: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty. 3. Remove the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty. 4. Remove all late payment penalties and apply UOMI only. 5. Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances. Option 1 – Retain the status quo The high combined rate leads to increasing debt and high compliance costs for the taxpayer and high administration costs for Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will continue to struggle to constructively engage with indebted taxpayers. The lack of flexibility around the late payment penalty rules will prevent Inland Revenue from being able to effectively support newly indebted taxpayers. Option 2 – Reduce the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty Attempting to have a meaningful incremental late payment penalty will st ill result in a higher than desirable combined penalty and interest rate. For example, based on current UOMI rates, an incremental late payment penalty rate of 0.5% will result in the combined penalty and interest rate of approximately 21% per annum, in the first year. On its own, a reduced incremental late payment penalty is unlikely to provide a significant compliance benefit over the status quo, as taxpayers are unlikely to be further encouraged to comply by anticipating a reduced incremental late payment penalty if they do not comply. In addition, these unpaid incremental late payment penalties will continue to be added to the tax debt book. This option will continue to maintain a financial incentive for indebted taxpayers to enter into instalment arrangements, in order to avoid the imposition of the monthly incremental late payment penalty. Overall, this option, in effect, maintains the current incremental late payment penalty framework, including continuing to penalise taxpayers long after the debt was due, and in most cases imposing an additional financial penalty which is unlikely to encourage the taxpayer to comply. Option 3 – Remove the 1% incremental late payment penalty Only the one-off initial late payment penalty of 1% one day after the due date and 4% after seven days will be imposed. This option results in the combined penalty and interest rate decreasing from approximately 27% per annum, to approximately 15% per annum, in the first year. 52 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 124 of 160 This revised rate is more in line with unsecured lending from traditional commercial lenders. It ensures there continues to be a financial cost to taxpayers who do not pay on time. In addit ion, this option will enable taxpayers to repay their debt in a more sustainable way, as the debt is not incurring continuous late payment penalties. Currently, indebted taxpayers that enter into instalment arrangements have their future incremental late payment penalties suppressed (not imposed). In effect, this option removes the financial incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement. However, taxpayers would continue to have an incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement before the due date, to avoid the 4% penalty. In addition, the taxpayer continues to receive certainty that Inland Revenue will also adhere to the instalment arrangement and allow the taxpayer to repay the unpaid tax, over time, without taking action to enforce the tax debt. Removing the incremental late payment penalty means indebted taxpayers no longer incur late payment penalties that might have otherwise encouraged some to pay months or years after the due date. However, the reduced combined penalty and interest rate will reduce the growth of the debt and consequently provide more opportunity to all indebted taxpayers to repay their tax debt before it becomes too big to resolve. Option 4 -Remove all late payment penalties and impose UOMI only This option removes all late payment penalties (initial and incremental) and only imposes UOMI on unpaid tax, one day after the due date. This single rate will provide a better understanding to taxpayers of the consequences of not paying on time. As UOMI is compensation to the government for the loss of the use of the money, this option does not contain any financial penalty element notwithstanding some taxpayers’ perception that UOMI is punitive. The financial consequences of non-payment would be significantly lower than under the status quo, even during the time the tax has become initially outstanding. For taxpayers struggling financially, this option will likely encourage further non- compliance. Due to their likely credit risk, the taxpayer’s marginal cost of borrowing is likely to be higher than the UOMI being imposed on tax debt. This would lead to most indebted taxpayers choosing not to pay their tax liability because it is cheaper to owe Inland Revenue than to borrow the money to pay the outstanding tax. This places Inland Revenue at a distinct disadvantage and will likely lead to an increase in Inland Revenue’s tax debt book. This option will also likely erode confidence in the integrity of the tax system as compliant taxpayers will not see non-compliant taxpayers being penalised for failing to pay tax. Option 5 – Broad discretion to impose penalties based on individual circumstances This option would have Inland Revenue officers exercising discretion to decide whether to impose a late payment penalty. 53 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 125 of 160 This option would provide Inland Revenue with the legislative flexibility to impose a late payment penalty of any amount, at any time, on any taxpayer it chooses. The financial penalty would be imposed on taxpayers that have consistently demonstrated non-compliant behaviour, rather than taxpayers that have paid late due to genuine error. This option will likely have very high administration costs as Inland Revenue would be required to manually intervene and telephone all taxpayers that have not paid on time to determine the reasons for the late payment and whether a late payment penalty should be imposed. It will be very difficult for Inland Revenue to make this determination with a reasonable level of certainty. This option provides several avenues for indebted taxpayers to successfully avoid incurring a late payment penalty. Some taxpayers may take less care in making their payments on time if they feel that they could successfully argue that the late payment was due to a genuine mistake. Taxpayers may be less concerned about making their payments on time if they feel that they can successfully resist Inland Revenue’s efforts to contact them to discuss the reasons for their late payment. Taxpayers wit h more knowledge of the tax system would be more likely to be successful in not having a late payment penalty imposed. Due to this option requiring Inland Revenue to make highly subjective decisions, inconsistencies may occur. Over time, differences in treatment and other inconsistencies are likely to reduce taxpayers confidence in the integrity of the tax system. These options are analysed against the objectives in the table on the next page. 54 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 126 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Partially met Taxpayers in similar circumstances are treated in a similar way. However, for some taxpayers, imposing the financial penalty may be disproportionate to their circumstances and may be viewed as unfair. Once the existing debt is significant, any additional financial penalty becomes ineffective at motivating the taxpayer to actively attempt to comply. It is unfair to repeatedly impose unreasonably high financial penalties for the late payment of tax. Not met Continue to create compliance costs for taxpayers having to pay significant financial penalties in order to repay their tax debt in full. Continue to create compliance costs of stress and anxiety on taxpayers, due to the high growth of their tax debt. Higher administration and enforcement costs for Inland Revenue, to manage and recover tax debt. Not met High growth of penalties leads to many taxpayers becoming insolvent. Their continued non- compliance leads to Inland Revenue taking legal action. As a result other taxpayers become negatively affected. Some taxpayers are incurring significant penalties on their tax debt, only for them to be later written off, leading to uncertainty about how many outstanding late payment penalties are recoverable. The overall portion of financial penalties in the debt book that are unrecoverable will continue to increase.

Reduce the rate of the incremental late payment penalty. Partially met While the incremental late payment penalty rate is reduced, the combined penalty and interest rate may be too high to effectively encourage significantly indebted taxpayers to engage with Inland Revenue. Lacks fairness as Inland Revenue continues to impose a high combined rate, while expecting the taxpayer to be motivated to repay their tax debt. Taxpayers will c ontinue to have a financial incentive to enter into an instalment arrangement. Partially met Taxpayers will continue to incur significant stress and anxiety in attempting to resolve their tax debt, due to the continued imposit ion o f penalties on their tax debt lo ng after it i s due. Inland Revenue would likely have a small reduction in its administration and enforcement costs (compared to the status quo), due to the smaller incremental late payment penalties being added to the tax debt book. Not met Unpaid and potentially uncollectible incremental late payment penalties will continue be added to the debt book, though this will be less than the status quo. This option would likely have a negative revenue impact, lower than the recommended option. 3.

There is no penalty imposed on taxpayers that do not pay on time. Not met Reduced compliance impact as taxpayers will have reduced growth in their tax debt. However overall, the compliance impact may increase as indebted taxpayers will have more interaction with Inland Revenue as Inland Revenue make greater attempts to encourage them to pay the tax debt.

Not met A UOMI only rate may lead to some compliant taxpayers deciding that it is financial justificat ion to pay other creditors instead of Inland Revenue and thus become non-compliant. The lack of a penalty for non- compliance would likely lead to an erosion of taxpayer confidence in the integrity of the tax system, as compliant taxpayers will perceive that non-compliant taxpayers are not being penalised. This option would have a higher cost than the recommended option. This makes this option less viable for the government. 5.

These groups were generally supportive of the preferred options, as the recommended changes will result in a late payment penalty that is more fairly set and imposed. Recommendations Officials recommend option 3 - remove the 1% incremental late payment penalty. This will reduce the combined penalty and interest rate to a more sustainable level and over time will reduce the amount of unrecoverable late payment penalties in the debt book. This option continues to incentivise taxpayers to pay on the due date by continuing with the initial late payment penalty. This will also ensure that compliant taxpayers will continue to see non- compliant taxpayers being penalised for failing to pay on time. This option does remove the financial incentive for indebted taxpayers to enter into an instalment arrangement. However, the other significant benefit of an instalment arrangement remains; the certainty that while the debt is being repaid under the instalment arrangement Inland Revenue will not take action to enforce the it. Once fully implemented option 3 will result in the incremental late payment penalty no longer being imposed on 65,000 taxpayers with income tax debt, 67,000 taxpayers with GST tax debt, and 23,000 families with Working for Families Tax Credit debt. 59 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 131 of 160 APPENDIX D – MAKING MARKETS WORK BETTER THROUGH TAX TRANSPARENCY Status quo and problem definition Inland Revenue has extensive information collection powers. Revenue authorities tend to be granted wide powers to help them make sure all taxpayers comply with their tax obligations. As a counterbalance, these powers generally come with requirements on the revenue authority of tax secrecy. Tax secrecy has traditionally been considered necessary for promoting taxpayer compliance. Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy laws are broad, 7 covering all matters relating to legislation administered by Inland Revenue. Communication of these matters is not normally permitted other than for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation. Over time exceptions have been made to this strict rule, the majority of which involve cross- government information sharing. These exceptions reflect the weighing of principles of tax secrecy against the need to support economic efficiency and growth, and wider government outcomes. There are at least two areas where Inland Revenue does not currently have the power to share tax secret information, and where the sharing of this information would support economic efficiency. Specifically, there are opportunities to better inform and protect New Zealand’s business community from risks associated with its non-compliant participants. Significant tax debt Information about tax debt is tax secret. Inland Revenue does not disclose information about a taxpayer’s tax debt to others, except where a claim is lodged in court for recovery of the debt. However, there is arguably little difference between a tax debt and any other debt a taxpayer may have, especially in the context of risk posed to an indebted business’s creditors. While unpaid tax is owed to the Crown as opposed to another business, it remains a debt with a corresponding repayment obligation on the non-compliant taxpayer and will attract interest (and potentially penalties) so long as it remains outstanding. Mechanisms exist to facilitate creditors’ and potential creditors’ understanding of a business’s creditworthiness in relation to commercial debt. The lack of visibility of tax debt can have a significant impact on other businesses that have made credit decisions without full information, especially if the business with tax debt collapses and these other businesses are unsecured creditors. In addition to an information problem, the status quo raises concerns for the integrity of the tax system. Some taxpayers who are failing to resolve debt with Inland Revenue are not currently motivated to comply with their obligations despite the debt’s accumulation of interest and penalties. While these taxpayers are able to ignore significant tax debt by virtue of it being iso lated fro m their regular commercial dealings, non-compliant businesses that 7 Section 81, Tax Administration Act 1994 60 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 132 of 160 remain in business and fail to address their debt are able to unfairly compete against those who pay on time and are compliant with their tax obligations. Enforcement of wider business obligations In the course of undertaking its core duties, Inland Revenue obtains and holds information about businesses’ (and their directors’) non-compliance with non-tax legal obligations. Inland Revenue research has shown that those that are non-co mpliant with their obligations under the law in one area are likely to be non-compliant in other areas. 8 Businesses that continue to defy their obligations without detection or sanction pose significant risks to other businesses and to New Zealand’s reputation as a safe and transparent country in which to invest and do business. These businesses further represent a risk to the revenue and to the integrity of the tax system, because they are more likely to be non-compliant with their tax obligations and the tax obligations they are required to fulfil on behalf of employees. With the exception of Inland Revenue’s ability to share information with New Zealand Police in relation to serious criminal offences, Inland Revenue cannot usually share information about businesses’ and directors’ non-tax illegal conduct with agencies that enforce the relevant laws. This means that, without the sharing of information: • some cases of illegal conduct are being committed and discovered (or partially discovered) by Inland Revenue, but are never brought to the attention of the relevant enforcement agency; and • some cases of illegal conduct that are being investigated or prosecuted by another agency are not being handled as efficiently as they would be if that agency was able to request information already held by Inland Revenue. If Inland Revenue was able to share information, the likelihood of non-compliant businesses being charged or prosecuted would increase and the associated harm reduce. Reducing harm caused to compliant businesses would ultimately support greater economic efficiency by lowering the risks and costs associated with being in business in New Zealand. More efficient enforcement of wider business obligations would also strengthen the integrity of the tax system by ensuring businesses and directors, who are non-compliant in multiple areas including tax obligations, are comprehensively held to account. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. The analysis that follows is also constrained by limits of measuring the scope of the issue. It is not possible to accurately measure the number of businesses and members of the public affected by non-compliant taxpayers that are able to conceal their significant tax debt or illegal activity. Officials’ analysis relies on general assumptions including: 8 Habitual Non Complier Tier 2 Analysis, Inland Revenue. 61 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 133 of 160 • Taxpayers in significant tax debt are likely to have a number of credit arrangements with a number of businesses; and some of these businesses will be unsecured creditors who are vulnerable in the event of the taxpayer’s business collapsing. • Businesses (and their directors and management) behaving illegally are likely to pose a risk to a large number of other parties including their shareholders, creditors, and emplo yees. Options Officials have identified the following options: 1. Retain the status quo. 2. Share significant tax debt informat ion with credit reporting agencies. 3. Share significant tax debt informat ion with the general public. 4. Share information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies. 5. Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations. Options 2 and 3 are not mutually exclusive with measures 4 or 5. Option 1 – Status quo Tax secrecy laws would remain as they are and Inland Revenue would be unable to provide any information to credit reporting agencies. Businesses would continue to enter into arrangements with other parties with no visibility of the other party’s tax debt. This would expose them to risk if they were extending credit to a business that was heavily indebted to Inland Revenue. Option 2 - Share information on significant tax debt with credit reporting agencies Tax secrecy laws could be amended to permit the disclosure of certain tax debt information to credit reporting agencies, for use in credit ratings. This option would provide members of the business community who are seeking credit information on a taxpayer with a more complete understanding of that taxpayer’s creditworthiness. To target the option toward tax debt that poses the most risk to other businesses, officials recommend this disclosure be limited to significant income tax and GST debt, and unpaid PAYE, KiwiSaver, student loan and child support deductions. 9 The scope of “significant” debt would be the subject of various legislative criteria. The criteria would be designed to ensure credit reporting was only an option when disclosure would be proportionate given the level of risk accompanying the debt. The detail of the 9 Note, this proposal includes employer debt relating to employee deductions employers have failed to remit to Inland Revenue; it is not proposed that social policy debt be reported to credit agencies. 62 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 134 of 160 criteria would likely take into account factors including age and size of debt and the likelihood of it being repaid. It is recommended that in all cases Inland Revenue should be required to have attempted to resolve the debt prior to disclosure, and that disclosure not be permitted if debt is under an instalment arrangement or is in dispute. Finally, prior to information being disclo sed it is recommended that the affected taxpayer is given thirty days’ notice, and that this notice is served on the taxpayer personally to ensure its effectiveness. This option would require rigorous safeguards to ensure the accuracy and security of information being disclosed to credit reporting agencies. One advantage of this option is that credit reporting agencies already have robust processes in place as they are already in the business of dealing with debt information on a commercial scale. Inland Revenue would need to establish its own corresponding processes. One limitation attached to this option is that within the time available, officials have been unable to comprehensively work through privacy issues around credit reporting significant tax debt of individuals. Specifically, more work is required to determine the consistency of this proposal with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004, which contains obligations for credit reporting agencies’ use of individual information. Therefore this option would only initially be available for significant tax debt attached to non-individual taxpayers. Despite this limitation, officials believe the option remains well targeted to the policy problem. While individuals are capable of developing significant business tax debt and causing harm to other businesses, a large proportion of the significant debt informat ion problem stems fro m non-individual taxpayers. Officials continue to work with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to better understand the issues around credit reporting individuals’ significant tax debt. Option 3 - Share information on significant tax debt with the general public This option could make use of similar criteria as described for option 2, with the difference being that debt information would eventually be published rather than used in determining credit ratings. The information would be available for general access, for example using a searchable website. This option would allow a broader range of people to gain information than would be the case under option 2. Disclosure to a wider range of people comes with potential compliance benefits through strongly incentivising the repayment of the debt. On the other hand, the option is not as well targeted to the policy problem as option 2, as many people without a legitimate interest in a taxpayer’s creditworthiness, and to whom the taxpayer’s debt does not represent a risk, would have access to the information. The option would also lack some of the robust safeguards that accompany the use of credit reporting agencies. This option is likely to expose taxpayers to an inappropriate level of reputational risk without much further benefit to market efficiency. Option 4 - Share serious offences information with the registrar of companies This option would involve a new exception to tax secrecy rules to allow Inland Revenue to share information with the Registrar of Companies in relation to certain serious offences 63 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 135 of 160 (meaning offences with a maximum sentence of imprisonment of 5 years or more) under the Companies Act 1993. These offences relate to serious harmful conduct by company directors and management. Inland Revenue would be able to share information with the Registrar, either proactively or in response to a request, when: • there is reasonable suspicion (on the part of the initiating agency) that a serious offence has been, is being, or will be committed; • Inland Revenue considers the information being shared will prevent, detect, or provide evidence of, a serious offence that has been, is being, or will be committed; and • Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to communicate it, and communication is in the public interest. This option would be developed to closely resemble Inland Revenue’s current ability to share information with New Zealand Police in relation to serious crime. Due to the serious nature of the offences involved, it is not expected there will be a large number of shares taking place. Option 5 - Share information for enforcement of wider business obligations Exceptions to tax secrecy legislation could be developed to enable Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies for the enforcement of business obligations under various pieces of legislation. For example, Inland Revenue could share information generally to ensure other agencies’ registry records match information held by Inland Revenue, or Inland Revenue could share information in relation to lower level offences. Due to Inland Revenue’s wide information gathering powers it is very likely that it holds much of this information and that it would be useful to other agencies. That being said, sharing tax secret information for the purpose of aiding other agencies’ enforcement activity will often not be an appropriate use of taxpayers’ information or Inland Revenue’s resources, and exceptions to tax secrecy legislation should only be developed where they can be strongly justified. Sharing information below the serious offence threshold is likely to be an inappropriate use of the information and of Inland Revenue’s resources. It should be noted that there are non-criminal provisions, under the Companies Act and other legislation, that carry serious sanctions or serve an essential policy purpose despite not being serious criminal offences. There may be justification for including such provisions alongside serious criminal offences in future information sharing arrangements. For example, in developing these options officials considered the sharing of information in relation to two further Companies Act provisions: • The requirement for a company to have a director based in New Zealand, which is intended to prevent the abuse of shell companies; and 64 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 136 of 160 • The Registrar of Companies’ power to prohibit a director of a failed company from being a director of, or taking part in the management of, another company for up to ten years. Ultimately these provisions have not been included in the recommended option because expanding information sharing beyond a serious criminal offence standard requires further analysis and this analysis could not be completed in the available time. Options not considered Share serious offences information with a range of agencies There are a number of enforcement agencies other than New Zealand Police and the Companies Office that investigate and prosecute serious offences, some involving business and director conduct. Information sharing with these agencies may also have the potential to improve market efficiency. Given the limited time available to advance policy options for this package, officials have prioritised work on information sharing with the Registrar of Companies for serious director offences. The nature of these offences means this particular sharing proposal has strong potential to better protect compliant participants in the business community. Inland Revenue is also likely to have information that is relevant to the investigation and prosecution of these offences. The Government discussion document Making tax simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act discusses the future of cross government information sharing. The Government is currently considering how to better use agencies’ information, and in particular how to use information more effectively to combat organised crime. The document seeks feedback on the extent to which Inland Revenue should increase information sharing with other government agencies. This feedback will inform future decisions on extending information sharing for other serious offences. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 65 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 137 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue impact 1.

Share information on serious offences with Registrar of Companies Met Fairness is achievable with strict tests and high thresholds for sharing. It is also in the public interest to achieve efficient enforcement of criminal director offences rather than allow these directors to continue to pose a risk to the compliant business community. Met This option is expected to be implemented at a low administration cost. This option would only involve a small number of information shares; however it is likely that successful enforcement of serious Companies Act provisions would reduce harm to a larger population of compliant businesses.

Potentially posit ive Compliant businesses will be less subject to harm from habitually non-compliant businesses and directors. 67 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 139 of 160 Consultation Officials have consulted with a range of private and public sector stakeholders including the Corporate Taxpayers Group, credit reporting agencies, large accounting firms, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). Those consulted were broadly supportive of the policy intent underlying the options of credit reporting of significant tax debt and sharing information on serious offences with the Registrar of Companies. The majority of stakeholders consulted stressed that, given the potential consequences attached to sharing taxpayers’ information for these purposes; there should be high thresholds and sensible criteria for disclosure. Specifically regarding the option of credit reporting of significant tax debt, as stated above the OPC has assisted officials’ understanding of issues surrounding credit reporting of individuals’ information and officials will continue to work through these issues with OPC. Specifically regarding options for information sharing with enforcement agencies, several stakeholders expressed a desire for an overarching framework for cross-Government information sharing of tax secret information. These stakeholders were supportive of sharing in relation to serious criminal offences, including company director offences, but were concerned that information sharing policy was being developed on an ad hoc basis. These comments have shaped officials’ analysis around not including non-criminal Companies Act offences alongside serious director offences in option 2 without further work. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 – share significant tax debt information with credit reporting agencies. Although this option would, at least initially, be limited to disclosure of non- individuals’ information it would help to remedy the current information problem that exists for businesses that require information on other businesses’ creditworthiness. The reporting of certain tax debts would allow these businesses to make more optimal lending decisions and leave them less vulnerable to the effects of other businesses collapsing with significant tax debt. The use of credit reporting agencies for the disclosure of this information would target the policy response to the problem and avoid unjustified disclosure of information. Officials also recommend option 4 – share serious offence information with the Registrar of Companies. This option would lead to more efficient enforcement of serious director offences by the Registrar and reduce harm to the business community and wider public. The detection of this offending and sanction of seriously non-compliant directors would also benefit the tax administration system because it is likely that some of these directors are also not complying with their tax obligations. As stated above, officials have prioritised sharing with the Registrar of Companies because improved enforcement of serious offences under the Companies Act would be especially beneficial for improving market efficiency. Officials recommend further work around the development of a clear framework for this sharing to occur. 68 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 140 of 160 APPENDIX E – SUPPLEMENTARY SIMPLIFICATION MEASURES Research shows that tax compliance costs are relatively high for small businesses. However, measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This section outlines supporting simplification measures that will reduce the amount of paperwork required by businesses, and make it easier to manage their tax affairs without significantly affecting the amount of revenue collected by the government. The measures include simplified rules for businesses to calculate FBT, account for vehicles and premises, and deduct employee remuneration. They also include some threshold adjustments to enable more small businesses access to simplified rules for filing and correcting errors. Constraints Ministers have asked officials for options that could be included in a business tax package to apply from 1 April 2017. This has limited the feasible options that officials could consider to those that can be implemented within the timeframe. 1 – Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Status quo and problem definition Small business owners often use their personal vehicles and homes for both business and private purposes. Currently they need to allocate their expenses between private and business use. The private use percentage might also vary between different items of expenditure. Because there are numerous expenses for these items, allocating these between business and personal use can create large compliance obligations compared to the amount of tax at stake. The following options (other than the status quo) have been considered for addressing this issue. Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles Options and analysis The options to address this issue are: Option 1 – retain the status quo Option 2 – optional single rate method This method would be optional and extend and modify the current per kilometre option for calculating business use deductions so it could be used regardless of kilometres travelled (the current rules only allow the method to be used if business use is less than 5,000 km). Under this option: • Taxpayers would deduct a fixed amount per kilometre travelled for business purposes based on rates published by Inland Revenue. This would be instead of deducting actual costs. 69 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 141 of 160 • The rates would be set by reference to industry figures, and based on the average per kilometre cost for the average vehicle. The rates would also assume a fixed amount of private use in respect of the fixed cost element, so no apportionment between actual business and private use would be required • The rate would be divided into 2 tiers. The first tier would provide for the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and per kilometre costs. The second tier would provide for the recovery of the per kilometre costs only. • Taxpayers would keep a logbook for a 3 month representative test period to determine the vehicle’s business kilometres as a proportion of the total distance travelled. Taxpayers could then multiply that fraction by the total distance travelled each year to give the business kilometres. Taxpayers would also be able to choose the current method of recording and using their actual business kilometres for an income year. Option 3 – Compulsory single rate method This option is the same as option 2, except the method would be compulsory. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 70 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 142 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Met Completely fair, as the business proportion of actual expenses is deductible. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the number of expenses and the small amount of tax. Not currently time-consuming to administer. Met The actual calculation can be complicated. No impact 2. Optional single rate for Vehicles Met Generally fair, as the rate will be approximately accurate for most vehicles and owners of more expensive vehicles can elect to deduct based on their actual expenses. However owners of older cars may be able to claim greater deductions than their actual expenditure. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. However some taxpayers may elect to calculate their deductions under both this method and the other currently available methods so they can claim the greater amount. This would increase the tax calculations for such taxpayers. The measure will impact sole traders who use their vehicle for both business and personal purposes. There are up to 3,500 such taxpayers. Met The actual calculation is easier, rates will be broadly accurate for most taxpayers, and there is a significant cost floor for vehicle use. Small cost Taxpayers with older vehicles may be able to deduct more than their actual expenditure, while taxpayers with newer or more expensive vehicles can elect not to use the method. The estimated fiscal cost for this option is $700,000 per year. 71 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 143 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 3.Compulso ry single rate for vehicles Not met The method will be unfair for taxpayers with newer or more expensive vehicles, as the variability of vehicle costs (especially depreciation) means that an average rate could be significantly less than their actual expenses. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. The measure will impact the same number of taxpayers as option 2, although taxpayers will not be able to opt out of it. Met The calculation is easier than the status quo. There should not be any fiscal cost or savings, as the rates will be set based on the average vehicle expenditure. No impact There should not be any fiscal cost or savings, as the rates will be set based on the average vehicle expenditure. 72 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 144 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend that option 2 be adopted – optional single rate for vehicles. While an optional method has some disadvantages in terms of efficiency and sustainability, officials consider the variance in the actual costs of car ownership is too wide for a compulsory single rate to be acceptably fair. Owners of newer and more expensive cars may see a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. A more accurate compulsory method could be developed, but this would erode the compliance cost benefits. 2 – Simplified calculation of deductions for business use of premises. Options and analysis Options to address this issue are: Option 1 – Retain the status quo Option 2 – Optional single rate method Under this option, the deduction for business use of premises would be calculated by multiplying the number of square metres of the premises used primarily for business purposes by a single rate. A different rate would apply depending on whether the taxpayer owned or rented their premises. Taxpayers would also claim a deduction for their actual rates, mortgage interest or rental costs, based on the percentage of the premises used primarily for business purposes. This method would be optional. Option 3 Compulsory single rate method This option is the same as option 2, except the method would be compulsory. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 73 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 145 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo for premises Met The business proportion of actual expenses is deductible. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the number of expenses and the small amount of tax. Met Generally sustainable. However the actual calculation can be complicated. No impact 2. Optional single rate for premises Met The rate should be fairly accurate and taxpayers will still have the option to deduct based on actual expenses. Some taxpayers may be able to claim greater deductions than their actual expenditure. This is not expected to be significant however, due to the small variance in utility charges. Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation. Also easier to audit, but not otherwise easier to administer. However some taxpayers may elect to calculate their deductions under both this method and the actual cost method so they can claim the greater amount. This would increase the tax calculations for such taxpayers. The measure will impact sole traders who use their premises for both business and personal purposes. There may be up to 3,500 such taxpayers. Met The actual calculation is easier. Small cost Taxpayers could elect to use this method only if it increased their deductions compared with the actual cost method. There is insufficient data to estimate this cost, however it is expected to be fiscally immaterial due to the small variance in utility charges. 3. Compulsor y Single rate for premises Met The rate for utilities etc should be fairly accurate across taxpayers and the more Met More efficient for taxpayers to comply with, due to single rate calculation.

Some taxpayers may be entitled to slightly greater or lesser deductions than their actual expenditure however. taxpayers as option 2, although taxpayers will not be able to opt out of it. housing expenditure. 75 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 147 of 160 Recommendations Officials recommend option 2 for premises. While the method should produce a fairly accurate measure for most taxpayers, some taxpayers will be entitled to smaller deductions under the method than their actual costs. Such taxpayers may consequently regard a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely though that taxpayers would do this every year as premises expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand.. CAANZ submitted that the premises single rate method should be optional. CAANZ also suggested consideration be given to a flat deduction for dual use premises. However Officials consider that a flat deduction would be too inaccurate, given that it would not be proportionate to the size of the premises used for business purposes. Accordingly this suggestion was not included in the options above. 3 – Increase threshold for taxpayer self-corrections of minor errors Status quo and problem definition If a taxpayer makes a minor error in their tax return with a tax effect of less than $500, they can self-correct the error in their next tax return. 10 However, if the error results in more than a $500 tax difference, the taxpayer must request the Commissioner to correct the error. This imposes compliance costs on the taxpayer in having to apply to the Commissioner for a small adjustment. It also imposes administration costs on Inland Revenue in having to manage these low value items. These costs can be high compared with the amount of tax at stake. Options and analysis Options for addressing the issue are to retain the status quo, to increase the self-adjust ment threshold to $1,000, to increase the threshold to $2,000, or set the threshold as a percentage of taxpayer tax or turnover. The option to increase the threshold to $1000 represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $3,571 for a company, $3,030 for an individual and $7,667 for GST. The option to increase the self-adjustment threshold to $2000 represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $7,142 for a company, $6,060 for an individual and $15,333 for GST. 10 Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 76 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 148 of 160 The option to set the self-correction threshold as a percentage of the taxpayer’s tax or turnover would mean a corporate taxpayer with a $50 million tax liability could make a $1 million adjustment if the threshold for self-correction was set at 2% of tax. This represents $3.57 million of income or $7.667 million for GST. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 77 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 149 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Generally fair. Not met Inefficient, as taxpayers must apply to Inland Revenue to self-correct small errors. Met No impact 2. Increase threshold to $1,000 Met Met More efficient, as taxpayers can self-correct larger errors. The measure will affect all taxpayers who make low value minor errors. Met Although less Inland Revenue oversight of error correction slightly increases the potential for abuse. No impact 3.

Partially met As above, although the impact on sustainability increases with the greater threshold. No impact 4. Revenue percentage threshold Not met Unfair as large taxpayers will be able to self-correct larger errors, but arguably fair given the relative significance of the error to the business. Met As above. Partially met As above, except there could be a significant impact on sustainability for large taxpayers, as they could make significant tax adjustments without Inland Revenue oversight. Measure may be abused There might be an impact if large taxpayers abuse the measure to defer income; however this is not possible to estimate. 78 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 150 of 160 Consultation We consulted on the proposal with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. CAANZ and Business New Zealand both supported an increase to the threshold, but considered it needed to be greater to benefit larger business. Corporate Taxpayer Group suggested setting the threshold as a percentage of tax or turnover while CAANZ suggested tiered thresholds based on turnover. Corporate Taxpayer Group also suggested including a requirement to notify Inland Revenue of any corrections made. Officials considered this option (included as option 4 in the table on the previous page), but do not recommend it. This is because it would have a significant impact on sustainability for large taxpayers, as they could make significant tax adjustments without Inland Revenue agreement. Recommendations Officials recommend Option 2, as it provides the best balance between meeting the objectives of fairness and equity, efficiency of compliance and administration, sustainability of the tax system and revenue. 4 – Remove the requirement to renew RWT exemption certificates annually Status quo and problem definition Currently some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) must renew the certificate annually. 11 Taxpayers have argued that this is creating relatively large compliance costs for those who are required to renew for relatively little value. It is also creating an administrative burden for Inland Revenue, as all the annual exemption certificates must be renewed at the same time each year. Options and analysis The following two options, plus the status quo, have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to retain the status quo. Option 2 – Issue certificate for an unlimited period This option would apply for all the available grounds of exemption, except for the taxpayer income estimation option. Inland Revenue would have the discretion to issue exemption certificates for a shorter period in exceptional circumstances. 11 Annual renewal is currently required by Inland Revenue if the applicant is applying for a RWT exemption certificate on the grounds that it has tax losses, a refund of over $500 RWT or estimated annual gross income of over $2 million. Applications on other grounds (such as annual gross income over $2 million in the prior year) do not require annual renewal. 79 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 151 of 160 There is an integrity concern that a taxpayer might no longer be eligible for an RWT certificate, but because they are not required to renew this is not known to Inland Revenue. We consider that this can be adequately mitigated by including a simple “tick the box” declaration on a taxpayer’s tax return. This would require the taxpayer to confirm that they are still eligible to hold their exemption certificate on the basis on which it was granted. Taxpayers will still be required to surrender their exemption certificates when they fail to meet the basis for eligibility on which they were granted. Inland Revenue will also retain its ability to cancel an exemption certificate. Option 3 – Issue certificate for a period greater than a year This option would ensure that taxpayers did not indefinitely retain exemption certificates they were no longer entitled to. However, a large number of exemption certificates are currently issued for an unlimited period (e.g. to charities, banks and entities with annual gross inco me over $2 million) and this option would not change this practice. Also a fixed period would still impose a level of compliance obligation in having to periodically reapply for the certificate. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 80 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 152 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Met Not met Inefficient, as annual applications impose compliance costs on taxpayers and administration costs on Inland Revenue. Met No impact 2.

The measure will affect taxpayers who are required to file annually, other than those applying under the income estimation method. There are currently less than 500 such taxpayers. Met Any integrity concerns can be addressed by requiring taxpayers to indicate in their annual returns whether they are still eligible to hold their certificates. No impact 3. Issue certificate for fixed periods longer than a year Met Partially met More efficient than option 1 but less efficient than option 2, as renewing certificates will impose compliance costs on taxpayers and administration costs on Inland Revenue.

The Corporate Taxpayer Group supported option 2, and recommended it be expanded to other types of exemption certificate (e.g. non-resident contractors withholding tax). CAANZ also supported option 2 in conjunction with the “tick the box” declaration. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objectives and improves efficiency with no significant impact on fairness or sustainability of the tax system. 5 – Increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT Status quo and problem definition Most businesses are required to calculate and return fringe benefit tax (FBT) on a quarterly basis. However businesses that have combined pay as you earn (PAYE) and emplo yer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis. 12 As a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold. Consequently the business will be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs which are still significant relative to the size of the business. Options and analysis Three options have been considered for addressing this issue, namely; retain the status quo, or to increase the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT or from $500,000 to $2 million of PAYE/ESCT. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 12 Sections RD 60 and RD 61 of the Income Tax Act 2007 82 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 154 of 160 Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1.

However the payment of FBT will be a deferral as it will be payable in a lump sum rather than 4 quarterly instalments. Small fiscal cost The fiscal cost of this for close companies is estimated to be $0.5 million over four years. Other taxpayers will still pay their FBT in the same fiscal year. 3. Increase threshold to $2 million No impact on fairness Met More efficient, as only annual filing is required. This will affect 2,100 taxpayers. Met Same as option 2. Small fiscal cost, greater than option 2. 83 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 155 of 160 Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. They did not have any comments. Recommendations Officials recommend option 2, as it meets the objective without a significant fiscal cost. Officials do not recommend option 3, as officials consider a business with combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of over $1 million is sufficiently large to be subject to the standard quarterly filing requirement. 6 – Modify the 63 day rule on employee remuneration Status quo and problem definition There is a special deduction and timing rule for the deferred payment of employee remuneration. Currently, in order to comply with this deferred payment rule, taxpayers need to work out what employee remuneration has been paid during the 63 day period that relates to the previous income year. This creates an additional compliance burden for taxpayers because they need to track payments accrued at year end and paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. Options and analysis The following options have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to retain the status quo. Option 2 – Make the 63 day deferred payment rule optional If taxpayers did not want to apply the deferred payment rule, then they would deduct an amount for all employee remuneration on an “incurred and paid in an income year” basis. This would mean that taxpayers would not need to track employment remuneration payments made within 63 days of the end of the income year and could use the accruals in their financial accounts as a basis for working out the amount of their deduction for emplo yee remunerat ion. Option 3 – Taxpayers choose which employee remuneration is subject to the 63 day rule Taxpayers could choose which types of employee remuneration are subject to the 63 day rule and which types are subject to the ordinary incurred and paid test. Types of employee remuneration include salary and wages, holiday pay and bonus payments. Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table on the next page. 84 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 156 of 160 Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table below. Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Status quo Met Existing rule applies to all taxpayers. Not met Inefficient to comply with, due to the need to track employee payments paid within 63 days of end of income year. Met The rule is well-established. However actual calculation can be time-consuming particularly for large emplo yers. No impact 2. Optional 63 day rule Met Taxpayers will choose whether to apply the existing deferred payment rule or not. Taxpayers will weigh up increased deductions under the existing rule against the compliance costs associated with the existing rule. Met More efficient as taxpayers will have a choice whether to continue applying the existing rule or use the information in their financial accounts. Administratively Inland Revenue will not monitor what option taxpayers elect. Met Taxpayers wanting to continue with the existing rule will not be affected and those not wanting to do the calculation required under the existing rule can apply the simpler rule. Small upfront gain No change to overall amount of deduction over time. 3. Optional 63 day rule for different classes of employee remunerat ion Met Taxpayers will choose whether to apply the existing deferred payment rule to different classes of employee remuneration. Taxpayers will weigh up the benefit of an increased deduction under the existing rule against the compliance costs associated with the existing rule. Partly met Taxpayers will have a choice whether to continue applying the existing rule or use the information in their financial accounts for different types of employee remuneration. Administratively Inland Revenue will not monitor what option taxpayers elect. Met Same reasons as above, except that taxpayers will be using different timing rules and deductibility for the same type of expenditure. Small upfront gain No change to overall amount of deduction over time. 85 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 157 of 160 Consultation We consulted on the options with Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), Corporate Taxpayer Group and Business New Zealand. CAANZ were supportive of the proposal whilst the Corporate Taxpayer Group suggested that the 63-day period should be increased to 90 days. A change to the existing 63-day period has not been considered as part of this proposal because the proposal is a simplification measure. Increasing the day period to 90 days whilst it may increase the deduction amount, does not simplify the calculation. Recommendations Officials recommend adopting option 2 – optional 63 day rule. This option will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving the efficiency by providing taxpayers with a choice. This option also has no disadvantages in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system because the same rule is being applied to all types of employee remuneration rather different rules for different types of employee remuneration as proposed under option 3. 7 – Simplification of fringe benefit calculation for close companies Status quo and problem definition Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT for that benefit, subject to certain exemptions. Sole traders and partners in a partnership who use a motor vehicle in a similar way are not required to register and pay FBT. Instead these taxpayers apportion their motor vehicle expenditure between the business and private use using special motor vehicle expenditure rules. These differences in treatment for what is essentially the same benefit (i.e. the private use of a motor vehicle) arise because of the different entities involved. Options and analysis The following options have been considered for addressing this issue. The first option is to maintain the status quo. Option 2 – Use motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT This option will allow close companies who pay their FBT on an income year basis to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules instead of paying FBT. These companies could choose not to pay FBT for a motor vehicle being available for private use for shareholder-emplo yees. Instead they would measure the business and private use of the motor vehicle and then make an adjustment to the amount of motor vehicle expenditure deducted. The option is available where the only benefit provided is 1 or 2 motor vehicles for private use to shareholder- emplo yees. 86 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 158 of 160 Officials’ analysis of the options is set out in the table below. Options Fairness and equity Efficiency of compliance and administration Sustainability of tax system Revenue 1. Retain the status quo Not met Existing rule treats close companies like other companies who provide benefits to their employees. However close companies are often similar to sole traders and partnerships that use different rules. Not met Inefficient to comply with due to having to register and pay FBT when close companies provide sole benefit to their shareholder- emplo yees. Not met Generally sustainable as the existing rule treats close companies like other companies that provide fringe benefits. However close companies can structure motor vehicle arrangements to minimise or avoid FBT liability. No impact 2. Option for close companies to use motor vehicle expenditure rules Met Provides an option to enable close companies to be treated the same way as a sole trader when accounting for the use of a motor vehicle. Met More efficient as close companies will have a choice whether to register for and pay FBT or use the motor vehicle expenditure rules. Met Generally sustainable as provides a choice for close companies as to how they account for the private use of a motor vehicle by their shareholder- emplo yees. Small fiscal cost Attributable to a reduction in FBT paid over time. 87 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 159 of 160 Consultation Limited consultation with a small number of tax advisers indicates that option 2 would be well-received and would assist with addressing the perceived mismatch in treatment between a sole trader using a motor vehicle for private use and a shareholder-employee in a close company using a vehicle for private use. It was also suggested that this option would increase compliance as it will be viewed as a simpler basis for calculating the private use of the motor vehicle. Recommendations Officials recommend adopting option 2 – option for close companies to use motor vehicle expenditure rules. This option will achieve the objective of providing compliance savings while also improving compliance overall. This option also has no major disadvantage in terms of fairness, equity and sustainability of the tax system. 88 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 160 of 160
Regulatory Impact Statement Transitional regulations during Inland Revenue’s business transformation Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to deal with the potential for delays to Inland Revenue’s transformation process caused by the need for prompt regulatory change. In developing options to deal with the issue, analysis was undertaken of previous transitional regulations, the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines, the Cabinet Manual and various reports of the Regulations Review Committee. None of the previous transitional regulations had considered the option of allowing delegated regulations to be made to remedy transitional issues. Consultation was undertaken with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC), Crown Law, the Ministry of Justice and the Treasury. This consultation resulted in the clarification in the scope of the empowering provision under option 2 (the preferred option). No wider consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. The time constraints resulted from the need to have the proposal enacted as soon as possible given the benefits of the transitional regulation-making provision and the timing of the transformation process. The lack of wider consultation raises a risk that potential problems with the proposals have not been fully identified. However, consultation during the select committee process will mitigate this risk to some extent. Parliament delegating the power to the executive to make regulations that can override primary legislation (under options 2 and 3) risks the separation of powers and fundamental common law principles. However, the proposed safeguards will moderate those risks. Further, Inland Revenue considers that the risks from option 2 are less than the risks to the rule of law from the status quo. Making changes to the tax administration rules and processes by way of delegated regulations under option 3 could adversely impact taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system (as opposed to making any changes by Orders in Council or legislative amendments). None of the policy options would impair private property rights or restrict market competition. The impact of any regulations made under the empowering provision would need to be considered at the time. Charles Ngaki Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 4 August 2016 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation, changes to legislation and administrative processes will be required in a range of areas, including supporting the upgrade to new technology. Some of these issues will require a prompt regulatory response to avoid the potential for delays to the transformation process. 2. Ideally any issues arising from the transformation would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases this will be both necessary and achievable, as it is anticipated that tax bills will be introduced in each year during the transformation process. The problem is that the process leading up to when a bill can be introduced can be complex and time-consuming. This risks valuable taxpayer and Commissioner resources being tied up pursuing outcomes that are not consistent with the policy intent, when a remedy for the issue cannot be achieved quickly. The delays prior to enactment also risk causing uncertainty for taxpayers. There is also a risk that the process could create hurdles that may delay the business transformation process, impede the orderly transition from the old system (FIRST) to the new system (START) and increase the cost of the transformation. 3. In developing options to deal with the issue, analysis was undertaken of previous transitional regulations, the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines, the Cabinet Manual and various reports of the Regulations Review Committee. None of the previous transitional regulations had considered the option of allowing delegated regulations to be made to remedy transitional issues. 4. Consultation was undertaken with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC), Crown Law, the Ministry of Justice and Treasury. No wider consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. The time constraints resulted from the need to have the proposal enacted as soon as possible given the benefits of the transitional regulation-making provision and the timing of the transformation process. 5. The preferred option is to enact an empowering provision to provide for transitional regulations and exemptions to be made by Order in Council during the business transformation process. Inland Revenue considers this would support an orderly transition from FIRST to START, and avoid delays and increased costs for the business transformation process, while minimising the administrative costs and compliance costs. Inland Revenue also considers that while there are some risks associated with using transitional regulations to remedy transitory issues, the use of regulations is a more sustainable option than the status quo. 3 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Inland Revenue’s transformation programme 6. The Government’s objective for the revenue system is for it to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government’s needs. For taxpayers the tax system should be simple to comply with, making it easy to get right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 7. The shift to digital and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, and their expectations of government. 8. Businesses are increasingly using software packages to automate processes and reduce their compliance burden. Businesses have consistently ranked tax as their highest compliance priority, and it often contributes the most to their overall compliance burden. Compliance costs could be reduced by making better use of businesses’ everyday processes and systems to meet tax obligations. Enabling businesses to spend less time on tax and more time on running their business will support Government’s wider goals of building a more competitive economy and delivering better public services. 9. The ways in which individuals work has changed with different types of employment and working arrangements. The New Zealand workforce has become more casualised as permanent employment has become less common, and temporary, casual and contract work has become more prominent. Other trends include part-time and temporary workers increasingly holding multiple jobs, and more self-employment and small businesses. Many of the current tax policies and administrative processes were designed for an era when New Zealand’s workforce was more strongly characterised by salary and wage earners in permanent full-time employment arrangements. 10. To protect the Government’s ability to collect sufficient revenue to keep providing services, it is important that New Zealand’s revenue system keeps pace with change and is as efficient as possible. The fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population and associated demand for high quality healthcare and other services will add impetus to the need for a highly efficient and responsive revenue system. To meet these challenges, Inland Revenue requires a fundamental shift in the way it thinks, designs, and operates. 11. The Government has agreed to change the revenue system through business process and technology change. A digitally-based revenue system, simplified policies, and better use of data and intelligence to better understand customers will simplify how services are delivered and change how customers interact with the revenue system. 12. Having a good overall revenue system means having both good policies and good administration. While the policy framework is fundamentally sound, there is an opportunity to review current policy and legislative settings as levers to help modernise the revenue system and ensure it is responsive to global changes. 13. There is no doubt that Inland Revenue’s computer systems (known as FIRST) need replacement to improve resilience and agility. They have reached the end of their life and are not sustainable in the medium to long term. The FIRST systems are aging, extremely complex, very difficult and costly to maintain, and inflexible. 14. Since FIRST was implemented, a number of income-related social policies have been added to the platform. Implementing social policies within a platform designed for tax administration has added layers of complexity and risk to Inland Revenue’s business processes and technology infrastructure. This in turn limits the department’s ability to respond to government policy priorities. 15. However, business transformation is far more than just updating a computer system. It is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system, and will re-shape the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. A new operating model and new systems will be the catalysts for these changes. Dealing with legislative issues during business transformation 16. As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation, changes to legislation and administrative processes will be required in a range of areas, including supporting the upgrade to new technology. Part of the transition will involve migrating information to the new processing system. The way this information is migrated between the old and new system will mitigate as much as possible the risk of transitional legislative issues occurring. However, it is likely that through the process of this large and complex change programme (including the migration process) issues may arise that require a prompt regulatory response. 17. The current issue relates to the administration of tax, rather than the substantive quantification of a taxpayer’s tax liability. In other words, it relates to the processes and administration of the tax system under the Tax Administration Act 1994 and not the quantification of tax liabilities under the Income Tax Act 2007. The Tax Administration Act 1994 covers a wide range of tax administration processes and rules including: • Rules relating to the role of the Commissioner, taxpayers and intermediaries; • Processes around information collection, record-keeping and tax returns; • Secrecy rules; • Disputes procedures; • Assessment processes and rules; • The processes for binding rulings and determinations; • The rules around the charging of interest and penalties; • The process for challenging a tax assessment; and • The rules for recovering and transferring tax. 18. The transformation is intended to affect a large proportion of the tax administration rules and processes, and it is impossible to anticipate where any issues might arise. 4 19. Legislation can be made either through the enactment of an Act (primary legislation), through an Order in Council (secondary legislation) or through a regulation made by an official or government agency (tertiary legislation or delegated regulations). Generally, changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are made by amendment Acts, but there are a limited number of regulations covering tax administration. The working party that recommended the enactment of the Tax Administration Act (separate from the Income Tax Act), also recommended that the Act should be rewritten with greater attention given to the use of regulations for tax administration.1 The working party recommended that provisions that were of a mechanical or administrative nature should be contained in regulations.2 The recommended rewrite has not been undertaken. However, the wider role of regulations in tax administration is being reviewed as part of the business transformation process. 20. Ideally any issues arising from the transformation would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases this will be both necessary and achievable, as it is anticipated that tax bills will be introduced in each year during the transformation process. 21. The benefits of using the legislative process include: • the issue would be subject to significant parliamentary scrutiny (including through the select committee process); • the process would allow for public consultation; and • any amendments would be formally published as part of the principal Act. 22. Legislative amendments offer a wide range of options, including amendments that have a fiscal impact, retrospective application, are unfavourable to taxpayers, and such amendments are not subject to any time limits. Legislative amendments also provide taxpayers with a high-level of certainty once they are enacted because they cannot generally be judicially reviewed and can only be amended through the legislative process. 23. The problem is that the process leading up to when a bill can be introduced can be complex and time-consuming. The process can be further complicated when it spans an election period. When a remedy for a transitional issue cannot be achieved quickly, valuable taxpayer and Commissioner resources can be tied up pursuing outcomes that are not consistent with the existing policy intent. The delays prior to enactment can cause uncertainty for taxpayers. The process can also create hurdles that may delay the business transformation process, impede the orderly transition from FIRST to START and increase the cost of the transformation. 24. It is envisaged there would be two main situations when a prompt regulatory response may be needed. The first situation is when a process aligned with the current computer system is examined and found to be inconsistent with the current law because of the limitations of the current system. A regulatory response would be needed to provide a bridge between the current process and the correct process in the new computer system. The second situation is when the new computer system offers a more efficient or different process to that currently legislated. A prompt regulatory response could reduce the delay in getting the law 1 Second Report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 (September 1993) 35. 2 Second Report (1993) 36. 5 to line up with the new process, so as to provide a smooth transition from the old law to the new law.3 OBJECTIVES 25. The main objective is to support an orderly transition from the old system (FIRST) to the new system (START), and avoid delays and increased costs for the business transformation process. 26. All options are assessed against the status quo in relation to the main objective and the following criteria: (a) Compliance efficiency: the compliance cost impacts on taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; (b) Administrative efficiency: administrative costs to the Government should be minimised as far as possible; (c) Sustainability: the option should support the coherence and integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. 27. The criteria have equal weighting because they are considered to be equally important. There are trade-offs between the different criteria and the main objective. For example, option 3 meets the main objective and reduces both compliance and administrative costs, but in doing so undermines the rule of law and the integrity of the tax system. 28. The main objective could be seen to overlap with the criteria to some extent, in that any reduction in delays in the transformation process would generally have a consequent reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for the Government. As a result, Inland Revenue has taken care to ensure that any benefits from a reduction in delays to the transformation process are not double-counted. 29. However, while there is a possible overlap, Inland Revenue considers that the main objective is distinct from the criteria. The main objective is to prevent delays to, and increased costs for, the transformation process. This objective is independent of whether this results in a minimisation o f compliance costs for taxpayers or administrative costs for the Government. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 30. Officials have identified three options to address the problem: • Option 1 (the status quo): The first option considered is retaining the status quo, so not enacting any transitional regulation empowering provision. This would mean no specific transitional regulations for Inland Revenue’s business transformation process. Instead, any transitional issues would be remedied by an amending Act; 3 For a discussion of this problem see Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 6 • Option 2 (Orders in Council and exemptions) (preferred approach): The second option is to enact a regulation-making empowering provision to allow transitional regulations and exemptions to be made by Order in Council. This option would still allow issues to be dealt with by an amendment Act if it was deemed appropriate. • Option 3 (Hybrid approach): The third option is to enact an empowering provision that allows regulations and exemptions to be made either by Order in Council or by the Commissioner under a delegated authority, depending on the nature of the transitional issue. This option would still allow issues to be dealt with by an amendment Act if it was deemed appropriate. 31. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the identified options. Option 1 32. The first option considered is retaining the status quo, so not enacting any transitional regulation-making empowering provision. This would mean no specific transitional regulations for Inland Revenue’s business transformation process. Instead, any transitional issues would be remedied by an amending Act. An amending Act would be able to cover the entire scope of issues that might arise during the business transformation process. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 1 Main objective 33. This option does not meet the main objective because the delays in the legislative process may hinder the orderly transition from the old system to the new system. Delays could be caused by the complex and time-consuming process leading up to when a bill can be introduced. This would delay or increase the cost of the transformation process. 34. It is noted that there are often several taxation Bills going through the House at any given time, so any remedial issues could be added to an existing Bill. This would arguably reduce any delays to the transformation process. However, rushing an amendment through an existing bill may raise issues about the sustainability of the option (which is discussed below). Compliance efficiency 35. Inland Revenue considers that overall option 1 would result in uncertainty for taxpayers in the interim while an amendment is progressing through the legislative process, causing undesirably high compliance costs for taxpayers. The delays would hinder the ability for taxpayers to plan for the future and invest with confidence. Specifically, taxpayers would need to assume that any proposed retrospective amendments would be enacted as promised, and that any amendments made during the process would not materially affect them. Taxpayers may need to seek advice during the period of uncertainty, which would mean taxpayers would incur compliance costs. 7 36. Option 1 would also require taxpayers to commit resources to issues that are inconsistent with the policy intent, including in disputes with the Commissioner. The Commissioner is unable to ignore the law under her care and management powers, so she would need to apply the law as it currently stands.4 This may result in taxpayers having to commit resources to transitional issues. 37. In contrast, a benefit of option 1 would be all changes would be made by primary legislation so this would be easily accessible to the public. In this respect, option 1 would minimise taxpayers’ compliance costs, because unlike the other options there would be no need to reconcile the various different pieces of legislation. Option 1 would also provide much more certainty for taxpayers than the other options because the remedies would not be subject to judicial review or disallowance. This certainty would mean there would be little risk to taxpayers of any plans being undermined in the future after the remedial legislation has been enacted. However, Inland Revenue considers the benefits would be minor compared to the compliance costs under option 1. Administrative efficiency 38. Option 1 would have a significant detrimental administrative impact for Inland Revenue. The delays in remedying transitional issues during the transformation process would mean Inland Revenue would have to find work-arounds until an amendment is passed. Inland Revenue would need to commit resources to work with taxpayers during the period of uncertainty, including providing advice. When a remedy could not be achieved quickly, Commissioner resources could be tied up pursuing outcomes that were not consistent with the policy intent (including in disputes). 39. There would no Executive and parliamentary costs in the first instance because the status quo would not require any legislation to be passed initially. However, option 1 would incur ongoing Executive and parliamentary costs in passing the remedial legislation. Sustainability 40. The first option would generally support the sustainability of the tax system but would raise rule of law issues. 41. Amending all legislative issues through amendments Acts would support the coherence of the tax system because it would generally allow time to consider the broader aspects of any remedies. In other words, adopting the full parliamentary process would generally allow the broader context and consequences of any proposed remedies to be scrutinised through the select committee process and broad public consultation (except when the legislation is passed under urgency or added to an existing Bill). 42. Option 1 would also generally support the integrity of the tax system as primary legislation would provide legal certainty for taxpayers. There would be no legal risks when the remedies are enacted by amendment Acts. Further, the integrity of the tax system would be supported by having all the remedies in the principal Act, because taxpayers would only need to refer to the Act to understand the law. This means there would be no need for them to weigh different types of legislation in interpreting the law. 4 IS 10/07: Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts - section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 8 43. However, there is a risk that the urgency of some issues may result in legislation being rushed through either under urgency or by adding it to a Bill already going through the House. Adopting such an approach is arguably inconsistent with best parliamentary practice, as it avoids the very parliamentary and public scrutiny that is intended by the process. This would undermine many o f the benefits of this approach discussed above. In other words, in practice there is a risk that option 1 would undermine the sustainability of the tax system, because it would not have the expected checks or balances. 44. Bill Moore, Acting Chief Parliamentary Counsel, Parliamentary Counsel Office noted to the Regulations Review Committee that trying to remedy all transitional issues through legislative amendments during major computer changes may be showing less respect for the rule of law than using transitional regulations.5 The challenges to the rule of law can arise when it is stated that the transitional issues will be remedied by retrospective amendments enacted later. This means taxpayers have to apply the current law and run the risk the approach will be retrospectively undermined, or they have to ignore the current law and hope that the amendment is enacted as proposed. Option 2 45. The second option is to enact a regulation-making empowering provision to allow transitional regulations and exemptions to be made by Order in Council. 46. As with other transitional regulation-making provisions, regulations and exemptions made under the provision could override primary legislation.6 Specifically, the exemption and regulation-making power would enable the delegated legislation to expressly or impliedly: • Amend, suspend or override a provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994; • Define or amend a term in the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • Exempt a person from a provision of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 47. The scope of issues that could be remedied by transitional regulations under option 2 is limited to those: • that are consistent with the current policy intent (see the safeguards below); and • that are necessary or desirable for the orderly implementation of the business transformation. 48. This means that the regulation-making ability would not allow for any general policy­ making ability. Any issues that represented a change in policy would need to be dealt with by an amendment Act. Further, it only allows issues that relate to the orderly transition to be remedied by regulations. This prevents the power being used to remedy general issues not related to the business transformation process. 5 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 6 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 9 7 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 8 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 10 49. Inland Revenue considered alternative constraints on the scope of the regulation-making power, such as: • they could only be made in respect of certain specified rules or processes; • they could only be made when they were taxpayer-favourable; or • they could not be made when they were retrospective in application. 50. However, Inland Revenue considers that none of the alternative constraints are appropriate limits on the scope of the empowering provision. Inland Revenue considers it is not possible to limit the regulation-making power to specified rules or processes. As noted above, the transformation process is intended to affect a large proportion of the tax administration rules and processes, and it is impossible to anticipate where any issues might arise. As a result, Inland Revenue considers that it would not be possible to anticipate what processes or rules should be subject to the empowering provision. This is consistent with Professor John Burrows’ testimony to the Regulations Review Committee’s investigation into transitional regulations.7 Burrows noted that sometimes “it is just beyond the powers of human foresight to be able to work out exactly how it will work in the early stages.”8 As a result, Inland Revenue considers it is not possible to set a bright-line for the rules and processes that could be covered by the empowering provision. 51. Inland Revenue considers that when a current process is determined to be inconsistent with the current law in a way that was favourable to taxpayers, then a prompt regulatory response would be needed to bring the process back into line with the current law. This could arguably be taxpayer unfavourable but consistent with the policy intent. As a result, Inland Revenue considers that whether an issue is taxpayer-friendly is not an appropriate constraint on the scope of the empowering provision. In addition, some issues may be discovered to be inconsistent with the law that require a prompt retrospective response to prevent compliance costs for taxpayers. As a result, Inland Revenue considers that retrospectivity is not an appropriate limit on the scope of the regulation-making power. 52. As a result, under option 2, issues that have a fiscal impact, retrospective application, or are unfavourable to taxpayers could be remedied either by an amendment Act or by Order in Council. It would be necessary to determine whether the proposal was consistent with the current policy intent to determine which legislative vehicle was appropriate. 53. Given the similar nature of the regulation- making power and the exemption-making power Inland Revenue considers that similar safeguards should apply. The safeguards, modelled on the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines (2014 edition) (LAC Guidelines), would be: • Exercise consistent with policy intent: Any regulations or exemptions made would have to be consistent with the policy intent of the primary legislation, and would not allow for any general policy-making ability. 11 • Parliamentary scrutiny: The regulations and exemptions would be disallowable instruments, and so would be subject to disallowance under the Legislation Act 2012 by resolution of the House of Representatives. • Judicial review: The courts would have a role in determining whether the delegated law-making power had been lawfully exercised. The High Court may declare that the subordinate legislation is invalid on a variety of grounds if it is outside the scope of the empowering provision. • Subject to time limits: Any regulations or exemptions made under the power to address a transitional issue would expire after three years, consistent with the principles prescribed by the Regulations Review Committee. Further, it is proposed that the empowering provision would only apply for the duration of the business transformation process, and would expire at the end of Stage 4 in 2021. If the relevant issue was ongoing after the expiry date, it would need to be amended in the primary legislation. Such issues would be included in a taxation bill before the expiry date. • Necessity for consultation: Before advising on any proposed regulations or exemptions, Inland Revenue would be required to undertake consultation. Depending on the issue, consultation could take a variety of forms, including broad public and private sector consultation or targeted consultation (if the particular issue had no visible impact on taxpayers). The empowering provision would require Inland Revenue to include the outcome of that consultation in the advice on the regulation or exemption. • Transparency: Assisting taxpayers to meet their tax obligations is an important part of Inland Revenue’s role in the tax system. Taxpayers must be informed if their rights and obligations are to be understood. A legislative instrument made under the proposed amendment would be required to be published in the legislative instrument (LI) series in accordance with the Legislation Act 2012. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 2 Main objective 54. Option 2 would allow transitional regulations to be made by Order in Council which would support the orderly transition from the old system to the new system by avoiding delays (or increases in the cost of the process). This option would meet the main objective. Compliance efficiency 55. Option 2 would significantly reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs compared with the status quo, but there are some minor risks. 56. The speed by which regulations could be made would mean that taxpayers would not face the costs of the delays in resolving issues. It would provide qualified certainty for taxpayers within a short time. This would allow taxpayers to organise their affairs and to plan for the future without having long periods of uncertainty that could be caused by the parliamentary process. This would reduce the need for taxpayers to seek advice during the period of uncertainty. However, as the transitional regulations would expire after three years, the certainty would only be for a set period. 57. However, remedying the transitional issues by way of regulation would slightly increase the costs for taxpayers in having to refer to two different types of legislation, and determining how the two relate. This may cause some interpretive issues that may have a compliance cost for taxpayers. 58. Further, while taxpayers would have certainty in a short time for transitional issues, it would not be the same quality of certainty as under option 1. Unlike primary legislation, regulations are subject to disallowance by Parliament and judicial review. This means that there would be a small risk that taxpayers’ expectations could be undermined. This risk would be reduced by undertaking consultation prior to the making of the regulations. Administrative efficiency 59. Option 2 would significantly reduce administrative costs for the Government compared with the status quo. The reduced costs would come from the reduction in delays and in resources needed to be committed to the process for remedying the issues. The reduction in delays would mean that Inland Revenue could more quickly deal with issues which should reduce the resources needed to assist taxpayers during the periods of uncertainty. 60. It is also possible that process changes could be made to option 2 that would allow regulations to be made almost as quickly as under a delegated authority under option 3. For example, Inland Revenue could obtain Cabinet approval that transitional regulations by Order in Council could proceed directly to the Cabinet Legislation Committee with draft regulations. This would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue further. 61. The intention would be to amend the primary legislation by an amendment Act for any issues that were ongoing. This would mean that for some transitional issues both the regulation-making process and the parliamentary process would need to be completed. This duplication of effort would give rise to some increased administrative costs. 62. Option 2 would incur Executive and parliamentary costs in enacting the empowering provision. However, option 2 would require less parliamentary resources on an ongoing basis because some issues would be able to be remedied by Order in Council. Executive resources would still be needed to deal with the Orders in Council. Sustainability 63. Inland Revenue considers that while there were some risks associated with using transitional regulations to remedy transitory issues, the use of regulations would be a more sustainable option than the status quo. 64. Support for using transitional regulations to deal with issues during a major systems change comes from Professor John Burrows in testimony to the Regulations Review Committee’s investigation into transitional regulations.9 Burrows noted: 9 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014) 12 So what one is looking for is a smooth transition from the old law to the new. If things go wrong, if say an IT system is just not ready to cope with the new system for a while, what’s one to do? One can just do nothing, and that means getting into a mess, or try to pass amending legislation, which will take a very long time, given Parliament’s Order Paper— \[an\] amending Act is a very slow and cumbersome way of doing it. So there has to be some efficient way of ensuring that things can be dealt with fairly quickly, and it seems to me that a regulation-making power, provided it’s properly constrained, is an acceptable way of doing that. 65. Mr Moore also voiced support for the use of transitional regulations to remedy issues in situations involving a significant change programme.10 Mr Moore suggested it was more consistent with the rule of law than relying on legislative amendments in the context of a significant change. Further, aligning the proposal with the LAC Guidelines supports the sustainability of the option. As a result, Inland Revenue considers the use of transitional regulations in the current context will generally support the sustainability of the tax system better than the status quo. 66. There are some risks under option 2. There is a risk that the incentive on the Government would be to use the regulation-making power when it would be more appropriate to remedy the issue by a legislative amendment. However, as noted above, the scope of the regulation-making power is limited, and is subject to disallowance and judicial review, so Inland Revenue considers the relevant risk is low. 67. Further, there could be a risk of some incoherence because the lull parliamentary process may not be followed (at least initially). The possible incoherence could arise from a remedial regulation not undergoing the same level of scrutiny as a statutory amendment, and so there would be a risk it would lack the appreciation of the broader context. Taxpayers would need to interpret the primary legislation and any regulations, and there would be a risk the remedy would be unintentionally in conflict with the intent of another part or provision in the Act. Given that the regulations must be consistent with the existing policy intent, this would mean they were ultra vires. However, the regulation-making process does contain some level of scrutiny through the consultation and ministerial processes, so Inland Revenue considers the risk of incoherence to be low. 68. The regulation-making process does not provide the same level of certainty as the parliamentary process. Regulations are subject to parliamentary disallowance and judicial review. Further, the speed by which regulations are made means there is a risk of mistakes. This means there would be a risk to the integrity of the tax system if the remedy is overturned, and taxpayers’ expectations are undermined. Taxpayers may question the integrity of the tax legislation if it could not be relied on. However, Inland Revenue considers this risk to be low because of the proposed safeguards. 69. While there would be an obligation to consult, the regulation-making process would not have the same level of public input as the full parliamentary process (which includes the select committee process). As a result, there would be a risk that taxpayers could perceive that the remedy was unfair or partial to a group of taxpayers. This could risk adversely impacting on taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue considers this risk to be small. 10 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 13 70. Orders in Council are regularly used to deal with transitional issues, and standard processes and safeguards could be put in place to mitigate many of the risks to the integrity of the tax system discussed above.11 Option 3 71. The third option is to enact an empowering provision that allows regulations to be made either by Order in Council or by the Commissioner under a delegated authority, depending on the nature of the transitional issue. 72. A regulation could be made under delegated authority when the matter is of minor technical detail, with little impact on the rights of individuals. Delegated regulations could not be retrospective. When the matter is more than procedural, is clearly not taxpayer favourable, or has a fiscal impact, it would be made by Order in Council (as under option 2). The same requirements listed above under option 2 would apply to regulations made under option 3. As a result, regulations could be made by Order in Council when the matter was consistent with the current policy intent. Any issues that represented a change in policy would need to be dealt with by an amendment Act. Assessment against objective and criteria - option 3 Main objective 73. Option 3 would allow transitional regulations to be made by Order in Council or by delegated authority which would support the orderly transition from the old system to the new system. It could prevent delays more effectively than either option 1 or 2. The speed that transitional issues would be able to be remedied would reduce the chances o f hurdles arising that would delay the transformation process (or increase costs). This option would meet the main objective. Compliance efficiency 74. Option 3 would significantly reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs relative to the status quo but with significant risks. 75. The speed by which regulations could be made would mean that taxpayers would not face the costs of the delays in resolving issues. It would provide qualified certainty for taxpayers within a shorter time than either option 1 or 2. This would allow taxpayers to organise their affairs and to plan for the future with the shortest periods of uncertainty. This would reduce the need for taxpayers to seek advice during the period of uncertainty. However, as the transitional regulations would expire after three years, the certainty would only be for a set period. 11 At least 30 transitional regulation-making provisions have been enacted in the last 10 years: see Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (I.16J, July 2014). Some of situations have involved computer system changes like the student loan reform. 14 76. As noted above, it is also possible that process changes could be made to option 2 that would allow regulations to be made almost as quickly as under delegated authority. For example, Inland Revenue could obtain Cabinet approval that transitional regulations by Order in Council could proceed directly to the Cabinet Legislation Committee with draft regulations. This may mean there is little efficiency gained by delegating the authority to make regulations to the Commissioner, and may undermine any benefits under option 3 as compared to option 2. 77. However, remedying the transitional issues by way of Orders in Council or delegated regulations would increase the risk of taxpayers having to interpret the law by reference to three types of legislation, and determining how the three relate. This risks causing increased compliance cost for taxpayers. 78. Further, while taxpayers would have certainty in a short time for transitional issues, it would not be the same quality of certainty as under either option 1 or option 2. Both delegated regulations and Orders in Council are subject to disallowance by Parliament and judicial review. Delegated regulations would be likely to face greater scrutiny from Parliament. This means that there would be a reasonable risk that taxpayers’ expectations would be undermined. Administrative efficiency 19. Option 3 would significantly reduce administrative costs for the Government compared with the status quo. The reduced costs would come from the reduction in resources needed to be committed to the process for remedying the issues. This would be especially the case for minor issues when they are remedied by delegated regulations. The reduction in delays would mean that Inland Revenue could more quickly deal with issues which should reduce the resources needed to assist taxpayers during the periods of uncertainty. 80. The intention would be to amend the primary legislation via an amendment Act for any issues that are ongoing. This would mean that for some transitional issues both the regulation-making process and the parliamentary process would need to be completed. This duplication of effort would give rise to administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 81. Option 3 would incur Executive and parliamentary costs in enacting the empowering provision. However, option 3 would require less parliamentary resources on an ongoing basis because some issues would be able to be remedied by Order in Council or delegated regulations. Executive resources would still be needed to deal with the Orders in Council but this would be less than under option 2. Inland Revenue resources would be needed to deal with the making of any delegated regulations. Sustainability 82. Inland Revenue considers the use of both Orders in Council and delegated regulations would reduce the sustainability of the tax system compared to the status quo. 83. Under option 3 the full parliamentary process may not be followed (at least initially). This means there would be a risk of some incoherence. This could arise from a remedial regulation not undergoing the same level of scrutiny as a statutory amendment, and so there is a risk it would lack the appreciation of the broader context. This would especially be the case for delegated regulations which would not undergo the same level of scrutiny as either Orders in Council or amendment Acts. Taxpayers would need to interpret the primary legislation, any Orders in Council and any delegated regulations, and there would be a reasonable risk the 15 16 remedy would be in conflict with the intent of some other provision in the Act. I f the regulation was in conflict with the policy intent it would be ultra vires. 84. The regulation-making process would not provide the same level of certainty as the parliamentary process, as both Orders in Council and delegated regulations are subject to parliamentary disallowance and judicial review. Further, the speed by which regulations are made means there is an increased risk of mistakes. Owing to the reduced scrutiny for delegated regulations the risk would be increased compared to option 2. This means there would be a reasonable risk to the integrity to the tax system of the remedy being overturned, and taxpayers’ expectations being undermined. Taxpayers may question the integrity of the tax legislation if it could not be relied on. 85. Using delegated regulations to deal with transitional issues is unprecedented and could risk undermining the integrity of the tax system. It could be considered to be inconsistent with fundamental constitutional principles to allow the Commissioner to override primary legislation with delegated regulations. Taxpayers may have concerns about whether the use of the approach is justified and may question why it is being used. This may risk creating negative taxpayer perceptions about the integrity of the remedies. It may also be seen as creating an undesirable precedent for future changes to the tax system. 86. There is a risk that the incentive on the Government and the Commissioner would be to use the regulation-making power when it would be more appropriate to remedy the issue by a legislative amendment. However, as noted above, the scope of the regulation-making power is limited, and is subject to disallowance and judicial review, so Inland Revenue considers the relevant risk is low. 87. Delegated regulations would not have the same level of public input as the full parliamentary process (which includes the select committee process) or the process for making Orders in Council. As a result, there would be a reasonable risk that taxpayers may perceive that the remedy is unfair or partial to a group of taxpayers. This would be especially a risk for delegated regulations. This could risk undermining taxpayers’ perception of the integrity of the tax system. CONSULTATION 88. Consultation has been undertaken with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, Crown Law, the Ministry of Justice and the Treasury. The consultation involved meeting with the relevant agencies and providing them with a draft of the Cabinet paper for comment. 89. The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee did not support option 3. It considered that option 3 had not been sufficiently justified, unnecessarily complicated taxpayer's ability to access the law and delegating such powers to an official was unprecedented. The Committee agreed with the proposal to remove the ability for the Commissioner to make delegated transitional legislation. 90. Crown Law did not provide any comments on the proposals. It noted that as the primary legislative provision and regulations had not yet been drafted they were not able to provide a more detailed view on any legal risk arising at this stage. Options Analysis against the objective and criteria Option 1: status quo Does not meet the m ain objective Option 2: Orders in Council and exemptions Meets the main objective Compliance efficiency:  Administrative efficiency:   Sustainability:  Overall comment: Meets the main objective and best meets the criteria 17 91. The Ministry of Justice was of the view that officials would need to ensure that the proposed empowering provision was sufficiently defined. It accepted that Inland Revenue did not wish to take an overly narrow approach, but noted equally it was important that the discretion was not unfettered. The Ministry stated it should be drafted in the “most limited terms possible” while accepting the broad scope of the transformation process. The Ministry would prefer to see more clarity in relation to the scope of the power and the constraints placed on it. Specifically, the Ministry commented that the term “tax administration” should be defined. In response to this comment, the initial scope of the proposal was further clarified to emphasise that it would only apply to the tax administration rules and processes under the Tax Administration Act 1994, and not the calculation of a taxpayer’s tax liability under the Income Tax Act 2007. Further, the initial scope was clarified to emphasise that any regulations made would have to be consistent with the existing policy intent (so it would not provide a general policy-making ability). The Ministry was pleased to see that the proposal included safeguards such as subjecting the regulations and exemptions to disallowance and judicial review, time limits and consultation. 92. No wider consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. The time constraints resulted from the need to have the proposal enacted as soon as possible given the benefits of the transitional regulation-making provision and the timing phase of the second business transformation process. Any delay in enacting the empowering provision could delay the business transformation process (or increase the cost), create uncertainties for taxpayers, and risk taxpayers and Inland Revenue having to commit resources to dealing with issues that are inconsistent with the current policy intent. The lack of wider consultation raises a risk that potential problems with the proposals have not been fully identified. However, consultation during the select committee process will mitigate this risk to some extent. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 93. The table below summarises our analysis of the options. Within this table the following symbols are used:   Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  No better than the status quo   Worse than the status quo Option 3: Hybrid approach Meets the m ain objective Compliance efficiency:   Administrative efficiency:   Sustainability:  Overall comment: Meets the main objective but there are risks to the coherence and integrity o f the tax system. 18 94. Inland Revenue prefers option 2 for the following reasons: • It meets the main objective of supporting an orderly transition from the old system (FIRST) to the new system (START). • It applies an approach that is recognised constitutionally as appropriate and it meets the requirements of the LAC Guidelines, as opposed to option 3. • It minimises taxpayer compliance costs by reducing the period of uncertainty, while reducing the risk any remedy will be overturned (in comparison to option 3). • It reduces administrative costs for Inland Revenue compared with the status quo. IMPLEMENTATION 95. Legislative changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required to implement option 2. Specifically, an empowering provision would need to be enacted that included the criteria set out above. 96. The amendment could be included in a Supplementary Order Paper at the select committee stage of the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This would allow consultation on the proposal as part of the normal select committee process. The amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendment and its effect could be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. 97. No systems changes would be required to implement option 2. Inland Revenue would be responsible for preparing advice on any Orders in Council but it would be the Executive Council that would make the regulations after consideration by Cabinet. It would require the use of the Commissioner’s resources to consider applications for transitional regulations or exemptions. The administrative costs for Inland Revenue, compliance costs for taxpayers and fiscal costs for the Crown would need to be considered for any proposed regulations. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 98. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of any regulations made under the empowering provision within that period to see whether they were consistent with the intended policy. 99. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 100. T he Regulations Review Committee would have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations made. The committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency with good legislative practice. The committee reports to the House and other committees on any issues it identifies. The House can “disallow” a regulation, meaning it no longer has force. 19
April 2016 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue “Cash out” of research and development tax losses This special report provides early information on changes to the tax rules that will allow start- up companies engaging in intensive research and development activities to “cash out” their tax losses for research and development expenditure. The changes were introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill enacted on 24 February 2016. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in the April edit io n of the Tax Information Bulletin. Sections DF 1, DV 26, LA 7, LB 4B, MA 1, MF 6, MX 1 to MX 7, OB 47B, Table O2, sections RM 10, YA 1 and schedule 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 70C, 81 and 97C of the Tax Administration Act 1994; Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992 Changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994 and Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992 to allow tax loss-making research and development start-up companies to “cash out” their tax losses arising from research and development expenditure. Key features Research and development start-up companies will be able to receive a payment for up to 28 percent (the current company tax rate) of their tax losses from research and development expenditure in any given year. To be eligible, the company must be a loss-making company resident in New Zealand, with a sufficient proportion of labour expenditure on research and development. The amount of losses that can be cashed out will be capped at $500,000 for the 2015–16 year, increasing by $300,000 over the next five years, to $2 million. The amount that can be cashed out for any year is the smallest of that cap, the company’s net loss for the year, the company’s total research and development expenditure for the year, and 1.5 times the company’s labour costs for research and development for the year. Because the cash-out is administered through the tax system, it is delivered in the form of a tax credit. Research and development expenditure eligible for the measure is more restricted than the research and development expenditure that is deductible under sections DB 34 and DB 35 of 1 the Act. Expenditure on certain activities and some types of expenditure are excluded from the measure. A cashed-out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future income; it is intended to provide a cashflow timing benefit only. In economic terms, repayment of cashed out losses will occur when a taxpayer pays tax on net income that would otherwise have been sheltered by the cashed out losses. An earlier repayment will also be triggered in certain circumstances. Triggers for the early repayment of amounts cashed out include the sale of research and development assets, liquidation or migration of the company, and the sale of the company. The early repayment will be effected via a new R&D repayment tax. Where a cashed out loss is required to be repaid early, a new deduction will reinstate the loss, which will be available to offset future income. Background The Government’s Business Growth Agenda emphasises the importance of innovation to help grow New Zealand’s economy. Innovation creates new sources of economic growth by delivering new products and generating improvements in the quality and cost of existing products. Encouraging business innovation is one of the seven key initiatives of the Government’s Building Innovation workstream, which recognises that research and development is a key element in the innovation process. The new rules focus on start-up companies engaging in intensive research and development, and are intended to reduce their exposure to market failures and tax distortions arising from the current tax treatment of losses. High up-front costs associated with undertaking research and development mean that relative to other investment projects, the profit cycle for research and development projects tends to be much more heavily skewed towards early losses. This can pose a particularly significant barrier to undertaking research and development for innovative start-up companies. Larger firms generally have the ability to use those losses earlier, setting them off against existing streams of income. The general tax rules delay the ability of loss-making businesses to use their deductions, as they are required to carry the losses forward. This provides an important integrity measure in the tax system to mitigate the creation of artificial losses. However, these current tax settings create a cashflow problem for certain companies in an on-going tax loss position. This cashflow bias is particularly significant for companies undertaking research and development, and this can increase the cost of investing in research and development rather than in other assets. Problems can be compounded for start-up companies undertaking research and development who are already likely to suffer from broader capital constraints. The general tax rules can also penalise businesses that engage in research and development that ultimately turns out to be unsuccessful. This is because losses, in this case from unsuccessful research and development, can only be used going forward if there is a subsequent profitable business. The general rules therefore make the use of previous tax 2 losses contingent upon successful innovation or future income earning by the same group of investors. The risk of incurring this potential additional sunk cost is likely to discourage investment in marginal research and development projects further. The timing that those companies can access their tax losses is being brought forward, provided they meet certain criteria. This will help to reduce the bias against investment in these firms from current tax settings. Consultation on the high level policy changes took place in July 2013, with the release of the officials’ issues paper, R&D tax losses. The new legislation received Royal assent on 24 February 2016. Application date The new rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015. Detailed analysis Research and development expenditure Section YA 1 and new schedule 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The new measure applies in respect of “R&D expenditure”, as defined in section YA 1. “R&D expenditure” is basically expenditure incurred on research and development. The terms “research” and “development” have the same meanings as they do for accounting purposes. These are also the same definitions that govern deductibility of research and development expenditure under sections DB 34 and DB 35. Using the existing definition is simpler for taxpayers already familiar with it for accounting purposes. However, to ensure that the measure stays targeted, the definition of “R&D expenditure” is subject to certain limits. Expenditure on an activity listed in a new schedule 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is excluded from the definition of “R&D expenditure” (and thus the measure). Activities are generally listed in the schedule because they take place in a post-development phase, are related to routine work or there is an indeterminate relationship between the activity and economic growth. Also, many of the excluded activities are expected to take place when the company is less likely to be capital and cashflow-constrained. The following activities are listed in schedule 22: • an activity performed outside of New Zealand; • acquiring or disposing of land and related activities, except if the land is used exclusively for housing research or development facilities; • acquiring, disposing of or transferring intangible property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how, and related activities (for example, drafting sale and purchase agreements for patents); 3 • prospecting for, exploring for or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal energy; • research in social sciences, arts or humanities; • market research, market testing, market development or sales promotion, including consumer surveys; • quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes or services; • making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes or services; • routine collection of information; • commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities; • activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards; • management studies or efficiency surveys; • reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; and • pre-production activities, such as a demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up, and trial runs. Similarly, some items of expenditure are specifically excluded fro m the definit io n o f R&D expenditure on the basis that their inclusion could create an economic distortion, inequity between taxpayers in a similar position, or risk compromising the integrity of the initiative. Items excluded on this basis are: • expenditure on goods and services used to provide a service of research or development to someone who is in the business of providing research and development services, or used to further another person’s research or development activities; • expenditure for which no deduction is available for the income year; • expenditure for or under a financial arrangement; and • expenditure for the acquisition or transfer of intangible property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how. An important component of the definition of “R&D expenditure” is that any intellectual property and know-how that results from the research or development is vested in the company, so lely or jointly. These requirements are intended to ensure that the value of the amounts cashed out goes to the company that is incurring the risk of investing in the research and development. More detailed guidelines to help applicants interpret the definition will be made available. 4 Eligibility Sections MX 1, MX 2, MX 3 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The eligibility requirements are set out in new sections MX 1, MX 2, MX 3 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and target the measure to start-up firms engaging in intensive research and development. The measure is not expected to apply to highly structured or complex firms which have an R&D aspect. The eligibility requirements must be met for each income year that the taxpayer applies to cash out a loss. Optional The decision to cash out a tax loss is optional for each income year. That is, a company may choose to cash out a loss in one year, and may choose not to for a subsequent year. The rules governing the repayment of cashed-out amounts are not optional. Corporate eligibility The applicant must be a company that is resident in New Zealand for the whole year and not treated, under a double tax agreement, as a resident of a foreign country or territory. A company incorporated part-way through the year will be eligible as long as it meets all the requirements for the part of the year that it is in existence. Example: Residence of shareholders Moby is a touring surfer who has an idea to use a new type of lightweight material to construct surfboards. Moby’s Hawaiian-resident friend Peleg agrees to fund investigating the idea. Modern Boards Limited (MBL) is incorporated in New Zealand (Peleg owns 85 percent of the shares and Moby the remaining 15 percent) and starts work on the idea. MBL has tax losses from that work. The residence of the shareholders does not affect the eligibility of the company to cash out losses, and therefore MBL ma y be eligible to cash out research and development tax losses. The initiative is not intended to apply to companies owned by the Crown. A company that is established by or subject to the Education Act 1989, the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000 or the Crown Entities Act 2004, is not eligible. Companies that are partially owned by the Crown may be eligible if less than 50 percent of the shares are together held by public authorities, local authorities, Crown research institutes or State enterprises. Example: Ineligible from government-sector ownership A Crown research institute and a State enterprise each have a 25 percent share of a joint venture company set up to do research and development on tidal impacts on new cable materials. The other 50 percent is owned by a private investor. The joint venture company is not able to cash out its losses because it is 50 percent owned by the Crown. 5 Example: Ineligible as a Crown entity As a result of the rebuilding work carried out in Christchurch, researchers in University A and University B have invented a new process for quickly testing the setting rate of newly poured concrete. Magnitron Ltd is set up to develop the invention and the two universities together, through two different subsidiaries, own 51 percent of Magnitron Ltd. The remaining 49 percent share is owned by the two university-employed researchers who invented the idea and other private investors. Magnitron Ltd is not eligible to cash out its tax losses because it is subject to the Crown Entities Act 2004. The company must not be a listed company or otherwise listed on a recognised exchange. Losses from R&D that is owned by the company The company must have a net loss for the relevant tax year. Also, the company must have incurred “R&D expenditure” in the relevant income year. A tax loss arising from a deduction for research and development expenditure that is allocated to a future income year under section DB 34(7) of the Income Tax Act cannot be cashed out either in the year the expenditure was incurred or in the year the deduction is allocated to. This is because the definition of “R&D expenditure” does not include research and development expenditure for which no deduction is available for the income year. Example: Expenditure allocated to later income years not eligible for the tax credit Mattlab Ltd is a biotechnology firm designing a new medicine to repair liver damage. In the 2016–17 income year the company makes a loss of $1.1m carrying out a pre-clinical trial on mice. Although the whole of the loss relates to research and development expenditure, Mattlab Ltd can only cash out losses of $800,000 (the maximum allowed under the cap for the 2016–17 year). Developing the medicine further requires new venture capital. New equity investors are found in the 2017–18 year and the remaining losses from the 2016–17 income year are allocated to the 2018–19 year. All of the losses generated by Mattlab Ltd in the 2017–18 year are cashed out. In the 2018–19 year Mattlab Ltd incurs $0.9m of research and development expenditure, which generates a tax loss of the same amount. The reallocation of deductions from the 2016–17 year mean that Mattlab Ltd has losses of $1.2m, however it can only cash out losses of $0.9m, and must carry forward the remaining losses of $0.3m. Group companies If a company is part of a group for tax purposes, then that group must also meet some of the eligibility requirements in aggregate. The group must have a net loss for the corresponding tax year and meet the wage intensity criteria. These features are important for the integrity of the initiative. The “R&D group” is defined and can include a company, look-through company or limited partnership. 6 Wage intensity criteria To target the initiative to innovative start-ups, proportional labour expenditure on research and development is used as a proxy to gauge the intensity of research and development. Evidence indicates that loss-making research and development-intensive businesses, particularly smaller and younger businesses, tend to spend a greater proportion of their wage and salary costs on research and development than other businesses. The wage intensity criteria are set out in section MX 3 of the Income Tax Act and to be eligible, the company must have a wage intensity calculation of 0.2 or more. Similarly, if the company is part of a group, the amount calculated for the “R&D group” in aggregate should be 0.2 or more. The intensity calculation is: total research and development labour expenditure ÷ total labour expenditure There are two options for calculating wage intensity under the new rules. Option 1 is the simpler of the two. Option 2 is more accurate for employers who remunerate their staff with fringe benefits and superannuation contributions in addition to other types of compensation for labour. Under Option 1, total research and development labour expenditure is defined as the total of amounts incurred in the income year on: • the taxpayer’s “contractor R&D consideration” multiplied by 0.66. The “contractor R&D consideration” is the amount paid to an external provider (excluding GST) for research and development work. This is to reflect the fact that taxpayers may outsource a part of their research and development work to an external provider. For taxpayers who are part of a research and development group, the contractor must not be part of that group; • salary or wages paid to employees for carrying out research and development; and • amounts paid to shareholder-emplo yees for carrying out research and development that are not subject to PAYE. Total research and development labour expenditure does not include expenditure on labour or contractors engaged in research and development activities that are listed in schedule 22. Similarly, the expenditure cannot be for goods and services used by the taxpayer to provide a service of research and development to another person, or to further another person’s research or development activit ies. In addition, the intellectual property and know-how result ing fro m the research and development must vest in the taxpayer, solely or jointly. Total labour expenditure is the total of amounts incurred in the income year on: • the “contractor R&D consideration” multiplied by 0.66 (as in the numerator); • salary or wages paid to employees; and • amounts paid to shareholder-employees that are not subject to PAYE. 7 Under Option 2, the calculation is the same as for Option 1, except: • the following amounts must be added to total labour expenditure: - the employer’s superannuation contributions for the employee that are not salary or wages; - tax on the employer’s superannuation cash contributions for the emplo yee; - fringe benefits attributed to the employee; and - the employer’s FBT liability in relation to the employee and the fringe benefits attributed to the employee. • A proportion of the above amounts must also be added to total research and development labour expenditure. The proportion is the same, for each employee, as the proportion of the employee’s total salary or wages that is paid for carrying out research and development, and included in the “total research and development labour expenditure” component of the formula. Example: Wage intensity Mattlab Ltd decides from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year to change its remuneration package for its full-time researchers to encourage them to stay in the company’s employment. Its two research scientists, doing research and development full-time, are each paid $100,000/year and will receive superannuation contributions of 5 percent of their income for each year of service with the company (up to a maximum of 15 percent). Both have been with the company for two years. Thirteen other staff are paid $1,040,000 in total, and the CEO who spends one day a week doing research and development, is paid $120,000. Mattlab Ltd has outsourced some research and development work for that year for a price of $75,000 (excluding GST). The wage intensity calculations for the 2017–18 year are: Option 1 Total research and development labour expenditure is $273,500 \[($75,000 \* 0.66) + $200,000 + ($120,000 \* 0.2)\] Total labour expenditure is $1,409,500 \[($75,000 \* 0.66) + ($200,000 + 1,040,000) + $120,000\] The wage intensity calculation is $273,500 ÷ $1,409,500 = 0.194 Option 2 Total research and development labour expenditure is $300,100 \[($75,000 \* 0.66) + ($200,000) + $20,000 + $6,600 + ($120,000 \* 0.2)\] Total labour expenditure is $1,436,100 \[($75,000 \* 0.66) + $200,000 + $20,000 + $6,600 + $1,040,000 + $120,000)\] The wage intensity calculation is $300,100 ÷ $1,436,100 = 0.209 The superannuation package adds $20,000 of superannuation contributions and $6,600 of tax on superannuation contributions to both the numerator and denominator of the calculation. Mattlab Ltd meets the wage intensity criteria using Option 2, but not if it uses Option 1. 8 Amount of the cash-out Sections MX 4 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Because the cash-out is administered through the tax system, it is delivered in the form of a refundable tax credit. This tax credit is referred to as the “R&D loss tax credit” Similarly to other tax credits, only the net loss for the relevant year can be cashed out. That means that it will not be possible to cash out a tax loss in a year subsequent to when the loss arose (that is, carried forward tax losses cannot be cashed out). Any net losses for a year which cannot be cashed out will be carried forward under the usual rules. New section MX 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the amount of the R&D loss tax credit for a year. It is the smallest of: • $500,000 (for the 2015–16 tax year, and increasing by $300,000 for each of the following five years) multiplied by the corporate tax rate; • the company’s net loss for the year multiplied by the corporate tax rate; • the company’s total R&D expenditure for the tax year multiplied by the corporate tax rate; and • the company’s total research and development labour expenditure for the year (as calculated under section MX 3), multiplied by 1.5 and also multiplied by the corporate tax rate. The $500,000 cap on eligible losses will be increased to $2 million over five years. The gradual increase of the cap is an integrity measure and should also help industry sectors to plan for the future supply of researchers. Example: Amount of the tax credit Amblack Ltd is a company carrying out research and development on a new variety of avocado that also tastes of lemon. They have two senior plant researchers and a technician working full-time on the project. In the 2016–17 tax year Amblack Ltd had a net loss of $600,000, spent $425,000 on research and development, and the researchers and technician were paid $245,000 in salary and wages for research and development. The amounts under the four tests are: $800,000 (cap) > $600,000 > $425,000 > $245,000 \* 1.5 ($367,500), each multiplied by the company tax rate of 0.28% for that year. Amblack Ltd is eligible to receive a R&D loss tax credit of $102,900 for that year ($367,500 \* 0.28). Treatment of tax losses Sections MX 5, MX 6 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 New section MX 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will extinguish tax losses that are cashed out. New section MX 6 creates a new deduction if the company tax rate increases after a tax loss has been cashed out. This is to ensure that a company is not disadvantaged by electing to cash out a tax loss instead of carrying it forward if the corporate tax rate is subsequently 9 increased (as an increase in the corporate tax rate will increase the amount of tax saved by any tax losses). The amount of the new deduction is essentially the difference between: • the amount of the cashed out tax losses that would still have been available when the tax rate increased; and • the amount of tax losses that would need to be cashed out at the new rate to produce the same tax credit as the above tax losses produced when cashed out at the old rate. The amount of the deduction is calculated for each year in which an R&D loss tax credit was received using the formula: tax credits \* (new rate – old rate) ÷ (new rate \* old rate) The items in the formula are defined as follows: “tax credits” is the total amount of the company’s R&D loss tax credits for years before the rate increases minus the total amount of: • the company’s terminal tax, plus tax credits giving rise to imputation credits, minus refundable tax credits giving rise to imputation debits, for the period beginning with the first year a R&D loss tax credit was claimed and ending with the tax year before the current year; and • payments of R&D repayment tax relating to the R&D loss tax credits before the current year (R&D repayment tax is discussed in the next section). “new rate” is the basic tax rate for a company after the rate increase: “old rate” is the greatest of: • the basic tax rate for a company before the rate increase; • the basic tax rate for a company for the latest year, before the current year, for which the person received a previous deduction under section MX 6; and • the basic tax rate for a company for the year in which the latest R&D loss tax credit arose (before the current year). Example: Increase in the company tax rate Hemantware Ltd researches new materials for sport shoes. The company cashes out $800,000 of tax losses in the 2016–17 income year when the company tax rate is 0.28, to receive tax credits of $224,000. The company tax rate changes to 0.30 for the 2017–18 tax year. Hemantware Ltd has a resulting deduction of $53,333 \[$224,000 \* (0.3 – 0.28) ÷ (0.30 \* 0.28)\] for that year. There is no complementary provision to create income (or remove deductions) if the company tax rate is reduced. 10 Repayment of cashed out losses Sections DV 26, MX 7 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 70C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A cashed out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future taxable income; it is intended to provide a temporary cashflow timing benefit when the company is in a tax loss posit ion. Repayment of cashed out losses will occur when a taxpayer pays tax on taxable income that would have been sheltered by the cashed out losses if they had been carried forward. However if the company or the shareholders make an untaxed return on their investment before they have repaid the value of the cashed-out loss, this would lead to an outcome that is concessionary for the taxpayer unless it triggered the repayment of some cashed-out losses. This is because, in addition to the untaxed receipt, the taxpayer would also retain the benefit of the remaining cashed-out losses that have not yet been repaid. This also creates a fiscal risk. If the company sells intellectual property, migrates or if the company is sold, it is highly likely the company will no longer be constrained to the same degree by the market conditions and cashflow constraints affecting small research and development intensive start-up companies. In this situation, the original po licy rationale will no longer apply, as the company will have funds available to pay back the value of the cashed-out loss. Section MX 7 sets out the rules required to recover the value of any remaining cashed-out loss to ensure the correct policy outcome. The remaining amount of any cashed-out tax losses must be repaid when one or more of the following four repayment events occur during the year: • The company makes a return on its investment by disposing of or transferring research and development assets (that is, intellectual property, intangible property, core technology and know-how). The exceptions are if the disposal is part of an amalgamation or if the disposal is for at least market value consideration that is assessable income to the company. • The company ceases to be a company resident in New Zealand for tax purposes or becomes resident in a foreign country under a double tax agreement. This is most likely to apply if the company migrates. • The company has a liquidator appointed. • Or more than 90 percent of the company is so ld or transferred after the tax loss was cashed out. A cashed-out tax loss is repaid by payment of the new R&D repayment tax. The R&D repayment tax is due by the terminal tax date for the tax year in which the repayment event occurs. The amount of R&D repayment tax payable depends on the type of repayment event which occurs. 11 Transfer of intellectual property (and when migration or liquidation-induced repayment obligations do not apply) In the case of the sale of research and development assets, the repayment amount (R&D repayment tax) will be capped, for that event, at the market value of the consideration for the disposal or transfer, multiplied by the tax rate. That is, the R&D repayment tax is the lesser of any unrepaid R&D loss tax credits and the market value of the transferred assets (intangibles’ market value), multiplied by the tax rate. The unrepaid R&D loss tax credits are the total amount of R&D loss tax credits paid to the company over time: • minus the company’s terminal tax; • minus tax credits giving rise to imputation credits (for example, provisio nal tax); • plus refundable tax credits giving rise to imputation debits; and • minus earlier payments of R&D repayment tax, where those amounts are for tax years from the first time losses were cashed out until the repayment year. “Intangible market value” is the market value of the research and development assets that are disposed of in the year, excluding assets sold for at least market value consideration that is assessable income for the taxpayer. Example: Disposal or transfer of intangible property Taylortronics Ltd is incorporated in May 2015 to develop new guidance systems for munitions. It cashes out losses of $150,000 and $300,000 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years respectively. It receives tax credits of $42,000 and $84,000. It carries forward other losses of $50,000. In the 2017–18 year the company enters a manufacturing phase selling trading stock to earn net income of $150,000. It has taxable income of $100,000 and pays income tax of $28,000. In the 2018–19 income year it sells know-how for $250,000 (which is a capital receipt) and also has taxable income of $80,000. The sale triggers a repayment event, as the receipt from the sale of the know-how was not assessable income for Taylortronics. Therefore Taylortronics has to pay R&D repayment tax as well as income tax of $22,400. The R&D repayment tax is the lesser of: 1. the market value of the research and development assets sold that year multiplied by the tax rate. This amount is $70,000 \[$250,000 \* 0.28\]; and 2. the unrepaid R&D loss tax credits. This amount is $75,600 \[$42,000 + $84,000 – $28,000 – $22,400\]. Therefore, Taylortronics pays R&D repayment tax of $70,000. In the 2019–20 income year the company has taxable income of $150,000 and pays income tax of $42,000. Unless Taylortronics Ltd cashes out further losses, no further repayments will be required from that time. R&D Repayment tax and income tax payments made since the 2017–18 income year of $162,400 \[$28,000 + $70,000 + $22,400 + $42,000\] exceed the $126,000 \[$42,000 + $84,000\] of tax credits received for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years. 12 Example: Patent disposal or transfer at market value Cameron Waterboards Ltd is incorporated in June 2015 to produce a hoverboard that can cross open bodies of water. It cashes out losses of $200,000 and $400,000 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years respectively for R&D loss tax credits of $56,000 and $112,000. It obtains a patent for the technology in the 2016–17 year but realises that it is not in a position to develop the technology itself. In the 2017–18 year the company sells the patent at its market value of $1,000,000 and returns that amount as assessable income. As the patent sale has given rise to assessable income and was sold at market value, no defined repayment event occurs. Example: Disposal or transfer of intangible property below market price Viditech Ltd is incorporated as a subsidiary of BR Semiconductors Ltd to investigate new methods of layering semiconducting materials. Viditech cashes out losses of $200,000 and $400,000 in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years, for R&D loss tax credits of $56,000 and $112,000 respectively. It obtains a patent for the technology in the 2016–17 year and then, in the 2017–18 year, sells the patent to its parent for $500,000, well below the market value of $1,000,000. It has taxable income of $350,000 in the 2017–18 year and pays income tax of $98,000. The sale triggers a repayment event as the consideration received was below market value. Viditech Ltd is required to pay R&D repayment tax equal to the lesser of: 1. the remaining balance of the tax credit of $70,000 \[$56,000 + $112,000 – $98,000\]; and 2. the patent’s market value multiplied by the company tax rate, which equals $280,000 \[$1,000,000 \* 0.28\]. Therefore Viditech Ltd will pay R&D repayment tax of $70,000. The R&D loss tax credit balance is repaid in full. Example: Multiple sales of intangible property Replicosteo Ltd is incorporated in July 2015 to develop new synthetic materials for hip replacements that are similar to bone. Replicosteo cashes out losses of $500,000 and $800,000 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years for R&D loss tax credits of $140,000 and $224,000 respectively. In the 2017–18 year, Replicosteo sells know-how for $600,000 (which is its market value and a capital receipt) and also has taxable income of $200,000 on which $56,000 of income tax is paid. That year Replicosteo has to pay R&D repayment tax of $168,000 \[$600,000 \* 0.28 < (140,000 + 224,000 – $56,000)\], and has a tax credit balance of $140,000 remaining \[$140,000 + $224,000 – $56,000 – $168,000\]. Replicosteo sells further know-how in the 2018–19 year for $900,000 (which is its market value and a capital receipt) and has taxable income of $300,000 and income tax of $84,000 that year. Replicosteo has R&D repayment tax of the lower of the remaining balance of the tax credit – $56,000 \[$140,000 + $224,000 – $56,000 – $168,000 – $84,000\] and the value of the know-how sold that year multiplied by the company tax rate of $252,000 \[$900,000 \* 0.28\]. Replicosteo therefore pays R&D repayment tax of $56,000, and so the R&D loss tax credit balance is fully repaid. Sale of the company (and when migration or liquidation-induced repayment obligations do not apply) If the co mpany is so ld, the repayment amount (R&D repayment tax) will be capped at the market value of the company shares that have been sold since the first tax loss was cashed out, mult iplied by the tax rate. 13 That is, the R&D repayment tax is the lesser of: • any unrepaid R&D loss tax credits; and • the market value of the shares that have been sold (shares’ market value) multiplied by the tax rate. The unrepaid R&D loss tax credits are the total amount of R&D loss tax credits: • minus the company’s terminal tax; • minus tax credits giving rise to imputation credits (for example, provisio nal tax); • plus refundable tax credits giving rise to imputation debits; and • minus earlier payments of R&D repayment tax, where those amounts are for tax years from the first time losses were cashed out until the repayment year. This amount is the same as the unrepaid R&D loss tax credits for the other repayment events. “Shares’ market value” is defined to be the market value of all the company’s shares disposed of or issued, that combined to cause the repayment event to be triggered, regardless of the year in which the disposals or issues occurred. This is because the repayment event can be triggered even if the disposal or issue events were to occur over a number of income years. The market value of the shares at each disposal or issue should be accumulated to calculate the shares’ market value. 14 Example: Multiple transfers of shares Hine and Akira incorporate a company, HydroPasifika Ltd, in October 2015 to develop large-scale hydroponic farms as alternatives to farming in increasingly saline soils on Pacific islands. As they expand, they dilute their shareholding in exchange for finance before selling the company entirely. The table below shows how this takes place: Shareholding Voting interest at 31/3/16 Voting interest at 31/3/17 Voting interest at 31/3/18 Voting interest at 31/3/19 Hine and Akira 100% 50% 25% 0% Angel investor 0% 50% 0% 0% Development Co 0% 0% 75% 100% The table below shows how the shares were valued and sold (assume each sale takes place on the last day of the income year): 31/3/16 31/3/17 31/3/18 31/3/19 Number of shares 500,000 1,000,000 1,000,000 1,000,000 New shares issued 0 500,000 0 0 Shares sold 0 0 750,000 250,000 Value per share $0.25 $1.00 $2.00 $2.50 Value of issue/sale N/A $500,000 $1,500,000 $625,000 Value of company $125,000 $1,000,000 $2,000,000 $2,500,000 The continuity breach occurs in the 2018–19 income year as Hine and Akira’s shareholding falls from 100% ownership to 0%. R&D repayment tax is required to be paid for the 2018–19 income year because no group of persons have at least 10% of voting rights over the period from first receiving a credit (2015–16 income year) to a later income year (2018–19 income year). HydroPasifika has received $750,000 of R&D loss tax credits over the four-year period, and has not paid any income tax in this period. The R&D repayment tax will be lesser of: 1. the R&D loss tax credit balance of $750,000; and 2. the disposed or issued shares’ market value multiplied by the company tax rate, which equals $735,000 \[($500,000 + $1,500,000 + $625,000) \* 0.28\]. Therefore HydroPasifika will have R&D repayment tax of $735,000. Change of residence or liquidation of company The company will be required to repay any unrepaid cashed-out losses in full if the co mpany ceases to be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes, becomes resident in a foreign country under a double tax agreement, or has a liquidator appointed. In this case, the amount of R&D repayment tax payable is the total amount of R&D loss tax credits: • minus the company’s terminal tax; • minus tax credits giving rise to imputation credits (for example, provisio nal tax); 15 • plus refundable tax credits giving rise to imputation debits ; and • minus earlier payments of R&D repayment tax, where those amounts are for tax years from the first time R&D tax losses were cashed out until the repayment year. This amount is the same as the unrepaid R&D loss tax credits for the other repayment events. Example: Multiple loss reinstatement events Nest Guarder Ltd is incorporated in August 2015 and is attempting to develop robots that protect the nests of native birds from predators. Nest Guarder cashes out losses of $400,000 and $700,000 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years for R&D loss tax credits of $112,000 and $196,000 respectively. It also sells know-how for $100,000 in the 2016–17 income year (which equals the market value and is a capital receipt), and pays R&D repayment tax of $28,000 \[$100,000 \* 0.28\]. In the 2016–17 tax year, the R&D repayment tax payment of $28,000 reduces the tax credit balance from $308,000 to $280,000. In the 2017–18 tax year, Nest Guarder receives a $140,000 tax credit from cashing out a $500,000 loss and the company is sold for $1,000,000 (which equals the market value and is a capital receipt), triggering R&D repayment tax of $280,000 ($1,000,000 \* 0.28 is less than the credit balance of $420,000). The tax credit balance is reduced to $140,000 \[$420,000 - $280,000\]. In the 2018–19 tax year, Nest Guarder migrates offshore, which triggers R&D repayment tax of the remaining tax credit balance of $140,000. The table below shows when Nest Guarder cashes out losses and has loss repayment events where R&D repayment tax must be paid. Year Description Change in value of tax credit balance R&D loss tax credit balance 2015–16 R&D loss tax credit + $112,000 ($400,000 loss) $112,000 2016–17 R&D loss tax credit Know-how sold; R&D repayment tax + $196,000 ($700,000 loss) – $28,000 (28% of $100,000) $308,000 $280,000 2017–18 R&D loss tax credit Company sold; R&D repayment tax + $140,000 ($500,000 loss) – $280,000 ($1,000,000 sale) $420,000 $140,000 2018–19 Company leaves NZ and can no longer satisfy residency requirement; R&D repayment tax – $140,000 (migration) $0 Multiple reinstatement events If more than one repayment trigger event occurs in a given year, the amount to be repaid will depend on what events have occurred. For example, the loss of residence or liquidation of a company will trigger the repayment of all unrepaid amounts, regardless of whether a share or asset sale event has also occurred in the year. If the company is sold in the same year that R&D assets are sold, repayments in relation to both those events need to be paid, up to the total value of unrepaid R&D loss tax credits. 16 Reinstatement of repaid losses Any cashed out tax loss that is repaid wit h R&D repayment tax will be reinstated via a deduction under section DV 26. However, for simplicity, those deductions cannot be allocated to a future income year. Imputation Sections OB 47B, table O2: imputation debits row 20B and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 No credit balance will arise in an imputation credit account of a company that has cashed out a loss unt il that company has repaid all the cashed-out amounts (whether through normal payment of income tax or via R&D repayment tax). This is to maintain neutralit y with taxpayers who are not able to cash out losses. However cashing out a tax loss will not put a taxpayer’s imputation credit account into a debit balance. The rules are set out in section OB 47B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Example: No imputation credits arise until tax credit balance repaid R&D Biotics’ imputation credit account has a zero balance at the beginning of the 2015–16 year. R&D Biotics cashes out losses of $100,000 in the 2015–16 year and $125,000 in 2016–17, receiving tax credits of $28,000 and $35,000 respectively. R&D Biotics pays no tax for these years. R&D Biotics pays income tax of $22,400 in 2017–18 and $35,000 in 2018–19. R&D Biotics will not have a credit balance (or a debit balance) in its imputation credit account for any of income years from 2015–16 to 2018–19 inclusive, This is because the amount cashed out has not been full y repaid by the end of the 2018–19 income year, with a balance of $5,600 remaining. R&D Biotics earns $150,000 in the 2019–20 income year and pays tax of $42,000. It will therefore have a credit balance of $36,400 for income tax paid for the 2019–20 income year (income tax of $42,000 – loss cash-out balance of $5,600). Administration Sections LA 7, LB 4B, MA 1, MF 6 and RM 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 70C, 81(4)(v) and (w), and 97C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Companies will need to apply to cash out their tax losses. Applications will need to be made by the time the company files the corresponding income tax return. While the application will need to be in electronic form, the income tax return does not have to be filed electronically. A company with R&D repayment tax to pay must include the amount in any application to cash out their tax losses they file for the year, or file a separate statement if there is no such application. Like other tax credits, R&D loss tax credits may be used to satisfy an existing tax liability of the company. Exceptions have been added to the secrecy rules to allow Callaghan Innovation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to support Inland Revenue in the administration of the R&D loss tax credits. This will permit information-sharing between 17 Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation to help Callaghan Innovation assist Inland Revenue in making decisions on the R&D eligibility for difficult applications. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment will also provide ICT and policy support to Inland Revenue. Consequential amendments Section DF 1(1BA) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992 Consequential amendments have been made in section DF 1(1BA) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and to the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. This is to ensure that: • the bar on deductions in relation to Government grants does not apply for cashed out losses; and • the cashed out loss is not subject to GST. 18
July 2016 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes Sections CE 2, RD 6, RD 7, RD 7B, of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 46(6B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; sections 11 and 15 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 This special report provides early information on changes to the tax rules affecting the collection of tax on benefits an employee receives from an employee share scheme. Benefits provided to an employee under a share purchase agreement are “employment income” for income tax purposes. The Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended by integrating employment income in the form of employee share benefits into the PAYE (pay as you earn) system. The changes were introduced in the Taxation (Transformat ion: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill enacted on 2 June 2016. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in the August edit ion of the Tax Information Bulletin. Employers are now responsible for reporting share benefits under an employee share scheme. Employers have a choice about whether tax is withheld on such benefits. The changes are designed to remove problems facing so me emplo yees wit h meeting their tax obligations in relat ion to these benefits, and improve the integrit y of the tax system by reporting income information at its source. Key features The general PAYE collection rules in the Income Tax Act and disclosure rules in the Tax Administration Act have been changed to: • allow emplo yers to choose to use the PAYE system and withhold tax on any employment income an employee receives under a share purchase agreement using the PAYE system; and • require employers to report the value of any benefits an employee receives under a share purchase agreement via the employer monthly schedule (EMS). 1 Consequential changes have also been made to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure that share benefits are not counted as employment income under these Acts. Background Benefits an employee receives under a share purchase agreement are treated as employment income under the Income Tax Act 2007. Under the old rules, unlike most employment income or benefits (such as salary and wages or the use of a company car), such share benefits were not subject to tax at source under either the PAYE or FBT rules. This meant employee recipients of a benefit under a share purchase agreement had to file an individual tax return including the benefit as income and pay the tax on those benefits themselves. For employees unused to filing returns and paying tax directly to Inland Revenue, these obligations were not always well understood and imposed compliance costs. These compliance costs could affect voluntary compliance and perceptions about the integrity of the tax system. From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the rules imposed a number of administrative costs. If an individual employee did not return the income from an employee share scheme, the Commissioner had to expend resources to collect a potentially small amount of tax from an individual. In April 2015, officials released an issues paper, Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes, which discussed the problems with the collection of tax on benefits received under an employee share scheme. The issues paper discussed changing the collection of tax on employment income received under a share purchase agreement using the PAYE system, the FBT rules or a separate withholding tax. Inland Revenue considered a number of ways informat ion about emplo yee share benefits could be collected under the PAYE system and concluded that the employer monthly schedule (EMS) was the best option as the necessary information is captured in a timely and administratively efficient manner. Application date The new rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2017. Validat ion rules apply if employers have withheld and paid tax in a return of income in earlier income years. Benefits treated as income under section CE 2 and received on or before 31 March 2017 should be returned by the emplo yee. 2 Detailed analysis The basic rule: what employee share benefits are covered by the new rules? Under the Income Tax Act, emplo yment income from an employee share scheme arises in the specific circumstances set out in section CE 2. Table 1 illustrates the responsibilities under the tax Acts for employers and employers to report and pay tax on inco me fro m an emplo yee share scheme from 1 April 2017. Table 1: When income arises from an employee share scheme and compliance obligations on the employer and employee When income arises Pre 1 April 2017 Post 1 April 2017 When the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(2) Employee must report income and pay tax. (i) Employer reports income for current employees. (ii) Employer may choose to withhold tax. (iii) Employee must pay tax if (ii) does not apply. (iv) Former employees must report and pay tax unless (ii) applies. When employee disposes of rights to acquire shares to non- associates – section CE 2(3) Employee must report income and pay tax. Employee must report income and pay tax. When an associate of the employee acquires shares – section CE 2(4) Employee must report income and pay tax. (i) Employer reports income for current employees. (ii) Employer may choose to withhold tax. (iii) Employee must pay tax if (ii) does not apply. (iv) Former employees must report and pay tax unless (ii) applies. When an associate disposes of rights to acquire shares to non- associates – section CE 2(5) Employee must report income and pay tax. Employee must report income and pay tax. The section CE 7 definition of “share purchase agreement”, which applies to income in the form of share benefits under section CE 2, means the employer is responsible for reporting the value of the benefit received under a scheme offered by an associate of the employer if the benefit is in connection with the employee’s employment or service. The obligation to report the value of a share benefit and the election to withhold PAYE is therefore limited to situations where income arises under section CE 2(2) and CE 2(4) – situations when there is a transfer of shares to the employee or an associate of the employee. 3 Exceptions to the basic rule The new reporting and payment rules have two important exclusions from the basic rule. • Former employees: When an employer’s PAYE obligations for an employee have ended, as set out in the definition of “employee” in section 46(7) of the Tax Administration Act, any benefits accruing to the employee do not need to be reported by the employer. Consider the examples below: (i) Employee ceases employment from 1 October 2017. A cash bonus is paid to the former employee in March 2018. The employee has their incentive shares vested in November 2017. In this situation, the employer has an obligation to report the value of benefits received by the former employee. (ii) Employee ceases employment from 1 October 2017. A cash bonus is paid to the former employee in March 2018. The employee has their incentive shares vested in April 2018. In this situation, the employer has no obligation to report the value of benefits received by the former employee. The employer can still choose to report and withhold tax on any benefit, however. • Commissioner-approved schemes: Benefits received from an employee share scheme to which sections DC 12 and DC 13 of the Income Tax Act apply, known as “Commissio ner-approved schemes”, are not required to be reported. Under section CE 2(7) of the Income Tax Act, these benefits are treated as having a nil value. Disclosing share benefits in the employer monthly schedule Section CE 2 specifies the income year in which an employee derives a share benefit from an emplo yee share scheme. For most employers, they will be responsible for reporting the value of the share benefit in the relevant employer monthly schedule (EMS) for which the share benefit accrues to the employee. For example, a share benefit that accrues to an emplo yee in August 2017 would be included in the employer’s EMS for the period ending 31 August, and due on 20 September 2017. Special income recognition rule for “large” employers For employers that have annual withholding obligations under the PAYE system of $500,000 or more (including employer superannuation contribution tax – ESCT), the disclo sure of income from a share benefit has been modified. Under section RD 22(2), employers with this level of withholding are considered to be “large” employers, and new section CE 2(11) shifts the recognition of employment income to the next PAYE payment period. This rule applies whether or not the employer has withheld tax on the share benefit. Under this new rule, income from the share benefit is shifted to the next PAYE payment period. The implications for emplo yers of this new rule are as follows: • Recognition of share benefits that vest to the employee in the first half of the month is shifted to the second half of the same month and reported by the emplo yer in the employer monthly schedule for that month. 4 • Recognition of share benefits that vest to the employee in the second half of the month is shifted to the first half of the following month and would be reported in the employer monthly schedule for that following month. This rule does not affect the date that the share benefit should be valued. It does, however, affect when share benefits are reported to Inland Revenue. In some cases, such as when a benefit arises between the 16 th and the last day of March, the rule shifts employee income into the next tax year. Inland Revenue may investigate instances where employees seek to exploit for personal advantage the deferred recognition of income for share benefits provided between 16 and 31 March if those share benefits are provided out of pattern with previous years or the decision to acquire shares is out of step with market conditions. Affected emplo yers should raise the effect of this new timing rule wit h their employees as it may affect their tax obligations for the income year and any associated social policy obligations and entitlements. Withholding tax on employee share benefits under the PAYE system If the employer elects to withhold under new section RD 7B, share benefits received from a share purchase agreement are treated as an “extra pay” for the purposes of section RD 7 of the PAYE rules. Such benefits are treated as a “PAYE income payment” under section RD 3. This ensures that the obligation to pay tax is transferred from the employee to the employer under the PAYE rules. The applicable rate of tax on the benefit will be determined by: • section RD 10, if the employee has made an election with their employer to fix the rate of tax on extra pays; or • section RD 17. For the purposes of section 33A of the Tax Administration Act, the employee is treated as a non-filing taxpayer when the employer returns and pays tax for the emplo yee. Selling shares to meet PAYE withholding Employers who sell shares to meet an employee’s tax liability will be acting on the employee’s behalf. The tax treatment of the sale of shares to meet employees’ tax obligations under the PAYE rules should not create a different outcome from the situation if the emplo yee were to sell the shares themselves to meet a tax obligation. If the shares vested in the employee were held on capital account then, in principle, any share disposal to meet tax obligations (independent of whether tax is withheld under PAYE) should not result in those shares being “tainted” and treated as held on revenue account. Compliance obligations on employees The overarching purpose of the changes is to reduce the need for employees to complete an IR3 return or request a personal tax summary (PTS). For employees whose employers have elected to withhold PAYE, there should be no further tax to pay on that share benefit income. Emplo yees may still have filing obligations if they have other inco me. 5 Emplo yees whose employer has reported only the value of any share benefit will have tax owing and should arrange payment. Employees who receive employment income from a share benefit by way of selling share rights to another party, or an associate disposes of the share rights, will continue to have obligations to report that income to Inland Revenue. Former employees will need to be aware that their tax obligations may be affected by their employer’s disclosure obligations and whether tax has been withheld on any share benefit that vests in the former employee. Examples Table 2 sets out the compliance implications for large and “small” employers in connection with the new rules for current employees. 6 Table 2: Examples Facts When employer reports benefit/pays tax When treated as derived by employee Tax outcome Large employer • Share benefit vests in employee on 25 March 2018. • Employer elects to withhold tax under section RD 7B of the Income Tax Act. • Employer records the benefit in the EMS for April, which is returned on 5 May. • Tax on the benefit is paid in the PAYE payment period due 20 April. • Employee treats the income as derived in April 2018, the next tax year after the year in which the benefit is vested. • Share benefit is treated as an extra pay under section RD 7. • Tax is withheld, assuming for the purposes of section RD 6, that the benefit was paid on 1 April on the basis of the value of the share benefit as at 25 March. • Employee has no obligation to separately report the income or pay tax as these have been done by the employer.

May 2016 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue GST on cross-border supplies of remote services This special report provides early information on changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, recently enacted in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016. The changes apply goods and services tax (GST) to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles supplied by non-resident suppliers (including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from offshore websites) to New Zealand-resident consumers. The new rules will require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on these supplies if they exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. The new rules apply from 1 October 2016 and non-resident suppliers will be able to apply to be registered from 1 August 2016, with the registration taking effect from 1 October 2016. The registration form and information about registering for GST will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). For general enquiries, or to apply for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exercise various discretions included in the rules, email info.gors@ird.govt.nz Information in this special report, and in a soon-to-be available special report on the new residential land withholding tax rules, precedes full coverage of the new legislation, which will be published in the July edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Key features Scope of the new GST rules From 1 October 2016, GST will apply to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles supplied by non-resident suppliers to New Zealand-resident consumers. The new rules will require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on these supplies if the supplies in aggregate exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. Consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system, the new rules apply GST to a wide range of cross-border remote services. 1 A “remote” service is defined as a service where, at the time of the performance of the service, there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the recipient and the place of physical performance. The definition 1 Services that are already exempt (such as supplies of financial services), zero-rated under a specific rule or the rules that apply to telecommunication services retain their current treatment under the new rules. 1 includes digital services, such as e-books, music, videos and software downloads, as well as non-digital services, such as general insurance, consulting, accounting and legal services. The new rules only apply when a remote service is supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand resident and the service is not physically performed in New Zealand (which is covered by existing rules). Non-resident suppliers will be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-contradictory pieces of commercially available evidence. The rules contain a list of commercially available evidence that suppliers can rely on, being: • the person’s billing address; • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the person or another geolocation method; • the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank; • the mobile country code (MCC) of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the person; • the location of the person’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied to them; and • other commercially relevant information. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to prescribe or agree to an alternative method of determining whether a customer is resident, in circumstances when there is insufficient information available to apply the test. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will take into account: • whether the supply is made in a low-value, high-volume digital context; • whether the supply is a one-off transaction, rather than one made between a supplier and customer who have an on-going relationship; and • the information that is commercially available to the supplier. Remote services supplied to GST-registered businesses Non-resident suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST- registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. However, the supplier will be able to treat the supply as zero-rated (taxed at a rate of zero percent). This may allow the supplier to claim back New Zealand GST costs incurred in making zero-rated supplies to GST-registered businesses. A rule requires non-resident suppliers to presume that a New Zealand-resident customer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number, New Zealand Business Number or notified the supplier of their status as a registered business. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is also able to prescribe or agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. The Commissioner will take into account the following matters as an indication that the services are generally only supplied to registered businesses: 2 • the nature of the supply (for example, advertising services); • the value of the supply (for example, the provision of a high-value software package that would only be associated with business use); • the terms and conditions of the provision of services (for example, software that is licensed for enterprise use across a large number of networked computers). When a GST-registered recipient is inadvertently charged GST, they will have to seek a refund from the non-resident supplier, and the non-resident supplier may make a GST adjustment in their GST return when it is apparent that a mistake has been made. Alternatively, if the payment for the supply (including GST) is NZ$1,000 or less, a non- resident supplier will have the option to provide a tax invoice to the purchaser to allow them to claim a deduction, rather than to refund the GST charged and make the necessary adjustment in their GST return. Special rules for certain non-resident suppliers Non-resident marketplaces When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of a marketplace (such as an app store) may be required to register and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace, instead of the underlying supplier. The rules require the non-resident operator of an “electronic marketplace”, rather than the underlying supplier, to register and return GST. An “electronic marketplace” is a marketplace operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of remote services by electronic means through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). Operators of “non-electronic marketplaces” can also register and return GST on behalf of its underlying suppliers (for example, in the insurance industry) but this requires an agreement with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. New Zealand agents A new agency rule provides agents acting for non-resident suppliers of remote services to New Zealand resident consumers the ability to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply. Insurance and gambling services General insurance and gambling services are subject to special GST rules that apply GST on a cashflow and net basis: • Non-resident insurance suppliers will need to return GST on premiums charged to New Zealand-resident consumers and will be able to claim deductions when making insurance payments to New Zealand-resident consumers, or on New Zealand GST costs incurred in paying for replacement goods or repair services. 3 • Non-resident gambling suppliers will need to return GST on the amounts received from New Zealand residents less amounts paid out to New Zealand residents. A special rule allows losses derived from one taxable period to be used to offset positive amounts from subsequent taxable periods. Non-double taxation rule A special rule will prevent double taxation from arising on supplies of remote services performed in New Zealand to a non-resident consumer in situations when the same supply is also subject to consumption tax in another jurisdiction. The rule allows a deduction against the supplier’s liability for New Zealand GST to the extent that the same supply has been taxed in another jurisdiction. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of remote services) The reverse charge has been extended to GST-registered businesses that receive non-taxable supplies of remote services and do not use or intend to use those services to make taxable supplies. The reverse charge applies if the percentage intended or actual taxable use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. The reverse charge requires the GST- registered businesses to return the GST. An equivalent reverse charge also applies in relation to zero-rated supplies of remote services received by GST-registered businesses. Administration of the non-resident registration system Registration The new rules will require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on remote services supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers if these supplies exceed, or are expected to exceed, NZ$60,000 in a 12-mo nth period. Non-resident suppliers are able to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. Non-resident suppliers are able to apply to be registered from 1 August 2016 (an application form will be available on that date) with the registration coming into force on 1 October 2016. The registration form will be located on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident GST). The application form will be relatively simple and ask for the applicant’s name, contact details, country of residence (including any existing tax identification numbers), a description of the business activity and website address. If a non-resident supplier is already registered for GST because they make taxable supplies under the standard rules, they do not need to register separately for any remote services they supply. Instead, these suppliers should continue to file their usual GST returns and include their supplies of remote services. 4 Filing GST returns The registration form will ask applicants whether they intend only to return GST, or return GST and claim GST back on New Zealand-based costs. A simplified “pay-only” GST return will be available from 1 April 2017, for suppliers that only return GST. The simplified return would only include fields relevant to returning GST, such as the amount of supplies to New Zealand-resident customers and the amount of GST required to be returned. Applicants who indicate that they intend to return GST and claim GST may be asked to provide further information about their business during the registration process to better confirm their identity. These applicants will be required to file a full GST return. Both types of GST return will be able to be filed online using Inland Revenue’s myIR. For GST payments, myIR displays payment options available to registrants, such as Western Union and OrbitRemit, and provides links and instructions on how to make payments. Information on how to file returns online and make payments will be available to non- resident suppliers when they apply to register for New Zealand GST. Taxable periods For the period from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services will have a taxable period of six months (or an optional taxable period of two months). After this transitional period, these suppliers will have mandatory quarterly taxable periods beginning on 1 April 2017. A GST return must be provided setting out the tax payable for the taxable period by the 28 th of the month following the end of the taxable period. The end of each taxable period is the last day of the month at the end of the taxable period. The quarterly taxable periods end on 30 June, 30 September, 31 December and 31 March. Converting amounts to New Zealand dollars When converting to New Zealand dollars for determining the amount of GST required to be returned, the supplier can use the conversion rate at: • the time of supply; • the end of each taxable period; • the time of filing the return (or at the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); • another time as agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Once the supplier elects in their return to use an option they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Consumers providing false or misleading information The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have the discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST if that person provides false or misleading information about themselves in order to avoid GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. 5 Existing “knowledge offences” rules may also apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information to a non-resident supplier for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business or as a resident of another country. This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence, or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. Transitional rule A transitional provision is provided in the new rules for fixed-term contracts entered into before 1 October 2016 and when the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement. The transitional provision allows suppliers to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successive supplies, and therefore, payments made after 1 October 2016 are not subject to GST. This transitional rule only applies for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. Background In principle, GST should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand, as this ensures that the system is fair, efficient and simple. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased offshore services, and online digital products were not available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported services outweighed the benefits of taxation. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of services and intangibles on which GST has not been collected is increasingly significant. Previous tax settings had the potential to distort consumer and business decisions, placing New Zealand suppliers of services and intangibles at a competitive disadvantage relative to non-resident suppliers. Non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles has also resulted in a growing “hole” in New Zealand’s GST revenue base. The new rules are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and from a GST perspective create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of services and intangibles. The effect will be to reduce the extent to which differences in GST treatment distort consumers’ purchasing decisions. The amendments broadly follow Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines, as well as similar rules that apply in other jurisdictions, such as Member States of the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and South Africa. Australia also enacted similar rules that will apply from 1 July 2017. 6 Application date The new GST rules come into force on 1 October 2016. Detailed analysis References are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless stated otherwise. Scope of the new GST rules (Sections 2, 8(3)(c), 8(4D), 8B, 11A(1)(j), 11A(1)(x) and 51(1B)) Place of supply rules The GST Act imposes GST on goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The Act adopts a broad set of rules to determine whether a good or service is considered to be supplied in New Zealand in the first instance. The place of supply rules are followed by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt rather than taxed at the normal 15% rate. If a non-resident person supplies services, the starting point is that the supply will be treated as having been made outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST. However, under section 8(3)(b), services are treated as having been supplied in New Zealand if the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of performance. Section 8(4) provides that if a supply is made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on their taxable activity, the services are considered to be supplied outside New Zealand, and therefore are not subject to GST, unless the parties agree that GST will apply. New section 8(3)(c) has been inserted into the place of supply rules, which treat supplies of “remote services” (as defined) supplied by a non-resident to a person resident in New Zealand as a supply made in New Zealand. The supply is therefore subject to GST, unless the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed (in which case the supply would be subject to GST under existing section 8(3)(b)). In the same way as section 8(4), new section 8(4D) provides that if remote services are made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on their taxable activity, the services are treated as having been supplied outside New Zealand. The services are therefore not subject to GST, unless the non-resident supplier chooses to treat the services as being made in New Zealand (no agreement is required between the supplier and recipient for this purpose). If the supplier chooses to treat the services as being made in New Zealand, these services will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). (See the following section of this Special report for more information on business-to-business supplies.) 7 Section 11A(1)(j) zero-rates services that are physically performed outside New Zealand or supplies that arrange services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. An amendment to this section excludes supplies of remote services to a person resident in New Zealand that is not a registered person from this zero-rating rule. This creates a level playing field between resident and non-resident suppliers, as in both cases, GST will apply at the 15% rate when remote services are physically performed outside New Zealand and supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer. Example Movie Co. is a non-resident company that provides remote services to consumers in a number of countries, including New Zealand. As some of these services are remote services supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer, these supplies will be subject to GST under section 8(3)(c). If Movie Co. exceeds the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on these supplies. If Movie Co. was a resident of New Zealand that physically performed remote services outside New Zealand, its supplies would also be subject to GST at the 15% rate when supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers, due to the exception to section 11A(1)(j). Services that are already exempt (such as supplies of financial services), or zero-rated under a specific rule, would retain that treatment under the new rules. 8 Summary of the new place of supply rules for services N o – new rulesYes – existing section 8(3)(b) Are the services “remote services” supplied to a person resident in New Zealand? section 8(3)(c) Are the services physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed? Are the services supplied to a registered person for the purposes of their taxable activity? section 8(4D) Do the supplier and the registered person agree that the supply will be a taxable supply? GST applies at the 15% rate GST applies at the 0% rate section 11A(1)(x) The supplier chooses to treat the supply as a taxable supply? No GST applies Are the services supplied to a registered person for the purposes of their taxable activity? section 8(4) No GST applies GST applies at the 15% rateGST applies at the 15% rateNo GST applies NoYes No Yes YesNo YesNo NoYes 9 Definition of “remote services” Under section 2, “services” are defined to include anything other than goods or money. A definition of “remote services” has been added to section 2, being a service where, at the time of the performance of the service, there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the customer and the place where the services are performed. Whether a service is a “remote service” will depend on if the nature of the service requires that the recipient is present when the service is physically performed. If a service is actually, or capable of being supplied when the recipient is not present, the test will be satisfied as there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the recipient and the place of physical performance. Requiring a connection between the physical location of the customer and the place of physical performance of services means that the definition of “remote services” includes services that are capable of being supplied remotely, but that happen to be provided when the recipient and provider are in the same location. Examples of services that could be supplied as remote services include: • supplies of digital content, such as e-books, movies, TV shows, music and online newspaper subscriptions; • online supplies of games, apps, software and software maintenance; • webinars or distance learning courses; • insurance services; • gambling services; • website design or publishing services; and • legal, accounting or consultancy services. Examples of services that would not be remote services include: • provisio n of acco mmodat ion; • hairdressing, beauty therapy and physiotherapy; • car rental services; • entry to cinema, theatre performances, sports events and museums; • gym memberships; • passenger transport services; and • restaurant and catering services. 10 Example Legal Co. is a non-resident company based in Australia. Sam, a New Zealand tax resident, seeks advice from Legal Co. about investing in an Australian company. The nature of the service is such that Sam is not required to be present when the advice is provided, and in fact the advice is provided via telephone and email, rather than in person. The services are remote services, as there is no necessary connection between Sam’s physical location and the place where the service is physically performed. If Legal Co. exceeds the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on this supply. An amendment has also been made to the definition of “goods” under section 2. The amendment removes the reference to a non-resident supplier and resident recipient, in order to ensure that intangible digital products will be treated as services irrespective of the tax residence of the supplier and recipient. Telecommunications services The GST Act includes special rules for cross-border supplies of telecommunications services, 2 including specific place of supply and zero-rating rules. These rules determine the GST treatment of the supply based on the place that the customer is located when initiating or receiving services. These rules zero-rate domestic telecommunications providers’ supplies of international roaming services to New Zealand residents who are temporarily offshore. Offshore telecommunications providers are, however, required to charge GST on services provided to non-resident consumers that are temporarily in New Zealand (for example, inbound roaming services), if the total value of their supplies exceeds the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. However, if the threshold is exceeded only because of supplies to non-residents that are physically present in New Zealand, they are not required to register. The new rules are not intended to disturb the current tax settings for telecommunications services. Section 8(5) excludes these services from the application of the relevant provisio ns. GST registration threshold As a result of the changes to the place of supply rules, non-resident suppliers of remote services to New Zealand customers will be required to register for GST if the total value of supplies made in New Zealand exceeds NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period, which is equivalent to the existing registration threshold for resident suppliers. As these suppliers will be subject to the rules contained in section 51, non-resident suppliers will be required to register if: 2 “Telecommunications services” are defined to include the transmission, emission or reception of information by certain technical systems, including access to global information networks, but excludes the content of the telecommunication. 11 • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. As remote services supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand GST-registered business are generally treated as not being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST), these supplies will not count towards the registration threshold. However, if the supplier chooses to zero-rate the services they will count towards the threshold. If a non-resident supplier of remote services is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand, and their supplies fall below the NZ$60,000 threshold, they will be able to voluntarily register for GST. Example Music Co., a non-resident, supplies access to music on a subscription basis over the internet. Music Co. also supplies licences for businesses such as restaurants and bars to play music in a commercial setting. Each year, Music Co. makes supplies valued at NZ$50,000 to New Zealand customers who are not GST- registered. It makes supplies valued at NZ$20,000 to New Zealand GST-registered customers. Unless Music Co. chooses to treat its supplies to GST-registered customers as being zero-rated, Music Co. will not be required to register and return GST on any of its supplies in New Zealand, as it has not exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. New section 51(1B) allows non-resident suppliers to use a “fair and reasonable” method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. This includes converting amounts to New Zealand currency as at the time of supply, using the current exchange rate at the time of testing the threshold, or using an average exchange rate over the period. Any of these methods would be regarded as fair and reasonable as long as they were used on a consistent basis. Example Software Co., a non-resident, supplies software to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Over the past two years, Software Co. has supplied NZ$10,000 of software, each month, to New Zealand individual consumers and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Software Co. will be expected to register for New Zealand GST from 1 October 2016 as it is reasonably expected that their supplies to New Zealand individual consumers will exceed NZ$60,000 in the 12 months following 1 October 2016 (the date the new rules apply from). Determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand When applying the new place of supply rules, a supplier will be able to use objective proxies to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident. Under new section 8B(1) and (2), a non-resident supplier of remote services is required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. 12 This rule is intended to provide non-resident suppliers with certainty when determining whether a recipient of a supply should be treated as a New Zealand resident. New section 8B(2) provides a list of indicators that can be used for these purposes: • the person’s billing address; • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the person or another geolocation method; • the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank; • the mobile country code (MCC) of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the person; • the location of the person’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied to them; or • other commercially relevant information. The supplier can use one or more pieces of other commercially relevant information to determine whether a person is resident in New Zealand, rather than using the specific indicators listed. This information might include the customer’s trading history (such as the previous billing address of the customer) or the product purchased if it is linked to a geographic location (for example, some vouchers may only be used in a particular country). Information provided by a third party, such as by a payment service provider, can also be used if it is commercially relevant. Under section 8B(3)(a), if a supplier has more than one piece of evidence that meets the test, where one piece supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in New Zealand and another supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in another country, the supplier is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Which items are more reliable will depend on the circumstances. Example Jacob, a New Zealand tax resident, purchases a navigational app on his phone while on holiday in the United States. The app store collects two pieces of evidence that support the conclusion that Jacob is resident in New Zealand – his credit card information and the records of his billing addresses from his transaction history with the app store. The app store also has two pieces of evidence that suggest Jacob is resident in the United States – the SIM card in the phone he is using and his IP address. Section 8B(3)(a) requires the app store to use the set of evidence that is more reliable to determine whether GST applies in New Zealand. The app store has implemented system rules that give priority to its customers’ credit card information and transaction history, as these indicators are more reliable in the context of their business. On this basis, the app store treats Jacob as a New Zealand resident, and charges New Zealand GST on the supply. 13 For additional flexibility, section 8B(3)(b) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe or agree with a supplier an alternative method of determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand when sufficient information is not commercially available to apply the test. Section 8B(3B) outlines a number of factors the Commissioner would take into account when exercising the discretion, being: • whether the supply is made in a low-value, high-volume digital context; • whether the supply is a one-off transaction, as opposed to one made where the supplier and customer have an on-going relationship; and • the information that is commercially available to the supplier. Remote services supplied to GST-registered businesses (Sections 8(4D), 8B, 11A(1)(x), 11A(7), 8B, 20(4C), 24 and 25(1)(aab) to (abb)) New section 8(4D) will apply to supplies made under section 8(3)(c), so that remote services supplied to GST-registered businesses will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand, unless the supplier chooses to treat the supply as being made in New Zealand. If the supplier chooses to treat the supply as being made in New Zealand, the supply will be zero-rated under new section 11A(1)(x). Example Accommodation Co. is a non-resident company that provides facilitation services, by matching customers who are looking for accommodation in a particular location with local accommodation providers. The facilitation services provided by Accommodation Co. to the local accommodation providers are remote services, as there is no necessary connection between the location of the recipients and the place where the facilitation services are performed. If the local providers are not registered for GST, these supplies will be subject to GST under section 8(3)(c), as the facilitation services are remote services that are supplied to a New Zealand resident who is not a GST- registered business. If the local providers are registered for GST, then under section 8(4D) the facilitation services will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand. If Accommodation Co. incurs New Zealand GST costs, it may wish to zero-rate the services, as this would allow them to deduct the costs incurred in New Zealand in making the supplies. New section 8B(5) requires non-resident suppliers to treat their services as being supplied to a consumer who is not GST registered, unless the recipient notifies the supplier that they are GST registered or provides their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of remote services may not identify themselves as a GST- registered business, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the service wholly for non-taxable purposes. 14 It is recognised that it may not be practical for all suppliers to ask for evidence that a customer is GST-registered. Therefore, to provide additional flexibility, section 8B(6) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe or agree an alternative method to determine whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. Section 8B(7) outlines the factors that the Commissioner will consider when exercising the discretion, being: • the nature of the supply (for example, advertising services); • the value of the supply (for example, provision of a high-value software package that would only be associated with business use); or • the terms and conditions of the provision of services (for example, software that is licensed for enterprise use across a large number of networked computers). Example Software Co. is a non-resident that provides software to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Factors such as price, and licensing terms and conditions mean there is a clear division between the software purchased by businesses and individual consumers. Businesses that purchase the software are likely to be GST- registered businesses. Software Co. has a large number of customers and it is impractical to ask for evidence to identify their customers as GST-registered. Software Co. is able to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use an alternative method for identifying whether their customers are GST-registered persons. Evidence such as the nature of the products, pricing, licensing terms and other conditions could be used, as well as a sample of their customer base that supports the likelihood that future customers will be GST-registered. GST inadvertently charged to a GST-registered recipient There may be instances when a non-resident supplier inadvertently treats a GST-registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the business GST. In this situation, the GST-registered recipient should seek a refund from the non-resident supplier and not claim an input tax deduction for the inadvertently charged GST (see the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C)). There is, however, an exception to the deduction prohibition for supplies under NZ$1,000. Amendments to section 25(1) will allow a supplier to make adjustments to the payment of output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This will apply if the supply is standard-rated when it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see new subsection 25(1)(aab)), or the supply is standard-rated if it should have been zero- rated (see new subsection 25(1)(abb)). Note that an adjustment will be required only if the non-resident supplier has already furnished a return and has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as a result of the mistake (see existing section 25(1)(e)). If the mistake becomes apparent before the relevant return has been furnished, the mistake can be rectified before the return is filed. Since non-resident suppliers are not required to provide a tax invoice under the amendment to section 24(5), they will not be required to issue a credit note under section 25(4). 15 Supplies of NZ$1,000 or less An exception to the above rules applies when the payment for the supply (including GST) is NZ$1,000 or less based on the value of the supply in New Zealand dollars at the time of supply. In this situation, when the supplier inadvertently charges a GST-registered business GST, the supplier can choose to provide a tax invoice to the GST-registered business. This option is intended to be a compliance cost-saving measure for non-resident suppliers in relat ion to low-value supplies, when the cost of issuing a refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. Note that if the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice, the supplier must provide a full tax invoice, even if the payment for the supply (including GST) is less than $50 (see the amendments to section 24(4)). The tax invoice must be a full invoice as set out in section 24(3), and therefore must contain the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the services supplied; • the quantity of the services supplied; and either— • the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or • where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in relation to the tax. The exception to the deduction prohibition (discussed above, under section 20(4C)) allows the GST-registered business to claim an input tax deduction under the normal deduction provisions to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice: • the supplier is not required to make an adjustment under section 25 to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii) and exception to section 25(1)(abb)); • the supplier and recipient are treated as having agreed that the supply is made in New Zealand (and therefore subject to GST) under section 8(4); 3 and 3 Note that new section 24(5B) and (5D) incorrectly refer to section 8(4), instead these sections should refer to new section 8(4D). Officials will seek to correct this cross-referencing error in a future omnibus tax bill. 16 • the zero-rating provision under section 11A(1)(x) does not apply (see exception to the zero-rating provision under section 11A(7)). These provisions turn a supply that should not have been taxed or was taxed at zero percent, into a supply that is taxed at the standard rate of 15%. In this situation, the correct amount of GST is returned by the supplier and therefore an adjustment to the supplier’s GST return, under section 25, is not required. 17 The following diagram summarises how these rules will apply. When GST is incorrectly charged Is the consideration for the service le ss tha n NZ$1,000? A non-resident supplier has supplied a remote service to a G ST-registered business and GST is inadvertently charged Supplier can provide a tax invoice The supplier must make an adjustment of tax payable in the period when the incorrect treatment becomes apparent. Supplier can provide a refund of GST charged The service is treated as a standard-rated supply. The GST- registered recipient is able to claim an input tax deduction. The non-resident supplier will not make an adjustment. No Yes Supplier has an option The option to provide a tax invoice is not available for the supply of a contract of insurance (see section 24(5C) and the discussion on the special rules that apply to contracts of insurance). 18 Special rules for certain non-resident suppliers (Sections 2, 5(10B), 5(11), 5(13), 10(14B) to (4F), 20(3)(d)(vii), 60(1A), 60(1AB), 60(1C), 60C and 60D) Non-resident marketplaces A marketplace is a medium that allows consumers and suppliers of goods and services to interact to facilitate the sale and purchase of the goods and services. When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of a marketplace (such as an app store) instead of the underlying supplier may be required to register and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace. Under the new rules, electronic marketplaces are required to register and return GST, and non-electronic marketplaces can register subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. The definition of “marketplace” in section 2 means an electronic marketplace or a marketplace approved under section 60D as a supplier of remote services. An electronic marketplace is further defined under section 2 as requiring the following: • the marketplace allows underlying suppliers to make supplies of remote services through the marketplace to customers; • the marketplace must be operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace; and • the supplies made by the marketplace must be made by electronic means. Payment providers are excluded from the definition of “electronic marketplace” as these providers merely facilitate the exchange of money between the supplier and consumer, rather than the exchange of the remote service itself. Electronic marketplace rule New section 60C states that when a supply of remote services is made through a non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace to a person resident in New Zealand, the operator of the marketplace will be treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. As the rules will only apply to non-resident operators of electronic marketplaces through which supplies of remote services are made to New Zealand residents, this rule is not expected to affect existing arrangements that apply in the domestic context. However, the operator of the electronic marketplace will not be considered to have made the supply if they do not control any of the key elements of the supply, and the liability of the underlying supplier is made clear in the documentation relating to the transaction. Accordingly, under section 60C, the non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace will be the supplier, unless all of the following conditions are satisfied: • the electronic marketplace does not authorise the charge to the recipient, or authorise the delivery of the supply, or set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made; • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; and 19 • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed that the supplier is liable for GST. If they are treated as making the supply, the operator of the electronic marketplace will be responsible for returning GST. The operator of the electronic marketplace will include these supplies in their turnover for the purpose of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded and, if it is exceeded, will be liable for the GST. Non-electronic marketplace rule Similarly to the rule that applies to electronic marketplaces, new section 60D allows non- electronic marketplaces (such as a syndicate providing insurance services to New Zealand residents) to register as a marketplace subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. The operator, and not the underlying supplier, would then be treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. When exercising this discretion the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may take into account (under section 60D(3)): • whether the marketplace is best placed to determine whether the recipient of the supply of remote services; - is resident in New Zealand; - is a registered person; and • whether the number of underlying suppliers to the marketplace means that return requirements are better satisfied by the marketplace rather than the individual underlying suppliers. Resident underlying suppliers A specific rule in new section 60(1C) will apply to New Zealand-resident suppliers of remote services through a marketplace. These underlying suppliers may already be registered for GST under the standard rules. If these suppliers were subject to the general rule under section 60C or 60D, the services they supply through the electronic marketplace would no longer be taxable, as the operator of the marketplace will have been treated as the supplier. This would mean that GST incurred by the underlying supplier in making these supplies would be irrecoverable. To address this issue, section 60(1C) treats the supply of remote services as two separate supplies – a supply of services from the underlying supplier to the operator, and a supply of those services from the operator of the marketplace to the recipient. This will allow the resident underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. 20 Example Gaming Co., a New Zealand GST-registered app developer, contracts with Applications Co., a non-resident operator of an app store, to distribute its smartphone games. Applications Co. collects payments from customers and authorises delivery of the app. Applications Co. is treated as the supplier under section 60C, and therefore is responsible for GST on the supply. If Applications Co. makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of the remote services that are made through it to New Zealand-resident consumers. Even though Applications Co. is treated as a supplier of the app under section 60C, under section 60(1C), Gaming Co. and Applications Co. can agree to treat the supply from Gaming Co. to Applications Co. as a separate supply. This will allow Gaming Co. to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies to Applications Co. New Zealand-resident agents A new agency rule under section 60(1A) and 60(1AB) allows agents acting for non-resident suppliers that supply remote services to New Zealand-resident consumers to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them. If this option is exercised, the agent would be required to register and return GST on the supplies of remote services. Since the agent is a New Zealand resident they would be treated as any other resident supplier of services and, therefore, would be required to return GST on both supplies to New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. Example Agent Co., a New Zealand resident, provides contracts of general insurance to New Zealand residents on behalf of Insurance C., a non-resident supplier of insurance services. Agent Co. and Insurance Co. agree that Agent Co. will be treated as making the supply of the insurance services. Assuming the supplies made by Agent Co. exceed the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, Agent Co is now required to register and return GST on behalf of Insurance Co. in relation to supplies to both New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. Remote supplies of insurance services Under the new rules, a non-resident provider of insurance will be required to return GST on premiums charged to New Zealand-resident consumers if its supplies to New Zealand residents exceed the registration threshold, as the supply of the contract of insurance will be taxable under section 8(3)(c). If registered, a non-resident insurer would also be able to claim a deduction when making an insurance payment under an insurance contract with a New Zealand-resident consumer (through existing section 20(3)(d)), or on New Zealand GST costs incurred in paying for replacement goods or repair services. 21 The following diagram shows how the rules will apply to cross-border supplies of insurance to New Zealand residents who are not GST-registered businesses. Cross-border supplies of general insurance services to New Zealand-resident non GST- registered consumers Insurance company Offshore NZ A deduction is available to the insurance company when an insurance payment is made Consumer G ST ap p li es at th e 15% rate on the insurance premiums charged Supplies of general insurance services to New Zealand GST-registered businesses Unless the insurer decides to zero-rate the supply under sections 8(4D) and 11A(1)(x), cross- border supplies of insurance services to a GST-registered businesses will not be subject to GST. Consequently, a non-resident insurer will not be required to return GST on premiums charged to GST-registered business customers, and will not be entitled to a deduction under section 20(3)(d). A GST-registered recipient of an insurance payment will not be required to return output tax on the payment under existing section 5(13). This means the current arrangements for GST on supplies of insurance services by a non-resident insurer to a GST-registered business will not change. The following diagram shows how the new rules will apply. 22 Cross-border supplies of insurance services to New Zealand GST-registered businesses (when the supply is not zero-rated) Insurance company Offshore NZ N o ded u ctio n is available o n the insurance payment under existing section 20(3)(d) G ST-registered business Insurance premiums are not subject to GST No deemed supply when the business receives an insurance payment under existing section 5(13) If the non-resident insurer decides to treat the supply as zero-rated, GST will apply at 0% on the insurance premiums. This will allow the insurance supplier to claim back GST costs incurred in New Zealand in making these supplies, which could include costs incurred in repairing or replacing goods. This should mean that non-resident insurers, in the same way as resident insurers, are indifferent from a GST perspective about whether they make a payment to the insured GST-registered business or replace or repair damaged goods. However, the new rules ensure that an insurer is not entitled to claim a deduction for insurance payments under these contracts (new section 20(3)(d)(vii)), and that a GST- registered recipient of an insurance payment is not required to pay output tax under new section 5(13)(d). This treatment is equivalent to situations when the supply is treated as being made outside of New Zealand, with the exception of the non-resident insurer’s ability to claim back related New Zealand GST costs. The following diagram shows how these rules will apply. 23 Cross-border supplies of zero-rated insurance services to New Zealand GST-registered businesses Insurance company Offshore NZ N o ded u ctio n is available o n the insurance payment due to new section 20(3)(d)(v ii) G ST-registered business G ST ap p li es at th e 0% rate on the insurance premiums charged No deemed supply when the business receives an insurance p aym ent d u e to new section 5(13)(d) No option to provide a tax invoice The option to provide a tax invoice when GST is inadvertently charged on a supply for consideration of NZ$1,000 or less will not apply to supplies under a contract of insurance. Allowing this option would require changes to ensure that GST applies correctly on a cashflow basis, which would lead to significant complexity in the rules. Because of the nature of insurance services, an insurance company is likely to have access to sufficient information to determine whether their client is a GST-registered business. Remote supplies of gambling services New section 5(10B) treats payments for remote gambling services or prize competitions by a New Zealand resident performed outside New Zealand as payment for the supply of services by the person who conducts the gambling or prize competition. An addition to section 5(11) will apply the definition of “gambling” under the Gambling Act 2003 to section 5(10B). “Gambling” is defined under the Gambling Act 2003 as follows: • paying or staking consideration, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance; • includes a sales promotion scheme; • includes bookmaking; and 24 • includes betting, paying, or staking consideration on the outcome of a sporting event. A “prize competition” is defined in the GST Act as a scheme or competition: • for which direct or indirect consideration is paid to a person for conducting the scheme or compet ition; • that distributes prizes of money or in which participants seek to win money; and • for which the result is determined: - by the performance of the participant of an activity of a kind that may be performed more readily by a participant possessing or exercising some knowledge or skill; or - partly by chance and partly by the performance of an activity as described above, whether or not it may also be performed successfully by chance. Section 10(14B) applies to determine the consideration for the supply of remote gambling services or prize competitions for the purposes of section 5(10B). The amount of consideration is: Consideration = amounts received from residents – prizes paid to residents Amounts received by residents and prizes paid to residents are defined under section 10(14C) as follows: • amounts received from residents – this is the total amount in money received in relation to the supply by the non-resident person who conducts the gambling or the prize competition, as applicable, from all persons resident in New Zealand; and • prizes paid to residents – this is the total amount of all prizes paid and payable in money to persons resident in New Zealand in relation to the supply. Sections 10(14D), 10(14E) and 10(14F) apply in situations when a loss is calculated under the formula. Losses derived from the formula can be carried forward to the next taxable period and can be offset against positive consideration in that period. Any balance of losses can continue to be carried forward in subsequent periods until they are extinguished. Example Gambling Co. operates an offshore gambling website. In a taxable period Gambling Co. receives $100 from New Zealand residents and pays out $250 in prizes to New Zealand residents. Therefore, Gambling Co. has a loss of $150 in that period and will have no GST to return. In the next taxable period, Gambling Co. receives $500 from New Zealand residents and pays out $120 of prizes to New Zealand residents. Gambling Co. can use the $150 loss from the previous taxable period and offset that loss against the positive consideration calculated in the current period. Therefore, the total consideration derived in the current period is $230 and Gambling Co. will be required to return $30 of GST (($500 – $120 – $150) x (3/23) = $30). 25 Non-double taxation rule (Section 20(3)(dc)) Section 20(3)(dc) prevents double taxation from arising on supplies of remote services to a non-resident consumer in New Zealand that are physically performed in New Zealand, by allowing a deduction that offsets their liability for GST in New Zealand to the extent that the supply is subject to consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Section 20(3)(dc) provides a deduction for the New Zealand GST charged when: • there is a supply of remote services that are physically performed in New Zealand and supplied to a non-resident person in New Zealand who is not registered for New Zealand GST; and • the supplier has, in relation to the supply, incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. The deduction is limited to the GST paid on the supply in New Zealand (15%) and to the extent tax is paid and returned in the other country. Example A resident of Country A visiting New Zealand receives a remote service from a New Zealand supplier. The service is physically performed in New Zealand and therefore is subject to New Zealand GST. Country A also requires the New Zealand supplier to register for GST and tax the service at a rate of 20% as it is a remote service supplied to a resident of their country. The non-double taxation rule allows the New Zealand supplier the ability to claim an input tax credit up to the amount of New Zealand GST returned on the supply (15%) if the supplier has returned and paid GST to Country A. If Country A’s tax rate was 10%, the supplier would only be entitled to an input tax credit of 10%. Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of remote services) (Sections 8(4B), 20(4D), 20(3JC) and 25AA) An amendment to the reverse charge rule in section 8(4B) will require recipients of a remote service under new section 8(3)(c), that are not treated as being supplied in New Zealand, to return output tax on the supply if the percentage intended or actual use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. An exception (new section 20(4D)) to the prohibition on input tax deductions (new section 20(4C)) allows a recipient of remote services, that is required to return output tax under the reverse charge, to claim an input tax deduction to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. 26 Example 1 Melissa is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a software package from a non-resident supplier for $400, identifies herself as a GST-registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the software 50 percent for her taxable project management services and 50 percent for home/recreational use. Under the reverse charge rule, Melissa is treated as making a supply to herself of $400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of $60 ($400 x 15%). However, Melissa can claim an input deduction for the portion of the value of the software package (50 percent) that is attributed to her taxable use. This input tax deduction is $30 ($60 x 50 percent). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of $30 ($60 output tax minus $30 input tax). If Melissa’s taxable use of the software package had been 95 percent or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. The existing reverse charge rule only applies when the supply of services is not treated as a supply made in New Zealand. Therefore, the reverse charge under section 8(4B) will not apply when the non-resident supplier chooses to treat the service as being made in New Zealand under section 8(4D), as the service will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). In this situation, section 20(3JC) requires the recipient of a remote service under section 8(3)(c), that is zero-rated under new section 11A(1)(x) or existing section 11A(1)(j), to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the services. The nominal GST component is the tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply, as if the value were equal to the consideration charged on the supply. This section will only apply when at the time of acquisition, or at the end of an adjustment period, the taxable use of the service is less than 95 percent. This is consistent with the application of the reverse charge rule under section 8(4B). Example 2 The supplier in Example 1 chooses to treat the service as a supply made in New Zealand, in which case the service is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). Because the supply is zero-rated, Melissa will be required to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the services under section 20(3JC). Since the value of the software is $400, the nominal GST component is $60 ($400 x 15%). The amount of output tax Melissa is required to return is $30, calculated by multiplying the nominal GST component ($60) by the non-taxable use of the service (50 percent). Note that an equivalent amount of tax is paid on the services as with the application of section 8(4B). Amendments have also been made to existing sections 10(15C) (reduction of value of related party internal charges), 24B (records to be kept by recipient of imported services), and 56B (branches and divisions in relation to certain imported services) to ensure these provisions apply when the recipient is required to apply the reverse charge under section 20(3JC). 27 Reverse charge for supplies of NZ$1,000 or less There may be instances when a GST-registered recipient applies the reverse charge and the non-resident supplier also inadvertently charges the GST-registered recipient GST. In this situation, GST may be returned twice on a single supply (by the non-resident supplier and the GST-registered recipient). This issue will likely be resolved if the non-resident supplier subsequently returns the GST to the GST-registered recipient and makes an adjustment under section 25 as described previously. An adjustment may still be necessary under section 25AA(1)(a)(iii), however, to ensure the correct amount of tax is accounted for under the section 8(4B) reverse charge rule. To ensure the correct amount of tax is paid when the supplier provides a tax invoice under section 24(5B), an addition to section 25AA will allow the GST-registered recipient to correct the amount of output tax paid and deductions claimed as a result of the application of the reverse charge rule under section 8(4B). The recipient will then be able to claim, in the normal manner, the portion of the GST charged by the non-resident supplier to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example 3 Consider Example 1 again, where Melissa has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). However, she subsequently finds out that the price for the software included GST at the standard 15% rate (3/23 x $400 = $52.17). Melissa contacts the non-resident supplier and seeks a refund for the incorrectly charged GST. Instead of providing a refund, since the consideration for the supply is NZ$1,000 or less, the supplier issues Melissa with a full tax invoice. The tax invoice enables Melissa to claim an input tax deduction to the extent the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies, which means she can deduct $30. The non-resident supplier is not required to make any adjustments under section 25. Under section 25AA(1)(a)(v), Melissa makes an adjustment in the return during which it is apparent that a mistake has been made to the amount of output tax and deductions claimed as a result of the application of section 8(4B). Melissa can claim a deduction under section 20(3) for the output tax actually accounted for ($60 under section 25AA(2)) and return output tax for the deduction actually claimed ($30 under section 25AA(3)). Administration of the non-resident supplier registration system (Sections 5(27), 15(6), 51B(7), 75(3F) and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Sections 24BA(1B) and 143A(1)(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Taxable periods For the period beginning 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services will have a taxable period of six months, or the option of two-month periods. From 1 April 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services that are subject to GST under the new rules will have quarterly taxable periods (section 15(6)). This is intended to align with these suppliers’ filing obligations in other jurisdictions. 28 Expressing amounts in a foreign currency Generally, the GST Act requires all amounts to be expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. This means that if a supply is paid for in a foreign currency, the value of the supply must be expressed as the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. Amendments have been made to section 77 that will provide non-resident suppliers of remote services with a range of options for expressing amounts in a foreign currency. When converting to New Zealand dollars for determining the amount of GST required to be returned, the supplier can use the conversion rate at: • the time of supply; • the end of each taxable period; • the time of filing the return (or at the due date for filing, if the return is filed past the due date); • another time as agreed with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Once the supplier elects in their return to use an option other than expressing amounts in New Zealand currency at time of supply, they may not change their method for a period of 24 months, unless they agree otherwise with the Commissioner. Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English Currently, a GST-registered person must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Section 75(3F) provides an automatic exception to this requirement for non-resident suppliers of remote services that are subject to GST under section 8(3)(c). Exception from the bank account requirement Recent amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 require an offshore person to have a New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person has first been subject to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. Section 24BA(1B) provides an exception to this requirement for non-resident suppliers who require an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier under the GST Act. Misrepresentations by recipients of remote services Sections 5(27) and 51B(7) provide a discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged, when: • the person has knowingly provided information that is altered, false or misleading, which leads to a supply being treated as zero-rated or as not being supplied in New Zealand; and 29 • the person has repeatedly and knowingly provided altered, false or misleading information, or the amount of GST that was not charged is substantial. The existing “knowledge offences” also apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business or as a resident of another country (section 143A(g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). This is a criminal penalty and a person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. If a customer has provided incorrect or false information to access content that is geographically restricted, and this consequentially results in GST not being charged, the reverse charge rule in section 5(27) and the existing knowledge offences would not be expected to apply. However, there may be other consequences unrelated to New Zealand’s tax obligations. Example Luke purchases a number of remote services online, including online dating services, music and movie content. Luke is not registered for GST. To avoid paying GST, Luke continually informs suppliers he is GST registered and provides suppliers with a false GST registration number. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to register Luke from the time the services were physically performed, and requires him to repay the GST that was not charged, plus penalties and interest. Transitional rule (Section 85B) Section 85B contains a new transitional provision similar to the transitional rule under section 78AA(10) and (11), which was provided for the GST rate change in 2010. The new transit ional provisio n applies: • to contracts that are for a fixed term and entered into before 1 October 2016; and • to periodic payments made under the contract, and consequently section 9(3)(a) would apply to treat these payments as successive supplies; and • if the consideration for the supply is set or reviewed for periods of 396 days or less during the term of the agreement (this covers contracts that are entered into during a month and end a year later at the end of the month); and • if the non-resident supplier elects that the transitional provision applies. The transit ional provisio n allows a non-resident supplier to treat periodic payments under the contract as not being successively supplied under section 9(3), and therefore, those payments made after 1 October 2016 would not be subject to GST. This transitional rule would only apply for the term of the agreement or up to 396 days from the date the contract was entered into, whichever is earlier. After that time, section 9(3) would usually apply and treat periodic payments as being successive supplies when the payments become due or are received, whichever is earlier. 30 Example Jacob insures his car for a 12-month period with a non-resident insurance provider on 15 January 2016 and he elects to pay for the insurance in monthly instalments. The non-resident insurance provider is able to treat those monthly instalments as not being successively supplied under section 9(3) and, therefore, payments made after 1 October 2016 would not be subject to GST up until the 12-month contract ended. Jacob has an accident and damages his car on 1 November 2016. He immediately makes a claim under his insurance contract. The insurance provider is unable to claim a deduction for any insurance payment made as it relates to a non-taxable supply of insurance. 31
June 2016 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Residential land withholding tax The Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016 introduced a new withholding tax – residential land withholding tax (RLWT) – on sales of residential property made by “offshore RLWT persons” within two years of acquisition. This special report provides early information on the new RLWT rules, and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the July edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Background Residential land withholding tax is primarily intended to support the “bright-line test” announced by the Government in Budget 2015 as part of a package of proposals to improve compliance with the residential investment property tax rules. The bright-line test was enacted on 16 November 2015 in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015. It requires income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property bought and sold within two years, with some exceptions – for example, if the property sold was the vendor’s main home. It applies to land acquired on or after 1 October 2015. Proposals for the RLWT were consulted on in an officials’ issues paper, Residential land withholding tax, released in August 2015. It was originally proposed that RLWT apply when the vendor is an “offshore person”, using the definition introduced in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 (referred to as the “land information requirements” in this special report). Sixteen submissions were received. The issues paper also left open the question of whether the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor, or the purchaser’s conveyancer or solicitor should be the withholding agent, and outlined the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Feedback from that consultation, including with the Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society, and New Zealand Society of Conveyancers, whose members are required to administer the withholding tax, helped to shape the RLWT measures in the new legislation. A number of modifications were subsequently made to the original proposals, which were then introduced in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill on 16 November 2015. The main modifications included: • broadening the scope of “offshore person” in response to submissions that the definition used for land information requirements would be too difficult for RLWT agents to determine and verify; 1 • requiring the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor involved in the land disposal to be the RLWT withho lding agent; and • reducing the amount of RLWT payable, when payment would leave insufficient funds for a mortgage with a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013 to be paid. This reduction is only available when the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor is the RLWT agent. Further refinements to the proposals were recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to submissions made at the select committee stage of the bill. The main recommendations included: • renaming “offshore person” to “offshore RLWT person” to avoid confusion with the land information requirements; • narrowing the definition of “offshore RLWT person” as it applies to companies and trusts, to make it more consistent with the approach taken in the Overseas Investment Act 2005; • introducing an RLWT exemption certificate regime to relieve cashflow pressures in certain situations. Offshore RLWT persons in the business of developing land, erecting buildings, or dividing land into lots will be able to apply for an RLWT exemption certificate if they have complied with all of their tax obligations or are able to provide sufficient security to the Commissioner (for example, a bank bond). Offshore RLWT persons who would be eligible for the main home exclusion under the bright-line test will also be able to apply for an RLWT exemption certificate; • reducing the amount of RLWT payable, where payment of RLWT would leave insufficient funds for the vendor’s outstanding local authority rates to be paid; • applying late filing penalties for RLWT agents to ensure the timely provision of information to Inland Revenue; and • streamlining and simplifying the information provision requirements. Key features As the RLWT is primarily a collection mechanism for the bright-line test, the RLWT follows as closely as possible the concepts used in the bright-line test. However, there are some instances where the framework departs from that of the bright-line test to ensure that the RLWT is able to be administered by agents. RLWT applies when: • the property being sold is “residential land” located in New Zealand and defined for the purposes of the bright-line test as introduced in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015; • the vendor acquired the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has owned the property for less than two years before disposing of it (the two-year holding period used in the bright-line test); and • the vendor is an “offshore RLWT person”. RLWT does not apply when the vendor holds a certificate of exemption. 2 Offshore RLWT persons An “offshore RLWT person” includes all non-New Zealand citizens and individuals who do not hold residence class visas granted under the Immigration Act 2009. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas, if they have not been physically present in New Zealand within the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be “offshore RLWT persons” if there are significant offshore interests in them. A New Zealand company is an offshore RLWT person, if more than 25 percent of the directors or holders of the shareholder decision-making rights are themselves offshore persons. This 25 percent threshold rule also applies for limited partnerships and look-through companies, which are legal ent ities. Similarly, a trust is an offshore RLWT person if more than 25 percent of the trustees or persons with the power to appoint or remove trustees or amend the trust deed are themselves offshore persons. However, the general 25 percent rule does not apply to beneficiaries. A trust is an offshore RLWT person if any one of the following applies: • all of the natural person or non-natural person beneficiaries (discretionary and non- discretionary) are offshore; • a non-natural person offshore beneficiary has received a distribution from the trust within the previous four years; • a natural person offshore beneficiary has received distributions from the trust totalling more than $5,000 in any of the previous four years; or • there is an offshore beneficiary and the trust has disposed of residential land within the previous four years. These rules seek to ensure that a family trust where the beneficiaries are now living overseas or are on their OE will not be an “offshore RLWT person”. For transparent entities like partnerships and co-ownership situat ions, the offshore status of each partner or owner needs to be considered and RLWT will be calculated and allocated accordingly. Further detail on what constitutes an “offshore RLWT person” can be found in the section titled “When RLWT applies”, under the subsection “Offshore RLWT persons”. Exemptions from RLWT No exempt ion for the vendor’s main home is available for the purposes of the RLWT, unless the vendor has a valid RLWT exemption certificate from Inland Revenue and has provided this to the RLWT agent. 3 This is because RLWT only applies to offshore RLWT persons, so it is unlikely that the property being sold is an offshore RLWT person’s main home. If it is the offshore RLWT person’s main home, it would be difficult for the withholding agent to verify, so an exemption certificate regime is appropriate. An RLWT exemption certificate is also available to persons in the business of developing land, erecting buildings or dividing land into lots. To obtain an exemption certificate, the developer, builder or subdivider must have eit her complied with all of their tax obligations or provided acceptable security to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue – for example, a bank bond. Further detail on this can be found in the section titled “When RLWT applies”. Alternatively, if the vendor does not hold an exemption certificate and RLWT is withheld and paid to Inland Revenue, the vendor may file an “interim claim” to obtain a refund of the overpaid RLWT before the end of the income year. The section titled “Interim claims” has further information on the interim claim process. RLWT agent The obligation to pay RLWT primarily lies with the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor, as agent for the vendor. A conveyancer or solicitor provides conveyancing services as defined in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 and must have a New Zealand-based trust account. If the vendor does not have a conveyancer or solicitor, the obligation to pay RLWT is on the purchaser’s conveyancer or solicitor. In the absence of either, the obligation to pay RLWT is on the purchaser themselves. In these situations, the person with the obligation to pay RLWT is referred to as the “paying agent”. If the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser is liable for the payment of RLWT and is known as a “withholding agent”. The person who is required to pay or withho ld RLWT is referred to as the “RLWT agent” in this special report except when there are differences in the treatment between withholding agents and paying agents (for example, in relation to penalties and underlying liability). In these situations, this special report distinguishes between paying agents and withholding agents. RLWT is not a traditional withholding tax in the sense that paying agents are not held jointly and severally liable for the RLWT if they have not retained the RLWT from the settlement funds. This is the correct outcome when the paying agent has not retained RLWT from the settlement amount before paying the funds to the vendor. This is because the RLWT paying agent would not be able to recoup the debt from the vendor if the paying agent were held liable for the underlying RLWT debt. 4 As this is a departure from “normal” wit hho lding tax treatment, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to report cases of RLWT non-compliance to the conveyancing agent’s professional body – for example, the New Zealand Law Society or the New Zealand Society of Conveyancers – for appropriate action to be taken. Note that when the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser can be liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. The RLWT agent must pay the required amount of RLWT to the Commissioner by the 20th of the following month, together with information relating to the transaction. However, they can also pay RLWT to the Commissioner on a transaction-by-transaction basis immediately following settlement, if desired. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue can still apply the monetary penalties applicable to other withholding taxes (including both civil and criminal penalties) – for example, shortfall penalties, late payment penalties and late filing penalties. Further detail on this can be found in the section titled “When RLWT obligations not met”. Calculating RLWT There are three calculations required to determine the amount of RLWT payable. The amount of RLWT required to be withheld will be the lowest of the following three amounts: • 33% (or 28% if the vendor is a company) x (current purchase price – vendor’s acquisition cost); • 10% x the current purchase price; and • current purchase price – outstanding local authority rates – security discharge amount. In general, RLWT must be paid before other disbursements are made at the time of settlement. However, under the third calculation outlined above, an allowance has been made for the vendor’s outstanding local authority rates in relation to the property. If the payment of the vendor’s outstanding local authority rates would result in insufficient funds being available to pay RLWT, the amount of RLWT payable is reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that the outstanding local authority rates are able to be paid. In addit io n, if the vendor’s conveyancer is the RLWT agent, the amount of RLWT payable is reduced to the extent necessary to discharge the vendor’s mortgage obligation with a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. Further detail on this can be found in the section titled “Calculating RLWT”. 5 Credit for and repayment of RLWT RLWT is not a final withholding tax. The vendor is able to claim a tax credit for the amount of RLWT withheld and paid to the Commissioner against their final income tax liability in relation to the sale of the residential property. In some cases, this may result in a tax refund. The vendor does not need to wait until the end of the tax year to do this. As long as they have no outstanding tax obligations, the vendor can file an “interim claim”, which includes all of the vendor’s land-related income and costs for the year to date. Application dates The RLWT rules apply to a “residential land purchase amount” made on or after 1 July 2016, but only in relation to residential land acquired on or after 1 October 2015 and subsequently disposed of. Residential land acquired before 1 October 2015 is not subject to RLWT. Detailed analysis New tax type: Residential land withholding tax The RLWT rules are set out in new subpart RL. RLWT applies to certain disposals of residential land. New section RA 6C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a person required to pay RLWT under new section RL 2 and a person required to withhold and pay RLWT under new section RL 3, must pay RLWT to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by the due date. Section RL 5 provides that RLWT must be paid on a monthly basis and section RA 15(2) provides that the due date is the 20 th of the following month. RLWT is, in effect, a new type of withholding tax. However, it is only a true withholding tax if the vendor and purchaser are associated persons. This situation is specified in new sections BE 1(6) and RL 3. In this situation, the purchaser must withhold the RLWT calculated. The meaning of “associated person” is set out in sections YB 1–16 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In this case, the person required to withhold RLWT (the purchaser) is referred to as a withholding agent and may be liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. Where the vendor and purchaser are not associated persons, the person required to pay RLWT on behalf of the vendor (“the paying agent”) is permitted to retain the amount of RLWT from the purchase price, similar to a withholding tax, but RLWT is instead listed in section BF 1(d) (and in section YA 1 as an ancillary tax). The ability to retain an amount of RLWT from the purchase price is provided for in new section RL 2(8) and the vendor is treated as receiving both the amount paid to them directly and the amount paid to the Commissioner. This provides assurance to the person correctly retaining or withholding RLWT from a payment to the vendor and paying this RLWT to the Commissioner that the vendor cannot say that they did not “receive” the full payment. 6 This distinction between “paying agent” and “withholding agent” is necessary because, in general, paying agents are not liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. This is provided for in new section RL 2(5). One exception is when the paying agent has retained an amount of RLWT, but has not paid this to the Commissioner. The sect ion tit led “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)” provides further discussion on this issue. The term “RLWT agent” is used throughout this special report to mean both paying agents and withholding agents. When the obligation arises The obligation to retain or withhold and pay RLWT generally arises upon settlement when, in most cases, the bulk of the purchase price is paid by the purchaser to the vendor via a conveyancer or solicitor. At this point the RLWT paying or withholding agent (RLWT agent) should retain or withhold RLWT from the funds being paid. Further information about who the RLWT agent is can be found in the section titled “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)”. New section RL 1 provides that in general, the obligation to pay RLWT arises if there is a “residential land purchase amount” and the conditions for payment are satisfied. The section titled “When RLWT applies” discusses when RLWT applies. The definition of “residential land purchase amount” inserted into section YA 1 means an amount paid or payable for the disposal of the residential land in question, but excludes deposits and part-payments as long as all deposits and part-payments total, in aggregate, less than 50 percent of the purchase price for the land. This rolling aggregate ensures that part- payments are not used to circumvent the application of the RLWT. Example Elizabeth is an offshore RLWT person. Elizabeth agrees to sell her house to Rebecca for $500,000. The contract requires Rebecca to pay a 10 percent deposit of $50,000, with the remaining $450,000 to be paid upon settlement. The $50,000 deposit is not a residential land purchase amount, but the $450,000 paid upon settlement is a residential land purchase amount. RLWT is calculated based on the purchase amount of $500,000. The residential land purchase amount in itself is not income for tax purposes. It is an amount that is paid, which triggers a withholding or retention obligation. The residential land purchase amount forms part of the consideration for the disposal of residential land, which may be inco me for the vendor under another part of the Income Tax Act 2007. The obligation to pay RLWT is not restricted to instances where consideration for the property is paid in cash. In-kind consideration may form part of the transaction and the situation will be monitored to ensure that RLWT obligations are not evaded or avoided through the use of non- cash consideration, as this could raise concerns under the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. As noted, a paying agent is not liable for the underlying amount of RLWT if they are unable to retain RLWT, but shortfall penalties may apply depending on the level of culpability of the paying agent. The section titled “When RLWT obligations not met” sets out the different types of penalties in further detail. 7 Due dates for RLWT to be paid to the Commissioner Once the obligation for RLWT has arisen and the appropriate amount of RLWT has been withheld or retained from a residential land purchase amount, new section RL 5 and an amendment to section RA 15 provide that the standard due dates for interim and other tax payments made on a monthly basis apply. The due date is specified in section RA 15(2) as being the 20th day of the following month. This provides for the “batching” of various RLWT amounts, which may be preferable for a RLWT agent who handles a number of RLWT transactions in a month. RLWT agents are also permitted to pay RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on a transaction-by-transaction basis before the stipulated due date. The transaction-by-transaction approach may be preferred by RLWT agents who handle RLWT transactions only occasionally, and by vendors who want to square up the amount of RLWT paid wit h their inco me tax liabilit y in relation to the disposal o f the resident ial land fairly soon afterwards. Example Susanna is a conveyancer and retains RLWT from four transactions during the month of March. Susanna pays the retained RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on the stated due date, 20 April. Example Bill is a conveyancer who normally pays RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on the 20th of the following month. However, for a particular transaction, Bill agrees with his client to pay the RLWT amount to the Commissioner immediately. Example Scott is a solicitor who only occasionally handles RLWT transactions and prefers not to hold onto the retained funds. Scott retains RLWT from a residential land purchase amount on 1 August. He is not required to pay this amount to the Commissioner until 20 September, but chooses to pay the RLWT amount to the Commissioner the following week. Tax credit for RLWT paid Section LA 6 has been amended and section LB 6B inserted to provide that a person has a tax credit for a tax year equal to the amount of RLWT paid in relation to residential land they have disposed of. There is the possibility that a person’s tax liability in relation to the disposal of residential land arises in one tax year, but the RLWT is not collected until the following tax year due to the timing of a property settlement. Section LB 6B provides that the RLWT tax credit arises in the income year in which they dispose of the relevant residential land to ensure that it can be credited against the person’s income tax liability in the appropriate year. 8 The vendor is eligible for an RLWT credit for the amount retained or withheld by the RLWT agent. In some cases, this might not be the same as what is paid by the paying agent to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may need to investigate whether the full amount claimed was actually retained, in order to retain the integrity of the RLWT rules and to prevent fraudulent claims from being processed. Under existing law, the Commissioner is able to provide appropriate relief to the vendor, if satisfied that the paying agent has retained more than what was paid to the Commissioner and there is no underlying mischief. This addresses concerns surrounding the lack of visibility as to the true underlying relationship between the vendor and paying agent, combined with the fact that the paying agent is not automatically jointly and severally liable for the full RLWT debt. Example Bernard is an offshore RLWT person who has recently sold his house and has had $15,000 of RLWT retained from the settlement funds by his paying agent. Inland Revenue has received $10,000 that is allocated to Bernard’s IRD number. In his income tax return, Bernard declares in his tax return that his RLWT credit is $15,000. Following further investigation, the Commissioner is satisfied that there is no mischief on Bernard’s behalf and that the paying agent did retain $15,000. The Commissioner takes action against the paying agent and recovers the remaining $5,000 and provides Bernard the full RLWT credit of $15,000. It is expected that a credit under section LB 6B will be used primarily to offset the person’s income tax liability from the disposal of residential property. Section LA 6 provides that the RLWT credit can be used to satisfy the person’s other income tax liabilities, to the extent that the amount of RLWT paid exceeds their income tax liability, in relat ion to the disposal o f the resident ial property. The excess RLWT may be refunded if the person has no other income tax liabilities. Example Patrick is an offshore RLWT person who sold his residential property, and $40,000 of RLWT was withheld from the settlement amount. Patrick’s income tax liability in relation to the disposal is only $35,000. Patrick has no other tax liabilities. Inland Revenue issues a refund to Patrick of $5,000. A person can lodge an interim claim before the end of an income year, returning their taxable income arising from land, to obtain a refund of excess RLWT. However, as this is merely an interim claim, it is not considered to be final, and the person will still need to lodge an income tax return at the end of the income year. RLWT generally needs to be received by the Commissioner before a refund is issued as part of an interim claim, to prevent fraudulent claims from arising. Interim claims are provided for in new section RL 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and new section 54D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Further detail on interim claims can be found in the section titled “Interim claims”. 9 RLWT must be paid before other disbursements RLWT must be paid before other disbursements, such as mortgages, are made as part of the settlement process. This is so RLWT cannot be circumvented by gearing up before disposal of the residential property or making a number of disbursements at the time of settlement, when RLWT must also be paid. Normally this is not a problem because withholding taxes are generally paid by the payer of an amount at the first possible opportunity. For example, in other jurisdictions wit h an equivalent regime to RLWT, the withholding tax must be paid by the purchaser before the settlement funds are passed to the vendor or the vendor’s agent. This means the wit hho lding tax is paid before any other disbursements are made. Sometimes, the payment of RLWT before other disbursements may leave insufficient funds for the vendor’s mortgage obligation to be discharged. New section RL 4(6) provides that in limited circumstances, the amount of RLWT payable is reduced to the extent required to discharge a mortgage obligation held with a New Zealand- registered bank or non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. However, this is restricted to instances where the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor is the RLWT agent. If the RLWT agent is the purchaser’s conveyancer or solicitor, or is the purchaser themselves, this reduction for a New Zealand mortgage is not available. Section RL 4(6) also provides that when necessary, the amount of RLWT is reduced to take account of the vendor’s outstanding local authority rates at the time of the disposal. Further information can be found in the sections titled “Calculating RLWT” and “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)”. If there are other charges that are being cleared as part of the settlement process, for example, unpaid body corporate levies or a loan held with a party that is not a licensed security ho lder, the paying agent has a number of possible courses of action if there are insufficient funds for RLWT to be paid – for example, they may require the vendor to pay the additional funds to ensure those payments can be made. While a paying agent is not liable for the underlying amount they did not withhold, they may be subject to shortfall penalties depending on their level of culpability. For further information on civil and criminal penalties, refer to the section titled “When RLWT obligations not met”. Officials will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that this provision is not used to undermine the integrity of the new RLWT rules and the broader tax system. Non-fulfilment of RLWT obligations This is discussed in the section titled “When RLWT obligations not met”, but generally the standard penalties that apply to other withholding taxes apply in the context of RLWT, including late filing penalties. In addition, an amendment has been made to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the Commissioner to report repeated or deliberate instances of non-compliance to an RLWT agent’s professional body. 10 When RLWT applies RLWT applies to disposals of residential land, where a “residential land purchase amount” is paid or payable on or after 1 July 2016. In mo st standard cases, the payment of a residential land purchase amount occurs upon settlement where the bulk of the purchase price is paid by the purchaser. A discussion on the meaning of “residential land purchase amount” can be found in the section titled “New tax type: Residential land withholding tax”. RLWT applies to a disposal when all three fo llowing conditions are met: • the land being disposed of must be residential land located in New Zealand; • the vendor is within the two-year period for the bright-line period for the land, where the vendor originally acquires the land on or after 1 October 2015; and • the vendor is an offshore RLWT person. RLWT does not apply to residential land acquired before 1 October 2015. Residential land in New Zealand New section RL 1(2) provides that RLWT only applies to residential land located in New Zealand. This restriction is necessary, otherwise RLWT could apply to disposals of property situated overseas where the transaction has no link to New Zealand. The meaning of “residential land” follows the definition used for the bright-line test, and is: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling; • bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the rules in the relevant operative district plan; • but does not include land that is farmland or used predominantly as business premises. Further information on the meaning of “residential land”, including examples, is available in Inland Revenue’s February 2016 Tax Information Bulletin on the bright-line test legislat io n (Vol 28, No 1). Within two-year bright-line period New section RL 1(2)(a) provides that, in addition to being residential land located in New Zealand, the vendor must be within the two-year bright-line period for the property being disposed of. More specifically, new section RL 1(2)(a) requires the residential land purchase amount from the disposal to be income of the vendor under section CB 6A, or it would be income of the vendor but for the main home exclusion in section CB 16A or the application of another land taxing provision in section CB 6A(6). This means that the land needs to be acquired on or after 1 October 2015 and the person’s bright-line date for that land is within two years of acquisition. Land acquired before 1 October 2015 is not subject to the bright-line test or RLWT. 11 Further information on how to calculate the two-year bright-line period is provided in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the bright-line test legislat ion (Vo l 28, No 1), but in most cases the bright-line period begins on the date the person’s title to the residential land is registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952, and ends on the date that the person enters into the agreement for the disposal of the residential land. If the end date (or “bright-line date”) is within two years of the start date, the requirement in section RL 1(2)(a) is met. A summary of the start and end dates to calculate the bright-line period for most types of property transactions is shown below: Start date End date (“bright-line date”) • the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 • the date of entry into a contract to purchase, for sales “off the plan” • the date of acquisition of the land according to ordinary rules , if an instrument to transfer the land to the person is not registered on or before the bright-line date. • the date that the person enters into an agreement for the disposal • the date on which the person makes a gift of the residential land • the date on which the person’s residential land is compulsorily acquired under any Act by the Crown, a local authority, or a public authority • if there is a mortgage secured on the residential land, the date on which the land is disposed of by or for the mortgagee as a result of the mortgagor’s defaulting • or if none of the above apply, the date on which the estate or interest in the residential land is disposed of. If the residential land being disposed of was subdivided, the start date is when the title to the undivided land was registered. Further detail on subdivisions and other types of property transactions can be found in the Tax Information Bulletin item for the bright-line test (Vol 28, No 1). The vendor is required to provide information under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to the RLWT agent detailing whether the disposal is subject to RLWT. Further detail on what the vendor is required to provide can be found in the section titled “Information requirements”. To confirm that the information provided by the vendor is correct, the RLWT agent can obtain the title registration date from Land Information New Zealand’s Landonline system, which is available to conveyancers and solicitors. In most circumstances, the RLWT agent should be able to obtain the “bright-line date” from the agreement for sale and purchase for the vendor’s disposal. In a standard scenario when a prospective purchaser makes an offer on a house, but the offer is conditional on the purchaser obtaining satisfactory financing and/or a builder’s report, the vendor’s bright-line date is the date on which they accept the purchaser’s conditional offer, not when the agreement goes unconditional. If the terms of the agreement are amended as a result of these conditions, the end of the bright-line period is still the date on which the vendor entered into the agreement to dispose of the property. 12 Example Florence is selling her house. Ash is a prospective buyer and makes an offer on Florence’s house on 18 April. The agreement is conditional on Ash obtaining financing within five working days of Florence’s acceptance of Ash’s offer. Florence accepts Ash’s conditional offer and signs the agreement on 19 April. Ash obtains suitable financing on 22 April and the agreement goes unconditional that day. Florence’s bright-line date is 19 April because this is the date that Florence enters into the agreement to dispose of the house. If the vendor’s bright-line date for the residential land is within two years, but the vendor is not taxed under section CB 6A because another land taxing provision applies, RLWT still applies. This is because the vendor has an income tax liability in relation to the disposal and the purpose of the RLWT is to act as a collection mechanism for income tax. The vendor should not be able to avoid RLWT merely because another taxing provision applies to the transaction. There are implicit exemptions from RLWT or rollover relief for inherited property and for transfers of relationship property, which are provided for in the bright-line test. This is achieved through section RL 1(2)(a) which refers to an amount that is income, or would be income but for the main ho me exclusio n or another land taxing provision. During a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the parties hold any property according to the conventional laws relating to property. As a result, the parties are free to deal with their property during the relationship without regard to the provisions of the Property (Relat ionships) Act 1976. When a relationship breaks down, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may be invoked by a court order or an agreement between the parties. When this statutory regime is invoked, new property rights operate from the date of the court order or agreement. The property of the spouses or partners is reapportioned between them under principles from this statutory regime. Rollover relief generally means that when part or all of a specific property is transferred from one party to another under a relationship property agreement, the transferee takes on the cost base of the transferor – that is, they are treated as having acquired their recently acquired portion at the same time for the same cost as when the transferor originally acquired the property. Through section FB 3A, this means there should be no RLWT to pay in relation to the transfer from one party to the relationship property agreement to the other. This is because the transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of transfer. However, depending on the circumstances, there may be a requirement to account for RLWT, even though the amount of RLWT calculated is nil. If the transferee subsequently disposes of the residential land within two years from when the transferor originally acquired it, that sale is within the scope of the bright-line test and RLWT. Offshore RLWT persons New section RL 1(2) sets out the criteria for the RLWT rules to apply. In addition to the land being New Zealand residential land and being disposed of within the two-year bright-line period, the vendor must be an “offshore RLWT person” for RLWT to apply. “Offshore RLWT person” is defined in section YA 1 and covers both individuals and non-individuals, such as companies or trusts. 13 The vendor must provide a statement under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that they are/are not an offshore RLWT person in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. At the time of writing, the IR1101 is the form required to be filled in by the vendor under section 54C. The person who fills in the form will be subject to criminal penalties if they knowingly provide false information, as it is information provided in relation to a tax law. Certain accompanying documents are also required. New section RL 2(7) provides that a paying agent is able to “reasonably rely” on the information in the completed IR1101 form and the accompanying documents provided under section 54C. This “reasonable reliance” test enables paying agents to rely on the information provided to them by vendors, unless they know the information to be false or they suspect it to be false (for example, if the passport appears to be fraudulent). This reasonable reliance test does not extend to RLWT agents who are withholding agents under section RL 3. Section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the vendor must provide this information to the RLWT agent before a residential land purchase amount is made. If the IR1101 form has not been provided by the vendor, the RLWT agent may assume the vendor is an offshore RLWT person and therefore withhold RLWT if the other requirements for withholding have been met (New Zealand residential land being disposed of within the two- year bright-line period). An exception to this would be when the RLWT agent has reasonable grounds for establishing that the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person – for example, a lo ng-standing client relationship such that the RLWT agent knows the vendor not to be an offshore RLWT person. Further information on the information that must be provided as part of the section 54C requirements and what constitutes “reasonable reliance” can be found in the section titled “Informat ion requirements”. Natural persons Subsection (a) of the definition of “offshore RLWT person” in section YA 1 sets out when a natural person is an offshore RLWT person. It is the same as the definition of “offshore person” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 as introduced by the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 for the land information requirements. The definit io n is used to determine who must have a New Zealand bank account (or have had customer due diligence identity verification carried out by a reporting entity) when applying for an IRD number, and who must provide their IRD number when buying or selling residential property. An individual is an offshore RLWT person if they are not a New Zealand citizen and do not hold a New Zealand residence class visa as defined in the Immigration Act 2009. A residence class visa is a resident visa or a permanent resident visa. Student visas and work visas, for example, are not residence class visas. Example Mary is an investor in residential property. She sells a piece of residential land located in Auckland to Jim. Mary is in New Zealand at the time of the sale, but she is not a New Zealand citizen and does not hold a residence class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009. Mary is an “offshore RLWT person”. 14 A New Zealand citizen is nevertheless an offshore RLWT person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last three years. A single day (or part- day) of presence in New Zealand during the past three years is enough for a New Zealand cit izen not to be an offshore RLWT person. A ho lder of a New Zealand residence class visa is an offshore RLWT person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. Again, a single or part-day of presence in New Zealand within the past 12 months is enough to satisfy the physical presence test. Example Tane is a New Zealand citizen and is relocated overseas with his job. Eighteen months after moving overseas, he sells his residential property. Tane has not been back in New Zealand since relocating. Tane is not an offshore RLWT person at the time of the sale. Generally, Australian citizens and permanent residents are granted a resident visa on arrival in New Zealand under the Immigration Act 2009 and subsequent regulations, but this visa expires when the individual leaves New Zealand. If they subsequently re-enter New Zealand, they are issued a new resident visa. This means that if an Australian citizen or an Australian permanent resident is physically present in New Zealand at the time of the sale, they are not an offshore RLWT person. However, they may be an offshore RLWT person if they are outside New Zealand at the time of the sale and have not applied for a New Zealand permanent resident visa or New Zealand citizenship. In most cases it is likely that the reasonable reliance test can be satisfied when a New Zealand citizen or holder of a residence class visa who is selling their property within two years meets with the paying agent in person and shows them their passport. The conveyancing agent should take a copy of the documentation and record that they have seen the person in New Zealand. As the vendor is currently in New Zealand, this means they are not an offshore RLWT person. If an individual is selling their property from outside New Zealand, they are required to provide suitable proof to the RLWT agent that they are not an offshore RLWT person. This could include a certified statement and copy of their New Zealand passport or residence class visa, as well as evidence of flights to New Zealand within the relevant timeframe. This enables the paying agent to “reasonably rely” on their statement that they are not an offshore RLWT person. Partnerships and other joint or co-ownership situations For partnerships and other cases where the vendors hold the property jointly (for example, as tenants in common or as part of a joint tenancy) the offshore status of each partner or co- owner is considered individually and then RLWT applies to the offshore RLWT person’s share in the property. This is provided for in section RL 1(3). In this case, each partner or co- owner is required to provide information in a separate IR1101 form under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 15 In the case of a partnership, RLWT applies according to the income interests held by offshore RLWT persons. To enable the RLWT agent to do this, the partners must provide the RLWT agent with a copy of the partnership agreement or a statement regarding their income interests in the partnership. Knowingly providing incorrect information is a criminal offence. For other co-ownership situations, the RLWT agent can assume that the property is equally divided between co-owners, unless evidence to the contrary is provided. This is a different approach to that proposed in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill at the time of introduction. It was then proposed that an offshore partner or co-owner would taint the transaction, and RLWT would subsequently apply to the whole transaction. Example Rebecca is a New Zealand citizen and Sebastian is a holder of a residence class visa. They are both physically present in New Zealand when they purchase a New Zealand residential property and hold the property as joint tenants. For the purposes of RLWT, their respective shares are 50 percent each, even though as joint tenants they have the equal, undivided shares in the property. Rebecca and Sebastian go travelling immediately after purchasing the property. After 15 months, they decide to sell the property and neither of them has been back in New Zealand since they purchased the property. Sebastian is an offshore RLWT person, but Rebecca is not. The property is sold for $500,000, so Sebastian’s share is $250,000. The RLWT agent calculates RLWT in relation to Sebastian’s $250,000 share and, in returning the retained RLWT to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, allocates it to Sebastian’s IRD number. Companies and limited partnerships This allocation rule does not apply for limited partnerships or look-through companies for example, which are corporate entit ies. Part (c) of the definition of “offshore RLWT persons” deals with legally corporate entities and covers both limited partnerships and look-through companies. A non-natural person is an offshore RLWT person if any of the following conditions are met: • it is incorporated outside New Zealand; • it is registered outside New Zealand; • it is const ituted under foreign law; • it is a co mpany and more than 25 percent of the company’s directors are offshore RLWT persons or more than 25 percent of the shareholder decision-making rights are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons; • it is a partner in a limited partnership and more than 25 percent of the general partners are offshore RLWT persons or more than 25 percent of the partnership’s shares are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons; or • it is an owner of an effective look-through interest in a look-through company and more than 25 percent of the look-through company’s effective look-through interests are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons. 16 A company (including a unit trust) is not an offshore RLWT person when all of the following conditions are met: • the company is incorporated in New Zealand and not registered overseas; and • no more than 25 percent of the directors of the company are offshore RLWT persons; and • no more than 25 percent of the shareholder decision-making rights of the company are held by offshore RLWT persons. A limited partnership is not an offshore RLWT person when all of the following conditions are met: • the limited partnership is incorporated in New Zealand and not registered overseas; and • no more than 25 percent of the general partners are offshore RLWT persons; and • no more than 25 percent of the shares (voting interest or income interest) in the partnership are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons. Trusts Subsection (b) of the definition of “offshore RLWT person” in section YA 1 sets out when a trustee of a trust is an offshore RLWT person. A person that is a trustee of a trust is an offshore RLWT person for the purposes of the RLWT rules if any of the following conditions are met: • more than 25 percent of the trustees of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; • more than 25 percent of the people that have the power to appoint or remove a trustee of a trust, or to amend the trust deed, are offshore RLWT persons; • all natural person beneficiaries (including discretionary beneficiaries) of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; • all beneficiaries (including discretionary beneficiaries) of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; • a beneficiary (including a discretionary beneficiary) that is not a natural person and is an offshore RLWT person has received a distribution from the trust within the last four years of a relevant disposal of residential land; • a natural person beneficiary (including a discretionary beneficiary) that is an offshore RLWT person has received distributions from the trust of more than $5,000 in any one year of the past four years prior to the relevant disposal of residential land; and • a beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary of the trust is an offshore RLWT person and the trust has disposed of residential land within four years before the current disposal. A 25 percent control test applies to trustees and persons with the power to appoint/remove trustees or amend the trust deed (set out in subsection (b)(i) and (ii) of the definition of offshore RLWT person). If the 25 percent threshold has not been breached, the trust may nevertheless be an offshore RLWT person depending on the status of the beneficiaries. 17 Generally, it is expected that the settlors of a trust would have the power to appoint/remove trustees or amend the trust deed. Looking at the offshore status of people with this power prevents the situation where a trust, with an offshore settlor and resident trustees, sell the property (without being subject to a withholding tax), with the settlor then replacing resident trustees with trustees who are offshore persons and beyond the reach of Inland Revenue. This requirement is consistent with the settlor focus for trusts in New Zealand’s income tax rules. In addition, the trustees of a discretionary trust have the ability to shift the tax liability to one of the beneficiaries by distributing the income to the beneficiary and treating it as beneficiary income. To ensure that the gain does not escape tax by being transferred to an offshore beneficiary, a trust can be an offshore RLWT person if a beneficiary is an offshore RLWT person and they have received certain distributions. Note that there is no percentage test in relation to beneficiaries, even though there is a 25 percent control test in relation to trustees and settlors. The first limbs of the test for beneficiaries (subsections (b)(iii) and (iv)) are relatively narrow in that all natural person beneficiaries (including discretionary beneficiaries) or all beneficiaries of the trust must themselves be offshore RLWT persons. The intention was that trusts that own the family home should not be an offshore RLWT person solely because some of the beneficiaries were offshore (for example, adult children working overseas), but it should not be possible to set up a trust in which all beneficiaries are foreign investors who are natural persons, with a New Zealand charity appointed as a discretionary beneficiary simply to avoid being classed as an offshore RLWT person. Example Matilda and Madeline are natural persons who are also offshore RLWT persons. They are the only natural person beneficiaries of a trust. A New Zealand charity is appointed as a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The settlor and trustees of the trust are not offshore RLWT persons. The trustees are treated as offshore RLWT persons for the purposes of the RLWT rules, because all natural person beneficiaries of the trust (Matilda and Madeline) are offshore RLWT persons. The remaining limbs of the test for beneficiaries (subsections (b)(v) and (vi)) address concerns about possible misuse of trusts in order to evade payment of RLWT, and therefore deal with distributions made to beneficiaries who are offshore RLWT persons, and situations when the trust has already recently disposed of residential land. A trust is not an offshore RLWT person if a natural person beneficiary (discretionary or otherwise) who is an offshore RLWT person receives $5,000 or less in distributions from the trust in each of the four years before the current disposal of residential land. However, the trust is an offshore RLWT person if that beneficiary has received more than $5,000 of distributions from the trust in any of the four years before the current disposal of residential land. There is no minimum threshold in the case of non-natural person beneficiaries, so that if a non-natural person beneficiary (discretionary or otherwise) who is an offshore RLWT person has received any distributions from the trust during the four years before the current disposal of residential land, the trust would constitute an offshore RLWT person. 18 This means that a small annual distribution of dividends paid to a beneficiary of a family trust, for example, does not result in the trust becoming an offshore RLWT person, but a distribut ion to a beneficiary that is a company and an offshore RLWT person does. Example Debbie and Greg are the settlors and trustees of a family trust. They are both New Zealand citizens and live in New Zealand. Dan and Natalie are discretionary beneficiaries of the trust and are also New Zealand citizens. Dan lives in New Zealand, but Natalie has lived in Australia for the past five years and has not been back to New Zealand. The trust property consists of the family home in New Zealand as well as some shares and money held in a savings account. Each year, Dan and Natalie receive around $1,000 each in distributions from the trust. Debbie and Greg as trustees of the trust are not offshore RLWT persons, because they themselves are not offshore RLWT persons and, of the two beneficiaries, only Natalie is an offshore RLWT person, but she has not received more than $5,000 in distributions from the trust in any of the previous four years. It is not necessary to determine whether the offshore beneficiary (discretionary or otherwise) was an offshore RLWT person at the time of each distribution. The test looks at whether a beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary who is currently an offshore RLWT person has received a distribution from the trust within the past four years of the relevant disposal of residential land. In the case of natural persons, the test looks at whether a natural person beneficiary or natural person discretionary beneficiary who is currently an offshore RLWT person has received $5,000 or more from the trust in any one year during the past four years. A trust is also an offshore RLWT person, if any of the beneficiaries (discretionary or otherwise) are offshore RLWT persons and the trust has disposed of residential land within four years of the current disposal. While the offshore RLWT person definition should not capture family trusts where a beneficiary is an offshore RLWT person and the family’s main home is being sold, if the trust has a history of buying and selling residential land and there is an offshore beneficiary, the trust is classified as an offshore RLWT person for integrity reasons. Corporate trustees must satisfy both the trust and company criteria if they are not to be considered an offshore RLWT person. It is important to note that the non-natural person component of the definition of offshore RLWT person differs from the definit io n of “offshore person” introduced in the land information requirements. The definit ion of offshore person as it relates to non-natural persons follows that used for “overseas person” in section 7(2)(b) to (f) of the Overseas Investment Act 2005. The main differences between the RLWT definition and the land information requirement definit ion for companies, limited partnerships, partnerships and trusts are outlined in the following table. 19 “Offshore RLWT person” – RLWT purposes “Offshore person” – land information requirements It is a body corporate (such as a company) and: • it is incorporated outside New Zealand; • it is registered outside New Zealand or constituted under foreign law; • it is a company and: – more than 25 percent of the company’s directors are offshore RLWT persons; or – more than 25 percent of the shareholder decision- making rights are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons • it is a partner in a limited partnership and: – more than 25 percent of the general partners are offshore RLWT persons; or – more than 25 percent of the partnership’s shares are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons; or • it is an owner of an effective look-through interest in a look-through company and more than 25 percent of the look-through company’s effective look-through interests are held directly or indirectly by offshore RLWT persons. It is a body corporate (such as a company) and: • it is incorporated outside New Zealand; or • 25 percent or more of its shares are owned by a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand; or • an offshore person has (or offshore persons have): – 25 percent or more of any class of securities; – the power to control the composition of 25 percent or more of its governing body; or – the right to exercise or control 25 percent or more of the voting power. The offshore status of each partner is considered individually and RLWT calculated according to the income interests held by offshore RLWT persons. It is a partnership or other unincorporated body of persons (other than a trust) and: • 25 percent or more of its partners or members are offshore persons; or • an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the profits or assets (including on winding up); or • an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) the right to exercise or control the exercise of 25 percent or more of the voting power at a meeting. A person that is a trustee of a trust, if: • more than 25 percent of the trustees of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; or • more than 25 percent of the people that have the power to appoint or remove a trustee of a trust, or to amend the trust deed, are offshore RLWT persons; or • all natural person beneficiaries (including discretionary beneficiaries) of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; or • all beneficiaries (including discretionary beneficiaries) of the trust are offshore RLWT persons; or • a beneficiary (including a discretionary beneficiary) that is not a natural person and is an offshore RLWT person has received a distribution from the trust within the last four years of a relevant disposal of residential land; or • a natural person beneficiary (including a discretionary beneficiary) that is an offshore RLWT person has received distributions from the trust of more than $5,000 in any one year of the past four years prior to the relevant disposal of residential land; or • a beneficiary or discretionary beneficiary of the trust is an offshore RLWT person and the trust has disposed of residential land within four years before the current disposal. It is a trust and an offshore person (or offshore persons): • constitute 25 percent or more of its governing body; or • has or have a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the trust property; or • are 25 percent or more of those that have the right to amend or control the amendment of the trust deed; or • are 25 percent or more of those having the right to control the composition of the trust's governing body. 20 Exemption certificates Section RL 1(4) provides that the RLWT rules in subpart RL do not apply if the vendor holds an RLWT exemption certificate that applies for the disposal of the relevant residential land. Certificates of exemption for RLWT purposes can be issued if certain requirements are met, in the following circumstances: • the person is disposing of their main home; or • the person disposing of the residential land is in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots or erecting buildings. The introduction of this exemption certificate facility was in response to submissions made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, and is available for offshore RLWT persons selling their main home, or offshore RLWT persons who are in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots or erecting buildings. The interim claim process was originally designed in lieu of a certificate of exemption facility to mitigate cashflow problems for people whose tax liability is likely to be lower than the amount of RLWT withheld. As a certificate of exemption needs to be issued before the sale of property and this involves an assessment by Inland Revenue of whether the person satisfies the criteria for a certificate of exemption, there may be potential for some sales to be delayed if the vendor needs to wait for the certificate to be issued. It was for this reason that the interim claim process was initially considered, overall, to be more appropriate. However, the issue of housing supply is an important one, and it was considered that RLWT should not further inhibit housing development, but the certificate of exemption should only be provided in bona fide cases when it was the vendor’s main home or when the taxpayer is increasing housing supply, not simply renovating or speculating. It was not considered appropriate to directly provide for the main ho me exclusio n under the bright-line test (in section CB 16A) in the RLWT rules because whether the residential land was the vendor’s main home may not be readily ascertainable by the RLWT agent. In addition, it is unlikely that the property being disposed of was the vendor’s main home, as RLWT only applies to offshore RLWT persons. Section 54E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the circumstances in which the Commissioner may issue RLWT exemption certificates. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer is eligible for a certificate of exemption, then section 54E(5) provides that one must be issued. Section 54E(1) requires the taxpayer to apply for a certificate of exemption using the for m prescribed by the Commissioner and to provide certified copies of relevant and appropriate documents as prescribed by the Commissioner. At the time of writing, the RLWT exemption certificate application form is the IR1103. The interim claim process is available for taxpayers who do not meet the requirements for, or have not been issued with, an RLWT exemption certificate. For further information on the interim claim process, see the section titled “Interim claims”. 21 For a vendor disposing of their main home section 54E(4) provides that they must meet the requirements of section CB 16A of the Income Tax Act 2007, which provides the main home exclusio n from the bright-line test. Whether the residential land was the vendor’s main home for the period during which the vendor owned the property depends on the facts and circumstances, and appropriate evidence must be provided to the Commissioner so that she can make that determination. Further information about the main ho me exclusio n in the bright-line test can be found in the Tax Information Bulletin on the bright-line legislation (Vo l 28, No 1). An exemption certificate issued under section 54E(4) is only issued in relation to a particular disposal, rather than on an enduring basis. Section 54E(2) and (3) provide that persons in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots or erecting buildings may apply for an RLWT exemption certificate. Evidence that they are in the business of one of these activities is required, and the nature of such evidence will be set out in further operational guidance. The terms “developing land”, “dividing land into lots”, and “erecting buildings” are already used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and have established meanings. It is important that RLWT exemption certificates are issued only to those who are increasing housing supply, not simply renovating or speculating. Persons in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots or erecting buildings must also meet one of two addit ional criteria – they must have had tax obligations in New Zealand and have complied with all of them for the two years before they apply for an RLWT exemption certificate or they must provide a security that is acceptable to the Commissioner. Section 54E(3)(b) and (c) provides that the person applying for the RLWT exemption certificate in relation to residential land must have had tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts before applying for the exemption certificate, and must have complied with all tax obligations for the two-year period before they apply for the certificate. The term “Inland Revenue Acts” encompass a number of different Acts and these are listed in the Schedule of the Tax Administration Act 1994. At the time of writing they are: • Child Support Act 1991 • Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 • Estate Duty Abolition Act 1993 • Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999 • Gaming Duties Act 1971 • Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 • Income Tax Act 1994 • Income Tax Act 2004 • Income Tax Act 2007 • KiwiSaver Act 2006 • Land Tax Abolition Act 1990 • Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 • Stamp Duty Abolition Act 1999 • Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 • Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 • Tax Administration Act 1994 • Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. 22 In addition, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the person will continue to comply with their tax obligations. This provision is intended to cover established developers in the New Zealand housing market who have good tax compliance histories but happen to be offshore RLWT persons. When a person disposing of residential land has not complied with all tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts over the previous two years, or has not been operating in New Zealand long enough to have the requisite compliance history, they can still apply for an RLWT exemption certificate if they provide security to the Commissioner to secure their income tax obligations in relation to the residential land. The intention is to avoid creating a barrier to entry for new developers in the New Zealand housing market, while also protecting the integrity of the tax system. Section 54E(2)(b) provides that the security must be provided in accordance with section 7A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and must be acceptable to the Commissioner to secure the performance of their income tax obligations in relation to the residential land. It was envisaged that bank bonds would be the most common type of security, but further operational guidance will be provided by Inland Revenue in relation to the type of securities that are acceptable for an RLWT exemption certificate. While the wording in section 54E relates to a specific piece of residential land, it is envisaged that a person could include a schedule of different pieces of residential land that they intend to dispose of when they prepare their application under section 54E. This means the certificate of exempt ion will apply to mult iple resident ial land tit les. Example Alistair is an offshore RLWT person who has been in the business of developing residential land in New Zealand for ten years. Alistair has complied with all of his tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts since he started developing land in New Zealand, including the past two years. Alistair acquired a piece of residential land which he has subdivided into ten lots, and is in the process of developing. Alistair thinks that he will be ready to sell the ten properties within the two-year bright-line period, so prepares his application for an RLWT exemption certificate. He includes a schedule listing all ten properties to be sold as part of his application and appropriate evidence that he is in the business of developing residential land. The Commissioner is satisfied that Alistair is in the business of developing land, has complied with his tax obligations over the past two years, and will continue to comply in the future. Alistair is granted an RLWT exemption certificate in respect of all ten properties. Note that when a vendor has an exemption certificate for RLWT purposes and the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period, they are still required to provide information to the RLWT agent under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is because section 54C stands alone from the RLWT rules in subpart RL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Further detail on the requirements under section 54C can be found in the section titled “Information requirements”. 23 Person required to pay RLWT (the RLWT agent) As noted in the section titled “New tax type: Residential land withholding tax”, RLWT is generally not a true withholding tax in the sense that in most cases, the person required to pay RLWT is not liable for the underlying amount of RLWT if they did not retain the RLWT from the residential land purchase amount. Section RL 2 introduces the concept of “a paying agent” to account for this situation. Section RL 3 provides that when the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, RLWT is a true withholding tax and the “withholding agent” is the purchaser. What it means to be a paying agent or withholding agent is discussed in the section titled “New tax type: residential land withholding tax” and when the treatment between the two does not differ, the term “RLWT agent” is used. Under section RL 2, the vendor is liable to pay an amount of RLWT, but the vendor’s conveyancer is treated as the vendor’s agent in relation to RLWT and must provide returns and satisfy the vendor’s liability. That is, the vendor’s conveyancer is the “paying agent” for RLWT purposes. “Conveyancer” is a defined term in section YA 1 for the purposes of the RLWT rules. It refers to the lawyer, incorporated law firm, conveyancing practitioner or incorporated conveyancing firm that provides conveyancing services (as that term is used in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) to the vendor or purchaser using a New Zealand-based trust account. It is intended that only those who are able to describe themselves in New Zealand as lawyers, incorporated law firms, conveyancing practitioners or incorporated conveyancing firms under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 should be paying agents for RLWT. This is because the paying agent is not jointly and severally liable for the RLWT debt and the compliance tools available to the Commissioner include the ability to report the RLWT agent to the appropriate professional body. It is expected that the professional body would take appropriate action in relation to the agent’s non-compliance. If the vendor does not have a conveyancer, the purchaser’s conveyancer is the paying agent. This is provided for in section RL 2(2). If neither the vendor nor purchaser has a conveyancer, the purchaser is the paying agent. This is provided for by reading part (b) of the definition of conveyancer into section RL 2(2). Associated persons Under new section RL 3, if the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the vendor is not liable to pay RLWT. Instead, the purchaser must withhold the requisite amount of RLWT and pay this to the Commissioner. In this case, the purchaser has a withholding tax obligation under section BE 1 and the standard requirements for other withholding taxes apply. 24 The purchaser is not precluded from using the services of a conveyancer or lawyer to fulfil their RLWT obligat ions. However, this would be a contractual relationship between the purchaser and conveyancer that is not specifically provided for in legislation. Paying agent is not the vendor’s agent for other purposes While the paying agent is considered to be the vendor’s agent for the purposes of RLWT, new section RL 2(3) ensures that the paying agent is not considered to be the vendor’s agent more generally, just because of their role as the RLWT agent. For example, the paying agent is not treated as the vendor’s agent for income tax purposes. New section RL 2(4) ensures that a paying agent who is only the vendor’s agent in relation to RLWT is not subject to sections HD 2 to 4, which relate to agents. No liability for underlying RLWT New section RL 2(5) provides that a paying agent is not jointly and severally liable in relation to the vendor’s RLWT debt, despite their obligation to satisfy the vendor’s RLWT liability. They may, however, be liable for the RLWT debt, if they have retained the RLWT amount from a residential land payment amount and have failed to pay the retained RLWT to the Commissioner. New section RL 2(6) provides that the rules relating to penalties as set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply. Further detail can be found in the section titled “When RLWT obligations not met”. Cost recovery by paying agent While it is not specified in legislation, an RLWT agent is not precluded on a contractual basis from recovering the costs incurred in satisfying the vendor’s RLWT obligations. Calculating RLWT Calculation steps There are three calculation steps for RLWT, with the amount of RLWT payable being the lowest amount calculated. The third calculation step includes a deduction for a mortgage with a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker. This part of the third calculation step is only available when the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor is the paying agent. New section RL 4 provides that the amount of RLWT to be paid is the lowest of the following three calculations: • 33% (or 28% if the vendor is a company that is not acting as a trustee) x (current purchase price – vendor’s acquisition cost) (set out in section RL 4(2)); and • 10% x current purchase price (set out in section RL 4(4)); and • current purchase price – security discharge amount – outstanding local authority rates (set out in section RL 4(6)). 25 New section RL 4(3)(b) defines “current purchase price” as the total price agreed by the vendor and purchaser for the disposal of the residential land that the residential land purchase amount relates to. This figure therefore includes deposits and part-payments. New section RL 4(3)(c) defines the “vendor’s acquisition cost” as being the purchase price paid by the vendor for their acquisition of the residential land being disposed of. It is expected that the vendor’s acquisition cost is generally available from Quotable Value and the paying agent should be able to reasonably rely on this figure. If the vendor does not believe this is the correct acquisition price, they would need to provide the RLWT agent wit h sufficient evidence of a different acquisition price – for example, the original acquisition contract. The current purchase price should be found in the agreement for sale and purchase between the vendor and purchaser. If, upon settlement, the parties agree to reduce the agreed purchase price, then this reduced purchase price is the figure that should be used to calculate RLWT. This may occur, for example, if the vendor has failed to carry out repairs prior to settlement, and instead, the purchaser takes responsibility for the repairs. Example Virginia is an offshore RLWT person who agrees to sell her residential property in Tauranga to Thomas. Thomas pays a $100,000 deposit and another $400,000 upon settlement. In determining Virginia’s RLWT liability, the “current purchase price” is $500,000. Virginia originally acquired the residential property for $350,000. The “vendor’s acquisition cost” for the purposes of determining Virginia’s RLWT liability is $350,000. Virginia does not have a mortgage on the property and she has no outstanding rates. RLWT calculated using the formula in section RL 4(2) is 33% x ($500,000 – $350,000), or $49,500. RLWT calculated using the formula in section RL 4(4) is 10% x $500,000, or $50,000. Therefore the amount of RLWT payable is $49,500. The obligation to pay RLWT is not restricted to instances when consideration for the property is paid in cash. In-kind consideration may form part of the transaction and the situation will be monitored to ensure that RLWT obligations are not evaded or avoided through the use of non-cash consideration, as this could raise concerns under the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. RLWT should be calculated with respect to the total consideration for the residential land. While a paying agent is not liable for the underlying amount they did not withhold, they may be subject to shortfall penalties depending on their level of culpability. The section titled “When RLWT obligations not met” sets out the different types of penalties in further detail. An option to acquire land is included in the definition of “an interest in land” so this means the payment of an option fee is within the scope of RLWT. The prices used to calculate RLWT should be net of GST, if any. Whether GST has been levied in relation to a transaction is determined by the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 26 In some cases, the sale may be zero-rated for GST purposes if both the recipient and supplier are GST registered and the recipient is acquiring the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies and the land is not intended to be used as the principal place of residence of the recipient. In addition, there is a specific provision under the GST rules relating to instances where an agent and nominated purchasers have different GST registration statuses, whereby the zero-rating rules look through the agent to the nominated purchaser. Whether the transaction is zero-rated for GST purposes is a matter of fact as the recipient is required to provide written information to the supplier under the GST rules so the supplier can determine if GST should be zero-rated. For further information on the zero-rating of land supplies for GST purposes, see the Tax Information Bulletin item for the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 (Vol 23, No 1). To maintain the integrity of the RLWT and the broader tax system, RLWT generally needs to be paid before other disbursements that are made out of a residential land purchase amount. In most cases, this means the disbursements made at the time of settlement, which normally appear on the settlement statement. However, a real estate agent’s commission is normally paid out of the deposit, before the payment of a residential land purchase amount – this can continue to be paid before RLWT. The third calculation set out in section RL 4(6) recognises that there are certain bona fide situations when abso lute priority of RLWT could delay or prevent settlement fro m occurring. In particular, these would be the payment of certain New Zealand mortgages and the vendor’s portion of outstanding local authority rates. If the two calculations set out in section RL 4(2) and (4) would leave insufficient funds for the vendor to discharge their mortgage obligation with a New Zealand-registered bank or non- bank deposit taker and/or their outstanding local authority rates, the third calculation allows for RLWT to be reduced to the extent required to pay the mortgage and outstanding rates. “Security discharge amount” is defined in section RL 4(7) and (8) as the total amount required by a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker (as licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013) to discharge the mortgage or other security over the residential land being disposed of. A full list of registered banks and licensed non-bank deposit takers is published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The list of registered banks is available at http://rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/banks/register and the list of licensed non-bank deposit takers is available at http://rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and- supervision/non-bank-deposit-takers/register. Note that the mortgage reduction part of the third calculation step is only available when the paying agent is the vendor’s conveyancer or solicitor. The reduction of RLWT payable for mortgages held with a New Zealand registered bank or a New Zealand non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-Bank Deposit Takers Act 2013 was inserted in response to consultation on the original issues paper, and concerns that the payment of RLWT could prevent settlement from occurring in some cases. By limiting the provision to mortgages held with New Zealand registered banks and non-bank deposit takers, the Government is more readily able to identify and react to any abuse as it is better equipped to monitor the regulatory environment in which the bank or non-bank deposit taker is operating. The situation is being monitored to ensure that it is not used to undermine the integrity of the RLWT and the broader tax system. 27 If the vendor’s conveyancer is not the paying agent, the third calculation set out in section RL 4(6) effectively becomes “current purchase price – outstanding local authority rates”. The “outstanding local authority rates” component of the formula in section RL 4(6) is the amount of local authority rates in relation to the property that is still to be paid by the vendor for the period of ownership before the disposal. This is because under the Local Government Act 2002, unpaid rates amount to a charge on the land which has priority ahead of any mortgage. This reduction is available regardless of who the RLWT agent is. It is not appropriate to extend the provision to other mortgages or other disbursements, even those that would be tax deductible for the vendor. To do so could undermine the tax system and it would be difficult for conveyancers who are not tax specialists to determine what payments are tax deductible. If there are other charges that are being cleared as part of the settlement process – for example, unpaid body corporate levies or a loan held with a party that is not a licensed security holder, the RLWT agent has a number of possible courses of action if this leaves insufficient funds to pay the full amount of RLWT. For example, they may require the vendor to pay the additional funds to ensure those payments can be made. For further information on civil and criminal penalties, refer to the section titled “When RLWT obligations not met”. It is important to note that RLWT is simply on account of income tax and to the extent that RLWT has been over-withheld relative to the vendor’s final income tax liability, a refund is available from Inland Revenue. Example Consider the previous example of Virginia and Thomas. Recall that the RLWT calculated using the methods set out in section RL 4(2) and (4) will be $49,500 and $50,000. However, now Virginia has a mortgage with a New Zealand bank for $460,000. In addition, Virginia has outstanding rates of $360 owing to her local council. Since Virginia’s conveyancer is the paying agent, the third calculation method set out in section RL 4(6) is relevant for both the mortgage and the local authority rates. Using the third calculation method in section RL 4(6), the amount of RLWT calculated is $500,000 – $460,000 – $360, or $39,640. As this is less than $49,500 and $50,000, $39,640 is the amount of RLWT payable. As discussed in the section titled “When RLWT applies”, rollover relief is provided in the bright-line test under section FB 3A when there is a transfer of property from one spouse or partner to the other under a relationship property agreement following the breakdown of a relationship. The transferee generally takes on the cost base of the transferor – that is, they are considered to have acquired their recently acquired portion at the same time for the same cost as when the transferor originally acquired the property. This means that for the purposes of the RLWT rules, when there is a transfer of residential land on a settlement of relationship property, the “current purchase price” for the transferor (as the “vendor” in this situation) under section RL 4(3)(b) should be the same as the “vendor’s acquisition cost” in section RL 4(3)(c) and when the transferee eventually disposes of the property, the “vendor’s acquisition cost” is what the transferor acquired the property for. The result is that the calculated amount of RLWT for the transfer under the relationship property settlement is nil, but depending on the circumstances, the reporting requirements for RLWT may still apply. 28 Co-owners As discussed in the section titled “When RLWT applies”, where the vendors hold the property jointly (for example, as part of a partnership, as tenants in common, or as a joint tenancy), the offshore status of each partner or co-owner is considered individually and then RLWT applies to the offshore RLWT person’s share in the property. This is provided for in section RL 1(3). In the case of a partnership, RLWT applies according to the income interests held by offshore RLWT persons. To enable the RLWT agent to do this, the partners must provide the RLWT agent with a copy of the partnership agreement or a statement regarding their income interests in the partnership. The partners, in providing information about their income interests in the partnership, are providing information in relation to a tax law, so if they knowingly provide incorrect information, they will be subject to criminal penalties. For other co-ownership situations, the RLWT agent can assume that the property is equally divided between co-owners, unless evidence to the contrary is provided to the RLWT agent. The retained or withheld RLWT amount is then allocated by the RLWT agent to the appropriate offshore RLWT persons when the RLWT is passed on to the Commissioner. Further information on this can be found in the section titled “Information requirements”. Example Hannah and Jack own a residential property as joint tenants, which they are selling within two years of acquisition. Jack is an offshore RLWT person and Hannah is a New Zealand citizen who has been physically present in New Zealand within the past three years. For the purposes of RLWT, their respective shares in the property are 50 percent each. The RLWT agent calculates the RLWT applying to the whole transaction as $25,000. This means that only $12,500 (being 50 percent of $25,000) needs to be retained from the settlement funds to be paid to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The RLWT agent allocates the $12,500 to the IRD number provided by Jack. Part-payments A “residential land purchase amount” is defined in section YA 1 as an amount paid or payable for the disposal of the residential land in question, but excludes deposits and part-payments as long as all deposits and part-payments total in aggregate less than 50 percent of the purchase price for the land. It is intended that the RLWT obligation arises as soon as that 50 percent threshold has been met. In most situations this should arise upon settlement, when the bulk of the purchase price becomes payable by the purchaser. However, there may be situations when a number of part-payments are made by the purchaser, rather than one small deposit and then the remaining outstanding amount paid upon settlement. This may result in insufficient funds being available to pay the full amount of RLWT each time there is a residential land purchase amount. In this case, section RL 4(1) provides that the RLWT to be paid or withheld for each residential land purchase amount is capped at the amount of the relevant residential land purchase amount. Effectively, this allows RLWT to be paid in instalments and the due date is set in relation to each instalment. 29 This means that as soon as the 50 percent threshold is met, the RLWT agent must pay the full amount of each subsequent residential land purchase amount to the Commissioner as RLWT until the total amount of RLWT calculated under section RL 4(2), (4), or (6) has been paid. Example Stella purchases a residential property from Nicola for $500,000. Stella agrees to pay in 20 instalments of $25,000 each. Nicola is an offshore RLWT person and purchased the property for $400,000 one year earlier. Nicola has a mortgage with a New Zealand bank in relation to the property for $300,000 and no outstanding local authority rates. The RLWT agent calculates the amount of RLWT in relation to the property as being $33,000. The first nine part-payments made by Stella do not meet the definition of a residential land purchase amount. However, the 10 th part-payment constitutes a residential land purchase amount as together, the first 10 part- payments equal 50 percent of the total purchase price. The subsequent part-payments also constitute residential land purchase amounts. The RLWT agent pays $25,000 from the 10 th part-payment to the Commissioner because this is the maximum amount available from the relevant residential land purchase amount. The remaining $8,000 is paid from the 11 th part-payment. The due date for the $25,000 payment of RLWT is set in relation to the date of the 10 th part- payment and the due date for the $8,000 payment of RLWT is set in relation to the date of the 11 th part-payment. The RLWT agent is not required to pay RLWT from the remaining part-payments as the total amount of calculated RLWT has been satisfied once they have made the payment of $8,000 to the Commissioner. Information requirements New section RL 1(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and new sections 54B and 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 set out the information requirements in relation to RLWT obligations. New section RL 2(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a paying agent is able to “reasonably rely” on the information provided to them by the vendor. Note that this ability to reasonably rely on information provided by the vendor is only available to paying agents, but not withholding agents. Information to be provided by vendors to RLWT agents New section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the information that vendors are required to provide to the RLWT agent so that the agent is able to fulfil their RLWT obligations. At the time of writing, the IR1101 form is the form that must be completed and provided to fulfil any obligations under section 54C. The information provision requirements in section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 only apply if the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period and the residential land being disposed of was acquired on or after 1 October 2015. An amendment has been made to the definition of “bright-line date” in section YA 1, so that the calculation of the two-year period for the purposes of RLWT is the same as the bright-line test. 30 The calculation of the two-year period in new section 54C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is almo st ident ical to section CB 6A(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 in the bright-line test. The only exception is that section CB 6A(1)(a)(ii) is not required in the context of the RLWT, as it relates to land outside New Zealand. The bright-line date is defined in new section CB 6A and is discussed in further detail in the section titled “When RLWT applies”. Essentially, the vendor only needs to provide information if the bright-line date (in standard scenarios, the date of the agreement for sale and purchase) is within two years of the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 (or if there has not been a registration yet, the date on which they acquired the land). However, the vendor is required to declare in the IR1101 form under section 54C(5)(c)(ii) whether RLWT applies to the disposal and the RLWT agent should check whether RLWT does in fact apply – particularly if the paying agent is to “reasonably rely” on the information and documents provided by the vendor. If a paying agent is able to reasonably rely on the information provided, they will not be liable for a penalty under part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The RLWT agent should be able to fairly easily determine on their own whether the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period, with little input from the vendor. This is because in most cases, the start-date of the two-year period is the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the vendor was registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952, which is readily available on Landonline to conveyancers, and also on certain websites like Quotable Value. If the RLWT agent is unable to find the title registration date because the instrument to transfer the land to the person is not registered on or before the bright-line date, the RLWT agent should ask the vendor for the acquisition date, and to reasonably rely on this information, certain documents may need to be provided. If this date is not provided by the vendor, the RLWT agent should assume that the vendor is within the two-year period for the purposes of RLWT. The end-date or bright-line date is, in most cases, the date on which the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the residential land. This date should be available to both the vendor’s and purchaser’s conveyancers from the agreement for sale and purchase for the vendor’s disposal. In a standard scenario when a prospective purchaser makes an offer on a house, but the offer is conditional on the purchaser obtaining satisfactory financing and/or a builder’s report, the vendor’s bright-line date is the date on which they accept the purchaser’s conditional offer, not when the agreement goes unconditional. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled “When RLWT applies”. If the RLWT agent determines that the vendor is outside the two-year bright-line period, RLWT does not apply and the vendor does not need to provide further information as part of the IR1101 form to the RLWT agent under section 54C. If the RLWT agent determines that the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period, the vendor is required to complete the IR1101 and provide accompanying documents under section 54C. 31 While the section 54C information requirements must be complied with if the vendor’s bright-line period is within two years, in some cases it may be simpler for the vendor to provide their completed IR1101 form and accompanying documents before the bright-line period is determined. As three conditions must be met for RLWT to apply, it may, in some cases, be easiest to first determine whether the person is an offshore RLWT person, in so me cases, the two-year disposal requirement, and in other cases, whether the land being disposed of is residential land. For example, it may be straightforward if the vendor is a New Zealand citizen or holder of a residence class visa, and is physically present in New Zealand to sit down with their RLWT agent in New Zealand, complete their 54C form and show the RLWT agent their New Zealand passport or evidence of their residence class visa. The RLWT agent must take a copy of the passport or visa, but this (along with their physical presence) is sufficient to prove that the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person and that RLWT does not apply to the transaction. Sometimes, when a New Zealand citizen who is not an offshore RLWT person and does not have a New Zealand passport, an RLWT agent may consider that in order to reasonably rely on the statement that the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person, they need to see the vendor’s birth certificate and government-issued photographic identification. A paying agent can rely on information and accompanying documents provided by the vendor under section 54C, as long as their reliance on the information and the documents is “reasonable”. This is provided for in section RL 2(7) of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, this means that a paying agent is entitled to rely on the statement that the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person, unless there are reasonable grounds for doubt – for example, if it appears that the passport has been altered or the vendor is unable to provide their New Zealand passport or residence class visa. If the vendor claims they are not an offshore RLWT person, but does not provide evidence to support this claim, relying on the statement would not be “reasonable”. This is because there is an inherent incentive for an offshore RLWT person to claim that they are not an offshore RLWT person, to avoid paying RLWT. If the vendor is required to provide information under section 54C, section 54C(3) provides that the vendor must provide the information prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (including any accompanying documents) in the form prescribed by the Commissioner before a residential land purchase amount is made. In a standard scenario, this generally means that the IR1101 needs to be provided before the purchaser is required to pay the settlement funds to the vendor. This ensures that the RLWT agent has all the necessary information and documentation required to determine if RLWT applies. If the IR1101 form and accompanying documents are not provided before the payment of a residential land purchase amount, the RLWT agent may assume the vendor is an offshore RLWT person and therefore withhold RLWT if the other requirements for withholding have been met (New Zealand residential land being disposed of within the two-year bright-line period). An exception to this would be where the RLWT agent has reasonable grounds for establishing that the vendor is not an RLWT person – for example, a lo ng-standing client relationship such that the RLWT agent knows the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person. 32 Section 54C(5) provides that the minimum information required by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to be provided by the vendor consists of: • their full name and address; • their IRD number; • whether they are an offshore RLWT person; and • if they are an offshore RLWT person, whether they and the purchaser are associated persons and whether the disposal would be subject to RLWT – that is, if the disposal would be income under the bright-line test, ignoring the main ho me exclusio n and other land taxing provisions. Any additional information specifically required is set out on the IR1101 form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Information provided under section 54C, including on the IR1101 form, is information provided in relation to a tax law, so the person signing the form could be subject to criminal penalties if they knowingly provide false information. Section 54C(4) requires the vendor to provide relevant and appropriate documents as prescribed by the Commissioner, to support the information they have given under section 54C(5) – for example, in relation to the assertion that the disposal would not be income under the bright-line test, ignoring the main home exclusion and other land taxing provisions. If a vendor is claiming that RLWT does not apply, for whatever reason, they must provide documentation to support this assertion. If a vendor states that they are an offshore RLWT person (and therefore subject to RLWT, depending on whether other requirements have been met), there is no need for the vendor to provide accompanying documents and evidence to support the statement that they are an offshore RLWT person. However, if a vendor states that they are not an offshore RLWT person, accompanying documents must be provided. This is to allow the paying agent to “reasonably” rely on the information provided to them by the vendor. It would not be reasonable to rely on a claim that the vendor is not an offshore RLWT person without sufficient supporting evidence. If the vendor can show the RLWT agent their New Zealand passport or residence class visa, the RLWT agent can take a copy and rely on this as evidence of their client’s onshore status. If the vendor is unable to meet the RLWT agent in person, a certified copy of the vendor’s New Zealand passport or residence class visa may need to be provided for the documents to be reasonably relied upon by a paying agent, in addit ion to evidence of physical presence within New Zealand during the requisite timeframe. Where there are a number of vendors for a given disposal, for example, in the case of co- owners and partnerships, each co-owner or partner needs to separately provide informat ion under section 54C in their own IR1101. This is so the RLWT agent can calculate the correct amount of RLWT and allocate it to the appropriate vendors. 33 Example Hannah and Jack own a residential property as joint tenants, which they are selling within two years of acquisition. For the purposes of RLWT, 50 percent of the proceeds belong to Hannah and the remaining 50 percent belongs to Jack, even though they each own an undivided share in the property. Jack is an offshore RLWT person and Hannah is a New Zealand citizen who has been physically present in New Zealand within the past three years. They each complete an IR1101 form and provide these to the RLWT agent. Hannah and Jack are not physically present in New Zealand at the time of the sale, Hannah also provides a certified copy of her passport and evidence that she has been in New Zealand. The RLWT agent calculates the RLWT applying to the whole transaction as $25,000. As 50 percent of the proceeds belong to Hannah and the remaining 50 percent belong to Jack, only $12,500 (being 50 percent of $25,000) needs to be retained from the settlement funds to be paid to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The RLWT agent allocates the $12,500 to the IRD number provided by Jack in his section 54C form. To provide a statement under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that a non- natural person vendor is not an offshore RLWT person, section 54C(6) requires that the information and documents provided under section 54C must be verified by a natural person who is not an offshore RLWT person themselves and is: • a director, in the case of vendor companies and look-through companies; • a general partner of the partnership, in the case of vendor limited partnerships; and • a trustee of the trust, in the case of vendor trusts. In the case of other entities or arrangements, the equivalent of a non-offshore director is required to provide the statement, if the entity or arrangement is claiming that it is not an offshore RLWT person. Only one person is required to verify the information and documents provided under section 54C, as long as they meet the requirements of section 54C(6). A paying agent can “reasonably” rely on the director, general partner, or trustee’s statement under section 54C on the offshore status of the entity without personally looking into the shareholding of the company. However, they must be satisfied that the person making the statement is not an offshore RLWT person themselves. This means the person completing the IR1101 form on behalf of the entity or arrangement must provide evidence of their New Zealand citizenship or residence class visa and presence in New Zealand in the same way that a natural person vendor does. For example, they could meet with the RLWT agent in person and show them their New Zealand passport. However, in some cases this may not be practical and providing a certified copy may be more appropriate. The rationale is that it would sometimes be difficult to provide evidence of the offshore status of all shareholders. For example, companies may be widely held, but the paying agent could reasonably rely on the person’s statement if they are satisfied that the person is not an offshore RLWT person. Furthermore, as the non-offshore director, general partner, or trustee would be providing information in relation to a tax law, they would be subject to criminal penalties, if they knowingly provide false information. 34 It was not considered appropriate to allow an offshore RLWT person to provide a statement under section 54C stating that an entity or arrangement is not an offshore RLWT person. This approach ensures that the RLWT rules maintain their integrity and appropriate fo llow-up action can be easily taken by the Commissioner in the event that information provided by the director, general partner or trustee is incorrect. If no director, general partner or trustee who is not an offshore RLWT person can verify the information provided under section 54C, the outcome is as though no information has been provided. In the case of a mortgagee sale, for example, the vendor (the mortgagor) is still required to provide the requisite information under section 54C. The standard consequences apply if the required information is not provided. Information to be provided by RLWT agents to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Section 54B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires RLWT agents to provide a statement detailing their RLWT withholding obligations at the time they pay RLWT to the Commissioner. This is to enable the Commissioner to match the payment of RLWT by the RLWT agent to the appropriate vendor. As previously discussed in the section titled “New tax type: Residential land wit hho lding tax”, the RLWT agent is permitted to pay amounts of RLWT to the Commissioner either on a monthly basis (by the 20 th of the month following the month in which RLWT was withheld or retained) or a transaction-by-transaction basis. The form of the section 54B statement is prescribed by the Commissioner and includes, at a minimum, the IRD number of the taxpayer to whom the RLWT should be allocated, the amount of RLWT calculated under section RL 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the amount of RLWT ultimately retained and paid to the Commissioner. Where an amount of RLWT has been retained or withheld on behalf of a number of offshore co-owners or partners in relation to a particular transaction, the RLWT agent must allocate the appropriate amount of RLWT to each of the offshore co-owners or partners using the IRD numbers provided to them under section 54C. Note that section 54B(2) provides that when RLWT applies, but the calculation methods set out in section RL 4 have resulted in a nil amount of RLWT to be paid, the RLWT agent must still provide a 54B statement to the Commissioner. This may happen, for example, if the vendor’s acquisition cost exceeds the current purchase price, or a New Zealand mortgage has reduced the amount of RLWT payable to zero. This enables more efficient data matching with information collected by Land Information New Zealand as part of the land transfer tax statement to determine that RLWT obligations have been considered and met. It also allows the Government to monitor the RLWT rules for any potential abuse of the rules and respond appropriately. Section 54B(1) provides that the Commissioner may also allow further time for paying and withholding agents to furnish their RLWT statements. However, this may affect a vendor’s ability to apply for a refund if he or she wants to file an interim claim shortly after the disposal, as refunds for an interim claim are generally not issued until the payment of RLWT to the Commissioner is reconciled with the vendor’s account. 35 Information retention and the Privacy Act 1993 New section 54C(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires anyone who receives information under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to retain that information for at least seven years. The seven-year period is a standard feature of record-keeping requirements. This rule applies to an RLWT agent who receives information under this section, irrespective of whether RLWT is ultimately retained or withheld. However, if the RLWT agent is the purchaser themselves, they are not required to retain the information if they provide to the Commissioner a copy of the information given to them by the vendor within one month of receiving it. This is because they are not a professional conveyancer or lawyer and may not be aware of their record-keeping obligations. The provisions of the Privacy Act 1993 also apply to information collected under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. When the recipient of the information is a conveyancer, there are also professional obligations regarding confidentiality. Interim claims Section RL 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 54D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide for the new interim claim process. This allows vendors who have had RLWT withheld to calculate their income tax liability in relation to land before the end of the relevant income year, and obtain a refund when the amount of RLWT paid exceeds the person’s income tax liability. The interim claim is not a full and final income tax return and the vendor is still required to file an income tax return at the end of the income year. This is because the purpose of the interim claim process is to relieve cashflow pressures for the vendor. As previously discussed, section LB 6B provides a tax credit for the year in which a person disposes of the residential land equal to the amount of RLWT paid. Generally, this tax credit is used to offset the person’s income tax liability arising fro m the disposal of residential land. If the amount of RLWT paid exceeds the person’s income tax liability for the disposal o f residential land, section LA 6 provides that the credit can be used to satisfy the person’s other income tax liabilities. If an excess RLWT credit still exists, a refund may be given. To retain the integrity of the RLWT rules, and to prevent fraudulent refunds from being processed, the vendor is provided a credit only for the amount of RLWT that has actually been paid to the Commissioner when the interim claim application is processed. The Tax Administration Act 1994 already provides for special returns in specific circumstances (for example, an early return when a taxpayer no longer has an enduring relat ionship wit h New Zealand and will not derive any further income that will be taxed in New Zealand), and sections 79 and 80 allow the Commissioner to require the furnishing of annual returns and other returns in addition to those already prescribed. However, sectio n 54D has been inserted to specifically provide for the interim claim process for RLWT. Under section RL 6(1)(a), the Commissioner may refund an amount of RLWT to the extent that an RLWT tax credit is a surplus credit when looking only at the person’s income and deductions for land for the tax year. 36 To calculate the amount of the surplus credit, the company tax rate (currently 28%) is used for companies, and the top marginal tax rate (currently 33%) is used for individuals. The rationale for using the top rate for individuals is that the interim claim process only takes into account the person’s income for land and does not consider the person’s other income for the year. Using a lower marginal tax rate (for example, the lowest marginal rate of 10.5%) could result in a larger refund being issued than the person would be ent it led to if they have other income that may be taxed in New Zealand. In addit ion, for a refund to be issued as an interim claim, section RL 6(1)(b) requires that the person must not have any outstanding tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts. This is because the person’s tax debts should be paid before a refund is issued. A person may lodge an interim claim regardless of whether they were eligible for an RLWT exemption certificate. Under sections RL 6(1)(c) and 54D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the person must provide information using the interim claim form prescribed by the Commissioner for an interim claim to be processed. The information that must be provided is set out in section 54D(1). At a minimum it must include the person’s income and deductions relating to land for the part of the income year until one month after the disposal of residential land for which RLWT was paid. This means all income relating to land for the income year to date, not just income relating to the disposal fro m which RLWT was withheld or retained, must be provided. During development of the policy it was not considered necessary to require the person to disclose all income and deductions for the year to date, but equally, it was considered inappropriate to limit the “snapshot” of the person’s tax position captured by the interim claim only to the RLWT transaction. Example Phoebe is an offshore RLWT person who sells three properties during the 2017 income year – one in May, one in August, and the other in September. All three disposals are taxable for Phoebe. Phoebe is liable for RLWT on the property sold in August. RLWT has been paid in relation to the sale made in August. Phoebe works out the amount of RLWT exceeds the tax to pay on the property sales. Phoebe prepares an interim claim using the form prescribed by the Commissioner and includes her income and deductions relating to all three sales. Phoebe also has salary and wage income that is taxable in New Zealand, but she does not include this income in her interim claim. As it is possible that a person who has had RLWT paid in relation to a disposal qualifies for the main ho me exclusio n, as part of the interim claim the person must also state whether or not they qualify for the main ho me exclusio n in section CB 16A of the Income Tax Act 2007. In addition, section 54D(1)(c) and (2) provides that the Commissioner may request further information and accompanying documents as part of the interim claim process. This will be clarified in further operational guidance. 37 When RLWT obligations not met The standard penalties that apply to other withholding taxes also apply in the case of RLWT. This is despite RLWT not being a true withho lding tax, as in most cases, paying agents are generally not jointly and severally liable for the RLWT that should have been paid. If there are insufficient funds available to pay the full amount of RLWT due to other disbursements or a non-cash consideration, for example, a paying agent has several possible courses of action. They may, for example, require the vendor to pay the additional funds to ensure those payments can be made. While a paying agent is not liable for the underlying amount they did not withhold, they may be subject to certain penalties depending on their level of culpability. Penalties Under new section RL 2(6), the rules relating to penalties as set out in part 9 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to paying agents as though they have failed to pay an amount of withholding tax equal to the amount of RLWT they failed to satisfy. This means the general penalties rules that apply to withholding taxes (such as late filing penalties) also apply to RLWT, irrespective of whether the person required to satisfy RLWT is a paying agent or a withholding agent. No corresponding penalties provision is required for when the RLWT agent is a withholding agent as the penalties that apply to “true” withholding taxes are implicit through the addition of RLWT in sections BE 1(6), RA 6C(2) and RA 10(1)(a). As discussed in the section titled “Information requirements”, a paying agent is able to “reasonably rely” on information provided to them as part of a section 54C form. If a paying agent fails to retain an amount of RLWT from a residential land purchase amount because they have reasonably relied on the information provided to them under section 54C by the vendor, section RL 2(7) provides that the paying agent is not liable for a penalty under part 9. Generally, the main civil penalty that may apply is a shortfall penalty. An RLWT agent may be liable for shortfall penalties if they take a tax position that is inaccurate and satisfies one of the following: • not taking reasonable care; • gross carelessness; • an abusive tax position; or • evasion. Penalties increase in proportion to the seriousness of the breach and apply across different tax types. Official guidance and interpretation is available on how the Commissioner applies each type of shortfall penalty. In addition, there are provisions which determine to what extent taxpayers may be eligible for a reduction in the shortfall penalty. When an RLWT agent retains and pays an amount of RLWT to the Commissioner, but this is less than the amount calculated using the three calculation steps, shortfall penalties may apply to the shortfall. (That is, the difference between the calculated amount and what is actually paid to the Commissioner, depending on the RLWT agent’s level of culpability the Commissioner considers was present in the transaction.) 38 Late payment penalties may also apply in the context of RLWT, but unlike shortfall penalties, they are applied automatically to the amount that should have been paid. The late payment penalties are set out in section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. When the RLWT agent is a true withholding agent (because the vendor and purchaser are associated persons), late payment penalties apply if the required amount of RLWT is not paid to the Commissioner by the due date (the 20 th of the following month). While the new legislation is silent on this point, use-of-money interest (UOMI) should also apply. Under new section RL 2(6)(a), a RLWT agent who is a paying agent and has subtracted or retained an amount of RLWT from a residential land purchase amount, but has failed to pay the calculated RLWT to the Commissioner, late payment penalties apply. Late payment penalties generally continue to accrue until the core debt (in this instance the RLWT) has been cleared. UOMI should also apply in this instance. Under new section RL 2(6)(b), when the paying agent has not retained an amount of RLWT from the residential land purchase amount, late payment penalties do not apply. This is because in most cases, the paying agent is not liable for the underlying amount of RLWT and once they have released the funds to the vendor, they are not able to rectify their failure to retain and pay RLWT. While the new legislation is silent on this point, UOMI should not, in this situat ion, apply to the paying agent. However, as the RLWT liability and resulting debt is ultimately the vendor’s, where penalties do not apply to the paying agent as a result of section RL 2(6)(b), they will instead apply to the vendor. UOMI will also apply to the vendor. The correct legal result is that late payment penalties are calculated in relation to the amount of RLWT that should have been retained under section RL 4. In some cases, this may not equal the amount that the paying agent retained and subsequently paid to the Commissioner. In this case, late payment penalties should ultimately apply only to the amount they retained because they are unable to rectify their failure to retain the full amount as the funds will have already left their possessio n. However, this should be determined on a case-by-case basis to ensure the integrity of the RLWT rules is maintained. To achieve this result, the existing rules surrounding remission of penalties and interest apply so that the paying agent may be able to seek relief in appropriate circumstances. When relief is sought, the paying agent must show they have retained what they claim to have retained and provide full information about why they have not retained and paid the correct calculated amount of RLWT. This enables the Commissioner to determine to what extent relief should be appropriately provided and to make an assessment on whether shortfall penalties should also apply. Example Manny is an offshore RLWT person whose bright-line period for the house he is selling is less than two years. RLWT therefore applies when Manny sells his house. Manny’s paying agent is Evan. Evan calculates the amount of RLWT that needs to be retained from the proceeds of the sale to be $25,000. Evan only retains $20,000 from the settlement funds on 15 August, but then only pays $15,000 to the Commissioner on the due date of 20 September. Evan is subject to late payment penalties, because he has not paid the full amount of RLWT to the Commissioner by the due date (20 September). Late payment penalties are automatically calculated based on the difference between what Evan paid ($15,000) and what Evan should have paid ($25,000). UOMI also applies. 39 While Evan can rectify his late payment in relation to the difference between the $15,000 and what he actually retained ($20,000), he is unable to rectify his late payment in relation to the difference between the $20,000 and $25,000 as the settlement funds have left his hands and he is not jointly and severally liable for the portion of the RLWT he did not retain. Evan contacts Inland Revenue and provides information on the amount he did actually retain and why he did not retain the full amount that was calculated under the RLWT rules. Late payment penalties and UOMI continue to accrue in relation to the retained $20,000 until Evan has paid to the Commissioner the full amount that he retained from Manny. Late filing penalties are important in the context of RLWT because if an RLWT agent’s section 54B statement is not received by the due date, it may negatively affect a taxpayer’s ability to use their RLWT credit to offset their income tax liability arising from the disposal of residential land and obtain a refund from Inland Revenue as part of the interim claim process. Late filing penalties apply to tax types when the timely provision of information to the Commissioner is important (for example, employer monthly schedules and annual imputation credit account returns) and does not apply to withholding taxes such as RWT and NRWT as that information is not required until 31 May in the following year. The possibility of having late filing penalties imposed encourages agents to provide RLWT statements by the due date. The imposition of late filing penalties in the context of RLWT is provided for in sections 139A(1), 139A(2)(iiic) and 139A(4). Section 139A(4) provides that the late filing penalty for RLWT statements is the same as that for employer monthly schedules – $250. The RLWT agent may also be liable for criminal penalties. These are applied by a court of law. Criminal penalties include absolute liability offences, such as failing to keep documents required to be kept under the Tax Administration Act 1994. The different types of criminal penalties are set out in sections 143–148 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Liability for underlying RLWT As noted previously, under new section RL 2(5), a paying agent is not jointly and severally liable in relation to the vendor’s RLWT debt, despite their obligation to satisfy the vendor’s RLWT liability. However, if a paying agent has retained RLWT from a residential land purchase amount, but has not paid the RLWT to the Commissioner, they are liable for the amount of RLWT they retained and did not pay to the Commissioner. Example In the example above with Evan as a paying agent, the amount of RLWT calculated is $25,000, but Evan only retains $20,000 and pays $15,000 to the Commissioner. Evan is not liable for the full $25,000, only the $20,000 that he did retain from Manny. If the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser is the withholding agent and is therefore liable for the underlying RLWT, in a similar way to standard withholding taxes. 40 Reporting to professional body An amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been made to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide details of a RLWT agent to their relevant professional body when they have failed to fulfil their RLWT obligations. These professional bodies might include, for example, the New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Society of Conveyancers. This allows professional bodies to take appropriate action against members who do not comply with their legal obligations under the RLWT rules. This is an important feature that supports the integrity of the RLWT rules, as paying agents are not liable for the underlying RLWT in most circumstances, so the exception from section 81 ensures there are sufficient consequences for RLWT agents who do not fulfil their legal obligations. However, it is expected that reporting to a professional body will only occur where the RLWT agent repeatedly or deliberately fails to correctly account for RLWT. For the RLWT rules to retain their integrity and be effective, it is expected that the relevant professional body would take appropriate action against the member. This is why it is intended that only conveyancers and lawyers who are allowed to hold themselves out as such in New Zealand and are therefore a member of a professional body in New Zealand should be paying agents for the purposes of RLWT. 41
