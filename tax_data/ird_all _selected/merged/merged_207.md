There are also some proposed improvements to online services, which would apply to all borrowers. The proposed new rules are tailored to borrowers' different circumstances. For most employees, the changes would make paying back their student loans simpler because they are based on pay-period deductions rather than square-ups at year-end. Better use of software and online tools will mean more accurate assessments, with fewer and less significant overpayments and underpayments. Minor discrepancies will be ignored. If you have overpaid, in most cases the excess will be put towards your loan, rather than refunded. The rules also move away from due dates and late payment penalties where possible. Enhanced online services will mean that borrowers can monitor and manage their accounts at their convenience. This will make things a lot easier for overseas borrowers in particular. Allowing borrowers to manage their loan repayment accounts online will allow Inland Revenue to focus resources on offering customised service for borrowers whose circumstances change. These proposals are explained on this website. A detailed written version of these proposals is also available online.

The government wants to make it easier for borrowers to manage their repayments and get out of debt sooner. More than half a million people have student loans, and this number grows each year. Most borrowers are people who have finished their studies and are paying off their loans. The present repayment system is complex. For example, if you are a New Zealand- based borrower, you require a yearly assessment and square-up of how much you paid and how much owed over the year. Inland Revenue has to perform these tasks manually, which takes a lot of administrative time and resources. Many borrowers receive letters and statements from us several times a year, and they have to contact us if they have questions about their loan balance or repayment levels.

Yes, anyone can contribute to the forum. Should my post include details about my student loan or other personal information? Forum posts can be viewed by all forum users, so your posts should not contain any personal information. If your post wouldn't make sense with that information left out, you can instead send us your thoughts by email or letter. See our timeline. I have posted to the forum, but my post doesn't appear. Why? This is a moderated forum. We may check posts before they appear on the forum. We may also delete posts that are not directly relevant to the policy proposals, or that may be inappropriate or offensive. See the forum's Terms of Use. Will you delete posts that say negative things about the proposals? The forum's purpose is to seek people's views on the proposals, so we are interested in all points of view. If you disagree with any of the changes proposed, use your post to explain why. We'll only delete comments which don't comply with the forum's Terms of Use - for example, using offensive language. I'd like more detail on the proposals - where can I get more information? The forum's content has been written for the online format, and therefore aims to be concise. If you would like to read more comprehensive information about the policy proposals, it is available here I don't understand some of the words used. Technical words are explained in our Glossary. How long is the forum open for? The forum is open until 17 July 2009. This gives us time to work through the comments and prepare legislation for later this year, if that's what government Ministers choose to do. What if I have additional feedback after the forum has closed? You can write to us or email us at the addresses set out here, but we're expecting to report to government Ministers soon after the forum closes, so we might not be able to take late comments into account. What happens next? When will the changes described in this forum take effect? The examples and scenarios used in the forum are only proposals at this stage. Once the forum closes and the feedback is considered, policy proposals will be developed for consideration by government ministers later this year. If the government wishes to implement those proposals, new legislation could be introduced in late 2009, with the changes applying from early 2011. To keep informed about student loan issues, including any new legislation being put forward, you can sign up to our NotifyMe email newsletter. Will all your policy consultation be via online forums from now on? This is the first time we've used an online forum to consult with the general public. If it proves a successful way of obtaining meaningful feedback about policy proposals, we will certainly be keen to use an online forum again for HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation Student Loans Consultation http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/faqs/\[24/10/2013 10:04:10\] suitable future issues. Other questions I've got a question about my student loan. Where can I ask that? The student loans page on the Inland Revenue website has answers to common questions, or you can contact Inland Revenue to discuss your question directly. Why are you using an online forum to get people's views? We've sought people's views on policy changes for a long time - here's some that we've done before. We decided to use an online forum for this consultation because, with more and more people using the internet, it is a good way of getting a wide range of public feedback on our proposals. Further questions about the forum I've got a question about the forum which isn't covered in the above FAQs.

Employee: a person whose main source of income is from salary or wages paid by an employer. Interest rate: the rate at which interest is charged on your loan balance if you're an overseas-based borrower. The interest rate is adjusted every year. The interest rate for the 2009–10 tax year is 6.8%. Late payment penalties: penalties incurred when you fail to meet your student loan repayment obligations. New Zealand-based borrower: any borrower who qualifies for an interest-free student loan. Notice of assessment: a notice from Inland Revenue telling you how much you need to pay. You won't get a notice of assessment if you're on a repayment holiday. Official Information Act 1982: the Act that regulates the release of government information to the public. Online services: services provided through the internet. A key feature of these proposals is to move student loan services to a web-based system. Over-deductions (overpayments): when a borrower's student loan repayments made through the PAYE system have been too large and therefore the deductions have exceeded the compulsory repayment obligation. Overseas-based borrowers: borrowers who doesn't qualify for an interest-free student loan because they've been overseas for 184 or more consecutive days and don't qualify for one of the exemptions. PAYE system: a "pay as you earn" system where employees make payments towards their tax liability and student loans through deductions from their salary and wages each pay period. Employees select a tax code based on their yearly salary or wage and their employer uses this to determine the amount of deductions for income tax and student loan repayments. Personal tax summary: a summary of your income for the year that indicates any income tax to pay or be refunded. Repayment holiday: a period during which a borrower is not required to make payments towards their loan, although interest continues to accrue. A repayment holiday applies only to overseas-based borrowers. Repayment obligation: an assessment of the amount owed on your student loan for a tax year. For New Zealand-based student loan borrowers, the obligation is equal to 10% of your income over the repayment threshold. Any repayments you have already made are deducted from this obligation to establish your year-end payment. Repayment threshold: the amount you can earn in a tax year before you must start paying back your loan. For the tax year 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the repayment threshold is $19,084. Secondary income: income from a job that is separate from and in addition to a taxpayer's main job. Self-employed: a person who earns income from their own business activities rather than from an employer. StudyLink: a service of the Ministry of Social Development that helps students access financial support and other entitlements while they complete their studies. Tax codes: codes used by the PAYE system to determine the correct deductions. Taxpayers select a tax code by filling out the flow chart on the IR330 form when they start a job. The codes indicate whether a job is the taxpayer's main or secondary employment and whether they have a student loan. If a taxpayer's circumstances change, they may have to change their tax code. Under-deductions (underpayments): when a borrower's student loan repayments made through the PAYE system have been too small and the repayments are less than the compulsory repayment obligation. HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation Student Loans Consultation http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/glossary/\[24/10/2013 10:04:15\] Voluntary repayment bonus: the proposed government policy whereby borrowers who make voluntary repayments of $500 or more over their compulsory repayment obligation in a tax year get a repayment bonus of 10% of the extra amount. Voluntary repayments: a payment above your compulsory repayment obligation. You can make voluntary repayments even if you earn less than the repayment threshold. A voluntary repayment will reduce the term of your student loan. You can choose to pay off some, or all, of your student loan at any time. Year-end square-up: an assessment process at the end of the tax year (31 March) to determine if a taxpayer has paid the right amount of income tax or made the right student loan repayments.

During studies, students should be encouraged to earn as much as they can during the holiday perioud in order to support themselves during the academic year. Normal tax deducted from your pay packet is never full and final. There is a process to correct any imblances/errors due to changes in circumstances at the end of the year. I think it is unfair not to have this for your student loan. Maybe this is okay for those that at the end of the year have earned over a threshold, but for those on limited incomes anyhow this is disadvantages them even further. Perhaps there is room for this approach, in combination with an exemption for those on an annual income less than the existing repayment threshold. If you know you are going to be under the threshold at year end, then you don't pay regardless of income in the shorter pay intervals. If you know you are going to be over the threshold, you are automatically subject to pay interval deductions. If you are unsure if you will be over or under, you can opt in to pay interval deductions. I agree with mjc, however, that reliance on the employer and PAYE to get it right is not realistic, and there are likely to be corrections etc from time to time. I agree with bartybird. If you know you won't be earning over the threshold for the year, then you probably can't afford to make PAYE pay-period deductions. Keep it the way it is, with the option to opt-in to repayments.

Go back to proposals PhilipA kris While this change might simplify administration of the student loan process, it will have a negative impact on students. This is effectively a 10c raise in the effective marginal tax rate faced by people who are some of the lowest earners in society. The proposed weekly threshold is $367 before tax. If a student works for 40 hours a week at the minimum wage of $12.50 they will make $500. This will mean they will have to repay approximately $14 per week towards their student loan. While $14 may not sound like much money, it would make a noticeable difference for those who are struggling to get by. Students should be encouraged to seek work and fund their own studies rather than relying on government provided living costs and allowances. The proposed changes provide a disincentive to work. The changes also may provide students with an incentive to game the system by taking under the table cash jobs (also evading tax), have employers spread their pay over weeks they did not work, or to pay their parents/spouses for work performed by the students. The changes are inequitable in that someone who works 20 hours a week for twice as long is better off than someone who works 40 hours a week. There is no reasonable basis for discriminating between people who prefer to focus on their studies and earn money in a concentrated period, such as the holidays, and those who prefer to earn money throughout the year. A better solution would be to shift to a weekly PAYE threshold for all borrowers, but retaining the current yearly threshold for people who are still studying. In Background section 2.1 of the discussion document, it is stated that most borrowers have finished their study. It would only be a minority who would need a special exemption as they are still studying. Obviously there would be difficulties with working out who counts as "still studying", but I'm sure it would be possible. I agree with all the points PhilipA made. IRD does not discriminate (with regard to tax) between people who earn $20k in 3 months or $20k over the entire year (although there may be a square up at the end of the year), so why should it be any different with regard to student loan repayments? No group of students are going to benefit from this, indeed, the worst off (those who finance their entire year from 3 months of holiday work) could potentially be $1000 worse off, if they had a particularly well paying holiday job, or worked excessive hours. Of particular issue is that over the holiday period, students may opt to work instead of taking their holiday entitlement, and instead have this paid as a lump sum at the end of employment. Some students will also have scholarships with their employers, which most likely get added to their last PAYE at the end of the 3 months employment. Both of these already get HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation forum Student loans consultation forum - Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/22/1/\[24/10/2013 10:05:44\] Jul 6th 2009 Jul 6th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 Jul 14th 2009 habbott13 BANG damonharrison07 Lys Tegan taxed, and now students will see even less of it, as their last weeks' pay could be hundreds (or thousands with a scholarship) more than their normal weekly pay (and well over the pitiful weekly threshold). I agree with both of the above comments. Students already struggle to find adequate finances to support themselves during the academic year, and by forcing them to make compulsory payments from their weekly earnings over the summer, it will become even more difficult. It will be also be difficult for students who have to also work during the year, whether it be demonstrating or as a residential advisor (RA) at the halls. They will be put under more pressure as they will need to work more hours to earn the same amount and it could jeopardise their academic studies. I actually think this is a good idea. Student debt has been getting way out of hand for far too long because it is so easy to get a loan and so easy to avoid paying it back. I have my reservations about this Government but I agree that something needs to be done about student debt and I see this as one logical step. Getting into the habit of paying off a loan as you go along is a good idea - you don't get a 100% loan on a car, drive the car into the ground over 9 years and then start making repayments, nor do you get a mortgage and be exempt from paying it off while you live in the house, so why should it be different with education? I lived on $170 a week for years while I was studying ($150 loan and $20 from summer savings), I saved most of what I earned over summer (half-time work as I was volunteering 0.5 FTE) and after living similarly and saving my earnings I am in a position at age 24 to write off my loan of $40,000. I'm an exception not the rule but seriously, if I managed to do that then there are MANY other students out there who can cut back on their spending and use it to get rid of their loan. I can see the the potential upsides of the proposal (i.e. Getting out of debt WITH THE IRD quicker) but I don't see how it will help in other aspects of student's lives. I agree completely with the above posters. I currently work two part time jobs and study full time and don't even have the money for text books after paying for essentials (petrol, food, part of bills etc), not to mention being limited in my income to $180 due to my student allowance. (I would need to work an extra 11 hours a week to actually make more money than I do now.) The limit should either be increased or this should be an option for people with lower expenses. Another thing to consider would be students who are becoming parents, their incomes will certainly need to be as high as they possibly can without more penalties. The most obvious problem with this proposal is that many students cram their entire years income into a few short weeks earning during the holidays. Without the luxury of being able to live at home with the parents while studying, it's really difficult to balance full time study with working enough during the week to pay for general living expenses - especially if you're not eligible for student allowance. Many students attempt to work (and save) as much as possible over breaks from study (such as over summer) in order to survive the busy study periods that restrict their ability to work. They may earn what seems a significant weekly amount during these times, but very little annually. It seems incredibly unfair to make these people make greater repayments when in actual fact they are only scraping through as it is...

People who are trying to keep thier student loans to a minimim and save for books and accomodation during the holidays should not be penilised. I find this very unfair that the government is trying to make us pay back our student loans while we are still in the middle of our studies. This just put more pressure on the students during the year. Students should be left alone untill they are working full time permanently not for a short number of weeks. People work during the holidays to keep themselves busy. This is going to restrict how much work they can do a week this may also put pressure on the work places students are at as during this time bussiness is up and they need more staff. Terrible idea. Life is hard enough as a student. There is no reason to require repayment ahead of gaining satisfactory post-study employment. After all, these students are likely to make a considerable contribution to the economy upon completion of study, and will be in a position to make regular repayments on the loan at that time. Why try and squeeze them, when it's a matter of waiting 3 or 4 years. Nope - bad idea. BANG says it is a good idea, because you learn responsibility, but it's not like anyone has a choice to get a student loan. If you didn't have to get it, you wouldn't! You aren't teaching anyone good money habits by coming down hard on them, just placing more obstacles in the way of people who are trying to get an education. I'm returning to study after an 8-year break and all this is adding to the stresses of going from being a full wage earner to a poor student. I don't expect a huge handout, but I do expect to be able to afford food, power, and shelter while I study. Having to pay off my loan if I work in the breaks just adds to the stress. Let's pay it off when we are working, not studying.

In effect, this would mean that Inland Revenue won't worry too much about small errors, and won't wait until year end to make corrections. Go back to proposals jacs15 smcn001 martinetherington I think it is a good plan, but what happens with larger errors? My partner was stung with a large student loan and tax bill due to his employer completely screwing it up (and this is an international comapany too). We also had conflicting info as to whether we had to pay or not from the IRD call centre. Having this clear on what is required and having some leeway when the individual is not at fault would make sense. I think this is a good idea too. However I also agree the larger error situation is an issue. My previous employer overpaid by several hundreds of dollars despite my request to cease payment probably 3yrs ago now. I have had to request a refund from the IRD, and despite sending in 3x completed rapid refund forms over that time ... nothing! A refund for overpayment at the end of the loan should be automatic. IR only receives information from employers once a month. This information includes the total earnings for the month, and the total student loan deductions for the month. E.g.: 1. An employee paid weekly earns the following gross amounts: $500, $500, $100 and $200. Total $1300. Student loan deductions are $13.30, $13.30, $0.00 and $0.00. Total $26.60. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an overpayment for the month since the total gross is less than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. 2. An employee paid weekly earns the following gross amounts: $360, $360, $360, $360 and $360. Total $1800. Student loan deductions are nil for each of the five weekly pays. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an underpayment of $20.97 for the month since the total gross is more than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. 3. Worst case scenario: An employee paid fortnightly earns the following gross amounts: $733.98, $733.98 and $733.98. Total $2201.94. Student loan deductions are nil for the three pays. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an underpayment of $61.16 for the month since the total gross is more than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. Would these be detected as PAYE errors or just as a minor over/underpayments? In practice I expect there to be frequent apparent over or under payments which have in fact been deducted correctly on a pay-period basis. Therefore only major discrepancies need to be checked as possible PAYE errors. Where a PAYE error is detected maiking corrections for future payments only is a good idea.

This takes away choice for the taxpayer and I do not support that approach. While I appreciate that the government is trying to recover loans, I believe individuals need to retain control over their income and where it is directed. This question is flawed as you haven't defined what 'major' and 'minor' are measured as. I agree with making corrections for future payments, instead of penalising someone for their employer's stuff-up. But I agree with bartybird that people should have control over their own money and where it goes. Overpayments over a certain amount, say $100, should be able to be refunded if requested. $100 seems small, but that's a power bill for the month, or groceries for a week. Waving minor underpayments would be great, a year or so ago I was required to pay $20 and so many cents .... took alot of effort to sort it out and checking it got paid. Would have been nice to just have written off as a requirement for that year. It wasn't really my fault either, just a minor error from when I first started my new job and they got it wrong slightly and never corrected it.

This should mean ex students will not receive unpleasent surprise letters asking for repayment money that they should have paid during the year. Very good. I don't support this idea if it is reliant upon the proposal to take out repayments based on shorter income intervals (weekly, fortnightly or monthly thresholds). As stated in the related discussion, this will only hit the already vulnerable, and during a recession it makes no sense to make life harder for those at the bottom of the income range. I agree with bartybird. If this is only because of the pay-period deductions, then no. I'm not sure what problem this is addressing. Once people leave study they either go overseas and have a payment holiday, or enter the NZ workforce and immediately start to pay off their loan. So there shouldn't be huge discrepancies in the amount you owe. I think that the year end square up process is essential! I use it to ensure that my employee is paying my deductions on my behalf etc., and to check track of how much I owe. I also use it as my once yearly check that IRD and writing off my interest for me, many times this does not happend automatically. If the year end process was removed then I would have one more thing to worry about each year. If you got "rid" of this process as standard, would people at least be able to request a year end summary e.g. like you do for tax. Also would people who have not met there repayment requirements still get a bill, or would it work like the tax summary e.g. if you don't enquire you do not have to pay.

What may seem a minor amount of money to IRD may make a real difference to the recipient and the employee should retain control over that decision. Again, it is hard to answer this question without a definition of 'major' or 'minor' overpayments. Even a small amount, like $100, can make a huge difference to quality of life. Any overpayment no matter how small should not automatically go onto the balance, unless someone has requested this to be a permanant option ... people's circumstances change from year to year ... last year I was okay with it being added on, this year I am not. I don't know what classifies as a minor/major overpayment to most people but personally the $1900 in overpayments I get refunded each year means a heck of a lot especially when my repayment obligations are set at around $3,300 pa (thats almost 2/3rds over what I need to pay). If you want to take away the option of receiving the refund then the CORRECT amount needs to be taken out throughout the year...... Refund option should be retained. Even if it is a minor amount, it may make a big difference to the recipient however, it will not change alot in the repayment period. The employee should have control over that decision of taking the refund or applying the overpaid amount towards their loan.

Go back to proposals martinetherington Nia bartybird Home Why change About Contact us Terms of use FAQs Conditions of website use Privacy Policy Glossary Discussions For more info on government services go to newzealand.govt.nz © Copyright 2009 Inland Revenue This is a good idea. Currently when a special student loan deduction rate is issued it is a flat rate applied to all earnings, not just earnings over the annual threshold. Will this continue to be the case or will the special student loan deduction rate always be for earnings over the annual threshold, or could it be either? From a compliance point of view I’d prefer it to remain as a flat rate on all earnings for the pay period as it is now. This is the simpler option for those doing manual payrolls. This would be good. I have been in that very situation where when I begun working I ended up underpaying my student loan payments. To my surprise I was penalised for it and large amounts were deducted from my pay for it. At present, there is the capability to make payment arrangements to clear year end underpayment amounts and those arrangements are within the control of the employee, made in consultation with IRD based on income level. Trying to manage this through PAYE is an extra burdern on the employer in terms of administration and reduces the employee's ability to manage their own income.

Go back to proposals ruralgirl administrator rhwilburn kris Why is the voluntary payment bonus as explained on your main IRD website not listed here for policy consultation? Thanks for your question. Parliament is currently considering a bill providing for the voluntary repayment bonus. The matter is best addressed through that process and that is why discussion is not included on this point in this forum. I am a software engineer by trade. I would like to see your online interent banking style payment system interact with other banking systems as a webservice. For example: I login to my interent banking with my bank (e.g. ANZ) and I can see my account balances for various accounts like VISA, Savings, etc. I would like it to be possible to have my student loan account show on that internet banking like my VISA does. My visa is latent in terms of showing the balance which is fine. The advantage of this to me, is that I can 1) see my fairly current balance. 2) I can easily transfer money to my student loan. I am aware that it would be up to banks to implement their side of things, however if you find one bank that will do it, all other banks will likely be inclined to do it. Personally I think the fact that you are asking for public feedback on proposed changes is an excellent idea, and should be an ongoing thing, rather than a one off. Without having the student loan seem like a loan, ie appearing on my internet banking, I am likely to just not worry about it and let the compulsory payments take care of it because its a hasle to make a small one off payment. To be honest, the only change that should be made is like rhwilburn says, better internet services. I know there are already online services for IRD and Studylink, and some banks have online features which allow you to make tax payments easier, but the system as a whole is lacking (just look and the truckload of snail mail you get from studylink throughout the year). Integrating everything into one place would be great, as well as showing IRD and student loan statuses on online banking websites (bonus points for allowing money to be transferred to them just as you would to your other suffixes). The rest of the student loan policy does not need changing, as no students will actually benefit from it.

My student loan repayments would have my loan paid off in 2 months. This is a real pain on several fronts and maybe a lower repayment percentage (3c in the dollar for example), as this will mean easier budgeting and manage house cash flow for my partner and I to maintain mortgage payments and spread my study loan payments over the year, as in the near future we will be going down to one income, but since there is no household income splitting at present, the current 10 cents in the dollar threshold is harder. Ideally if there were a different repayment say 3c in the dollar for loans under $2000 for example, as this will help single income families where either one partner or both are studying with one income stream. This may be a pain to adminster, but will mean more full time workers who are studying part time can better themselves while the recession is on, allowing more qualified people when the recession finishes. I'd really like a note on the statement (or somewhere easily accessible) that does a prediction of when I'll pay the loan off. This could be based on the average of the past 3 payments or something equally suitable. Paragraph 3.7 of the discussion document is of concern. Firstly it assumes someone with more than one job would have consistent earnings. These days this assumption is rarely true, especially amongst students and low income part-time workers. Therefore it would be difficult (or rare) for someone to accurately determine how much unused threshold they can apply to a second job. Secondly to implement this I expect the IR330 will need to be changed with the addition of a box to enter a threshold to apply (if any) for the S SL tax code. This will increase the compliance costs for employers. Employers who pay manually will need to remember to reduce the student loan repayment from the tax tables by 10% of the threshold each pay. This increases the room for errors. It will also require a change to payroll software. There will need to be an additional field for the employer to enter the threshold to apply if the S SL tax code is used by an employee. Student loan repayment calculations will need to be modified, (i.e. made more complicated) to apply this threshold. This change would not be difficult, but it does add another bit of extra complexity. The amounts involved will generally be small. The worst case scenario would be 367/2 \* 0.1 = $18.35 per week. I predict the average to be closer to $5 per week. So in line with the goal of encouraging earlier repayment, keeping things simple and minimising compliance costs I’d recommend dropping this feature. I don't see the relevance of getting two statements a year. I'd rather be able to log in and check progress myself, and get an end-of-year statement so I can see how much I've paid off. I'd like a quicker process and less form-filling to change my personal details. I would be interested to know if IRD have considered a progressive repayment rate for student loans. I.e. the repayment percentage could increase at different levels of income.

Higher admin costs too though, perhaps could be more integrated with the rest of the tax system (including matching the repayment rate thresholds with the income tax thresholds)? An alternative would be to increase the repayment rate depending on the size of the loan. One could argue (although it would need to be confirmed by the actual statistics) that in theory the higher the loan size the higher the income that person would be earning.

The new rate would be somewhere between the 6.8% rate that overseas borrowers currently face and the penalty of 19.56%. \[Revised question\] Go back to proposals Nicholas Nicholas catgregg1 martinetherington I live in New Zealand and in four years will be SL free! Of the ten or so really close friends i made at University eight have chosen to make overseas locations their permanent homes. About 5 of them still have student loans and have no intention of paying them back. For a number of them student loans have been a contributing factor in their decision to live overseas (or kept them there long enough to start families etc to ensure their detachment from NZ). Generally I think that the student loan policy (regarding overseas debtors) is short sighted given the much larger amount of money people will contrute in taxation over a three or four year period. Anything to reduce the burden on these people (which I see this measure as a step towards) is a good idea. In seeing other comments, it occurred to me that IRD could open bank accounts in the most common overseas destinations to help borrowers avoid extra bank transaction and conversion charges by providing a service that transfers money to NZ with a much larger economy of scale. (just a thought) It is a step in the right direction Why not let overseas borrowers be able to transfer their loans to the Australian Taxation Office? That way it would be so much easier for us to pay off our loan without having to go through lots of steps to pay the IRD. My student loan is the size of a large deposit for a house thanks to lthe living cost allowance and whatever money I would send over wouldn't be enough to cover the interest. Putting a large interest rate on the loan or any sort of penalty would deter me from saving money to send over. And I have a partner who also has to pay off his too so the repayment applies to both of us. We really can't afford to save up $4000 a year (will be more cos of fees and exchange rate) to pay off our loan. Scrap the interest altogether or let us transfer it here! I think it is important for New Zealand that graduates get work experience overseas and therefore should be encouraged to do so. There should be as little distinction as possible between those working overseas and those working in New Zealand. We also need to make sure there are no impediments to them returning. Interest should only be charged on the expected repayments that have not been made (i.e. the repayments of between $1000 & $3000 HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation forum Student loans consultation forum - Do not pay in full http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/40/2/\[24/10/2013 10:06:51\] Jul 14th 2009 Jul 16th 2009 Jul 16th 2009 Jul 17th 2009 Jul 21st 2009 tessa 1upsetexstudent waiholawoman sbvh petalpusher based on the loan balance), in a similar way to the self employed interim repayments. I think it is better that the loans do get repaid than get written off. It would also simplify the administration of the student loan system. Given our close relations with Australia, the idea of being able to transfer loan balances between the two countries makes sense. Then New Zealanders permanently moving to Australia could have their student loans being repaid through deductions from their Australian wages. Alternatively setting up bank accounts in the major currencies and/or countries where there a lot of graduates to reduce the cost of making regular payments also makes sense. I agree with most that incentives are more effective than penalties, and that the easier and cheaper it is the more likely it is to happen, but I also think that student loans are not high on the list of 'things I need to prioritise' while overseas. At least for the first few years living overseas, the focus is on establishing yourself, travelling and having as much fun as possible - it's a virtuous few that put money towards their loans. It's only once you get over the initial excietment of that adventure that you start thinking about your loan, and by then it's so massive from the interest and penalities that you get too scared about the size of the debt to come back to NZ. And then you stay away for so long you don't want to come back ever. I actually don't see why loan borrowers overseas can't also have interest-free loans, with incentives to pay them back quickly. But that's just crazy talk. I am a student who for 7 years did the right thing and made payments on my loan. I had contacted IRD and let them know I was going to be going out of the country and set up payments before I left. I kept in touch with them and gave them any change of address. I filled out all their forms. I paid child support through them for my child who was still in NZ and under 16. Funny thing was that last year they changed their minds about all sorts of things with my account. Then they added extra interest back to when I first left, they ignored the fact that one loan had been paid off early and added the extra interest for the whole term! Now they say that I am in arrears by hundreds of dollars because of extra interest. I was one of the good ones. Now I have no job and may no intention of paying any more!!! Their new measures do not go far enough and do not help!!!! They still do not get it right for us and it costs us the ability to go back to NZ and be productive tax payers in our home country. BTW yes I still owned property, had a NZ bank account and paid NZ taxes and child support while overseas but........ Now I'm not!!! Anything that means less penalties for people overseas gets thumbs up from me. The real question is whether the (higher) interest is compounded in the loan. The loan will grow exponentially and people will simply not want to return to NZ. I agree with the comments about making it easier to pay. For the last few years I had been sending through Barclays bank here in the UK but the fees they charge and the rates they give are far from great. I have just recently come across this company that pays direct to student loans www.orbitremit.com. The IRD should make us aware that alternatives such as this exist as a method other than using the banks. I am completely in support of moving to an online system. Living in the UK makes it hard to find a god time to call New Zealand and I cant believe that in this day and age we are still subjected to a phone and mail system to manage our details! I could believe it in the UK where systems are antiquated but not in NZ where we are usually at the front of the pack in such areas.

Existing interest rates have been as high as 9.2% (as far as I recall), and an additional penalty rate beyond this for missed payments will act to lengthen the distance to the goal posts. I would prefer to see a capped penalty rate for that tax year at less than 10%. Penalties gained during the year will be added to the compounded loan value (along with the regular interest rate).

Comments - Change the address and contact fields to reflect the requirements for postal codes in countries other than New Zealand. - Provide statements as PDF's to be available to replace correspondence so that they may be provided to accountants etc in other countries. - Consider setting up a local country account for loan payments and provide the \*market rate\* (or \*very close to\*) for exchange when calculating exchange rate to $NZD. Rather than credit card payments (and the 2.5% margin charged by IRD), this would allow for lowered government cost for payments, and direct access for anyone with a bank account. This would also preclude the money lost to intermediary service costs by borrowers and maximise payment made to the actual loan. - Consider aligning the payment year and set payment dates with local country taxation year to allow for less stress/easier accounting for persons residing in a single country.

Go back to proposals tamatea jacs15 annap The\_Forgotten Interest charges for overseas borrowers should be CANCELLED! I am paying back my loan under the amnesty scheme and meeting my obligations, but due to interest charges I am not making any impact on the loan capital. I hope to return to live in NZ one day, but this idea of charging overseas based borrowers interest means I will end up with an ever increasing loan whichh makes this return more and more difficult. As one of the 'guinea pig' generation I was charged interest on my loan while studying and my loan has increased exponentially over the years. Now that the goalposts have moved, borrowers from my generation who have moved overseas to try and pay off their loan are seeing no benefit at all. An unfair and unjust system in summary. Stop interest charges and let people start paying their capital instead of being marginalised and exiled. I think there should be a rethink on the charges for overseas borrowers. I understand the idea is to incentivise working in NZ vs overseas but there needs to be a better way. If the 3 year repayment holiday was interest free if you return at the end of it and work for a minimum period, this would work for me! I think this would be an incentive for a lot of people who are planning to come home at some point, but see the over inflated housing market and massive loan as a huge negative. I am currently living overseas and paying back my student loan via voluntary repayments. I disagree with the fact that overseas borrowers are being charged 6.8% interest because they dont live, work or study in NZ. I think the system should be changed so that if you are making regular repayments on your loan, whether you live in NZ or overseas, that the interest is wiped. I think that this would encourage people in my situation to pay off their loans, rather than simply trying to 'forget' about them as we feel we are being treated unfairly. I understand that loans carry the burden of interest, but it seems unfair that the rate is set so high...especially in the current economic climate. The NZ government may think that they are encouraging people to move back to NZ with the lure of interest free loans, but in reality all it is doing is making us stay away in countries where we can earn more money. With the interest rate set so high I think that the NZ government can forget about getting money out of many overseas based borrowers.

I have never missed one repayment and have been charged interest at 7% from day one. Consequently, I currently have a loan which is effectively 70% interest and slightly more than I ever took out. How are people like me supposed to make a dent in our student loans? No wonder I, along with many other people, have no incentive to come back to New Zealand when we have been hammered with interest charges over the years. Most New Zealanders, whether they go overseas to travel or work, return with enhanced skills that help New Zealand to grow as a country and compete internationally; how is this justification for charging them 7% interest while they are overseas? To me, as they always do, the government and the IRD have missed the point for overseas borrowers and the “guinea pig” generation. In conclusion, the interest on these loans is ridiculous, unjust and unfair, especially given the current benefits New Zealand based borrowers receive. The interest should be written off or reduced! The way student loan case is handled in NZ is absurd. I went to Uni in Auckland and for 5 years no one would give me a job because I was a beginning teacher. This is really frustrating. How can a person be experienced unless and untill they are offered a job. I had to move overseas as it is much easier to get a teaching job in overseas then in NZ. I paid my student loan while I did relief teaching mind you I never got paid during two weeks break and 6 weeks break. I was told that once I move overseas I will have to pay $2000 per month whether I will be working or not! Why should I pay so much when I was not offered a job in NZ. They shoukd not penalise overseas borrowers like this. I did take the 3 year hoilday option but my loan will increase like as if it's a house loan. I think it is not fair to put student loan borrowers under such pressure. there should not be any interest charged at all. Scrap the interest for overseas borrowers. Basically you are penalising people because of where they live. Many New Zealanders want to come back one day and contribute to the economy. What use is a graduate in New Zealand anyway, without the work experience they can get overseas? Why should you be punished for broadening your work experience? I wouldn't be able to do the work I'm doing now for a NZ government department if I had stayed in NZ after I graduated. I paid off (some of) my loan from Australia and hated the hassle of sending money over to the NZ and the extra costs involved. It also made me feel less loyal to NZ that I was being charged interest, while people who were staying in NZ didn't have to pay it. I got over it because I love my country. I'm home now and not paying interest and my loan is being paid off so much faster. Think about it, it makes sense. Imagine if everyone overseas could pay off their loans faster - less admin costs for the IRD and more resources freed up. I live in Oz along with many other kiwis who have student loans. I am now repaying my loan under the amnesty scheme but it took me 9 years to start repaying. Obviously the interest is now huge, more than doubling my initial loan as I was also part of the “guinea pig” generation. I know loads of people who never signed up when the amnesty was on & never intend to pay a cent on their loans. (Big or small). Why wouldn’t you offer a once off collection ‘promotion’ to gather up as much of the cash you’re likely never to see. Something like an interest free payback option. 3/6 month offer of a % interest credit on all loans paid in full during that period. A lot of people would jump at the chance to get rid of it once and for all especially those who currently pay nothing & never intend to. Currently I have a $40,000 loan & pay the minimum $1500 per 6 months which doesn’t even dent my interest. It’s going to take years for the government to get back what I owe, if the loan doesn’t outlive me. If I could pay $25,000 tomorrow to have it gone for good I would. I know we all signed a legal document to pay back with interest (I was 18) but isn’t something better than nothing? Under the current scheme IRD will not see a cent of so many loans, they will just keep getting bigger & the intention to pay will not change unless there a big incentives.

Even if its $2,000 or $5,000 someone owes, isn’t reclaiming even just the principal from such an offer a huge injection of cash that otherwise would never be re-payed. How much cash do you think you could get back in 1 month alone with an offer like that? ...Try it! I agree with the other comments, I live in Australia and have been making the obligatory repayments, last year I paid $2,000 but was charged $1,900 interest, how am I ever going to be able to pay it back? The interest rates are just huge. Where's the incentive for me to make additional payments on the loan, when all I am paying is the interest? It also doesn't encourage me to return to NZ as there's no way I would make as much money as I do over here so it would probably still take me forever to pay off the loan. These are great comments i agree with 'give us a break' and those who mentioned the “guinea pig” situation as i too was charged interest while at uni.. no idea how i was meant to pay that off, then the year the interest free came in - was the year i left NZ!!! I had only just started to make a dent in my capital on my loan and now i am virtually back to where i was when i left uni. And my interest figure is scary.. why should money be made off us when we are trying to get an education and better ourselves which eventually in the long run is going to help NZ. I am always promoting my favourite NZ products to local stores in Australia and am gaining great experience and knowledge that i hope to bring back one day. Unless the interest is scrapped and agree with incentives to make any payment rather than none...(and for it to be easier for overseas borrowers to make payments) then there is more chance we will feel we want to. I too want to come back to NZ one day but at this stage my student loan is a big consideration as to whether i will ever be able to!? Its something that I often think about and wonder how I can better deal with it... A specialist overseas borrower team at IRD might be useful to look into ways people can better manage their loan?! Why do get punished just because we paying off from overseas ???? I really did not want to leave NZ if I could get a job. I know many people who have loans and 95% of them are not paying a cents. And their view was because of the interest rate they will never be able to pay off . we ware charged with interest rate while even studying. On the other hand I am on a very hardship and tried to pay my minimum payment but constantly charged with interest and all other kinds of fine and penalty. Even my parents gave me 10,000 dollars so I can pay voluntary repayment. After all this now my loan amount is more than I took. So the bottom line is : If you are good person in this world – you MUST suffer. Look at those who don’t even have intention to repay. They are enjoying their life. On the other hand I am walking to work in this cold weather, have no savings money to buy even a good warm cloth. no car, no tv, no social life. When ever I save money to buy something, I end up repaying the savings to IRD. Loan is a big burden. By the time I will repay the full amount it will be three times the original. Who knows I might even die by then, because I feel so depressed and sick when I think about it. I had a dream that one day I will be a mum, start of my own family. But not any more. How can I afford a kid when its hard to survive myself. Sometimes I think my biggest mistake was studying in Uni. I wish I did not go to uni and took student loan. Whats the point of getting good education??? Suggestions : 1. Interest write off for overseas based. Why we have to get punished for repaying? If not, than good on those people who forget about the loan and never repay, not getting punished. No repay, no worries. 2. Introduce voluntary repayment bonus. In Australia they give bonus on voluntary repayment. Is there such a good thing exist in NZ? Please let me know. If not please make this happen. I am sure after moving to such a good idea all the people will be more encouraged to repay their loan. It will help the both parties. Bonuses Example: http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?

We would be particularly interested in your comments on: - Did you find the forum easy to use? - Did we explain the proposals in a way that made sense? - What improvements could we make for any future forums? The forum was easy to use. I like the fact that each person's comments were separate and couldn't be linked as a reply to someone else's comments like on blogs. This often results in new threads being started off in the middle of another and duplication of comments. I think the proposals were explained well on the whole, but weren't detailed enough. My main concern is consulting on 'major' and 'minor' repayments, without defining either of those in monetary terms. If 'minor' means $100 or $500, that will make a difference to someone's feedback. There is a real danger in the IRD defining what 'minor' is. When you are strapped for cash, $5 can make a huge difference. An improvement to the forum would be less blurb on the front page and better links to the discussions. I found out by accident that you could view all discussion topics by clicking on the green and pink speech bubbles. The other thing that was annoying was that the same discussion topic came up under several headings and you didn't realise until you had clicked on it and started reading the question. Perhaps you could number topics in future. The forum and discussion is a great initiative and the only disappointment was that not many people commented. I think once you have left study and are working it is hard to empathise with current students. I am working but returning to study next year so the results of your consultation will have an impact on me. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Keep in mind that this proposal could mean that students who work in their holidays, or borrowers who work for part of the year only, might have to make repayments. Go back to proposals jeremy stu ras90 aegordon I have a student loan and think this is fair as long as the compliance burden is not excessive... ie lets make sure its not going to cost the taxpayer more than is made on it Surely it makes little sense for students to have to make compulsory repayments whilst still studying? I think (as a student with a student loan and student allowance) that this penalises those who wish to work during the holidays in order to support themselves during the academic year. If you receive a student allowance you are only allowed to earn $185 pw on top of your allowance (roughly $380pw). Most summer jobs pay more than this every week, so by forcing students into compulsory repayments, you are inhibiting their earning potential during the holidays to the same level as during semester. This provides disincentives for work from a student's point of view and will be an issue for employers trying to attract full-time student summer holiday workers, as students may fail to see the point in workng 50 hours pw and only taking home the pay of 25. From an administrative point of view, a pay-period measure may be the easiest way, but perhaps an amnesty on sompulsory pay period repayments whilst one is still studying (including the summer holidays) through different tax codes for students working through the holidays whilst intending to return to study? I am concerned about how this will effect working parents who may chose to work only part of the year. The new system would unfairly require them to repay their student loan even if their income is under the current annual threshold, which could cause unecessary financial strain on some young families, particularly when childcare costs are also accounted for. I would also be concerned if parental leave payments were eligible for the pay-period threshold, as typically paid parental leave is rather limited. I think the current annual system effectively takes into account a range of different circumstances which may lead employees to work only part of the year (whether full time or part time). It is unfair to make students who are still studying pay back their student loans. Most students try to earn as much as they can over the summer holiday period so that they can pay things like their rent throughout the academic year when they don't have so much time to earn money. The $160 a week from studylink does not go very far on its own and students have to have be able to supplement this somehow.

While I agree that a yearly income threshold is fair, a weekly threshold is not. Many students rely on full time work over the holidays, and work overtime if possible, so that they can finance their next year of study, and only work minimal hours (if any) part time during the academic year. The proposed policy change means there will be a disincentive for students to work extra hours in the holidays (when they are most able to), and more pressure to earn up to weekly threshold during semester. This puts more pressure on students to find part time jobs with flexible hours, which can be difficult (especially considering today's economy), and those students will have less time to study. The net effect of this policy proposal sees less money in students pockets to pay rent and other living expenses. The best off will be those who earn the under the threshold all year round, the worst off will be those who finance their entire year from holiday work - they receive a kick in the guts for trying to help themselves. NO students will actually benefit from this. There is already existing policy to offer a voluntary repayment bonus, those who do have spare money are likely to take that option, students don't need another "tax" taking away more income, which they depend on to live through the academic year. I agree that a weekly threshold disadvantages those students who are trying to work to subsidise thier study. As a student ineligible for a student allowance and recieves no help from their family to study. I rely on every cent that I can earn in my summer holiday break to survive during the next year. My student loan only just covers my rent. I then have to work part time to eat, pay power, have internet and clothe myself. By working over summer I can repay the overdraft that I have incured in the previous year. I then try to save as much as pysically possible for the next year. This means I can try to keep my hours down during semester so I can actually do what I need to do which is Study. If I had to repay my loan over the summer - I would be struggling even more with basic living costs than I am now. Any mid trimester break work that I did to bump up my funds for the coming semester would be reduced - I could not cope. This change would just increase the hardships that are suffered by students who are trying to help themselves through their studies. I think that this pay period threshold is a great idea for those who have finished studying and are working fulltime. How about students being able to have exemptions from this weekly threshold. Lets say a qualification long exemption from the weekly payment threshold? Or it doesn't apply to year's that you are recieving a student loan/allowance. It is a good idea in theory for those that are working, but it severly disadvantages those students who are already struggling to survive and trying to work when they can to help themselves. These proposed changes are unfair and will increase hardship among students. For students ineligible for an allowance, these changes increase the reliance on the student loan living costs to live as it decreases the value of working. For students lucky enough to receive a student allowance, the maximum they can earn from a part-time job is $190 so their income is already limited. This change discourages students from earning extra income during less busy periods in favour of earning a fixed amount every single week. This will only add to the stress of students in busy periods around the end of semesters. Calculating the threshold on a weekly or fortnightly rather than a yearly basis will decrease the net income of most students especially those who work variable hours from week to week. The principle behind student loans and the threshold is that tertiary education increases an individual's income. The state is then 'paid back' when the Student loans consultation forum - Repayment threshold – the income level at which you must start paying back your loan http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/20/\[24/10/2013 10:07:33\] Jul 6th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 rbar martinetherington alanajane Home Why change About Contact us Terms of use FAQs Conditions of website use Privacy Policy Glossary Discussions For more info on government services go to newzealand.govt.nz © Copyright 2009 Inland Revenue individual is economically benefiting from that education. It is a mockery of this principle to increase the rate of repayments from students who have not completed their education and thus not in a position to economically benefit from it. I agree that this proposal will be more efficient for collecting loan repayments from full-time workers who are no longer studying full-time and are earning above the $19K threshold. It is patently unfair on students who need to work full-time over their holidays to earn and save enough supplemental income to pay for rent, food etc during the forthcoming year of study. It is also unfair on part-time/casual workers such as sole parents, who may earn over the threshold in some weeks during the year, but overall come in under the threshold for repayments. It is usually these people who struggle to meet ends meet and unwarrented deductions from their weekly pays will prove a hardship. I believe full-time students should be exempted from repaying student loans until they have completed their course of study and are working and earning a full-time wage above the $19K threshold. In practical terms the repayment threshold is already implemented on a pay- period basis. It currently applies to any employee declaring one of the M SL, ME SL, S SL, SH SL or ST SL tax codes on their IR330 (tax code declaration), based on their expected annual earnings being over the annual repayment threshold. If the repayment threshold is to be implemented on a pay-period basis regardless of the employee’s annual earnings then all that is required is to remove the questions, “Is your annual income from all sources likely to be more than the student loan repayment threshold?” and “Is your income from your highest paid job likely to be over the student loan repayment threshold?” from the IR330. This change will have no impact on payroll software. There will be no extra compliance costs for employers, and no reduction in compliance costs either. It will result in less cash in the hand for those who have annual earnings under the annual repayment threshold but have fluctuating or periodic earnings and sometimes earn over the pay-period threshold during the year. If these ‘extra’ repayments exceed $500 per year then they will benefit from the student loan repayment bonus. To retain equity between employees and self-employed, I recommend the IR330 remains as is, so that those employees expecting to earn less than the annual threshold do not have to make repayments from their wages during the time they work. They can always choose to if they want. I think there needs to be more of an incentive to pay back the loan faster... the voluntary repayment bonus is great but in all honesty if I pay back $500 on my own accord what is a $50 write off a $38,000 loan.

During studies, students should be encouraged to earn as much as they can during the holiday perioud in order to support themselves during the academic year. Normal tax deducted from your pay packet is never full and final. There is a process to correct any imblances/errors due to changes in circumstances at the end of the year. I think it is unfair not to have this for your student loan. Maybe this is okay for those that at the end of the year have earned over a threshold, but for those on limited incomes anyhow this is disadvantages them even further. Perhaps there is room for this approach, in combination with an exemption for those on an annual income less than the existing repayment threshold. If you know you are going to be under the threshold at year end, then you don't pay regardless of income in the shorter pay intervals. If you know you are going to be over the threshold, you are automatically subject to pay interval deductions. If you are unsure if you will be over or under, you can opt in to pay interval deductions. I agree with mjc, however, that reliance on the employer and PAYE to get it right is not realistic, and there are likely to be corrections etc from time to time. I agree with bartybird. If you know you won't be earning over the threshold for the year, then you probably can't afford to make PAYE pay-period deductions. Keep it the way it is, with the option to opt-in to repayments.

Go back to proposals PhilipA kris While this change might simplify administration of the student loan process, it will have a negative impact on students. This is effectively a 10c raise in the effective marginal tax rate faced by people who are some of the lowest earners in society. The proposed weekly threshold is $367 before tax. If a student works for 40 hours a week at the minimum wage of $12.50 they will make $500. This will mean they will have to repay approximately $14 per week towards their student loan. While $14 may not sound like much money, it would make a noticeable difference for those who are struggling to get by. Students should be encouraged to seek work and fund their own studies rather than relying on government provided living costs and allowances. The proposed changes provide a disincentive to work. The changes also may provide students with an incentive to game the system by taking under the table cash jobs (also evading tax), have employers spread their pay over weeks they did not work, or to pay their parents/spouses for work performed by the students. The changes are inequitable in that someone who works 20 hours a week for twice as long is better off than someone who works 40 hours a week. There is no reasonable basis for discriminating between people who prefer to focus on their studies and earn money in a concentrated period, such as the holidays, and those who prefer to earn money throughout the year. A better solution would be to shift to a weekly PAYE threshold for all borrowers, but retaining the current yearly threshold for people who are still studying. In Background section 2.1 of the discussion document, it is stated that most borrowers have finished their study. It would only be a minority who would need a special exemption as they are still studying. Obviously there would be difficulties with working out who counts as "still studying", but I'm sure it would be possible. I agree with all the points PhilipA made. IRD does not discriminate (with regard to tax) between people who earn $20k in 3 months or $20k over the entire year (although there may be a square up at the end of the year), so why should it be any different with regard to student loan repayments? No group of students are going to benefit from this, indeed, the worst off (those who finance their entire year from 3 months of holiday work) could potentially be $1000 worse off, if they had a particularly well paying holiday job, or worked excessive hours. Of particular issue is that over the holiday period, students may opt to work instead of taking their holiday entitlement, and instead have this paid as a lump sum at the end of employment. Some students will also have scholarships with their employers, which most likely get added to their last PAYE at the end of the 3 months employment. Both of these already get HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation forum Student loans consultation forum - Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/22/\[24/10/2013 10:07:44\] Jul 6th 2009 Jul 6th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 Jul 8th 2009 Jul 14th 2009 habbott13 BANG damonharrison07 Lys Tegan taxed, and now students will see even less of it, as their last weeks' pay could be hundreds (or thousands with a scholarship) more than their normal weekly pay (and well over the pitiful weekly threshold). I agree with both of the above comments. Students already struggle to find adequate finances to support themselves during the academic year, and by forcing them to make compulsory payments from their weekly earnings over the summer, it will become even more difficult. It will be also be difficult for students who have to also work during the year, whether it be demonstrating or as a residential advisor (RA) at the halls. They will be put under more pressure as they will need to work more hours to earn the same amount and it could jeopardise their academic studies. I actually think this is a good idea. Student debt has been getting way out of hand for far too long because it is so easy to get a loan and so easy to avoid paying it back. I have my reservations about this Government but I agree that something needs to be done about student debt and I see this as one logical step. Getting into the habit of paying off a loan as you go along is a good idea - you don't get a 100% loan on a car, drive the car into the ground over 9 years and then start making repayments, nor do you get a mortgage and be exempt from paying it off while you live in the house, so why should it be different with education? I lived on $170 a week for years while I was studying ($150 loan and $20 from summer savings), I saved most of what I earned over summer (half-time work as I was volunteering 0.5 FTE) and after living similarly and saving my earnings I am in a position at age 24 to write off my loan of $40,000. I'm an exception not the rule but seriously, if I managed to do that then there are MANY other students out there who can cut back on their spending and use it to get rid of their loan. I can see the the potential upsides of the proposal (i.e. Getting out of debt WITH THE IRD quicker) but I don't see how it will help in other aspects of student's lives. I agree completely with the above posters. I currently work two part time jobs and study full time and don't even have the money for text books after paying for essentials (petrol, food, part of bills etc), not to mention being limited in my income to $180 due to my student allowance. (I would need to work an extra 11 hours a week to actually make more money than I do now.) The limit should either be increased or this should be an option for people with lower expenses. Another thing to consider would be students who are becoming parents, their incomes will certainly need to be as high as they possibly can without more penalties. The most obvious problem with this proposal is that many students cram their entire years income into a few short weeks earning during the holidays. Without the luxury of being able to live at home with the parents while studying, it's really difficult to balance full time study with working enough during the week to pay for general living expenses - especially if you're not eligible for student allowance. Many students attempt to work (and save) as much as possible over breaks from study (such as over summer) in order to survive the busy study periods that restrict their ability to work. They may earn what seems a significant weekly amount during these times, but very little annually. It seems incredibly unfair to make these people make greater repayments when in actual fact they are only scraping through as it is...

People who are trying to keep thier student loans to a minimim and save for books and accomodation during the holidays should not be penilised. I find this very unfair that the government is trying to make us pay back our student loans while we are still in the middle of our studies. This just put more pressure on the students during the year. Students should be left alone untill they are working full time permanently not for a short number of weeks. People work during the holidays to keep themselves busy. This is going to restrict how much work they can do a week this may also put pressure on the work places students are at as during this time bussiness is up and they need more staff. Terrible idea. Life is hard enough as a student. There is no reason to require repayment ahead of gaining satisfactory post-study employment. After all, these students are likely to make a considerable contribution to the economy upon completion of study, and will be in a position to make regular repayments on the loan at that time. Why try and squeeze them, when it's a matter of waiting 3 or 4 years. Nope - bad idea. BANG says it is a good idea, because you learn responsibility, but it's not like anyone has a choice to get a student loan. If you didn't have to get it, you wouldn't! You aren't teaching anyone good money habits by coming down hard on them, just placing more obstacles in the way of people who are trying to get an education. I'm returning to study after an 8-year break and all this is adding to the stresses of going from being a full wage earner to a poor student. I don't expect a huge handout, but I do expect to be able to afford food, power, and shelter while I study. Having to pay off my loan if I work in the breaks just adds to the stress.

In effect, this would mean that Inland Revenue won't worry too much about small errors, and won't wait until year end to make corrections. Go back to proposals jacs15 smcn001 martinetherington I think it is a good plan, but what happens with larger errors? My partner was stung with a large student loan and tax bill due to his employer completely screwing it up (and this is an international comapany too). We also had conflicting info as to whether we had to pay or not from the IRD call centre. Having this clear on what is required and having some leeway when the individual is not at fault would make sense. I think this is a good idea too. However I also agree the larger error situation is an issue. My previous employer overpaid by several hundreds of dollars despite my request to cease payment probably 3yrs ago now. I have had to request a refund from the IRD, and despite sending in 3x completed rapid refund forms over that time ... nothing! A refund for overpayment at the end of the loan should be automatic. IR only receives information from employers once a month. This information includes the total earnings for the month, and the total student loan deductions for the month. E.g.: 1. An employee paid weekly earns the following gross amounts: $500, $500, $100 and $200. Total $1300. Student loan deductions are $13.30, $13.30, $0.00 and $0.00. Total $26.60. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an overpayment for the month since the total gross is less than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. 2. An employee paid weekly earns the following gross amounts: $360, $360, $360, $360 and $360. Total $1800. Student loan deductions are nil for each of the five weekly pays. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an underpayment of $20.97 for the month since the total gross is more than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. 3. Worst case scenario: An employee paid fortnightly earns the following gross amounts: $733.98, $733.98 and $733.98. Total $2201.94. Student loan deductions are nil for the three pays. These deductions are correct but as far as IR goes it appears to be an underpayment of $61.16 for the month since the total gross is more than the monthly threshold of $1590.33. Would these be detected as PAYE errors or just as a minor over/underpayments? In practice I expect there to be frequent apparent over or under payments which have in fact been deducted correctly on a pay-period basis. Therefore only major discrepancies need to be checked as possible PAYE errors. Where a PAYE error is detected maiking corrections for future payments only is a good idea.

This takes away choice for the taxpayer and I do not support that approach. While I appreciate that the government is trying to recover loans, I believe individuals need to retain control over their income and where it is directed. This question is flawed as you haven't defined what 'major' and 'minor' are measured as. I agree with making corrections for future payments, instead of penalising someone for their employer's stuff-up. But I agree with bartybird that people should have control over their own money and where it goes. Overpayments over a certain amount, say $100, should be able to be refunded if requested. $100 seems small, but that's a power bill for the month, or groceries for a week. Waving minor underpayments would be great, a year or so ago I was required to pay $20 and so many cents .... took alot of effort to sort it out and checking it got paid. Would have been nice to just have written off as a requirement for that year.

This should mean ex students will not receive unpleasent surprise letters asking for repayment money that they should have paid during the year. Very good. I don't support this idea if it is reliant upon the proposal to take out repayments based on shorter income intervals (weekly, fortnightly or monthly thresholds). As stated in the related discussion, this will only hit the already vulnerable, and during a recession it makes no sense to make life harder for those at the bottom of the income range. I agree with bartybird. If this is only because of the pay-period deductions, then no. I'm not sure what problem this is addressing. Once people leave study they either go overseas and have a payment holiday, or enter the NZ workforce and immediately start to pay off their loan. So there shouldn't be huge discrepancies in the amount you owe. I think that the year end square up process is essential! I use it to ensure that my employee is paying my deductions on my behalf etc., and to check track of how much I owe. I also use it as my once yearly check that IRD and writing off my interest for me, many times this does not happend automatically. If the year end process was removed then I would have one more thing to worry about each year.

Also would people who have not met there repayment requirements still get a bill, or would it work like the tax summary e.g. if you don't enquire you do not have to pay.

I don't know what classifies as a minor/major overpayment to most people but personally the $1900 in overpayments I get refunded each year means a heck of a lot especially when my repayment obligations are set at around $3,300 pa (thats almost 2/3rds over what I need to pay). If you want to take away the option of receiving the refund then the CORRECT amount needs to be taken out throughout the year...... Refund option should be retained. Even if it is a minor amount, it may make a big difference to the recipient however, it will not change alot in the repayment period. The employee should have control over that decision of taking the refund or applying the overpaid amount towards their loan.

Currently when a special student loan deduction rate is issued it is a flat rate applied to all earnings, not just earnings over the annual threshold. Will this continue to be the case or will the special student loan deduction rate always be for earnings over the annual threshold, or could it be either? From a compliance point of view I’d prefer it to remain as a flat rate on all earnings for the pay period as it is now. This is the simpler option for those doing manual payrolls. This would be good. I have been in that very situation where when I begun working I ended up underpaying my student loan payments. To my surprise I was penalised for it and large amounts were deducted from my pay for it. At present, there is the capability to make payment arrangements to clear year end underpayment amounts and those arrangements are within the control of the employee, made in consultation with IRD based on income level. Trying to manage this through PAYE is an extra burdern on the employer in terms of administration and reduces the employee's ability to manage their own income.

If it is less than $1000 but higher than the ‘major’ underpayment threshold then a special student loan deduction rate will be issued to claw back the underpayment.. I'm not sure what this means?

He will be working full-time and earning above the repayment threshold each pay period. His employer makes repayment deductions out of Danny's income each pay- period. Under the current system, his repayments would be squared-up at year- end and he would have to pay any outstanding amounts or receive a refund of any overpayment. Under the new proposals, Danny can check the balance of his student loan online to monitor his progress in paying it off and to ensure the deductions are correct. He doesn't have to do anything at the end of the year. Discussion: Repayment threshold - the income level at which you must start paying back your loan Discussion: Payments deducted (if over threshold) Discussion: Year-end process Example: Part-time worker and also studying Maia works part-time eight hours a week while attending university. She is paid $200 per week. Under the current system, her yearly income and any student loan liability would be determined at year-end. As Maia's income is under the annual repayment threshold, (currently $19,084 per annum), she has no student loan liability. Under the new proposals, her weekly wages would be checked against the weekly repayment threshold ($367 for the current year). As Maia's income is under the repayment threshold, she won't have to make repayments, nor get a bill at year- end. If there are weeks where her income exceeds the weekly repayment threshold, she would make repayments only in those weeks. Discussion: Repayment threshold - the income level at which you must start paying back your loan Example: Working while studying Lisa is a university student and works during the Christmas break. She earns $900 a week for the eight weeks she works, and has an annual income of $7,200. Under the current system, Lisa won't have to make repayments as her annual income does not exceed the $19,084 annual repayment threshold. Under the new proposals, Lisa's weekly income for the period she works will be above the repayment threshold. Over the Christmas break, Lisa will have $53.30 deducted from her pay for her student loan repayments. This is calculated as follows: Lisa's weekly total gross income $900, less $367 repayment threshold = $533 x 10%. Discussion: Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold Example: Decisions to work and study Tariq is a student in his fourth year of study. He takes a year off and works full- time, earning $600 per week, to help cover his living expenses when he returns to finish his studies the following year. Tariq also has the option of studying six months and working six months for the next two years. He would prefer to take a year off and work full-time. Under the current rules, Tariq might be more inclined to work only part of both years to maintain an annual income below the annual repayment threshold so he HomeEmployeesSelf-employedOverseasOnline servicesSearch Student loans consultation Student Loans Consultation http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/index.php?page\_id=employeescasestudies.php\[24/10/2013 10:08:25\] wouldn't have to make student loan repayments. Under the proposed changes, this wouldn't be a consideration. He would be required to make payments while working in both cases and the amount would be essentially the same, assuming no change in the repayment threshold over the two-year period. Discussion: Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold Example: Repayment error Underpayment Arjun has finished studying. He now works full-time for a small employer who has a manual payroll system. He is paid weekly. When Arjun started his job his employer miscalculated his student loan repayments for the first month and he now owes $500 in repayment deductions. The employer did not spot the error when preparing the PAYE return. Under the current system, Arjun would be sent a bill for $500 after the end of the year. Under the proposed changes, the error may be spotted by Inland Revenue through its ongoing monitoring, or Arjun might notice it when checking his account online. Once brought to our attention, Inland Revenue would contact Arjun's employer to correct the deduction amount for the future. We would consider the problem corrected and take no further action. Overpayment Had Arjun overpaid by $500, the new proposals mean that Inland Revenue would contact Arjun's employer to correct the deduction amount for the future and would apply the overpayment to his student loan balance. Arjun's student loan would then be paid off a bit faster. Under the current system, if Arjun notices the overpayment and requests a summary of earnings and a personal tax summary from Inland Revenue, he could get the overpayment refunded to him at year-end. Otherwise, it would be applied to his loan balance. Discussion: PAYE employer error Discussion: Overpaid at year-end Example: Major under-deduction of student loan repayments Kath has finished studying, works full-time and is paid weekly. When Kath started her job she forgot to tell her employer to deduct student loan repayments and now owes $1,000 in repayment deductions. Under the current system, this error would not be noticed until year-end, when Kath would be sent a bill for $1,000. Under the new proposals, Inland Revenue would spot the error and talk to Kath and her employer to arrange repayment. The money would then be collected from Kath's pay over the next six months by deducting an extra $40 each week. At the end of the year Kath will have repaid the debt without having had to repay a lump sum, and without incurring penalties. Discussion: Underpaid at year-end Example: Income from a second job Peter has two jobs. He receives $326 a week from his main job and $77 a week from his second job. Under the new proposals, the weekly repayment threshold is $367. Peter has $41 of "unused" repayment threshold per week from his main job ($367 minus $326). He applies this unused repayment threshold to his second job: Peter's weekly income from the second job:$77 Minus his unused repayment threshold:$41 $36 He pays $3.60, or 10% of $36 (his secondary income in excess of the repayment Student Loans Consultation http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/index.php?page\_id=employeescasestudies.php\[24/10/2013 10:08:25\] threshold), each week, rather than $7.70, or 10% of $77 (his total secondary weekly salary). If he didn't apply his unused repayment threshold from his main job to his second job, the extra $4.10 ($7.70 minus $3.60) would be applied to his loan balance each week. Discussion: Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold Example: Interest and dividend income Recently Sally used some of her savings to buy some shares in a company. At the end of the year the company paid her a dividend of $500. Also, the cash she had in her savings account generated another $800 in interest. This gave her a total of $1300 in interest and dividend income. Under the current system, Sally would have to file at year-end and make repayments in respect of this extra income. Under the proposed system, her income will be below the proposed new threshold. This means that she will not have to make any extra student loan repayments.

The repayment threshold will be set on a pay-period basis – weekly, fortnightly, four weekly or monthly – rather than on an annual basis. This means if you work for only part of the year, you have to make payments towards your loan during that period of time only. This is consistent with the principle that student loans should be repaid at the time when people have the money to repay them, not at the end of the year. Discussion: Repayment threshold - the income level at which you must start paying back your loan Major PAYE errors would be identified and corrected earlier. This means fewer and less significant overpayments and underpayments. If you underpaid, your future deductions could be adjusted to correct the error. There would be no lump sum due or late payment penalties. Most overpayments would be applied to your student loan balance. You could seek a refund of overpayments only if the amount was significant and due to an employer error. Discussion: PAYE employer error Discussion: Overpaid at year-end Discussion: Underpaid at year-end Borrowers with secondary jobs At present, if you have more than one job and the income from the main one is less than the repayment threshold, it's not necessary to have loan repayments deducted from the pay from any of your jobs. At the end of the tax year, your income from all jobs is totalled and, if it is over the repayment threshold by more than $20, we send you an end-of-year assessment. Under the proposed changes, if you had a second job, you could choose to apply the "unused" repayment threshold from your first job (the difference between your income from the first job and the repayment threshold) to your second job. Otherwise, loan deductions would be made from the first dollar of income from the second job. Discussion: Borrowers currently below annual repayment threshold Borrowers who have interest and dividend income Under the proposed changes, if you earn interest and dividend income below a combined threshold set by Inland Revenue (say $1,500 or less), you will not be subject to repayment obligations on this income. If your interest and dividend income exceeded the combined threshold, Inland Revenue will send you a student loan assessment.

What services would you like to have available online to help you manage your account? Go back to proposals ruralgirl administrator rhwilburn kris Why is the voluntary payment bonus as explained on your main IRD website not listed here for policy consultation? Thanks for your question. Parliament is currently considering a bill providing for the voluntary repayment bonus. The matter is best addressed through that process and that is why discussion is not included on this point in this forum. I am a software engineer by trade. I would like to see your online interent banking style payment system interact with other banking systems as a webservice. For example: I login to my interent banking with my bank (e.g. ANZ) and I can see my account balances for various accounts like VISA, Savings, etc. I would like it to be possible to have my student loan account show on that internet banking like my VISA does. My visa is latent in terms of showing the balance which is fine. The advantage of this to me, is that I can 1) see my fairly current balance. 2) I can easily transfer money to my student loan. I am aware that it would be up to banks to implement their side of things, however if you find one bank that will do it, all other banks will likely be inclined to do it. Personally I think the fact that you are asking for public feedback on proposed changes is an excellent idea, and should be an ongoing thing, rather than a one off. Without having the student loan seem like a loan, ie appearing on my internet banking, I am likely to just not worry about it and let the compulsory payments take care of it because its a hasle to make a small one off payment. To be honest, the only change that should be made is like rhwilburn says, better internet services. I know there are already online services for IRD and Studylink, and some banks have online features which allow you to make tax payments easier, but the system as a whole is lacking (just look and the truckload of snail mail you get from studylink throughout the year). Integrating everything into one place would be great, as well as showing IRD and student loan statuses on online banking websites (bonus points for allowing money to be transferred to them just as you would to your other suffixes). The rest of the student loan policy does not need changing, as no students will actually benefit from it.

My student loan repayments would have my loan paid off in 2 months. This is a real pain on several fronts and maybe a lower repayment percentage (3c in the dollar for example), as this will mean easier budgeting and manage house cash flow for my partner and I to maintain mortgage payments and spread my study loan payments over the year, as in the near future we will be going down to one income, but since there is no household income splitting at present, the current 10 cents in the dollar threshold is harder. Ideally if there were a different repayment say 3c in the dollar for loans under $2000 for example, as this will help single income families where either one partner or both are studying with one income stream. This may be a pain to adminster, but will mean more full time workers who are studying part time can better themselves while the recession is on, allowing more qualified people when the recession finishes. I'd really like a note on the statement (or somewhere easily accessible) that does a prediction of when I'll pay the loan off. This could be based on the average of the past 3 payments or something equally suitable. Paragraph 3.7 of the discussion document is of concern. Firstly it assumes someone with more than one job would have consistent earnings. These days this assumption is rarely true, especially amongst students and low income part-time workers. Therefore it would be difficult (or rare) for someone to accurately determine how much unused threshold they can apply to a second job. Secondly to implement this I expect the IR330 will need to be changed with the addition of a box to enter a threshold to apply (if any) for the S SL tax code. This will increase the compliance costs for employers. Employers who pay manually will need to remember to reduce the student loan repayment from the tax tables by 10% of the threshold each pay. This increases the room for errors. It will also require a change to payroll software. There will need to be an additional field for the employer to enter the threshold to apply if the S SL tax code is used by an employee. Student loan repayment calculations will need to be modified, (i.e. made more complicated) to apply this threshold. This change would not be difficult, but it does add another bit of extra complexity. The amounts involved will generally be small. The worst case scenario would be 367/2 \* 0.1 = $18.35 per week. I predict the average to be closer to $5 per week. So in line with the goal of encouraging earlier repayment, keeping things simple and minimising compliance costs I’d recommend dropping this feature. I don't see the relevance of getting two statements a year. I'd rather be able to log in and check progress myself, and get an end-of-year statement so I can see how much I've paid off. I'd like a quicker process and less form-filling to change my personal details. I would be interested to know if IRD have considered a progressive repayment rate for student loans. I.e. the repayment percentage could increase at different levels of income. For example: Income Marginal repayment rate Student loans consultation forum - Any other changes? http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/47/\[24/10/2013 10:08:36\] Home Why change About Contact us Terms of use FAQs Conditions of website use Privacy Policy Glossary Discussions For more info on government services go to newzealand.govt.nz © Copyright 2009 Inland Revenue $0-$19,084 0% $19,085-$30,000 5% $30,001-$50,000 10% $50,001-$70,000 15% $70,001- 20% While this could increase the risk of students going overseas, it could also have a positive impact on repayment rates, and also make things easier for those on lower incomes. Higher admin costs too though, perhaps could be more integrated with the rest of the tax system (including matching the repayment rate thresholds with the income tax thresholds)? An alternative would be to increase the repayment rate depending on the size of the loan. One could argue (although it would need to be confirmed by the actual statistics) that in theory the higher the loan size the higher the income that person would be earning. Doing it this way would also help out people in gcornes' position. I also strongly agree with rhwilburn's suggestion on incorporating student loans with private banking systems, though there might be system integration and privacy issues (i.e. banks knowing how big people's student loans are) that could be challenging.

If you don't make your first and second loan instalments on time, you'll be charged interest on the amount due from the dates they were due, rather than a late payment penalty from the final of the three due dates.

I think it would be easier to manage if the interest rate wasnt going to be so high. For some of us it is hard to try and find spare money to send home especially as it takes a while to get on top of things when first moving to a new country!!! I think this is a terrible idea. Incentives, not penalties will be the only way to get people based overseas to try and pay in full. I cannot afford to make any payments back to NZ at the moment and increasing the interest just pushes the likelihood of me being able to do so even further away. I agree that it is difficult to make the payments from overseas. If the aim in charging higher penalties is to encourage people to return home then why not offer an interest write-off if you return within the 3 year repayment holiday and work in NZ for a minimum time. The repayment holiday is only available once so you would have to pay interest and penalties if you went back overseas, but it allows people to go on an OE, increase their CV selling power with overseas experience, and then encourages them to come home and put back into the economy. In saying that, the interest rates are too high, going overseas to earn is sometimes the only option if you ever want to scrape up a deposit on a house too! I agree that it should be easier to make student loan repayments from overseas. How about web-based system that accepts foreign credit cards?

I also agree that incentives rather than increased penalties are a better approach to getting payments made on time. I would like better advice on overseas payment options from Inland Revenue. I agree with Timmeh and Wilson. Incentives is more encouraging and also a better approach. I began making student loan payments from overseas via credit card and International online net banking and both payment options were discouraging, because not only do we pay for bank fees/ surcharges from origin and also at final receiving point/ branch. The thought of having interest ontop of our student loan and then having to take into consideration bank fees/ surcharges for overseas payments can be daunting. It seems like it is one step forward and two steps back. More advice on simple overseas payment options from Inland Revenue is a must. Thank you for commenting on the topic of replacing the current penalties with an interest rate for overseas-based borrowers. You have highlighted an issue with the way we have worded the question and we would like to take the opportunity to clarify the question. The original question was: "What do you think about doing away with late payment penalties, and replacing them with a higher rate of interest? This would be applied to borrowers who haven't kept up with their repayments. The current late payment penalties are 19.56% p.a., and the interest under this proposal would be lower than this." This has been replaced with a new question: "What do you think about replacing the penalty for late loan payments — which is currently equivalent to 19.56% per annum — with a significantly lower interest rate? The new rate would be somewhere between the 6.8% rate that overseas borrowers currently face and the penalty of 19.56%." Thank you for pointing this out to us. To the administrator, I was emailed about your wording change of the topic, so it may be important for you to know that this wording change has no bearing on my original comment. To clarify my first comment: The standard interest rate (without any penalties for late payments) would be 6.8%. The interest rate applied to those who are late on payments might hypothetically be 10%. Here is my point: if someone is late on a payment and the interest rate applied to their loan becomes 10% accordingly, then it may be wise that the system would change their interest rate back to 6.8% once they have caught up on their payments. If this didn't happen (ie they were stuck with 10% interest from that point onward) then this may discourage them from paying off their student loan. If you are living overseas, then you are excempt from the interest write-off that NZ residents get, so your student loan continues to grow. If you miss a payment and are charged a penalty, does it really matter much, considering that if your loan is a substantial one it is probably growing at a faster rate than you can pay it anyhow? The change in penalty probably doesn't matter much to people who are not making their payments. I do agree that incentives might make a difference though. If I could get 3 years worth of interest written off, I'd consider returning home before the end of my 3 year payment holiday.

Have found the secure email system good but sometime would prefer a more personalised repsonse and would be better to go to our own email if possible. Also if the statements could be sent to email that would be extremely useful. thanks I can only echo the above sentiments, an online based system would be fantastic and would allow me to keep track of what is going on with my account. I haven't seen a letter or have any idea of the state of my student loan for close to 5 years now! I fully endorse this. Being on the other side of the world there is no way I am calling the IRD and waiting on hold spending money! Internet banking has made banking so much easier, it is the logical step. I would love to actually follow what is going on with my loan... Agree with all the above. An online system is the logical step forward as it would make staying on top of student loans so much easier, especially from Europe where the c.12 hour time differences make calling NZ during business hours fairly difficult. This is a wonderful idea. As an overseas borrower I would like to be able to access all of my student loan and IRD account details, and to work with them in the same way that I do my NZ banking online. I'd like to be able to cancel paper letters, view account balances, and see when payments are due by. Most importantly I would love to be able to transfer money online directly from my overseas bank account to my IRD account, rather than having to transfer to my NZ bank account first.

Also be great if communication sent by the IRD would go directly to my email address. The more online functions the better! I also think IRD should look at some incentive for overseas repayers, such as if I pay say $1000 above my requirement the IRD rewards us such as the interest write off currently for residents, that would help many of us to pay these loans off quicker? I agree that online comms is a great move. Further, given the push from the likes of the retirement commisioner with the sorted.com website a facility to calculate an approximate end date for loan payments would be really cool. It helps people focus on goals (or perhaps helps make repayment obligations along with other considerations more realistic). Sorted may also be interested in targeting people nearing the completion of loan repayments as this could well be an excellent time (given the income previously committed to loan repayments that will shortly be available) to suggest future retirement plannig eg kiwisaver. If I had internet banking and if I could have used the internet to deal with IRD it may have saved me the grief I now have and the situation of not wanting to pay them back the rest of what I supposedly now owe. Last year they increased what I owed from $3000 to $7900 because they decided after 7.5 years that I was now considered an overseas student for the whole period despite having property in NZ, a child under 16 whom I was paying child support for and a bank account and income tax being paid, The extra interest is despite the fact I had been making regular payments and had not missed payment dates on more than maybe three payments in 8 years and I was paying at a rate far above what I had been asked to pay! How many NZ students can say the same? Yes IT IS nearly $4000 in INTREST! Are they going to get it? No. Would they have got the rest of their money if not for this? Yes. Now the point is mute as I don't have an income, I don't have a child under 16 in NZ, I don't have NZ property anymore, I don't have a job and I don't have the same desire to be an honest and upstanding NZer. I did want to get home some time, but the IRD have KOed that. I love the country but the IRD not so much!!! Go online. Keep it simple, make it work. I live in Australia and have successfully been paying my loan with the current system by using my credit card. The only problem I had was with the ird site changing their site map several times and moving the payment section, which increasingly became harder find on the website even after a search. This issue has been resolved. I can also appreciate that the IRD Bank has recently dropped their percentage loading on credit card payments, so when I load up my card I don't have additional fees charged to another bank on top of interest. Here's my problem - I have on multiple occasions emailed the enquires section and never recieved a response! Not even an automatic response.

He checks his student loan balance online while he's away. Under the current system, if Manu needs to speak to an Inland Revenue officer he needs to make sure that he calls during Inland Revenue's office hours. This could be inconvenient for him given international time differences. It could also be costly for him to have to make international calls. If Manu plans to move around a lot, it could be difficult for Inland Revenue to send him mail. Under the new proposals, he can go online and manage his account whenever it suits him. Discussion: Who manages my loan? Example: Non-payment of loan while overseas Peggy graduated and went on her OE three years ago. The three-year repayment holiday Peggy arranged before she left has recently ended, and she now has a repayment obligation. She does not make payment. Rather than the late payment penalties of 1.5% per month that currently apply (which add up to 19.56% per annum), Peggy is charged a higher interest rate on the missed payment. This rate will be higher than the current 6.8% rate applying to overseas-based borrowers, but lower than the annual late payment penalty rate of 19.56%.

Go back to proposals tamatea jacs15 annap The\_Forgotten Interest charges for overseas borrowers should be CANCELLED! I am paying back my loan under the amnesty scheme and meeting my obligations, but due to interest charges I am not making any impact on the loan capital. I hope to return to live in NZ one day, but this idea of charging overseas based borrowers interest means I will end up with an ever increasing loan whichh makes this return more and more difficult. As one of the 'guinea pig' generation I was charged interest on my loan while studying and my loan has increased exponentially over the years. Now that the goalposts have moved, borrowers from my generation who have moved overseas to try and pay off their loan are seeing no benefit at all. An unfair and unjust system in summary. Stop interest charges and let people start paying their capital instead of being marginalised and exiled. I think there should be a rethink on the charges for overseas borrowers. I understand the idea is to incentivise working in NZ vs overseas but there needs to be a better way. If the 3 year repayment holiday was interest free if you return at the end of it and work for a minimum period, this would work for me! I think this would be an incentive for a lot of people who are planning to come home at some point, but see the over inflated housing market and massive loan as a huge negative. I am currently living overseas and paying back my student loan via voluntary repayments. I disagree with the fact that overseas borrowers are being charged 6.8% interest because they dont live, work or study in NZ. I think the system should be changed so that if you are making regular repayments on your loan, whether you live in NZ or overseas, that the interest is wiped. I think that this would encourage people in my situation to pay off their loans, rather than simply trying to 'forget' about them as we feel we are being treated unfairly. I understand that loans carry the burden of interest, but it seems unfair that the rate is set so high...especially in the current economic climate. The NZ government may think that they are encouraging people to move back to NZ with the lure of interest free loans, but in reality all it is doing is making us stay away in countries where we can earn more money. With the interest rate set so high I think that the NZ government can forget about getting money out of many overseas based borrowers.

I have never missed one repayment and have been charged interest at 7% from day one. Consequently, I currently have a loan which is effectively 70% interest and slightly more than I ever took out. How are people like me supposed to make a dent in our student loans? No wonder I, along with many other people, have no incentive to come back to New Zealand when we have been hammered with interest charges over the years. Most New Zealanders, whether they go overseas to travel or work, return with enhanced skills that help New Zealand to grow as a country and compete internationally; how is this justification for charging them 7% interest while they are overseas? To me, as they always do, the government and the IRD have missed the point for overseas borrowers and the “guinea pig” generation. In conclusion, the interest on these loans is ridiculous, unjust and unfair, especially given the current benefits New Zealand based borrowers receive. The interest should be written off or reduced! The way student loan case is handled in NZ is absurd. I went to Uni in Auckland and for 5 years no one would give me a job because I was a beginning teacher. This is really frustrating. How can a person be experienced unless and untill they are offered a job. I had to move overseas as it is much easier to get a teaching job in overseas then in NZ. I paid my student loan while I did relief teaching mind you I never got paid during two weeks break and 6 weeks break. I was told that once I move overseas I will have to pay $2000 per month whether I will be working or not! Why should I pay so much when I was not offered a job in NZ. They shoukd not penalise overseas borrowers like this. I did take the 3 year hoilday option but my loan will increase like as if it's a house loan. I think it is not fair to put student loan borrowers under such pressure. there should not be any interest charged at all. Scrap the interest for overseas borrowers. Basically you are penalising people because of where they live. Many New Zealanders want to come back one day and contribute to the economy. What use is a graduate in New Zealand anyway, without the work experience they can get overseas? Why should you be punished for broadening your work experience? I wouldn't be able to do the work I'm doing now for a NZ government department if I had stayed in NZ after I graduated. I paid off (some of) my loan from Australia and hated the hassle of sending money over to the NZ and the extra costs involved. It also made me feel less loyal to NZ that I was being charged interest, while people who were staying in NZ didn't have to pay it. I got over it because I love my country. I'm home now and not paying interest and my loan is being paid off so much faster. Think about it, it makes sense. Imagine if everyone overseas could pay off their loans faster - less admin costs for the IRD and more resources freed up. I live in Oz along with many other kiwis who have student loans. I am now repaying my loan under the amnesty scheme but it took me 9 years to start repaying. Obviously the interest is now huge, more than doubling my initial loan as I was also part of the “guinea pig” generation. I know loads of people who never signed up when the amnesty was on & never intend to pay a cent on their loans. (Big or small). Why wouldn’t you offer a once off collection ‘promotion’ to gather up as much of the cash you’re likely never to see. Something like an interest free payback option. 3/6 month offer of a % interest credit on all loans paid in full during that period. A lot of people would jump at the chance to get rid of it once and for all especially those who currently pay nothing & never intend to. Currently I have a $40,000 loan & pay the minimum $1500 per 6 months which doesn’t even dent my interest. It’s going to take years for the government to get back what I owe, if the loan doesn’t outlive me. If I could pay $25,000 tomorrow to have it gone for good I would. I know we all signed a legal document to pay back with interest (I was 18) but isn’t something better than nothing? Under the current scheme IRD will not see a cent of so many loans, they will just keep getting bigger & the intention to pay will not change unless there a big incentives.

Even if its $2,000 or $5,000 someone owes, isn’t reclaiming even just the principal from such an offer a huge injection of cash that otherwise would never be re-payed. How much cash do you think you could get back in 1 month alone with an offer like that? ...Try it! I agree with the other comments, I live in Australia and have been making the obligatory repayments, last year I paid $2,000 but was charged $1,900 interest, how am I ever going to be able to pay it back? The interest rates are just huge. Where's the incentive for me to make additional payments on the loan, when all I am paying is the interest? It also doesn't encourage me to return to NZ as there's no way I would make as much money as I do over here so it would probably still take me forever to pay off the loan. These are great comments i agree with 'give us a break' and those who mentioned the “guinea pig” situation as i too was charged interest while at uni.. no idea how i was meant to pay that off, then the year the interest free came in - was the year i left NZ!!! I had only just started to make a dent in my capital on my loan and now i am virtually back to where i was when i left uni. And my interest figure is scary.. why should money be made off us when we are trying to get an education and better ourselves which eventually in the long run is going to help NZ. I am always promoting my favourite NZ products to local stores in Australia and am gaining great experience and knowledge that i hope to bring back one day. Unless the interest is scrapped and agree with incentives to make any payment rather than none...(and for it to be easier for overseas borrowers to make payments) then there is more chance we will feel we want to. I too want to come back to NZ one day but at this stage my student loan is a big consideration as to whether i will ever be able to!? Its something that I often think about and wonder how I can better deal with it... A specialist overseas borrower team at IRD might be useful to look into ways people can better manage their loan?! Why do get punished just because we paying off from overseas ???? I really did not want to leave NZ if I could get a job. I know many people who have loans and 95% of them are not paying a cents. And their view was because of the interest rate they will never be able to pay off . we ware charged with interest rate while even studying. On the other hand I am on a very hardship and tried to pay my minimum payment but constantly charged with interest and all other kinds of fine and penalty. Even my parents gave me 10,000 dollars so I can pay voluntary repayment. After all this now my loan amount is more than I took. So the bottom line is : If you are good person in this world – you MUST suffer. Look at those who don’t even have intention to repay. They are enjoying their life. On the other hand I am walking to work in this cold weather, have no savings money to buy even a good warm cloth. no car, no tv, no social life. When ever I save money to buy something, I end up repaying the savings to IRD. Loan is a big burden. By the time I will repay the full amount it will be three times the original. Who knows I might even die by then, because I feel so depressed and sick when I think about it. I had a dream that one day I will be a mum, start of my own family. But not any more. How can I afford a kid when its hard to survive myself. Sometimes I think my biggest mistake was studying in Uni. I wish I did not go to uni and took student loan. Whats the point of getting good education??? Suggestions : 1. Interest write off for overseas based. Why we have to get punished for repaying? If not, than good on those people who forget about the loan and never repay, not getting punished. No repay, no worries. 2. Introduce voluntary repayment bonus. In Australia they give bonus on voluntary repayment. Is there such a good thing exist in NZ? Please let me know. If not please make this happen. I am sure after moving to such a good idea all the people will be more encouraged to repay their loan. It will help the both parties. Bonuses Example: http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?

As a student who is still studying and thus has contact with both Studylink and IRD, I receive many statements from both organisations. It leads to a sort of fatigue where you stop paying any attention to the barrage of envelopes you receive. It would be much more effective to allow borrowers to check their balances online, and reserve sending out an actual paper document for matters which require attention by the borrower (underpayments, penalties, etc) or for significant and important changes to the system (a change in repayment threshold, change in interest rate, etc). This would ensure that the paper documents are taken seriously rather than being dismissed as yet another statement that people don't care about. Online is definately the way to go. Although with the current system it takes a month for your payments to appear on your balance and that is very slack. It needs to work like a bank account where transactions are immediate or the following day. Great idea. Integrate all the online systems, as OzboiNZ said, so one login enables us to do everything in one place. Add some inter-department cooperation behind the scenes, for example the Ministry of Social Development sent me a rather threatening letter recently advising of discrepancies between its data and IRD's. As it turned out, they thought I was still employed by one employer, which I was not, and they could have easily found this out from IRD (whose data clearly showed I was no longer receiving income from said employer). Instead both myself and my previous employer had to go around in circles to clarify a simple error. Reserve phone calls only for exceptional cases, and snail mail only for important notifications, sending in evidence etc. Phone numbers that are retained should be free from mobile phones also, students at uni all day may not have access to a landline until outside of office hours, which can be frustrating and/or expensive if they have to make a toll call on a mobile phone at uni. This is a huge milestone, finally!! Agree with comments above please save taxpayers money. And yes, it would be great to have this service across the rest of IRD communications. It's not only efficient in the long run but cost effective! online would be really great. i really dislike the current phone system, it is ridiculous how long you have to wait. i currently use the limited online services that there are and they are really great. had a really quick and helpful response to my last email query, was alot more helpful than waiting for half an hour on the phone. i agree with alot of the above comments, making sure that if it moves to online that everything is available and easy to navigate would be great. current system is very slow. I agree that an online system would be great, as long as it is efficient, accessible 24/7 and cuts down the time involved for users in interacting with IRD and improves IRD's telephone service. I find online services to be a excellent resource to monitor my student loan information, I make voluntary repayments as well as using the MSL tax code and the online services helps me to keep track of all my payments....

Go back to proposals bartybird genegem genegem shorti1001 lc16 Taking out student loan repayments on a weekly or fortnightly basis without considering the overall annual income is only going to hurt those on already low incomes - these would appear to be the main group of people captured by this policy change. At that desperately low income level, any additional earnings will be needed in the household for basic living. Employers will also have to spend additional time administering this method Nobody earning under $35K pa should be required to repay student loans. Nobody earning under $35K pa should be required to repay student debt. Let's get real here - the purpose of tertiary education is to gain high paid jobs and $35K is nowhere near high paid. I receive an allowance and also work part-time and I just manage to scrape through any given week and also to save a few dollars each week. I fear this change will inhibit those that do not receive an allowance and rely on work hours to get through any given week let alone save. I work in excess of 70hours/week during summer breaks in efforts to pay rent over the break as well as save for the coming year, just like a lot of students. To have pay deducted from hard-working students simply trying to plan ahead is actually quite foolish. How can they be expected to make compulsory deductions after tax, savings/kiwisaver and paying rent, power, internet and feeding and clothing themselves? I feel that imposing this on students raises the likelihood of other, perhaps less 'taxable' avenues being used to find an income they can live off. Compared with other countries, NZ has a pretty good system right now. So why make studying harder for everyone? On top of this the 2009 Govt. Budget removes my scholarship. Luckily I have savings from the Summer... To be honest, the amount we get for a student allowance is not a lot.

This means most people try and earn as much as possible over the holidays. It would be very unfair to cut this down, when it really is the government's fault that we even have to do that. If we had enough to live on during the year, then it wouldn't be such a big deal. I do not agree with this change at all. I think this policy change would be detrimental to students who are trying to work hard and save money over the holidays so they can scrape through the next year with a good quality of life. It is hard enough to study full time and work a part-time job, without having some of that essential cash taken away from you during the one time in the year you can make some ground. Keep it the way it is so that once you have graduated or left study and are earning, you can start to pay it back. It's not fair to put more burdens on people who are trying to improve themselves but facing a financial struggle to do so. Despite the negative feedback regarding this proposal, it has several positive qualities. Students that receive over the threshold would make repayments - meaning that they have less to pay off after graduation. Generally, graduates like the idea of traveling and gaining work experience from different countries. However, due to a massive student loan, their time overseas is limited (if they don't want to pay interest) OR they pay interest once the specified timeframe has expired. In other words, graduates must stay in the country until they have paid their student loan, or they end up paying an extra amount for being overseas for too long. There is a generalization that all students are poor - which is not too far from the truth. but once they graduate, they are immediately faced with the reality of repaying a ridiculous amount of money. Paychecks would be forever- deducted until the loan is paid off. Yet, isn't that the time when a person needs money the most? e.g. to buy a house, to start a business etc. Neither example is possible without repaying a student loan first. This proposal would stabilize a person's future faster. It seems inconvenient in the short-run, however, when looking at the bigger picture, this helps the students just as it helps the government. It doesn't make sense to have to make student loan repayments over work done to accumulate funds for the coming university year. Students will only have to borrow more in the university year then they have otherwise. Who will benefit from this change in policy? I think that you should just stick with the current system, it seems to work fine. As an employee I like how my work just takes it out each fortnight, and I don't worry. I would'nt want them to have to increase admin etc. I am not interested in knowing how much I own on my student loan on a fortnightly basis, finding out yearly is enough. I completely disagree with a pay-period assessment of repayments. Many people, for a whole variety of reasons, are forced to (eg casual employees who get whatever work they are given) or choose to work varying hours each week knowing that in one pay period things might be tight but they will get by from increased pay the next period, or later on in the year. A yearly assessment of repayments is the fairest way to take into consideration the fact that people don't and can't live on a week to week basis. This seems to be further National Government bullying of people on low wages, casual employees, students, single parents and others who don't fit their model citizen profile Student loans consultation forum - Repayment threshold – the income level at which you must start paying back your loan http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/20/3/\[24/10/2013 10:10:02\] Home Why change About Contact us Terms of use FAQs Conditions of website use Privacy Policy Glossary Discussions For more info on government services go to newzealand.govt.nz © Copyright 2009 Inland Revenue Student loans consultation forum - Repayment threshold – the income level at which you must start paying back your loan http://studentloanforum.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/discussion/discussion/20/1/\[24/10/2013 10:10:07\] Quick Links Proposals at a glance Why consider changes Your feedback Terms of use FAQs Glossary About us Discussions Jun 24th 2009 Jun 25th 2009 Jun 25th 2009 Jun 25th 2009 Employees Repayment threshold – the income level at which you must start paying back your loan 1234Next > What do you consider to be the advantages and disadvantages of a pay- period threshold? Keep in mind that this proposal could mean that students who work in their holidays, or borrowers who work for part of the year only, might have to make repayments. Go back to proposals jeremy stu ras90 aegordon I have a student loan and think this is fair as long as the compliance burden is not excessive... ie lets make sure its not going to cost the taxpayer more than is made on it Surely it makes little sense for students to have to make compulsory repayments whilst still studying? I think (as a student with a student loan and student allowance) that this penalises those who wish to work during the holidays in order to support themselves during the academic year. If you receive a student allowance you are only allowed to earn $185 pw on top of your allowance (roughly $380pw). Most summer jobs pay more than this every week, so by forcing students into compulsory repayments, you are inhibiting their earning potential during the holidays to the same level as during semester. This provides disincentives for work from a student's point of view and will be an issue for employers trying to attract full-time student summer holiday workers, as students may fail to see the point in workng 50 hours pw and only taking home the pay of 25. From an administrative point of view, a pay-period measure may be the easiest way, but perhaps an amnesty on sompulsory pay period repayments whilst one is still studying (including the summer holidays) through different tax codes for students working through the holidays whilst intending to return to study? I am concerned about how this will effect working parents who may chose to work only part of the year. The new system would unfairly require them to repay their student loan even if their income is under the current annual threshold, which could cause unecessary financial strain on some young families, particularly when childcare costs are also accounted for. I would also be concerned if parental leave payments were eligible for the pay-period threshold, as typically paid parental leave is rather limited. I think the current annual system effectively takes into account a range of different circumstances which may lead employees to work only part of the year (whether full time or part time). It is unfair to make students who are still studying pay back their student loans. Most students try to earn as much as they can over the summer holiday period so that they can pay things like their rent throughout the academic year when they don't have so much time to earn money. The $160 a week from studylink does not go very far on its own and students have to have be able to supplement this somehow.

While I agree that a yearly income threshold is fair, a weekly threshold is not. Many students rely on full time work over the holidays, and work overtime if possible, so that they can finance their next year of study, and only work minimal hours (if any) part time during the academic year. The proposed policy change means there will be a disincentive for students to work extra hours in the holidays (when they are most able to), and more pressure to earn up to weekly threshold during semester. This puts more pressure on students to find part time jobs with flexible hours, which can be difficult (especially considering today's economy), and those students will have less time to study. The net effect of this policy proposal sees less money in students pockets to pay rent and other living expenses. The best off will be those who earn the under the threshold all year round, the worst off will be those who finance their entire year from holiday work - they receive a kick in the guts for trying to help themselves. NO students will actually benefit from this. There is already existing policy to offer a voluntary repayment bonus, those who do have spare money are likely to take that option, students don't need another "tax" taking away more income, which they depend on to live through the academic year. I agree that a weekly threshold disadvantages those students who are trying to work to subsidise thier study. As a student ineligible for a student allowance and recieves no help from their family to study. I rely on every cent that I can earn in my summer holiday break to survive during the next year. My student loan only just covers my rent. I then have to work part time to eat, pay power, have internet and clothe myself. By working over summer I can repay the overdraft that I have incured in the previous year. I then try to save as much as pysically possible for the next year. This means I can try to keep my hours down during semester so I can actually do what I need to do which is Study. If I had to repay my loan over the summer - I would be struggling even more with basic living costs than I am now. Any mid trimester break work that I did to bump up my funds for the coming semester would be reduced - I could not cope. This change would just increase the hardships that are suffered by students who are trying to help themselves through their studies. I think that this pay period threshold is a great idea for those who have finished studying and are working fulltime. How about students being able to have exemptions from this weekly threshold. Lets say a qualification long exemption from the weekly payment threshold? Or it doesn't apply to year's that you are recieving a student loan/allowance. It is a good idea in theory for those that are working, but it severly disadvantages those students who are already struggling to survive and trying to work when they can to help themselves. These proposed changes are unfair and will increase hardship among students. For students ineligible for an allowance, these changes increase the reliance on the student loan living costs to live as it decreases the value of working. For students lucky enough to receive a student allowance, the maximum they can earn from a part-time job is $190 so their income is already limited. This change discourages students from earning extra income during less busy periods in favour of earning a fixed amount every single week. This will only add to the stress of students in busy periods around the end of semesters. Calculating the threshold on a weekly or fortnightly rather than a yearly basis will decrease the net income of most students especially those who work variable hours from week to week. The principle behind student loans and the threshold is that tertiary education increases an individual's income.

It is a mockery of this principle to increase the rate of repayments from students who have not completed their education and thus not in a position to economically benefit from it. I agree that this proposal will be more efficient for collecting loan repayments from full-time workers who are no longer studying full-time and are earning above the $19K threshold. It is patently unfair on students who need to work full-time over their holidays to earn and save enough supplemental income to pay for rent, food etc during the forthcoming year of study. It is also unfair on part-time/casual workers such as sole parents, who may earn over the threshold in some weeks during the year, but overall come in under the threshold for repayments. It is usually these people who struggle to meet ends meet and unwarrented deductions from their weekly pays will prove a hardship. I believe full-time students should be exempted from repaying student loans until they have completed their course of study and are working and earning a full-time wage above the $19K threshold. In practical terms the repayment threshold is already implemented on a pay- period basis. It currently applies to any employee declaring one of the M SL, ME SL, S SL, SH SL or ST SL tax codes on their IR330 (tax code declaration), based on their expected annual earnings being over the annual repayment threshold. If the repayment threshold is to be implemented on a pay-period basis regardless of the employee’s annual earnings then all that is required is to remove the questions, “Is your annual income from all sources likely to be more than the student loan repayment threshold?” and “Is your income from your highest paid job likely to be over the student loan repayment threshold?” from the IR330. This change will have no impact on payroll software. There will be no extra compliance costs for employers, and no reduction in compliance costs either. It will result in less cash in the hand for those who have annual earnings under the annual repayment threshold but have fluctuating or periodic earnings and sometimes earn over the pay-period threshold during the year. If these ‘extra’ repayments exceed $500 per year then they will benefit from the student loan repayment bonus. To retain equity between employees and self-employed, I recommend the IR330 remains as is, so that those employees expecting to earn less than the annual threshold do not have to make repayments from their wages during the time they work. They can always choose to if they want. I think there needs to be more of an incentive to pay back the loan faster... the voluntary repayment bonus is great but in all honesty if I pay back $500 on my own accord what is a $50 write off a $38,000 loan.

Keep in mind that this proposal could mean that students who work in their holidays, or borrowers who work for part of the year only, might have to make repayments. Go back to proposals harpinkath ali\_ham gojojo emenlemon In the long run paying money towards your student loan every week you work over the threshold whilst you are still studying is ineffective and totally unfair to the majority of students who work extra during their holidays to save for textbooks and making living that little bit easier. It's hard enough as a student without having the extra worry of whether you are over the threshold in the holidays. Perhaps they should look at lowering the annual income threshold, but even that would sting new graduates who, in this current economic climate, earn little over the threshold (if at all). Most students do not earn enough while they are studying to pay rent etc; that is why we need living costs, and allowances. To make us pay back our loans at the same time as receiving them is counter intuitive. I totally agree with the comments that there should be a pay back amnesty for students (perhaps limited to full time students). In respect of the annual or weekly threshold, the annual threshold is consistent with other loan requirements. Will the parental income threshold for an allowance also change to weekly thresholds? I cannot support a proposal that has students required to repay their loan based on holiday earnings. Holiday earnings mean students can have the option of borrowing less money to support their studies. For financially idenpendant (not getting any assistance from parents or other sources) students this is really essential to having a managable loan at the end of their studies. Bear in mind that if you come from a background where there is no money, having a huge debt is a deterrent to studying. Being able to work in the holidays and use that money to reduce your borrowings helps you feel more in control of the situation and thus more likely not to be put off engaging in study in the first place. It doesn't make sense to enforce repayments that will simply drive up the level of borrowing. It assumes students just work for drinking money rather than for survival. I understand that debt that is beginning to burden New Zealand, but I also see - from a students point of view - the annoyance that will arise from student loan being deducted weekly. Being employed within the industry of hospitality, which I understand a lot of students are, our hours and thus our wage becomes determined by the extras we do and the shifts we are given. Therefore one week we may get one shift and earn less the given criteria, but the following week we may be given more shifts in order to restore the balance financially.

It deducts on the persons weekly income. It does not allow students to try to "get ahead" as the student is aware that if they earn "too much" they are liable for the repayment. I will admit that I like the fact that the taxes would be spread over the year, but unfortunately it is a stab in the back of any shift or casual worker, or any student just trying to get ahead. I think that the new way of calculating the repayment threshold by making it a weekly/monthly calculation is relevant and useful for people who have finished their university studies and are working full-time all year round. For students who are still studying, it creates a burden and hassle as many students cannot work during term time due to study commitments and so work over summer. It would be a huge pain to have to somehow cover the shortfall seeing as I am not eligible for a student allowance and the student loan has living costs of a paltry $150 a week. Anybody who has been a student in the past 5 years knows it is tough, not the easy life that some people (usually non-students) like to make out. Not only are you faced with enormous stress to perform and juggle papers, whilst learning how to live away from the parental home and deal with bills and other new experiences, but you have to juggle 1 or more part time jobs and still can only afford sub-standard housing and food. Ideally the government should be doing things that allow the country's future work-force to reach their full potential, and policies such as the student allowance help with this, though most of those people still need to work also, and it should be universal. This new policy does not help students. It takes away income they are already managing to scrape in inbetween studies, their only option is then to work more in their minimum wage jobs to try and make up the difference. Many students including myself work a variety of odd jobs when and where they can, meaning their hours vary a lot from week to week. A large income one week, may be from several weeks work, and hence cross the threshold for repayment, but that is money that is also meant to support them for several weeks. Different people have different circumstances and hence costs in their lives. Some people can live on very little rather well, others need more because they have medical conditions, live in different places, have other people to support, have mortgages or other debt to pay back etc. Why does the government keep giving disincentives for students to earn more? Why can't they let them earn as much as they need to without penalty? They are still paying tax and helping drive the economy with their part time work, often of huge value to small businesses with their often skilled but low payed employment. I'm very concerned at the proposal to have current students pay back their loan during the holiday periods, while they are trying to save for the cost of their education. The students I have spoken to do not like this proposal one bit. Rachel Boyack SANITI Student President Students shouldn't have to start making repayments on their loans while they are still studying, it's as simple as that. This is a bad idea. Those who are studying, but working intensely between semesters to actually decrease the amount they need to borrow to study, will be unfairly disadvantaged by this. I don't think those who are still studying should be subject to the weekly or fortnightly thresholds. In saying that, why should anyone? The way it works at the moment works just fine and seems fair. Is it a way to generate more income? If so you're doing it off the backs of those who can least afford it.

In 1992 - The student loan scheme is introduced (By the way, all of us students love you people for that too! <shakes her fist at you>). Back then $150 would have been hard to live off, especially in major cities such as Auckland, Wellington etc.. but i am sure it was much more do-able then than in 2009. In 1992 the price of petrol was 94.8c look at the changes now where it is almost double that. The price of everything has gone up people!! Now knowing the prices have risen by about double (you only have to take a look at milk, butter, bread and gas to see this is true), rent has escalated, course fees will more than likely rise year after year (by between 5% or 10% if your Uni or Poly applys for an exemption and wins) meaning students will borrow more because let's face it, unless you are fortunate enough to have a back ground where your have a great deal of money, saving up to pay for your fees before you enter tertiary studies will barely make a dent in your fees, you will ultimately need to get a student loan. and then when you start to work in the study break periods you will be further penalized. We have hit a recession people!! People have lost their jobs, they WILL return to study, most will have kids (I'd love to see stats in that... I would have a field day!!) and will be upskilling in tertiary education so they can just "get a job" let's face it, you don't get much on living costs if you are not eligible for student allowance. You would think that MSD (Ministry of Social Development) or IRD would have put more thought into the people who pay for them to have their jobs and not just, how to make the system easier for an administrative point of view. It is not rocket science to figure out that a work capable/ready nation will help NZ bounce back from the recession in a way they NZ wont with out the work capable/ready nation. I did wonder if this was a away to help people think twice before borrowing, therefore place themselves in debt, but then the reality of course fees slaps me... majority of the comment suggest that full time student be exempt. I saw comment of the hospitality industry where you get paid little 1 week and a lot the following week to balance it all out, those people will be penalized too? What about solo parents who need to earn extra for childcare, usually only needing to earn more that $367 just to cover the childcare anyway. I have had a huge rise in hardship application with my Student Association already, it's going to get worse with this rubbish. I believe all the student leaders of NZ will agree that this is utter pooz!

I think it would be easier to manage if the interest rate wasnt going to be so high. For some of us it is hard to try and find spare money to send home especially as it takes a while to get on top of things when first moving to a new country!!! I think this is a terrible idea. Incentives, not penalties will be the only way to get people based overseas to try and pay in full. I cannot afford to make any payments back to NZ at the moment and increasing the interest just pushes the likelihood of me being able to do so even further away. I agree that it is difficult to make the payments from overseas. If the aim in charging higher penalties is to encourage people to return home then why not offer an interest write-off if you return within the 3 year repayment holiday and work in NZ for a minimum time. The repayment holiday is only available once so you would have to pay interest and penalties if you went back overseas, but it allows people to go on an OE, increase their CV selling power with overseas experience, and then encourages them to come home and put back into the economy. In saying that, the interest rates are too high, going overseas to earn is sometimes the only option if you ever want to scrape up a deposit on a house too! I agree that it should be easier to make student loan repayments from overseas. How about web-based system that accepts foreign credit cards?

I also agree that incentives rather than increased penalties are a better approach to getting payments made on time. I would like better advice on overseas payment options from Inland Revenue. I agree with Timmeh and Wilson. Incentives is more encouraging and also a better approach. I began making student loan payments from overseas via credit card and International online net banking and both payment options were discouraging, because not only do we pay for bank fees/ surcharges from origin and also at final receiving point/ branch. The thought of having interest ontop of our student loan and then having to take into consideration bank fees/ surcharges for overseas payments can be daunting. It seems like it is one step forward and two steps back. More advice on simple overseas payment options from Inland Revenue is a must. Thank you for commenting on the topic of replacing the current penalties with an interest rate for overseas-based borrowers. You have highlighted an issue with the way we have worded the question and we would like to take the opportunity to clarify the question. The original question was: "What do you think about doing away with late payment penalties, and replacing them with a higher rate of interest? This would be applied to borrowers who haven't kept up with their repayments. The current late payment penalties are 19.56% p.a., and the interest under this proposal would be lower than this." This has been replaced with a new question: "What do you think about replacing the penalty for late loan payments — which is currently equivalent to 19.56% per annum — with a significantly lower interest rate? The new rate would be somewhere between the 6.8% rate that overseas borrowers currently face and the penalty of 19.56%." Thank you for pointing this out to us. To the administrator, I was emailed about your wording change of the topic, so it may be important for you to know that this wording change has no bearing on my original comment. To clarify my first comment: The standard interest rate (without any penalties for late payments) would be 6.8%. The interest rate applied to those who are late on payments might hypothetically be 10%. Here is my point: if someone is late on a payment and the interest rate applied to their loan becomes 10% accordingly, then it may be wise that the system would change their interest rate back to 6.8% once they have caught up on their payments. If this didn't happen (ie they were stuck with 10% interest from that point onward) then this may discourage them from paying off their student loan. If you are living overseas, then you are excempt from the interest write-off that NZ residents get, so your student loan continues to grow. If you miss a payment and are charged a penalty, does it really matter much, considering that if your loan is a substantial one it is probably growing at a faster rate than you can pay it anyhow? The change in penalty probably doesn't matter much to people who are not making their payments. I do agree that incentives might make a difference though. If I could get 3 years worth of interest written off, I'd consider returning home before the end of my 3 year payment holiday.

I also think IRD should look at some incentive for overseas repayers, such as if I pay say $1000 above my requirement the IRD rewards us such as the interest write off currently for residents, that would help many of us to pay these loans off quicker? I agree that online comms is a great move. Further, given the push from the likes of the retirement commisioner with the sorted.com website a facility to calculate an approximate end date for loan payments would be really cool.

If I had internet banking and if I could have used the internet to deal with IRD it may have saved me the grief I now have and the situation of not wanting to pay them back the rest of what I supposedly now owe. Last year they increased what I owed from $3000 to $7900 because they decided after 7.5 years that I was now considered an overseas student for the whole period despite having property in NZ, a child under 16 whom I was paying child support for and a bank account and income tax being paid, The extra interest is despite the fact I had been making regular payments and had not missed payment dates on more than maybe three payments in 8 years and I was paying at a rate far above what I had been asked to pay! How many NZ students can say the same? Yes IT IS nearly $4000 in INTREST! Are they going to get it? No. Would they have got the rest of their money if not for this? Yes. Now the point is mute as I don't have an income, I don't have a child under 16 in NZ, I don't have NZ property anymore, I don't have a job and I don't have the same desire to be an honest and upstanding NZer.

As a student who is still studying and thus has contact with both Studylink and IRD, I receive many statements from both organisations. It leads to a sort of fatigue where you stop paying any attention to the barrage of envelopes you receive. It would be much more effective to allow borrowers to check their balances online, and reserve sending out an actual paper document for matters which require attention by the borrower (underpayments, penalties, etc) or for significant and important changes to the system (a change in repayment threshold, change in interest rate, etc). This would ensure that the paper documents are taken seriously rather than being dismissed as yet another statement that people don't care about. Online is definately the way to go. Although with the current system it takes a month for your payments to appear on your balance and that is very slack. It needs to work like a bank account where transactions are immediate or the following day. Great idea. Integrate all the online systems, as OzboiNZ said, so one login enables us to do everything in one place. Add some inter-department cooperation behind the scenes, for example the Ministry of Social Development sent me a rather threatening letter recently advising of discrepancies between its data and IRD's. As it turned out, they thought I was still employed by one employer, which I was not, and they could have easily found this out from IRD (whose data clearly showed I was no longer receiving income from said employer). Instead both myself and my previous employer had to go around in circles to clarify a simple error. Reserve phone calls only for exceptional cases, and snail mail only for important notifications, sending in evidence etc. Phone numbers that are retained should be free from mobile phones also, students at uni all day may not have access to a landline until outside of office hours, which can be frustrating and/or expensive if they have to make a toll call on a mobile phone at uni. This is a huge milestone, finally!! Agree with comments above please save taxpayers money. And yes, it would be great to have this service across the rest of IRD communications. It's not only efficient in the long run but cost effective! online would be really great. i really dislike the current phone system, it is ridiculous how long you have to wait. i currently use the limited online services that there are and they are really great. had a really quick and helpful response to my last email query, was alot more helpful than waiting for half an hour on the phone. i agree with alot of the above comments, making sure that if it moves to online that everything is available and easy to navigate would be great. current system is very slow. I agree that an online system would be great, as long as it is efficient, accessible 24/7 and cuts down the time involved for users in interacting with IRD and improves IRD's telephone service. I find online services to be a excellent resource to monitor my student loan information, I make voluntary repayments as well as using the MSL tax code and the online services helps me to keep track of all my payments....

To clarify my first comment: The standard interest rate (without any penalties for late payments) would be 6.8%. The interest rate applied to those who are late on payments might hypothetically be 10%. Here is my point: if someone is late on a payment and the interest rate applied to their loan becomes 10% accordingly, then it may be wise that the system would change their interest rate back to 6.8% once they have caught up on their payments. If this didn't happen (ie they were stuck with 10% interest from that point onward) then this may discourage them from paying off their student loan. If you are living overseas, then you are excempt from the interest write-off that NZ residents get, so your student loan continues to grow. If you miss a payment and are charged a penalty, does it really matter much, considering that if your loan is a substantial one it is probably growing at a faster rate than you can pay it anyhow? The change in penalty probably doesn't matter much to people who are not making their payments. I do agree that incentives might make a difference though. If I could get 3 years worth of interest written off, I'd consider returning home before the end of my 3 year payment holiday.

Being able to transfer money online directly from my overseas bank account to my IRD account (without having to go through my NZ account and pay extra fees) would be great. I agree with others here - Incentives rather than penalties. It would make so many more pay - why not match what people pay over and above their minimum required payment? The debt that you would 'write off' couldn't possibly be more that which is currently written off or never paid. Don't encourage young minds to stay overseas! It's difficult to pay from overseas - income isn't always regular. A carrot rather a stick may well be the answer! Why is it not one of the proposals?

Te wawae me te whakawhanake rawa whenua hei hoko atu Subdividing and developing property to sell
================================================================================================

If you subdivide and then sell off a part of your existing section, you only need to pay tax in certain circumstances.

Generally, you do not need to pay tax if **all** of the following apply.

*   You do not have a pattern of buying and selling properties.
*   You did not buy the undivided section with an [intention](/api/glossary/item?id={A3637F26-4574-4352-B0EB-9A273CC990AA})
     of selling part or all of the property.
*   The [bright-line test](/api/glossary/item?id={01AC82FF-6ACD-4E27-BB59-E7E7792BAFEF})
     does not apply to the sale.

Your intention when you buy
---------------------------

If you buy a property intending to subdivide and sell off some or all of the sections, the profit from the sale of those sections is taxable. This also applies if you buy several already subdivided sections intending to sell them.

### Subdividing your home

If you buy a residential property, intending to live in the existing home and to subdivide then sell off the other part of it, then you probably need to pay tax on your profit when you sell the subdivided part. This is because you always intended to subdivide and sell.

You do not pay tax when you sell the part you live in.

### Get tax advice

The tax rules around the sale of subdivided and developed sections are complex. We recommend you speak with a tax advisor to make sure you’re getting it right.

Dealers, developers and builders
--------------------------------

If you're a dealer, developer or builder, you must pay tax on the profit of any property you sell that is part of your property or building business.

If you decide to leave the property business, you may still own some properties. If you sell these properties within 10 years of buying them, any profit you make is taxable. This is the 10-year rule.

Learn how the 10-year rule could apply to you.

[Property dealers, developers and builders](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/dealers-developers-builders)

### Subdividing co-owned land

Sometimes people pool resources to purchase land, becoming co-owners. Co-owners may then subdivide and allocate the land based on their original ownership interests. This is known as partitioning. In some circumstances the subdivision may be treated as a disposal of land at market value under the bright-line test or other property taxing rules.

The bright-line test or other property tax rules do not apply if the value of the partitioned land matches the interests you and your co-owners had in the undivided land. The value includes your contributions as co-owners to development and building costs.

If the land of a co-owner's partitioned interest after subdivision is more than their original co-ownership interest in the undivided land, the difference may be taxable.

#### When the difference is not taxable

If the difference in allocations is less than 5% of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the difference is not taxable. A difference could happen because of the land topography (landscape).

#### When the difference is taxable

If the difference is 5% or more of the smallest co-owner’s original interest, the full difference is taxed under the bright-line test or other property tax rules.

Example – Subdividing co-owned land - Allocation not proportional to original shares

Maggie and Jordan are co-owners in a residential property purchased for $1 million. Maggie contributed $750,000 (holding 75% interest) and Jordan contributed $250,000 (holding 25% interest). They subdivide the land in 2 and allocate the parcels to themselves.

Due to the landscape, Maggie’s land allocation changes to 74% and Jordan’s 26%.

Because the difference between Jordan’s original holding and the new allocation is less than 5% the transaction is not taxed under the bright-line test or other property taxing rules (5% of 25% is 1.25%).

 pages 124 to 126.

### Associated with someone in the property industry

The same rules apply if you're associated with someone in the property industry. This means you may have to pay tax on some or all of your property sales or transfers, even if you're not personally a property dealer, developer or builder.

### Non-minor subdivisions started within 10 years

If you develop or subdivide land within 10 years of buying it, the development or subdivision is taxable unless the work is minor.

Minor means very little work, time, effort and expense is needed. For example, if the only costs were the surveyors and lawyers’ fees.

Read more about when development or division work is minor in our interpretation statement IS 20/08 below.

### Major developments or subdivisions

If the development or subdivision involves significant spending or work, it’s generally taxable, with some exceptions. Major development work includes:

*   earthworks
*   roading
*   draining
*   contouring land.

[Part 2 - Membersip of Kiwisaver](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver-act-2006/part-2-membersip-of-kiwisaver "Part 2 - Membersip of Kiwisaver")

Subpart 1 - Becoming members of KiwiSaver
=========================================

Subpart 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 contains the rules for individuals to become members by automatic enrolment when they begin new employment or by opting in.

Subpart 1 contains the rules for individuals to become KiwiSaver members by automatic enrolment when they begin new employment or by opting in.

##### Automatic enrolment

The automatic enrolment rules generally apply to employees who start new employment if:

*   they meet the residency requirements (as outlined under "Who the Act applies to");
*   their new employer is not an exempt employer;
*   they are 18 years or over, but less than the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (currently 65) when they start that employment;
*   they are not already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

_New employment_  
Section 11 defines "new employment". It means employment that is started on or after the date the automatic enrolment rules begin (1 July 2007), but does not include:

*   temporary employment;
*   employment where the employee remains on the same payroll that they were on immediately before starting the new employment (except in the case of schools); and
*   employment with an employer that carries on the same business as was undertaken immediately before the new employment began (provided the employer gives the required notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue).

_Temporary employment_  
"Temporary employment" is defined under section 12 as employment that is as a casual agricultural worker [1](#01)
 or employment that is under a contract of service for a period of 28 continuous days or less. Temporary employment ceases and the automatic enrolment rules apply (as if the person started new employment) if the person ceases to be a casual agricultural worker or if the employment is extended beyond 28 days.

The intention of the 28-day rule is to ensure that people in temporary employment are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules if the period of employment is 28 days or less.

_Employment in schools_  
Section 13 provides that if an employee begins a new job at a state school or integrated school, they are treated as starting new employment, despite staying on the same payroll.

_Same business_  
"Same business" is defined under section 11 as a business that in substance carries on the same or a similar role, regardless of whether the legal entity carries on the business changes. Same business includes:

*   a company that results from, or continues after, an amalgamation under the Companies Act, involving the company that employed the person immediately before new employment was started;
*   a business that takes over as a going concern the business that employed the person immediately before they started new employment; and
*   creation of a new partnership as a result of a partner joining or exiting a business.

**Example one**  
Company A buys a business owned by Company B. As part of the purchase agreement, the employees of Company B become employees of Company A. Company A provides the requisite notice to the Commissioner and the employees are not subject to automatic enrolment. If Company A did not provide the requisite notice, the employees would be subject to the automatic enrolment rules.

_Other situations when automatic enrolment rules do not apply_  
Under section 14 the following situations are not considered new employment and the automatic enrolment rules do not apply if:

*   the person is an employee only because he or she receives one of the following:
    *   payments to working partners;
    *   parental leave payments; and
    *   certain ACC payments.[2](#02)
        
*   the new employment is as an election-day worker or a private domestic worker;[3](#03)
     or
*   the employee is not required to have tax deductions made from his or her salary or wages under the PAYE rules.

Beneficiaries are not subject to automatic enrolment

**Example one**  
On 1 April 2007 Maria begins working full-time for K&S Ltd on a permanent contract. The automatic enrolment rules do not apply because they have not yet commenced.  
  
**Example two**  
On 1 October 2007 Scott begins working full-time for ABC Ltd on a permanent contract. Scott is 40 years old and is a New Zealand citizen. The automatic enrolment rules apply to Scott.  
  
**Example three**  
On 30 August 2007 Hamish begins a part-time job working for his local supermarket. Hamish is 15 years old and is a New Zealand citizen. The automatic enrolment rules do not apply because Hamish is under 18 years old.  
  
**Example four**  
Tama has been working for a local plumbing firm for the past five years in the same role. The firm is expanding and on 1 September 2007 it amalgamates with another plumbing firm. Because Tama's employer provided Inland Revenue with the required information to show that the same business was being carried on, the automatic enrolment rules do not apply to Tama because he has not started new employment.  
  
**Example five**  
On 1 January 2008 Steve begins new employment at a bank. The bank has been approved as an exempt employer because it provides employees access to a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary (Financial Markets Authority from 01.05.2011). The automatic enrolment rules do not apply to Steve because his employer is an exempt employer.  
  
**Example six**  
Neil, an Australian citizen aged 30, starts working for an accountancy firm on 1 October 2007. His contract is short-term and is due to expire on 11 October 2007. The automatic enrolment rules do not apply because Neil is a temporary worker. If Neil's contract was extended beyond 28 October 2007, the automatic enrolment rules would apply from 29 October 2007.  
  
**Example seven**  
Matthew is from Los Angeles, is studying in New Zealand and is in the country on a student's visa. On 1 December 2007 Matthew begins a part-time job to help meet his living costs. Because Matthew is not entitled to be in New Zealand indefinitely in terms of the Immigration Act, the KiwiSaver Act does not apply to him and therefore the automatic enrolment rules do not apply.  
  
**Example eight**  
On 10 July 2007 Mark begins working at the local library. Mark is a New Zealand citizen and is 70 years old. Because Mark is older than the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age, the automatic enrolment rules do not apply.  
  
**Example nine**  
Trevor is already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. On 10 June 2008 Trevor begins working permanently for a computer sales company. Because Trevor is already a member of KiwiSaver, the automatic enrolment rules do not apply to him.  
  
**Example ten**  
Bronwyn is a teacher working permanently for Wadestown School and in January 2008 will begin working at Karori Normal on a permanent contract. Despite staying on the Ministry of Education payroll, the automatic enrolment rules apply to Bronwyn when she begins her new job.  
  
**Example eleven**  
Fran is a member of RetireEzy, a registered superannuation scheme (that is not a KiwiSaver scheme). Fran's bank provides access to the scheme and her employer is not affiliated to the scheme (or any other scheme) in any way. Fran begins a new job and is subject to the automatic enrolment rules. Although she is a member of an existing registered superannuation scheme, this does not affect the fact that she is subject to automatic enrolment (because her employer is not an exempt employer).  
  
**Example twelve**  
Andrew injures himself at work and begins receiving earnings compensation from ACC. The automatic enrolment rules do not apply to Andrew.  
  
**Example thirteen**  
Bob becomes unemployed and starts receiving a benefit payment. He is not subject to automatic enrolment.

#### Opting out

_How employees can opt out_  
Sections 16 to 21 allow employees who have been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver to opt out. Employees can opt out by giving an opt-out notice to Inland Revenue or to their employer. Opt-out notices will be included in the information packs that employers must provide to their employees but can also be given in any other form and manner permitted by the Commissioner.

An opt-out notice takes effect on the later of:

*   day 14 of the employment that triggered the automatic enrolment rules (the end of week two);
*   the date on which the opt-out notice is:
    *   accepted by the Commissioner, in the case of a notice given to the Commissioner; or
    *   received by the employer, in the case of a notice given to the employer.

An employer who receives an opt-out notice must notify the Commissioner no later than the time that they are required to deliver the next employer monthly schedule to the Commissioner.[4](#04)

_Time limit for opting out_  
Employees who are subject to automatic enrolment can opt out of KiwiSaver in the period beginning on the end of week two after beginning employment (day 14) and ending on the end of week eight after beginning employment (day 56).

_Extension of opt-out period_  
The Commissioner may accept a late opt-out notice if one or more of the following applies:

*   the employer did not supply the employee with an information pack within seven days of new employment starting with that employer;
*   the Commissioner did not send an investment statement for the default KiwiSaver scheme that the employee was provisionally allocated to;
*   the employer did not supply an investment statement for their chosen KiwiSaver scheme (if the employer's choice of KiwiSaver scheme is effective);
*   events outside the control of the employee meant that the opt-out notice could not be given within the time limit for opting out and, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is reasonable that a late opt-out notice be accepted.

The Commissioner may accept a late opt-out notice up to three months after the date on which the Commissioner receives the first contribution for an employee. If the Commissioner receives a late opt-out notice and does not exercise his discretion to accept it, the Commissioner must treat the notice as if it were an application for a contributions holiday, if the person was eligible to apply for a contributions holiday.

_Commissioner must give notice to employer if employee opts out_  
If the Commissioner accepts an opt-out notice from an employee the Commissioner must, as soon as practicable, give notice to the employer stating that:

*   the employee has opted out; and
*   the employer must not make any further deductions of contributions from that employee, from the effective date of the opt-out.

_Effect of opting out_  
From the date on which an opt-out takes effect, an employee ceases to be a member of any KiwiSaver scheme that the employee may have become a member of. The employer must stop making deductions of contributions from the employee's salary or wages, with effect on the next payment of salary or wages that the employer calculates. An opt-out notice only applies to the employment that triggered the automatic enrolment rules and does not apply to any other new employment that the employee may later begin.

Employers may refund any contributions deducted from the employee's salary or wage directly to the employee who has opted out or they can pay it to the Commissioner (who will refund it to the employee).

**Example one**  
On 1 April 2008 Mike begins a new job and the automatic enrolment rules apply. On 15 May 2008 Mike opts out of KiwiSaver by giving an opt-out notice to his employer. His employer must cease making deductions of contributions from the next pay calculated after receiving the opt-out notice.  
  
**Example two**  
On 10 October 2007 Tracey begins a new job and the automatic enrolment rules apply. Tracey wants to opt out that day. However, Tracey cannot opt out until 23 October 2007.  
  
**Example three**  
On 5 November 2007 Renee begins a new job and the automatic enrolment rules apply. Ten weeks later, Renee decides she wants to opt out and sends an opt-out notice to the Commissioner. Because none of the circumstances for accepting late opt-out notices applied, the Commissioner declined the opt-out. Renee cannot opt out.  
  
**Example four**  
On 13 January 2008 Sam begins a new job and the automatic enrolment rules apply. Nine weeks later, Sam sends an opt-out notice to the Commissioner. Because Sam had been in hospital for the past seven weeks, the Commissioner considers it reasonable that a late opt-out notice is accepted. The Commissioner gives notice to Sam's employer stating that Sam has opted out and that deductions of contributions must cease. The Commissioner direct credits to Sam's bank account a refund of contributions deducted.  
  
**Example five**  
Carol works part-time and gets a second part-time job somewhere else. Carol was automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver for her first job, but is not a member, because she opted out. She is automatically enrolled again for the second job. She must opt out again for the second job if she does not want to be a KiwiSaver member.

#### Opting in

Sections 33 to 37 contain the rules for people to opt into KiwiSaver.

_Who can opt in?_  
A person can opt into KiwiSaver at any time, provided they:

*   meet the residency requirements (as outlined earlier under "Who the Act applies to");
*   are under the New Zealand superannuation qualification age;
*   are not already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme; and
*   are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules.

_How to opt in_  
An individual can opt in by contracting directly with the provider of a KiwiSaver scheme or, if the person is an employee, by giving his or her employer a notice requiring deductions of contributions to be made from his or her salary or wages.

Persons aged under 18 may only opt in by contracting directly with a provider. If a provider of a KiwiSaver scheme accepts a person who is aged under 18 as a member of their scheme, the contract between the provider and the person must be treated for the purposes of the Minors' Contracts Act 1969 as if the person were aged 18 years.

_Effect of opting in_  
Employees who opt in become liable to deductions of contributions from their salary or wages paid by the employer that the opt-in relates to, and from salary or wages paid as part of any other employment that the employee starts after opting in.

A person who has opted in cannot opt out.

**Example one**  
Jean is working full-time and approaches her employer about opting into KiwiSaver. Because Jean is 67 years old, which is older than the current New Zealand superannuation qualification age, she is not eligible to join KiwiSaver.  
  
**Example two**  
Ashley, a 40-year old New Zealand citizen, has been working with the same firm for 20 years and wants to join KiwiSaver. He advises his employer that he wants to opt in to KiwiSaver and provides his employer with a notice requiring deductions of contributions. Ashley is subject to deductions of contributions from his next payment of wages. Ashley gets a second job so he can save for an overseas holiday. He is also subject to deductions of contributions from his new job.  
  
**Example three**  
Chloe is a 15-year old, New Zealand permanent resident who wishes to join KiwiSaver. She advises her employer that she wishes to opt in. Chloe cannot opt in via her employer (because she is under 18 years) but must contract directly with a provider of a KiwiSaver scheme. The scheme will notify Inland Revenue that Chloe is a member and Inland Revenue will advise her employer to start making deductions of contributions from her pay.  
  
**Example four**  
Mary has been on ACC for the past two years and wishes to join KiwiSaver. She can opt in by giving ACC notice that she wants deductions of contributions from her ACC payments.

#### Exempt employer

Sections 24 to 32 contain the rules allowing certain employers to be exempt from the requirement to automatically enrol their new employees in KiwiSaver.

_Purpose of being an exempt employer_  
Employers can apply to the Financial Markets Authority for approval for their employees to be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules if they provide access to an approved registered superannuation scheme which complies with specified criteria. A person who starts new employment with an exempt employer or who is an existing employee of an exempt employer is still able to opt in. In addition, a person who is already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme and who begins new employment with an exempt employer is still subject to automatic deductions of contributions from the salary or wages paid by that employer.

_Criteria to become an exempt employer_  
For an employer to become an exempt employer it must provide access to a scheme that meets certain criteria. The key criteria that must be met are:

*   the scheme is, in practice, open to all new employees;
*   the scheme is a registered superannuation scheme;
*   the member's interest in the scheme must be portable;
*   if the scheme is a defined contribution scheme, the minimum amount that the employee must contribute combined with the maximum amount that an employee can compel the employer to contribute must be at least 4% of gross base salary or wages;
*   any employer contributions that count towards the 4% must vest within the employee within five years;
*   if the scheme is a defined benefit scheme, the actuary of the scheme must certify to the satisfaction of the Financial Markets Authority that the value of each employee's accrued benefits are increasing at an amount equivalent to at least 4% of gross base salary or wages.

Employers who provide a scheme for their employees under a master trust arrangement are eligible to seek an exemption and an employer who provides their employees with access to more than one scheme can also seek an exemption if, when taken as a whole, the scheme would comply with the criteria.

_How to become an exempt employer_  
A person may apply to the Financial Markets Authority for approval of an employer as an exempt employer. The information must be accompanied by:

*   information that satisfies the Financial Markets Authority that the scheme complies with the required rules;
*   the names, addresses, and tax file numbers of each employer for whom the application is made; and
*   details of the names, addresses, tax file numbers, and payroll arrangements of any other members of the group that the Financial Markets Authority may request if the application is made in respect of an employer that is part of a group of companies.

Within 28 days of receiving an application for approval of an employer as an exempt employer the Financial Markets Authority must:

*   consider whether he or she is satisfied that the employer is eligible to be approved as an exempt employer; and
*   if he or she is satisfied, approve the employer as an exempt employer and register the employer on the register of exempt employers.

The Financial Markets Authority must give notice to the employer as soon as practicable after approving or not approving the employer as an exempt employer. For those employers who have been approved, the notice must specify an effective date after which employees who start new employment with the employer will be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules.

The Financial Markets Authority must give notice to the Commissioner as soon as practicable after an employer is approved as an exempt employer.

_Revocation of exempt employer approval_  
The Financial Markets Authority may revoke an exempt employer approval if:

*   the Financial Markets Authority has given at least 28 days notice to the employer that he or she is considering whether to revoke the approval; and
*   the Financial Markets Authority is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the employer no longer provides access to a scheme that complies with the requirements outlined above.

A revocation may be on application from the employer or on the Financial Markets Authority's initiative. The Financial Markets Authority must:

*   give notice to the employer as soon as practicable after revoking the approval;
*   specify in that notice an effective revocation date after which employees who start new employment with the employer will be subject to the automatic enrolment rules (unless those rules do not otherwise apply);
*   remove the employer from the register of exempt employers; and
*   give notice to the Commissioner as soon as practicable after an employer is revoked as an exempt employer.

_Register of exempt employers_  
Sections 156 and 161 establish a register containing the names of employers who are exempt employers.

**Example one**  
Widgets Ltd applies to the Government Actuary (Financial Markets Authority from 01.05.2011) for approval as an exempt employer because it offers its employees access to a registered superannuation scheme. On 16 July 2007 the Financial Markets Authority approves Widgets Ltd as an exempt employer effective from that date. On 17 July 2007 Jeff is employed on a part-time, permanent basis. Jeff, although a New Zealand citizen who is over 18 years old and under the New Zealand superannuation qualification age, is not subject to automatic enrolment. If Jeff opted into KiwiSaver, Widgets Ltd would be required to make deductions of contributions from his salary.  
  
**Example two**  
Sarah is a KiwiSaver member and begins a new job. Sarah's new employer has been approved as an exempt employer. Because Sarah is already a KiwiSaver member, the employer is still required to make deductions of KiwiSaver contributions from Sarah's wages.  
  
**Example three**  
Frank & Williams Ltd was approved as an exempt employer. It receives notification from the Government Actuary (Financial Markets Authority from 01.05.2011) that from 1 April 2008 it has been revoked as an exempt employer because it no longer meets the requisite criteria. From that date, employees who begin new employment with Frank & Williams Ltd are subject to the automatic enrolment rules (to the extent that they apply).

#### Effect of membership of KiwiSaver

The effect of automatic enrolment or opting in is that:

*   an employee will have automatic deductions of contributions made from his or her salary or wages. Deductions start from the next pay calculated after the new employment begins or the person opts in;
*   an employee must continue to have deductions made from his or her salary or wages paid in respect of any new employment; and
*   the person will become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

A person who is subject to automatic enrolment or who opts in will be a KiwiSaver member until the earliest of:

*   an opt-out notice taking effect (this only applies to people who are subject to automatic enrolment);
*   the New Zealand superannuation qualification age being reached or five years of membership, whichever is later;
*   the provider terminating the employee's membership of a KiwiSaver scheme because the balance in all of their accounts reaches zero (at the option of the provider); or
*   the date of withdrawal or transfer to a foreign scheme in the case of permanent emigration.

Employees will continue to be liable for deductions of contributions until the earliest of:

*   ceasing to be a KiwiSaver member;
*   the date on which the employer is given notice that they are taking a contributions holiday; or
*   the employee is not required to have tax deductions made from his or her salary or wages under the PAYE rules.

While members who reach the age at which withdrawal is permitted or who permanently emigrate will be able to access their funds in whole and cease to be a KiwiSaver member, it is not a requirement that they do so.

**Example one**  
Betty opts in to KiwiSaver at age 62. Betty continues to contribute to KiwiSaver and remains in New Zealand. She will continue to be a member until at least age 67. At age 67, Betty decides that she does not want to access her funds. Betty continues contributing to KiwiSaver and is still a KiwiSaver member.  
  
**Example two**  
Peter is a KiwiSaver member and moves to Australia permanently. After being overseas for one year Peter withdraws all of his funds (under the permanent emigration rules in Schedule 1 of the Act) and ceases to be a KiwiSaver member.  
  
**Example three**  
Nathan has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver and successfully opts out on 7 January 2008. Nathan ceases to be a member as at that date.

#### Information requirements

Sections 22, 23, 34, 38 and 39 require information about individuals who are automatically enrolled or who opt in to be provided to employers and to the Commissioner.

_Employees who begin new employment or who opt in via their employer_  
Every person who starts new employment must give notice to their employer of:

*   his or her name and address;
*   his or her tax file number; and
*   whether or not he or she is already a member of a KiwiSaver scheme and, if they are a member, must either:
    *   give their employer a notice requiring deductions of contributions from their salary or wages; or
    *   give or show to their employer a copy of a notice from the Commissioner stating that he or she has been granted a contributions holiday.

The information must be given as soon as practicable after the person starts the new employment. Employers are required to give notice to the Commissioner of the information that the employee provides them, if the employer is satisfied that the employee is subject to the automatic enrolment rules.

Persons who opt in via their employer must provide their employer with their name, address and tax file number. Employers are required to give notice to the Commissioner of the information that the employee provides them, if the employer is satisfied that the employee is eligible to opt in.

Employers must provide the above information no later than the time they are next required to deliver an employer monthly schedule to the Commissioner.

**Example one**  
NW Inc. is satisfied that their new employee, James, is subject to the automatic enrolment rules. James only provides NW Inc with his name and tax file number (James does not provide his address). NW Inc. is required to give the information that James supplied to the Commissioner no later than the time it is next required to deliver an employer monthly schedule to the Commissioner. NW Inc. is not required to provide James's address to the Commissioner.

_Providers who contract directly with a person to be a member of its scheme_  
People who are under 18 or who are not an employee (for example, the self-employed) may opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a provider. Providers who contract directly with a person to be a member of its KiwiSaver scheme must give notice to the Commissioner of that fact as soon as practicable after entering into the contract. The notice must contain the following information:

*   the person's name and address;
*   the person's tax file number;
*   the date of the first contribution received by the provider for the person (if any);
*   if the person is an employee, the name and address of each of the person's employers where deductions of contributions are to be made from salary or wages and the contribution rate in relation to each of those employers;
*   the name, address and tax file number of both the provider and the scheme; and
*   any other information that the Commissioner requires.

If the Commissioner receives notice from a provider that an employee has opted in, the Commissioner must, as soon as practicable, give notice to each of the person's employers to whom the opt-in notice relates stating:

*   that the employer must start to make deductions of contributions from each payment of the person's salary or wages that is calculated after the date the employer receives the notice from the Commissioner;
*   the contribution rate; and
*   the person's name and tax file number.

**Example one**  
Isabel generally works for herself but is also an employee of the local council, where she works "as and when required". Isabel contracts directly with Super Ltd, a KiwiSaver scheme provider and names the council as her employer. Super Ltd must provide the Commissioner the required information about Isabel. The Commissioner is required to inform the local council to begin making deductions of contributions from wages paid to Isabel.  
  
**Example two**  
Jenna is 16 years old and has two part-time jobs. She contracts directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider and names only Employer A to have deductions of contributions from her wages. Employer A receives notice from the Commissioner to begin making deductions of contributions from Jenna's wages. The Commissioner does not receive any information from Jenna's KiwiSaver scheme provider about Employer B and does not send any notice to Employer B.

_Information packs_  
Under section 40 the Commissioner must supply information packs about KiwiSaver to employers. The Commissioner must also supply information packs to any person on request. Section 41 provides that information packs must contain the following information:

*   a description of KiwiSaver;
*   a statement that membership of KiwiSaver, and of any individual KiwiSaver scheme, is at the member's own risk;
*   a summary of what could happen under the default allocation rules or if an employer has a chosen KiwiSaver scheme;
*   a description of how to access information about KiwiSaver schemes;
*   a statement that people should seek financial advice from a professional financial advisor (rather than an employer) if they want information in relation to:
    *   their personal financial circumstances;
    *   deciding whether to opt in or opt out or not;
    *   choosing a KiwiSaver scheme or investment product of a KiwiSaver scheme; or
    *   KiwiSaver or its financial concepts.
*   an opt-out notice form;
*   a statement about collection of personal information that complies with principle 3 in the Privacy Act 1993 (which relates to the collection of information from a subject); and
*   any other prescribed information.

Section 42 requires employers to supply an information pack to employees who:

*   are subject to the automatic enrolment rules (within seven days of the new employment beginning);
*   opt in by giving their employer a notice that requires deductions of contributions (within seven days of the notice being given to the employer); and
*   request an information pack in contemplation of opting in.

**Example one**  
Mio begins a new job on 5 September 2007 and is subject to the automatic enrolment rules. Mio's employer must give her an information pack no later than 11 September 2007.  
  
**Example two**  
Julie tells her employer that she is thinking about joining KiwiSaver and would like an information pack. Her employer is required to give her one. This alone does not mean that Julie has joined, or is required to join, KiwiSaver.

Employers may be liable for a penalty for failure to supply an information pack. However, employers are not liable for such a penalty if the employer proves that:

*   failure of the employer to supply the information pack was caused by the fact that the Commissioner had not given the employer enough information packs to enable the employer to meet its obligations; and
*   the employer notified the Commissioner that it needed more information packs as soon as practicable after realising it did not have enough.

Further information on penalties that are to apply for KiwiSaver purposes is outlined below (under Part 5).

**Example one**  
MA Ltd employs five new staff members and all of them are subject to automatic enrolment. MA Ltd only has four information packs left and is therefore unable to provide one of the new employees an information pack within seven days of employment beginning. Because MA Ltd notified the Commissioner that it needed more information packs as soon as realising it would not have enough, MA Ltd will not be penalised for failing to supply an information pack within the required seven-day period.

_Employers who have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme_  
Section 43 requires that employers who have chosen a KiwiSaver scheme for their employees must also, at the time the information pack is supplied to the employee, supply:

*   an investment statement for that scheme (if that choice of KiwiSaver scheme is effective); and
*   a statement that, if the employee does not choose his or her own KiwiSaver scheme, the employee will be allocated to the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme (and not to one of the default KiwiSaver schemes by the Commissioner).

**Example one**  
Stanley & Sons has chosen KAB Ltd scheme for its employees. Stanley & Sons' new staff member is subject to automatic enrolment. At the same time as an information pack is given to the new employee, an investment statement for KAB Ltd scheme must be given to the employee. The employee must also be given a statement that they will be allocated to that scheme if they do not choose their own scheme.

  

1 As defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act.  
2 As referred to in paragraphs (b)(iii), (b)(x) and (b)(xii)-(xvi) respectively in the definition of salary and wages in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act.  
3 As defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act.  
4 This is a requirement even if the next return due is a nil return.

[Part 2 - Membersip of Kiwisaver](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver-act-2006/part-2-membersip-of-kiwisaver "Part 2 - Membersip of Kiwisaver")

Subpart 2 - Allocating people to KiwiSaver schemes
==================================================

2006 legislation covering the allocation of people to individual KiwiSaver schemes and setting out the three ways people can become members of a scheme.

Subpart 2 allows the allocation of people to individual KiwiSaver schemes. Section 53 specifies that a person may be a member of only one KiwiSaver scheme at a time, but can have more than one account or investment product of any one scheme. There are three ways that a person can become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme:

#### People may choose their own KiwiSaver scheme

Section 45 allows a person to choose their own KiwiSaver scheme at any time by contracting directly with the provider of the scheme to become a member. This choice overrides an employer choice of KiwiSaver scheme or an allocation to a default KiwiSaver scheme by the Commissioner.

#### Employer choice of KiwiSaver scheme

Sections 46 to 49 allow employers to choose a KiwiSaver scheme for their employees. If they do, any employees who start new employment will then become members of that scheme if the employees do not choose their own KiwiSaver scheme.

An employer may choose a KiwiSaver scheme only if all new permanent employees of the employer are eligible to be members of the scheme and the KiwiSaver Act applies to the employees. "Permanent employees" are employees other than those employed in temporary employment (as defined earlier).

The way in which an employer may choose a KiwiSaver scheme is:

*   by agreement with a provider to give access to the scheme for its employees; and
*   by giving notice to the Commissioner of the name, address and tax file number of the employer, the provider and the chosen KiwiSaver scheme.

An employer's choice of KiwiSaver scheme is effective:

*   from the date on which the notice is accepted by the Commissioner, or on any later date specified in the notice; and
*   until the effective date of the earliest of any of the following notices:
    *   notice given by the employer to the Commissioner of an alternative choice of KiwiSaver scheme;
    *   notice given by the employer to the Commissioner stating that the employer no longer has a chosen KiwiSaver scheme; or
    *   notice given by the Commissioner to the employer stating that the employer's choice of KiwiSaver scheme has been revoked by the Commissioner on the grounds that the Commissioner is not satisfied that the scheme is eligible to be the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme.

While an employer's choice of KiwiSaver scheme is effective:

*   three months after the Commissioner receives the first contribution for an employee who has been automatically enrolled or who has opted in via their employer, the person is treated, on that date:
    *   as having offered to become a member of the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme; and
    *   as having subscribed for securities in that scheme;
*   the provider of the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme must accept that offer and allot those securities;
*   the membership contract of the KiwiSaver scheme is binding on the employee and the provider, and is enforceable as if it were a contract that was freely and voluntarily entered into;
*   the contract may be amended, replaced or terminated, and the allotment of any securities relating to the contract may be voided, in the same way as if the contract were freely and voluntarily entered into; and
*   the Commissioner must, as soon as practicable, give notice to the provider of the scheme the employee's name, address, date of birth (if known to the Commissioner), tax file number, and any other personal information that the Commissioner considers relevant.

If an employer's choice of KiwiSaver scheme ceases or changes, the cessation or change does not affect any person who became a member while the scheme was the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme.[5](#05)

#### Default KiwiSaver schemes

In cases where the employee does not choose their own KiwiSaver scheme or if their employer does not have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme, sections 50 to 52 provide for the employee to be allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme by the Commissioner.

When the Commissioner is notified that a person has been automatically enrolled or has opted in via their employer, the Commissioner will provisionally allocate the person to a default KiwiSaver scheme, except where:

*   the person is an employee of an employer whose chosen KiwiSaver scheme is effective;
*   the person has opted out; or
*   the Commissioner has been notified by a provider that the person has become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

After notification, the Commissioner must as soon as practicable:

*   provisionally allocate the person (on a sequential basis) to a default investment product of a default KiwiSaver scheme;
*   give notice to the person of that allocation, including the name and address of the scheme provider they have been provisionally allocated to;
*   send the person the investment statement relating to that product in that scheme; and
*   give notice to the person of what will happen if the person does not choose his or her own KiwiSaver scheme.

People who are provisionally allocated have three months from the time the Commissioner receives the first contribution for the person to choose a KiwiSaver scheme if they wish. Otherwise, the person is treated as having offered to become a member of the scheme to which they were provisionally allocated. The Commissioner is required to notify the person that the allocation has been completed as per the provisional allocation and notify the provider of the default KiwiSaver scheme that the person has been allocated to. The Commissioner is required to give the person's name, address, date of birth (if known), tax file number and any other personal information the Commissioner considers relevant, to the provider.

However, if a dispute is underway on the date which would normally be the final allocation date, the final allocation date is the effective date of the notice given by the Commissioner stating that the dispute has been resolved or otherwise terminated.

At the point of final allocation the person becomes a member of the KiwiSaver scheme, the contributions to be paid via the Commissioner must be held on trust by the provider and the provider must allot the relevant securities. The Act deems the membership contract to be as enforceable, and otherwise the same, as if it were a contract freely entered into.

**Example one**  
Frank opts in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with XYZ Ltd and becomes a member of its scheme. The Commissioner is not required to allocate Frank to a default scheme.  
  
**Example two**  
Lana is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. Her employer has chosen ABC Ltd as its chosen KiwiSaver scheme. She does not choose her own scheme and three months after the Commissioner receives the first contribution for Lana, she is treated as having offered to become a member of ABC Ltd scheme. The Commissioner must give notice to ABC Ltd of Lana's details.  
  
**Example three**  
Suna is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver. Because Suna has not chosen her own scheme and her employer does not have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme, the Commissioner provisionally allocates her to RetireEzy scheme (a default scheme). The Commissioner gives notice to Suna that she has been provisionally allocated to RetireEzy, sends her the relevant investment statement and informs her that if she does not choose her own scheme she will become a member of RetireEzy. The Commissioner does not hear from Suna and three months after receiving the first contribution final allocation occurs to RetireEzy. The Commissioner sends her notice that the allocation has been completed and informs RetireEzy that Suna has become a member of its scheme.  
  
**Example four**  
Arti is automatically enrolled and is provisionally allocated to BI Ltd default scheme by the Commissioner. Two weeks later, Arti contracts with Retire4Life to be a member of its scheme. Arti becomes a member of Retire4Life's scheme.  

5 This does not limit an amendment made to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 which provides for transfers without consent in certain circumstances (this is discussed further below).

[Part 3 - KiwiSaver contributions](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver-act-2006/part-3-kiwisaver-contributions "Part 3 - KiwiSaver contributions")

Subpart 2 - Miscellaneous provisions relating to contributions
==============================================================

KiwiSaver Act 2006 – s 72 requires the CIR to establish a holding account for recording the receipt, deduction, payment and refund of contributions and interest.

#### Inland Revenue KiwiSaver holding account

Section 72 requires the Commissioner to establish a holding account for the purpose of recording the receipt, deduction, payment, and refund of KiwiSaver contributions and interest.

The holding account is not a facility for the purpose of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 1996, which means that the Commissioner is not required to verify the identity of contributions or report suspicious transactions.

_Money entered and paid out of the holding account_  
As soon as practicable after the Commissioner receives an employer monthly schedule showing deductions of KiwiSaver contributions, under section 73 the Commissioner must enter the amount on the schedule in the holding account for the person from whose salary or wages the deduction was made.

Under section 74 the Commissioner must also enter any other contribution received (for example, if a person makes a voluntary contribution to their scheme via Inland Revenue) into the holding account as soon as practicable after receiving the contribution.

As soon as practicable after entering an amount in the holding account, the Commissioner must pay the amount to the provider of the relevant KiwiSaver scheme.

Money entered into the holding account that has been deducted from an employee's salary or wages is not trust money for the purposes of sections 66 to 68 of the Public Finance Act 1989. This is because the government will on-pay such deductions. Money entered other than contributions deducted from an employee's salary or wages, is trust money for the purposes of sections 66 to 68 of the Public Finance Act 1989.

_Initial contributions stay in holding account for three months_  
When a person first becomes a KiwiSaver member, under section 75 the Commissioner must hold all contributions for that person in the holding account until three months after the first contribution was received. The Commissioner must pay those contributions to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme as soon as practicable after expiry of the three-month period. In addition, the Commissioner must give notice to the person as soon as practicable after paying those contributions to the person's KiwiSaver scheme. The provider must also give notice to the person as soon as practicable after receiving those contributions.

The reason for the three-month holding period is to allow the person to seek financial assistance and to choose a KiwiSaver scheme if they wish.

_Employer contributions may stay in holding account until deducted contributions paid_  
If the Commissioner receives a contribution from an employer for a person and that contribution has not been deducted from the person's salary or wages (that is, an employer contribution), under section 76 the Commissioner may:

*   hold the contribution in the holding account; and
*   pay it to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme at the same time as contributions deducted from that person's salary or wages are paid to the provider.

_Small amounts of contributions may be held until large enough to be on-paid_  
If the Commissioner and the KiwiSaver provider agree on a minimum threshold for the payment of contributions to the provider, under section 77 the Commissioner may keep any contribution that relates to a person in the holding account until the amount reaches the minimum threshold. Once the amount reaches the minimum threshold, the Commissioner must pay the amount to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme.

_Treatment of unremitted deductions in holding account_  
If a deduction is not paid to the Commissioner on or before the date on which the employer is required to pay it to the Commissioner, under section 78 the Commissioner must pay the amount out of a Crown bank account and the amount is treated as having been received by the Commissioner on the 15th of the month in which the deduction is made. This provision ensures that contributions deducted but not paid by the employer are made good. This means that the employee does not suffer a loss due to non-payment by the employer.

_Information that the Commissioner must supply to providers when paying contributions_  
Under section 79 the Commissioner must supply to the provider any information, in any format, that the Commissioner determines to be relevant, after consultation with the provider.

_Refund by Commissioner of amounts deducted in excess or if employee opts out_  
Under section 80 the Commissioner may refund any amount of contribution to the person from whose salary or wages the amount was deducted if:

*   the person opts out and the contribution is in the possession of the Commissioner;
*   the contribution is more than the amount that is required to be deducted and the contribution is in the possession of the Commissioner; or
*   the person has opted out and the contribution was deducted from their salary or wages but was not refunded to the person or paid to the Commissioner. In this case the Commissioner will recover the unpaid contributions from the employer.

A person may request that the Commissioner transfer all or part of the refundable amount to another tax type.[10](#10)

**Example one**  
Shayne is a member of KiwiSaver. His employer accidentally deducted contributions of 8% of his wages when Shayne was on a contribution rate of 4%. $200 has been deducted from his wages to date, which has not yet been on-paid to the KiwiSaver scheme provider. The Commissioner gives Shayne a refund of $100.  
  
**Example two**  
Ella is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver but opts out seven weeks after she began her new job. Ella has had $300 of KiwiSaver contributions deducted from her pay. Instead of getting a refund from the Commissioner, Ella requests that the $300 be treated as a voluntary repayment towards her student loan.

_Refund by provider of amounts paid in excess of required contribution_  
Any excess amount that is paid by the Commissioner to the provider must be refunded to the Commissioner under section 81. The Commissioner must refund or give credit for the amount refunded by the provider to the employee in the manner that the Commissioner sees fit. Again, a person may request that the Commissioner transfer all or part of the amount able to be refunded to another tax type.

**Example one**  
Maria is a member of KiwiSaver and her employer accidentally deducted contributions of 10% of her wages when she was on a contribution rate of 8%. The Commissioner has passed $1,000 of contributions to the provider. The provider is required to refund $200 to the Commissioner. The Commissioner refunds or gives credit to Maria for the $200 refunded.

_Trustee investment rules do not apply to contributions in the holding account_  
Section 82 specifies that Part 2 of the Trustee Act 1956 (which relates to investment by trustees) does not apply to the Commissioner in relation to money in the holding account.

_Unclaimed money held by the Commissioner_  
If money has been in the Commissioner's possession for at least six years and the Commissioner has insufficient information to process that money in accordance with the Act then section 83 provides that the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 applies to that money. No interest is payable on that money for the period the Unclaimed Money Act applies.

#### Interest on contributions

Interest on money in the holding account Under sections 84 to 87 the Commissioner is liable to pay interest on any amount that is received, or treated as received as a contribution for a person.

The interest rate is:

Commissioner's paying rate[11](#11)
 x (1 - lowest tax rate)[12](#12)

The amount of interest payable by the Commissioner on a contribution for a person is calculated using the following formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (interest rate x contribution[13](#13)<br>) x | interest period[14](#14) |
| 365 |

If the Commissioner's paying rate changes during an interest period, under section 90 the paying rate is taken to be the weighted average rate based on the number of days on which each rate applied during the period.

For the purpose of the payment of interest, every amount of contribution that is deducted from salary or wages is treated as received by the Commissioner on the 15th day of the month in which the deduction is made.

Section 69 of the Public Finance Act 1989 (which relates to payment of interest on trust money) does not apply to the holding account.

The Income Tax Act 2004 was amended to treat the interest received as exempt income and exempt interest.

_How and when interest is paid on on-payments_  
Under section 88, interest payable on a contribution that is on-paid to a provider must be paid to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme at the same time the contribution is on-paid.

_How and when interest is paid on refunds_  
If a contribution is refunded by the Commissioner, interest must be paid with the refund under section 89. However, no interest is payable if the interest on that refund is less than $5. The $5 threshold may be increased by the Governor-General by Order in Council.

_Overpaid interest_  
Section 91 provides that interest overpaid by the Commissioner may be recovered in the same manner as income tax that is payable under the Income Tax Act (income tax that is payable can be recovered under the Tax Administration Act 1994).

10 In accordance with section 173L of the Tax Administration Act.  
11 "Commissioner's paying rate" is the rate of interest established and notified as the Commissioner's paying rate by Order in Council made under section 120H of the Tax Administration Act as the Commissioner's paying rate applying on the day on which the contribution is received or treated as received.  
12 "Lowest tax rate" is the basic rate of tax stated in Part B of Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 in respect of a taxable income that is not more than $38,000 for a tax year (expressed as a decimal).  
13 "Contribution" is the amount of contribution in respect of the person to whom the interest is payable.  
14 "Interest period" is the number of days in the period that begins on the day on which the Commissioner receives, or is treated as receiving, the amount of contribution and ends with the day on which the Commissioner on-pays the amount of contribution to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme or refunds the amount.

Subpart 3 - Contributions other than deductions from salary or wages
====================================================================

KiwiSaver Act 2006 – subpart 3 allows contributions other than those that are deducted from an employee's salary or wages to be made.

This subpart allows contributions other than those that are deducted from an employee's salary or wages to be made.

#### Contributions may be paid via the Commissioner

Under section 93, an employer may make a contribution to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme by paying it to the Commissioner, provided that the contribution is a "specified superannuation contribution".[15](#15)
 The employer employer contributions to the Commissioner to be on-paid:

*   to the provider of the KiwiSaver scheme, if the employer has a contractual obligation to the provider to pay those contributions; and
*   to the employee, if the employer has a contractual obligation to pay those contributions.

The employer contribution must be accompanied by a remittance certificate and must be paid to the Commissioner within the time prescribed[16](#16)
 as if the contribution were a tax deduction. The payments must be made net of specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable (if any).

The employer must include details of the contributions made for each employee on the employer monthly schedule that the employer is required to deliver to the Commissioner in relation to that month.

Under section 95 a person other than an employer (including a member of a KiwiSaver scheme) may make a contribution to a person's KiwiSaver scheme by paying it to the Commissioner, provided the contribution is accompanied by the person's:

*   name and address;
*   tax file number; and
*   any other information that the Commissioner may require.

Under section 96 the Commissioner must pay the contribution into the holding account and then on-pay the contribution to the person's KiwiSaver scheme provider.

**Example one**  
Under her employment contract, Chloe is entitled to an employer contribution to her KiwiSaver scheme for every dollar she contributes (subject to a cap). The employer decides that it would prefer to pay the employer contributions to Inland Revenue along with PAYE, student loan deductions and other tax obligations rather than paying them direct to the provider. The employer contribution must be net of any specified superannuation contribution withholding tax.  
  
**Example two**  
Julie wishes to make a one-off payment to her son Mark's KiwiSaver scheme. Julie can send her payment to the Commissioner provided it is accompanied by Mark's details.  
  
**Example three**  
Frank is self-employed. He wishes to make a contribution of $500 to his KiwiSaver scheme and pays this to the Commissioner at the same time he makes provisional tax payments.

#### Contributions not remitted or short paid

If an employer shows a payment of an employer contribution on a remittance certificate or an employer monthly schedule and the payment is not received in full by the Commissioner by the time the Commissioner receives the remittance certificate or monthly schedule for that PAYE period, the Commissioner must give notice under section 97 to the employer that the payment has not been received.

If the total amount received by the Commissioner for deductions from all employees' salary and wages and employer contributions is less than that shown on the remittance certificate or employer monthly schedule, under section 98 the employer contribution treated as received will be equal to the amount actually received and after the following deductions have been made for:

*   combined tax and earner premium payments;[17](#17)
    
*   child support;
*   student loans; and
*   KiwiSaver contributions.

Under section 99, the amount of the employer contribution (gross of any specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable) that is treated as received by the Commissioner for any one employee must be calculated by the Commissioner as follows:

|     |
| --- |
| a x b |
| c   |

  
where -ais the total employer contributions received by the Commissioner for all of the employer's employees for the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates.bis the employer contribution shown on the employer monthly schedule for the relevant employee for the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates.cis the total employer contribution shown on either or both of the remittance certificate or employer monthly schedule for all of the employer's employees for the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates.

This calculation does not prevent the provider of a KiwiSaver scheme from crediting amounts on the basis provided for in the trust deed or other document governing employer contributions.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Example one**  <br>ABC Ltd has 10 employees. The employer monthly schedule for June shows: |     |
| Total tax and earner premium deductions | $ 50,000 |
| Total child support deductions | $ 5,000 |
| Total student loan deductions | $ 2,000 |
| Deductions of KiwiSaver contributions | $ 2,000 |
| Employer contributions | $ 2,000 |
| Total | $ 61,000 |
| The Commissioner only received $60,000 from ABC Ltd. The employer contribution that is treated as received by the Commissioner is $1,000.  <br>  <br>The employer monthly schedule shows that $400 of the $2,000 employer contribution related to Mel. The amount of the employer contribution that is treated as received for Mel is equal to: |     |
| $1,000 x $400 |     |
| $2,000 |     |
| A $200 employer contribution is treated as having been received for Mel. |     |

#### Refunds of employer contributions if employee opts out

Under section 100 if an employee opts out after an employer contribution is paid to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may, if it is still in his or her possession, refund the employer contribution to the employer.

#### Refunds of employer contributions by provider

Under section 101 the provider of a KiwiSaver scheme may refund to the Commissioner any amount of employer contribution that was paid by the Commissioner in excess of the amount that the Commissioner was required to onpay to the provider.

However, no refund will be made if the contribution paid in relation to a payment of salary or wages is less, after the refund is deducted, than what is required under the Act according to the employee's contribution rate.

15 As defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act, "specified superannuation contribution" is a contribution that:

*   is an employer's superannuation contribution; and
*   is made in money; and
*   is made to a superannuation fund (a superannuation scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989).

16 As per section NC 15 of the Income Tax Act.

Subpart 3 - Transfers between KiwiSaver schemes
===============================================

2006 legislation covering subpart 3 of the KiwiSaver Act and voluntary or involuntary transfers between KiwiSaver schemes.

Subpart 3 allows a person to transfer between individual KiwiSaver schemes.

#### Voluntary transfers

Section 55 allows a KiwiSaver member to transfer to another KiwiSaver scheme at any time by contracting directly with the provider of the new KiwiSaver scheme to become a member of that scheme (provided that person is eligible to be a member of the scheme).

The provider of the new scheme must, as soon as practicable, give notice:

*   To the Commissioner:
    *   that the person has transferred to the new scheme;
    *   the person's name, address, date of birth and tax file number.
*   To the provider of the old scheme:
    *   that the person has ceased to be a member of the old scheme and the effective date of the transfer;
    *   the new scheme's name and address; and
    *   the funds and information that is required to be transferred.

The provider of the new scheme must give notice to the provider of the old scheme that the member wishes to transfer to the new scheme.

The provider of the old scheme must, within 35 days of receiving notice of the transfer (or any longer period agreed between the providers of the old and new schemes):

*   transfer the member's accumulated funds to the new scheme;[6](#06)
    
*   give notice to the member of the amount transferred;
*   give notice to the provider of the new scheme:
    *   of the date on which the member first became a member of a KiwiSaver scheme;
    *   whether the member has made a withdrawal for the purchase of a first home; and
    *   of any contributions holidays in force.

#### Involuntary transfers

In certain circumstances a person may become ineligible to be in a particular scheme, for example:

*   if the person ceases to be eligible to be a member of his or her employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme (for example, if they ceased to be an employee of that employer and the scheme only applies to its employees);
*   if the scheme they are in winds up;
*   if the scheme is in contravention of certain provisions of securities law.

Under sections 57 to 59, the person must be allocated to another KiwiSaver scheme according to the process outlined above. In this case an employer choice of scheme will not apply. The person can choose their own KiwiSaver scheme, but if they do not choose they will be allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme.

The Commissioner is required to take whatever steps the Commissioner thinks appropriate to ensure that, so far as practicable, the process for an involuntary transfer follows the process for a voluntary transfer. The provider of the old scheme will, however, have three months from when it received notice of the transfer (instead of 35 days) to meet the requirements outlined above.

The Commissioner must send the following information to people who are subject to an involuntary transfer:

*   an information pack;
*   advice on the effect of the transfer and the process of allocating the member to another KiwiSaver scheme.

If an employee ceases to be eligible to be a member of the employer's chosen KiwiSaver scheme, the employer must give the employee and the Commissioner notice of that fact.

**Example one**  
Peter is a member of his employer's (FashionZ Ltd) KiwiSaver scheme. One of the conditions of being a member of that scheme is that the person remains an employee of FashionZ Ltd. Peter quits his job and therefore ceases to be eligible to be a member of that scheme. The Commissioner is required to provisionally allocate Peter to a default scheme. If Peter does not choose his own scheme within the required time period, Peter is treated as having become a member of the default scheme to which he was provisionally allocated.  

6 Member's accumulated funds is the net value of the total of:

*   the member's contributions;
*   any vested employer contributions in respect of the member;
*   any fee subsidies paid in respect of the member; and
*   the Crown contribution in respect of the member.

Subpart 4 - Contributions holidays
==================================

KiwiSaver Act 2006 – Part 3 subpart 4 allows KiwiSaver members to receive a holiday from compulsory deductions of contributions from their salary or wages.

This subpart allows KiwiSaver members to receive a holiday from compulsory deductions of contributions from their salary or wages.

#### Applying for a contributions holiday

Under section 102 an individual can apply to the Commissioner for a contributions holiday any time after:

*   the Commissioner receives the first contribution for the person if they are suffering or are likely to suffer financial hardship;
*   12 months have expired since the earlier of:

*   the date that the Commissioner received the first contribution for the person; or
*   the date that a provider received the first contribution for the person's membership of a KiwiSaver scheme.

Under section 103 an application for a contributions holiday can be made by any means that the Commissioner accepts. The application must tell the Commissioner:

*   the person's name and address;
*   the person's tax file number;
*   the name and address of each employer that the person intends the holiday to apply to;
*   the period of time that the holiday is required;
*   in the case of financial hardship, the details of that hardship (Inland Revenue will provide guidelines as to what constitutes "financial hardship"); and
*   any other information that the Commissioner requires.

#### Grant of a contributions holiday

Under section 104 the Commissioner must accept an application for a contributions holiday if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person meets the requisite criteria and provides the required information.

A financial hardship contributions holiday will be granted for a period of three months, unless the Commissioner agrees to a longer period. Any other contributions holiday will be granted for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of five years or the period specified in the application (whichever is the shorter).

As soon as practicable after granting a contributions holiday, the Commissioner must give notice under section 105:

*   to the person who applied for the holiday, that the holiday has been granted and the date on which the holiday will end;
*   to each relevant employer, that a contributions holiday has been granted and that the employer must stop making deductions of contribution from the salary or wages of that person;
*   to the provider of the person's KiwiSaver scheme, that a contributions holiday has been granted, the names of the relevant employers and that deductions of contributions may not be made from the salary or wages paid to the person by the relevant employers during the period of the holiday.

"Relevant employer" means each employer that the contributions holiday was intended to apply to, as stated in the person's application to the Commissioner.

If an employer is notified by the Commissioner that it must stop making deductions of contributions for an employee, under section 106 deductions must cease from the next payment of salary or wages that the employer calculates after the date on which the notice is received.

#### Employers to whom contributions holiday applies

Section 107 specifies that a contributions holiday applies to each employer as stated in the person's application to the Commissioner. If the person chooses, it may also be used for any other employer.

#### End of contributions holiday

Sections 109 to 111 set out what happens at the end of a contributions holiday. The Commissioner must give notice to a KiwiSaver member who is taking a contributions holiday before the holiday ends. The Commissioner must also give notice to each affected employer known as soon as practicable after the end of a contributions holiday. The notice must specify the date on which the contributions holiday ends and the date on which the employer must start making deductions of contributions from the salary or wages of a person.

Section 112 allows a person to revoke his or her contributions holiday with an employer at any time by giving notice to the employer to make deductions of contributions from their salary or wages. To prevent employees requesting employers to stop and start deductions of contributions too often, section 108 specifies that a contributions holiday may not be used for less than three months, unless the employer agrees.

Deductions of contributions must begin from the next payment of salary or wages that is calculated after the date on which the employer receives the notice from the Commissioner or the KiwiSaver member.

#### Refunds

Section 113 allows a KiwiSaver member to apply to the Commissioner for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account if the person is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant financial hardship or if he or she is suffering serious illness, as defined in Schedule 1 of the Act (as outlined below).

The applications may be made by any means that the Commissioner accepts. The application must tell the Commissioner:

*   the person's name and address;
*   the person's tax file number;
*   details of the significant financial hardship or serious illness; and
*   any other information that the Commissioner requires.

The Commissioner must refund the contributions to which the application relates if the person and the application meet the requirements. However, no refund of any employer contributions will be made. The Commissioner must give notice of the refund to the provider of the relevant KiwiSaver scheme.

If an employee who is taking a contributions holiday starts new employment and cannot show his or her employer that they are taking a contributions holiday - for example, if they lose the notice from the Commissioner granting the contributions holiday, the employer will be required to make deductions of contributions from their salary or wages. The employer may, however, refund to the employee any contributions deducted under section 114 if the employee can later show the employer that they are taking a contributions holiday - for example, if the employee got a replacement notice from the Commissioner. The Commissioner may also refund those contributions to the employee if they are held by the Commissioner.

**Example one**  
Joyce has been a KiwiSaver member for two years. She applies to the Commissioner for a contributions holiday. In her application she states that she wants the holiday to apply to both of her employers and that she wants to take a contributions holiday for one year. The Commissioner accepts Joyce's application and gives notice to her employers to stop making deductions of contributions from her wages. Three months later, Joyce decides that she wants contributions to begin from the wages she receives from her main job. She gives notice to her employer requiring deductions of contributions from her wages. As required, her employer begins making deductions. Close to the expiry of her one-year contributions holiday, the Commissioner writes to Joyce stating that her contributions holiday is about to end. Joyce does not apply for another contributions holiday and the Commissioner writes to her employer stating that deductions of contributions must begin.  
  
**Example two**  
Tony has been contributing to KiwiSaver for five months. He is struggling to make ends meet and applies to the Commissioner for a contributions holiday. After receiving evidence of his financial situation, the Commissioner grants Tony a financial hardship contributions holiday for three months. Three months later, Tony is still struggling and is granted another contributions holiday.  
  
**Example three**  
Jin is taking a contributions holiday and starts new employment. He has lost his contributions holiday letter and so his employer must begin making deductions of contributions. He has had $300 deducted from his salary before he finds the letter from Inland Revenue granting the holiday. Jin shows the employer his letter and deductions of contributions stop. Because his employer has already paid the contributions to Inland Revenue, the Commissioner refunds the $300 to Jin.  
  
**Example four**  
Mohammad has been contributing to KiwiSaver for six years and wants to take a contributions holiday. His application for a three-year holiday is accepted. The Commissioner writes to Mohammad shortly before his contributions holiday expires. Mohammad applies for another three-year contributions holiday which is granted

=====================================

2014 case note – construction of retail shopping centre and sale agreement – capital/revenue, supply.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v John Curtis Developments Limited

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Income Tax Act 2007, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Facts

In 1988, the taxpayer (a property developer) purchased a large block of land in Christchurch and began construction of a retail shopping centre on the site.

In 2003, before the development was fully complete, the taxpayer sold the centre to AMP. The agreement for sale and purchase between the taxpayer and AMP ("the Agreement") contained an "option" which required the taxpayer to use its best endeavours to lease and build the undeveloped part of the centre.

The sites to be constructed and completed were described as Future Development Sites ("the FDS") in the agreement.

Between 2004 and 2009, the taxpayer found tenants and procured unconditional agreements to lease. The taxpayer received "development payments" from AMP as the new tenants started paying rent.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found the following in its decision of 23 October 2013:

1.  The Agreement was a single, unitary contract for sale and purchase of the completed centre.
2.  The adjustment provisions of the Agreement clearly envisaged the completion of the development and were consistent with the disputant's position that the Agreement provided for the sale and purchase of the completed centre.
3.  The development option was not in fact an option that could be exercised. If the taxpayer failed to develop all of the proposed FDS units, it would be in breach of the obligation to use the best endeavours to develop the site.
4.  What was supplied was a capital asset as the Agreement was for a single indivisible supply of a completed shopping centre.
5.  FDS development payments were not taxable. No shortfall penalties were payable.

The TRA also rejected the alternative submission of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") that the payments were taxable under s CB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as derived from an undertaking entered into for the purpose of making a profit.

The Commissioner appealed the TRA's decision.

### Decision

The Court allowed the Commissioner's appeal.

#### _Two preliminary points_

The Court began by considering two preliminary points: parole evidence; and the respondent's submission that the Commissioner had impermissibly shifted her grounds in the TRA, departing from her Statement of Position ("SOP").

In relation to the parole evidence issue, Kos J did not consider subjective declarations of the parties as to their intentions during pre-contractual negotiations relevant. His Honour did not consider them to be capable of providing objective guidance as to the intended meaning.

In respect to the second preliminary point, Kos J considered the Court of Appeal's decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Zentrum Holdings Limited_ \[2007\] 1 NZLR 145 (CA) ("_Zentrum_"), determining that it was binding on the High Court. His Honour then noted that _Vinelight Nominees Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZCA 655, (2013) 26 NZTC 21,055,distinguished between SOP and pleadings, finding that the Commissioner's SOP need only give an outline of the facts, evidence and propositions of law in sufficient "detail to fairly inform the disputant".

Kos J was satisfied that the Commissioner had done so here and that there was no place in the law for "arid literalism where clear meaning was conveyed despite form".

His Honour stated that even if that was not the case, the pleading would be permitted under s 138G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") as response to the assertion made in the taxpayer's SOP.

#### _One supply or two_

The Court noted that a single transaction in a single contract may nonetheless contain two or more supplies for tax purposes. Some receipts may be capital, whereas others are income. Whether that is or not, is to be assessed in accordance with the principles stated in _Wattie v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1997) 18 NZTC 13,927 (CA) (upheld on appeal: \[1999\] 1 NZLR 529 (PC)).

Kos J held that the agreement in this case contains two distinct and separately identifiable supplies. The first is the transfer of land, payment for which is a capital receipt. The second is letting and construction services concerning the still undeveloped FDS land, now owned by a third party.

His Honour did not accept that the Agreement, properly construed, provides simply for the sale and purchase of a completed retail development.

In particular, his Honour did not consider that the clauses in the Agreement relied upon by the disputant provided a clear pointer to the Agreement containing a single indivisible supply; a completed shopping centre. The fact that the parties had used a broad label to describe what is being transacted did not necessarily characterise the whole of the transaction from a taxation perspective.

Kos J instead noted that several clauses in the Agreement showed the "functional and temporal" separation of the two supplies. His Honour disagreed with the TRA's findings in relation to these clauses, concluding as follows:

1.  The Agreement divided the consideration into two distinct sums: the purchase price and the development payments. Each clearly attributable to a different type of performance.
2.  The adjustment provisions were not a financial penalty for non-completion of the development and did not demonstrate that the taxpayer was compelled to deliver a completed shopping centre.
3.  The taxpayer would not be in breach of the agreement if it failed to complete development of the FDS sites, it was only obliged to use best endeavours to develop the FDS under the development option. (The Court adopted the approach to best endeavours clauses taken in _Kingdon Development Ltd v Saiteys McMahon Property Ltd_ CIV-2007-404-3760, 17 October 2007 at \[21\], noting that the development option did not require the taxpayer to develop a site at its own cost in the event that neither the taxpayer nor AMP had been able to find tenants.)
4.  After the settlement of the sale of the land, when the development option took practical effect, the land no longer belonged to the taxpayer. It belonged to AMP. Therefore, all work to be done was on land belonging to AMP, not the taxpayer.
5.  The Agreement contemplated cancelling the development option separately from the principal agreement.

Kos J considered that the taxpayer, having chosen by its agreement to separate the form and timing of distinct obligations to supply, could not now re-amalgamate them because it better suited its taxation objectives. It could not have it both ways.

#### _Shortfall penalties_

The Court also held that the TRA upheld the taxpayer's position in a "cogent and careful" decision. Therefore, the taxpayer's position, while wrong, was rationally arguable so shortfall penalties were not imposed.

Successful strike-out of a judicial review
==========================================

2010 case note – application for judicial review as an abuse of process struck out - strike-out, default assessments, challenge proceedings.

Case

JD Hardie v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court decided in the Commissioner's favour, striking out Mr Hardie's application for judicial review as an abuse of process.

### Impact of decision

This decision applies the decisions of _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ \[2009\] NZCA 24 and _Tannadyce Investments Limited v CIR_ \[2010\] NZCA 233. Judicial review of an assessment in law is only available in exceptional cases where either there has been no assessment or there has been conscious maladministration fatally tainting the assessment.

The Court also found that the issue whether an assessment is so arbitrary that the officer who made it could not honestly believe it to be accurate is to be tested through the challenge procedure and is not capable of being assessed on an application for judicial review.

### Facts

Mr Hardie failed to file his income tax returns for the years ended 31 March 1999 to 2005 and goods and services tax (GST) returns for the monthly periods ended 31 March 2003 to 30 April 2006. The Commissioner made default assessments. Mr Hardie did not, and has not, filed returns or issued notices of proposed adjustments.

Mr Hardie commenced then discontinued his first application for judicial review claiming that the Commissioner in making the default assessments was culpable of conscious maladministration. He applied again for judicial review of the default assessments, requesting orders for discovery.

The Commissioner applied to strike out Mr Hardie's judicial review application on the grounds that it was vexatious and an abuse of process.

### Decision

The Court noted that "the statutory objection process \[Parts 8 and 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA")\] has primacy and only exceptionally does judicial review have a place". The "statutory objection procedure" is not just primary, but is also curative.

The Court referred to the presently definitive decision of the Court of Appeal in _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ \[2009\] NZCA 24 where the:

> Court held that judicial review of a tax assessment will only be justified where (i) what purports to be an assessment is not; or (ii) in exceptional cases, such as where there has been conscious maladministration; and that, as the Court said, is ‘a particularly inauspicious statutory context for judicial review' \[15\].

The Court also considered the recent (and similar) case of _Tannadyce Investments Limited v CIR_ \[2010\] NZCA 233 where the Court of Appeal was even more emphatic than in _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ that an inquiry by discovery could cut across the sections 109 and 114 TAA presumptions.

Mr Hardie contended that the default assessments were arbitrary and that he was precluded from using the statutory disputes and challenge procedures as he is required to furnish returns which he is unable to do as his financial records are neither complete nor accurate.

The Court held at paragraph \[34\] that:

> The issues Mr Hardie raises in his application for review go, I accept, not merely to the accuracy of the default assessments made by the Commissioner but to whether they are arbitrary. That is not enough, however, to warrant his application proceeding. Those issues, could, had Mr Hardie elected, have been readily resolved within the statutory challenge process, which extends to issues of validity as well as correctness.

The very issue Mr Hardie sought to have tested - that the default assessments are so arbitrary and that the officer who made them could not have honestly believed they could begin to be accurate - would have been tested in the statutory challenge procedure and is not capable of being set aside on judicial review.

The Court struck out Mr Hardie's application for judicial review because this was not one of those exceptional cases where plainly there is either no assessment or where there had been conscious maladministration tainting the assessment made. Mr Hardie's application therefore constituted an abuse of process.

Sufficient connection - section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004
===============================================================

2014 case note - interest can only be deducted where it is incurred by the person - nexus, sufficient connection, income-earning process.

Case

Ean Innes Brown v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 1599

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") disallowed interest deductions claimed by the appellant, Ean Innes Brown, in the 2005 to 2007 income tax years. The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") and now the High Court have upheld the Commissioner's assessments disallowing the interest deductions due to there being an insufficient connection between the deductions and the appellant's income-earning process.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms that interest can only be deducted where it is incurred by the person and that there must be a sufficient connection between the expense and the income-earning process for the nexus to be met.

### Facts

The appellant, Ean Innes Brown, who practised as a chartered accountant, claimed interest deductions in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 income tax years. The Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the basis that the appellant did not incur the interest expenditure and that there was no sufficient nexus between the payments made by the appellant and the appellant's income-earning process. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties in those income years for failure to take reasonable care. Those assessments were challenged before the TRA and the assessments were upheld.

### Background

The appellant practised as a chartered accountant through a company ("Accounting"). The appellant, his wife, and his business partner were the three directors. A trust ("Trust") was settled by the appellant in 2000. His wife and business partner were the trustees. In 2000, the Trust borrowed $420,000 from the bank and on-lent this to Accounting, which used the funds to purchase an accountancy practice.

In 2004, Trust borrowed a further $250,000 from the bank and on-lent it to Accounting to acquire another accountancy practice. Accounting gave a guarantee of the Trust's indebtedness to the bank. The appellant and others also gave guarantees of the indebtedness to the bank. Over the relevant tax years, the appellant paid the bank the interest charged to the Trust on the loans, in total nearly $100,000.

### Decision

#### _Contractual obligation to reimburse_

The appellant relied upon a minute of the trustees dated 14 April 2004 which recorded that "at the request of \[the Bank\] … it is agreed \[the appellant\] will pay the interest and principal payment on the two loans …". The Court found the appellant's evidence did not establish a legally enforceable obligation on the appellant to pay the interest.

The Court confirmed the finding and reasoning of the TRA that there was no definitive commitment on the appellant to make the interest payment.

#### _Statutory or common law right of indemnity to reimburse_

The appellant asserted an alternative argument that the Trust was liable to reimburse the appellant, either under sections 84 and 85 of the Judicature Act 1908 or under the common law right of indemnification, which arises when a guarantor makes a payment on behalf of the principal debtor.

The Court upheld the finding of the TRA that the appellant has no right to indemnity from the Trust for the interest paid. The Court noted that a prerequisite to the application of sections 84 and 85 of the Judicature Act is that the person seeking to invoke the rights conferred is a "surety for the debt or duty of another", or "liable with another for any debt or duty".

The Court held that the appellant was not a guarantor of the Trust's indebtedness to the bank. Accordingly, the Court found that the appellant's claim to a right of indemnity from the Trust must fail.

#### _Nexus_

Counsel for the appellant proposed that in circumstances where a particular item of expenditure does not have any other nexus with the derivation of any other assessable income, the existence of a right to be reimbursed that item of expenditure by another is sufficient to make both the payment and the subsequent reimbursement part of the income-earning process. No authority was cited in support of this proposition.

As the Court found that there was no contractual, statutory or common law right of indemnity upon the Trust to repay the appellant, it was unnecessary for the Court to consider whether an expectation of reimbursement would meet the test in section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Court found that the interest in this case was not deductible.

#### _Shortfall penalties_

The Court upheld the TRA's finding that a shortfall penalty was payable because the taxpayer did not take reasonable care in taking the tax position he did when claiming a deduction for the amounts paid to the bank. This was largely due to the fact that the appellant is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants with expertise in the field. The TRA upheld the Commissioner's contention that the disputant had not acted as a reasonable person would have in the same circumstances (at \[40\]-\[41\] of _X Ltd (Chartered Accountant) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZTRA 03).

The amount of penalty under section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") for not taking reasonable care is 20 per cent of the resulting tax shortfall. The TRA held that this was reduced by 50 per cent under section 141FB(2) of the TAA.

Summary judgment application
============================

2013 case note - summary judgment applications will not be successful when the defendant has an arguable defence - High Court Rules Part 12, section 46 GST Act.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The plaintiff made a summary judgment application which was unsuccessful on the grounds that the Commissioner has an arguable defence to both of the plaintiff's arguments.

### Impact of Decision

Reiterates the position that summary judgment applications will not be successful when the defendant has an arguable defence.

### Facts

This is a summary judgment application by Mr Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust.

The plaintiff contends that the Commissioner has omitted to pay $594,210.48 in respect of Goods and Service Tax ("GST") refunds for the GST periods ended 31 May 2009 to 31 December 2011 (inclusive). The Commissioner has withheld payment under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act") while the returns are investigated. Mr Mawhinney argues that the refunds are payable as the Commissioner is relevantly satisfied that the returns are in order; and alternatively that the refund is payable because the Commissioner did not initiate an investigation within 15 working days of receiving the information requested under section 46(4) of the GST Act.

### Decision

For his first argument, Mr Mawhinney says that the Commissioner is satisfied as a result of sending the taxpayer two letters. The first letter dated 2 May 2012, enclosed documents called "Notice of assessment for the Forest Trust" and sets out how the GST for each period from 31 May 2009 to 29 February 2012 has been treated. The second letter dated 20 June 2012 also enclosed documents but this time headed up "Acknowledgement of return for the Forest Trust". Apart from the change in title, they were similar to the documents sent with the letter of 2 May 2012.

Mr Mawhinney says that these documents are "assessments" under the Tax Administration Act 1994 and represent decisions made by the Commissioner under section 46(1)(b) of the GST Act that she is "relevantly satisfied" with the trust's GST returns.

The Commissioner refers to the self-assessment system for GST, when taxpayers lodge tax returns they self-assess their tax liability. The Commissioner admits that it was confusing that the documents attached to the 2 May 2012 letter were headed "notice of assessment". However, the Commissioner explains that the documents were generated to address a complaint made to Inland Revenue by Mr Mawhinney. The second letter dated 20 June 2012 notified the plaintiff of the errors in the documents and issued amended versions. The Commissioner submits that on the basis of that evidence, the documents were no more than responses to the taxpayer's requests for information about the GST returns and the label put on the documents is not decisive.

The Court accepted that the Commissioner had an arguable defence that these documents were not assessments and went on to note at \[41\]:

*   Mr Mawhinney's argument does not just turn on whether there were assessments. His claim is that the Commissioner was relevantly satisfied under section 46(1)(b) of the GST Act. For this decision, I assume that the Commissioner may be relevantly satisfied under that section and communicate his satisfaction without making an assessment or giving a notice of assessment as those terms are used in the tax legislation. Mr Mawhinney's reliance on the assessment provisions of the Tax Administration Act is not essential to his argument.

The Court concluded that the case law in _Paul Finance Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,379 (CA)and _Contract Pacific Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,379 (CA)go towards the Commissioner's defence that the documents are not evidence that she had made assessments and therefore, the Court cannot say that the defence is hopeless.

The second argument run by Mr Mawhinney focuses on section 46 of the GST Act. In particular, the Commissioner's request for information, the provision of that information by Mr Mawhinney and the absence of any notification of an investigation or communication within 15 days by the Commissioner of Mr Mawhinney providing that evidence.

The Court recognised in _Contract Pacific Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ that there are only two occasions when the Commissioner must refund. Neither of those situations applies here. The Court again concluded that the Commissioner has an arguable defence in regards to the interpretation of section 46 of the GST Act.

Summary judgment for $367 million
=================================

2014 case note - summary judgment entered by the Court as there was no arguable defence, and no grounds to decline summary judgment.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Russell \[2014\] NZHC 1296

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 1996

### Summary

A summary judgment was entered by the Court as there was no arguable defence, and no grounds upon which the Court ought to exercise its residual discretion to decline summary judgment.

### Impact of decision

A judicial review proceeding will not of itself amount to an arguable defence in a summary judgment application. The discretion of the Court in rule 12.2 is a discretion of the most residual kind.

### Facts

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") applied for summary judgment against John George Russell ("Mr Russell") in the amount of $367,204,207.41, plus costs and disbursements.

In January 2004, the Commissioner assessed Mr Russell for profits of $15,757,556.18 in relation to the 1985 to 2000 income tax years. Mr Russell challenged those assessments in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA"). On 17 September 2009, the tax challenge was dismissed by the TRA.

On 3 September 2010, Mr Russell's appeal of the TRA decision to the High Court was dismissed. On 3 April 2012, the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr Russell's appeal of the High Court decision. On 13 August 2012, Mr Russell's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed.

It was common ground between the parties that Mr Russell had exhausted his ability under the statutory disputes and challenge process provided for by the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

In addition to the original assessments made, over the intervening years, additional tax penalties and interest increased the amount owed to the sum claimed by the Commissioner.

It is relevant to note that Mr Russell commenced judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner just prior to the summary judgment hearing. The judicial review seeks to challenge the Commissioner's decisions reached in 2006 and 2013, not to enter into an instalment payment arrangement with Mr Russell under section 177 of the TAA.

### Decision

The High Court entered summary judgment for the Commissioner in the sum of $367,204,207.41. His Honour directed the parties to confer on the matter of costs and if unable to agree, to file memoranda not exceeding five pages on each side within 10 working days from the date of the judgment.

#### _No arguable defence/effect of the judicial review proceedings on the ability of the Court to enter summary judgment_

The Court dealt with the issues of whether the Commissioner could prove Mr Russell had no arguable defence to her claim and the effect that the filing of the statement of claim commencing judicial review proceedings had on the ability of the Court to enter summary judgment together.

In doing so, the Court considered the causes of action set out in the statement of claim filed in the judicial review and in particular Mr Russell's arguments that the Commissioner's decision to decline to accept Mr Russell's instalment arrangement proposals were "decisions that were not made fairly, reasonably or in accordance with the law".

In particular, the Court referred to the causes of actions whereby Mr Russell asserted that the decisions made by the Commissioner were not consistent with collecting the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law because continuing litigation against him will not lead to any recovery of revenue given he owns no assets.

The Court noted that the Commissioner did not accept that Mr Russell enjoyed any realistic expectation of success in the judicial review proceedings and went on to discuss the central authority relied upon by the Commissioner in support of her submissions, namely _Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 (HC) ("_Raynel_"). After discussing _Raynel_ in detail, the Court accepted the Commissioner's submission that _Raynel_ has been applied in later cases where similar arguments on the Commissioner's duty to maximise recovery of outstanding tax and collect over time the highest net revenue have been raised.

The Court considered that the prospects of Mr Russell successfully obtaining judicial review of the determination on the part of the Commissioner not to accept the proposed instalment plan were not great. Further, the Court considered that the proposal for payment put forward by Mr Russell was not advantageous to the Commissioner.

In coming to a conclusion on the prospect of success in the judicial review proceedings, the Court stated that it has to bring common sense to bear. Accordingly, the Court considered that the argument that Mr Russell had put forward did not constitute a compelling case. However, the Court accepted that having heard arguments and evidence in proceedings which are specifically designed for the purpose of testing the legality of the Commissioner's decisions, the Court might come to a different view to him.

However, his Honour found that on the basis of the material available, the enquiry in the summary judgment proceeding is whether the plaintiff has been able to satisfy the Court that the defendant has "no defence" to the particular cause of action, which has been interpreted as meaning "no bona fide defence, no reasonable ground of defence, no fairly arguable defence", ie, the absence of any real question to be tried. Viewed from that perspective, and adopting as the principal question whether Mr Russell has a prospect of success in the judicial review proceedings, the Court held that the Commissioner had succeeded in showing that Mr Russell had no arguable defence.

#### _Procedural issues raised by the intended application for interim relief_

Before departing from the subject of judicial review and the application for interim relief, the Court commented on the process the Court should take in cases where an issue arises about the possibility that a defendant to proceedings in which judgment is being sought, might be able to seek judicial review which would reverse the basis upon which the judgment is sought.

The Court considered that obiter comments made in _Air New Zealand v Wellington International Airport Ltd_ \[2009\] NZCA 259, \[2009\] 3 NZLR 713 (CA) and _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2010\] NZCA 253, (2010) 24 NZTC 24,341, are authority for the proper process, which is to seek interim relief under section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 prior to the hearing of applications, such as the present proceeding. This is instead of arguing before the Court that its intended judicial review proceeding would arguably provide a defence to a plaintiff's claim.

While the Court noted the comments in the above authorities were obiter and therefore not directly binding, his Honour agreed with the views expressed by the Court in both cases. The Court did not consider that the Commissioner should be delayed in obtaining judgment because of the last minute judicial review proceedings when there had been adequate opportunity for Mr Russell to seek substantive relief by way of judicial review at any time during recent years. Further, having been served with the summary judgment proceedings on 13 December 2013, the Court considered that Mr Russell had adequate time to bring an application for relief.

#### _Exercise of the Court's residual discretion_

The Court accepted the Commissioner's submissions concerning the scope of the discretion under rule 12.2 of the High Court Rules and in particular that the discretion could be exercised where the use of summary judgment would be oppressive or unjust.

In considering whether to exercise the discretion not to enter summary judgment, the Court considered Mr Russell's argument that the Commissioner ought to have agreed to a payment instalment arrangement. The Court noted in regard to this argument that Mr Russell seems to have assumed that attempts to enter summary judgment are so inconsistent with what he sees as his entitlement to a payment instalment plan that the Court ought to exercise its discretion to decline summary judgment.

Accordingly, the Court considered the effect on the underlying debt that would have resulted, if the Commissioner had agreed to enter an instalment arrangement with Mr Russell. In the absence of any statutory indication, the Court commented that it would seem unlikely that the legislative intention was that one effect of entering into an instalment arrangement would be that the underlying debt would be abrogated entirely and replaced by a statutory obligation to make instalment payments. This view was implicitly supported by the fact that there is power in the legislation (section 177B(6) of the TAA) for the Commissioner to cancel an arrangement in certain circumstances.

The Court considered this issue relevant because it was implicit in the fact that Mr Russell invoked the discretion to decline to enter summary judgment that the step would be necessary to permit Mr Russell to take advantage of any instalment arrangement that the Commissioner might eventually be required to enter into as a result of a direction following the judicial review hearing. His Honour concluded in this regard that the entry of judgment would not have the effect of pre-empting interim relief in the judicial review proceedings. In other words, he considered it was not correct to characterise the availability of summary judgment and the instalment type proposal as being mutually exclusive alternatives.

The Court later considered the argument that Mr Russell did not obtain financial advantages equivalent to the amount of the tax imputed to him following the Commissioner's reconstruction of his income under section 99(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Counsel for Mr Russell put forward this argument in support of the Court exercising its discretion not to enter summary judgment. In response, the Court noted that the reconstruction which the Commissioner carried out was approved by the Court of Appeal in its judgment and it was this judgment that finally fixed the tax liability Mr Russell owes.

The Court noted that the Court of Appeal expressed the conclusion that there had been large-scale tax avoidance by a group of companies under the control of Mr Russell. The Court then found that it was not an answer to say that Mr Russell should be able to avoid liability because he did not receive the fruits of the tax avoidance scheme. That is because the legislature when conferring the power of reconstructing tax avoidance arrangements so as to move the burden of those arrangements to the author of the arrangements, did not make it a precondition of the assessment of reconstructed tax that the person assessed should actually have received pecuniary advantages from the arrangement.

The Court held that not only was the analysis of the policy put forward by counsel for Mr Russell flawed, but the entire argument about whether the reconstruction had been carried out on a legally justified basis or otherwise was irrelevant to the question of whether summary judgment ought to be entered.

Further, the Court commented on counsel for Mr Russell's criticism of the Commissioner for allegedly not taking steps to recover the tax from the parties who were the direct beneficiaries of the tax avoidance scheme. The Court found there was no basis upon which it could reasonably decline to enter summary judgment against Mr Russell, noting there were no express terms in the legislation giving rise to a defence of this kind and nor could it be said that such a defence is one that was arguably intended by implication from the legislation.

In conclusion, the Court found there were no grounds upon which the Court ought to exercise the residual discretion to decline summary judgment.

On 21 August 2024, Inland Revenue published a consultation document seeking feedback on the scope of the proposed topic of its next long-term insights briefing (LTIB). The closing day for feedback was 4 October 2024. 2. This document provides a summary of the feedback we received and confirms the topic of Inland Revenue’s next LTIB. Long-term insights briefings 3. LTIBs are future-focused think pieces that government departments produce every three years. They provide information on long-term trends, risks and opportunities that could affect New Zealand in the future, and policy options for responding to these matters. Their purpose is to help us collectively think about and plan for the future. They are developed independently of ministers and are not current government policy. 4. LTIBs go through two rounds of public consultation during their development: first on the proposed topic of a briefing; and second on a full draft of a briefing. Proposed topic 5. The consultation document proposed that Inland Revenue’s next LTIB explore what structure of the tax system would be suitable for the future. It included an environmental scan, which compared New Zealand’s tax system to other countries and flagged the issues that are most likely to affect our tax system in the future. Based on the findings of the environmental scan, it set out Inland Revenue’s view that the future tax system needs to be one with a stable core structure but with flexibility to adapt to changing revenue needs and distributional goals over time. It outlined how we would approach this topic, focusing on two elements of the tax system: the regimes through which we tax income and consumption, and our mix of tax bases. It proposed that the topic’s title be “Our tax system: Bases and regimes”. SUMMARY OF SUBMISSIONS Overview 6. We received a total of 35 submissions on the consultation. These were from 12 groups and 23 individuals (see Appendix 1). 7. Seventeen submissions were generally supportive of the topic. Only one submission supported a completely different topic. The remaining submissions expressed either mixed views about the topic or did not specify whether they supported it or not. 8. The main themes that came through from submissions are discussed below. Theme 1 – fiscal pressures arising from superannuation and healthcare are a key trend 9. The consultation document outlined several trends that could have significant implications for our tax system in the future. It suggested that the most relevant trend is that of increased fiscal pressures from superannuation and healthcare costs. Many submissions agreed that this was a key trend impacting the future of the tax system. 5 Several submissions also stressed increasing fiscal pressures arising from climate change. Theme 2 – flexibility is a useful focus for the LTIB 10. Several submitters agreed that uncertainty about future revenue needs means that it is important to think about whether the tax system has the right balance of flexibility and stability. For example, EY said “we agree that improvements to system flexibility should be the focus for this LTIB. In particular working through options for system integrity in the context of tax rate increases is, in our view, important. For example, considering options to support system coherence and integrity given the rate misalignment as between companies and other taxpayers.” Theme 3 – analysis needs to consider policy design details 11. Many submissions welcomed a first principles look at the merits of alternative tax bases and regimes. Some submissions thought that such analysis needed to be supplemented with fuller consideration of the design of various tax bases and regimes. For example, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand said “Sometimes it is the detail that can make things unworkable. The framework should consider the relative merits of expanded bases with different design parameters.” Theme 4 – analysis needs to consider tax and transfer system interaction 12. Our consultation document discussed the importance of understanding potential distributional impacts of different tax bases and regimes. Several submissions suggested this needs to be supplemented with analysis of the transfer system. It was suggested that progressivity can only be understood by looking at the tax and transfer system as a whole. Theme 5 – LTIB should consider corrective taxes 13. Our consultation document suggested the LTIB would focus on tax bases that were primarily aimed at raising revenue. Some thought that revenue from corrective taxes could be a way of managing higher revenue scenarios. The Young IFA Network submitted that examination of environmental taxes fits well with Inland Revenue’s proposed topic and the objective of LTIBs to look at long-term trends. Theme 6 – technological change will affect sustainability of tax bases 14. In our consultation document, we suggested that issues arising from disruptive technology and the changing nature of work are most relevant to tax administration or have highly uncertain impacts, and therefore we proposed not to consider these issues in our LTIB. Some submitters thought that these issues warranted examination in the LTIB. PwC thought the uncertain impacts of technology strengthened the case for examining potential impacts in the LTIB. It cited an International Monetary Fund study highlighting the high number of jobs that could be exposed to artificial intelligence in advanced economies. Relatedly, it was acknowledged by some submitters that technology may create opportunities for the feasibility of new tax regimes and increased compliance. Theme 7 – interaction between the tax system and other social policy challenges 15. Some submissions emphasised that it was important to consider how the tax system impacts a wider range of social outcomes. For example, Andrew Coleman suggested the LTIB should consider a wider range of retirement savings reforms; and several submissions suggested the tax system could support productivity in New Zealand. 6 Theme 8 – progressive consumption taxes 16. Several submissions supported the LTIB exploring progressive consumption taxes. It was noted that such taxes have received relatively little attention in New Zealand. TOPIC CONFIRMATION 17. Inland Revenue thanks those who submitted on the consultation for their feedback. The feedback generally provides support for our proposal, so we have decided to confirm the topic. 18. We have taken account of feedback in determining the scope and focus of the LTIB. We note that while some submissions called for a wider scope (eg, including detailed design parameters), others called for a more targeted scope (eg, focusing on efficiency impacts of various tax bases). We therefore think we have pitched the breadth of the content about right. 19. Some areas where we have refined our scope based on feedback are: • We will discuss the arguments for lower taxes on savings and touch on the tax treatment of retirement savings as part of our discussion on social security taxes. • To manage the scope, we think we could reduce discussion of some tax bases that are less likely to be the subject of significant public discussion, such as financial transaction taxes. • While we do not propose to expand the scope to include a full review of the interaction of the tax and transfer system, our chapter on consumption taxes will discuss using transfers to offset GST rate increases. • The tax regimes chapters will largely focus on how to make our main tax bases more flexible to rate changes, including considering options to support system coherence and integrity. 20. While we will consider design parameters of various options at a high level, our topic is not meant to explore detailed design issues. Rather, our intention is to provide an analytical base to support further consideration of these issues in the future. For example, our focus on tax bases is on understanding the relative costs of taxing different underlying factors and what the overlaps and differences are in those tax bases. Our focus on tax regimes is on exploring how to make our main tax bases more flexible to rate changes without undermining equity or efficiency goals. 21. While we recognise that corrective taxes are an important and growing issue, we consider that this topic requires its own in-depth analysis. We will therefore consider this as a topic for future LITBs. Next steps 22. There will be further opportunity to provide feedback when Inland Revenue releases a draft of its second LTIB for public consultation in early 2025. The LTIB will then be finalised and provided to the House of Representatives in mid- to late-2025. 7 APPENDIX 1 Groups Individuals Deloitte Andrew Body KPMG Anna Muir PwC Basil Walker EY Bianca Fledderus Tax Justice Aotearoa Dan McGuire Young IFA Network Daniel McAuliffe NZCCSS Giacomo Lizzadro Corporate Taxpayers Group Individual 1 New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union Laird Madison Professional bodies Marg Ruyer Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Michael Hern CPA Australia Michael Locke Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers Mike Brunner Commentators/academics Michael Rutland Andrew Coleman Murray Gough Eric Crampton Stan Thompson Andrew Jackson Stuart Haselden Max Rashbrooke John Cantin Roger Douglas

Summary of unintended legislative change submissions where Rewrite Advisory Panel considered there was no unintended legislative change
=======================================================================================================================================

Lists unintended legislative change submissions where Rewrite Advisory Panel considered there was no unintended legislative change to Income Tax Act 2004.

As part of the implementation of the Income Tax Act 2004, a process was developed to refer potential Unintended Legislative Change issues arising as a result of the rewritten parts of the Income Tax Act, to the Rewrite Advisory Panel chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson.

The process is set out in RAP 001 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 6 – July 2004) and also on the RAP website at [www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz](http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz "This link will open a new window.")

The following is a list of potential unintended legislative change submissions where the Rewrite Advisory Panel considered there was no unintended legislative change arising under the Income Tax Act 2004. In other words, the 2004 Act has the same outcome as the corresponding provisions in the 1994 Act or there is a notified policy change set out in Schedule 22A of the 2004 Act. As well as the changes identified below there are a number of submissions where the Panel has agreed that an unintended change has occurred, and these will be set out in the TIBs for the amendment Acts in which the corrections to the law have been made. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act (both the 1994 and 2004 Acts) unless otherwise specified.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CD 14 (Submission 003)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CF 3 (1)(b) |
| **Description:** | Section CF 3 (1)(b), when dealing with the carve out for returns of capital by companies, applies to cancellations of shares in whole but not in part. It seems that the reference to cancellation (in whole but not in part) has not been carried over to the 2004 Act. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there is no unintended legislative change under section CD 14 of the Income Tax Act and therefore no amendments are required in respect of CD 14 of the Income Tax Act 2004. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 9 (Submission 007)** |
| **Section 1994:** | section CD 1(2)(d) |
| **Description:** | Example: Trust is set up for Mum, Dad (neither in the property game nor in the business of erecting buildings) and children. Trust buys rental property. Children grow up. Child 2 becomes a builder eventually going into the business of erecting buildings. Twenty years on non-minor improvements are built (not necessarily by Child 2, who could even be resident overseas) on the property. Five years after that the property is sold having been rented out all that time.  <br>  <br>Under the ITA 1994, the sale of the property is not taxable as there was no-one in the business of erecting buildings at the time the property was acquired.  <br>  <br>Under the ITA 2004 the sale is taxable as:<br><br>*   Child 2 is in the business of erecting buildings when the non-minor improvements are begun,<br>*   Child 2 is associated with the Trust as a beneficiary, and<br>*   the property is sold within 10 years of the improvements being undertaken. |
| **Outcome:** | This submission relates to an intended change which is included in Schedule 22A of the ITA 2004. The exposure draft relating to this item can be viewed at  <br>http://pad/external/publications/files/rewrite/index.html |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 11(1) (Submission 008)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD 1(2)(g) |
| **Description:** | Under this section any development work of a significant nature is taxed on the total value of the land transaction, rather than being taxed on the extent of the amount derived from the scheme, as would be the case under the 1994 act. This is clearly an unintentional change. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel is not persuaded that an unintended change arises in respect of section CB 11(1) of the ITA 2004.  <br>  <br>The Panel:  <br><br>1.  when all or part of a property enters into a scheme for development and when property is withdrawn from a scheme.<br>2.  recommends a retrospective amendment to the ITA 2004 if an unintended legislative change is confirmed in the light of the Panel's view of the preceding legislation as capturing only the gain in respect of such property and so on revenue account during that period.<br><br>(Refer to Submission 033.) |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **OB 1 (Submission 010)** |
| **Section 1994:** | OB 1 and definition of person Description: The ITA 2004 no longer includes, in section OB 1, a general definition of "person". Under the ITA 1994, "person" was defined to include "a company and a local or public authority; and also includes an unincorporated body of persons:". The ITA 2004 includes no such definition, which is odd considering the increased emphasis in the new Act on the term "person", rather than "taxpayer". |
| **Outcome:** | This issue was explained in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004). The definition of "person" in the Interpretation Act applies and given that definition, there is no change in outcome, and no unintended legislative change. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CD 33(2)(c) (Submission 012)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CF (3)(7) |
| **Description:** | Section CD 33(2)(c) does not specify application of "capital gain amount" and it should link to the definition of "capital gains" |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there is no unintended legislative change in respect of section CD 33(2)(c). The Panel considers that the application of "capital gain amount" can be implied from the current definition of "capital gains". However, the Panel has asked Inland Revenue to consider clarifying the legislation by inserting the word "amounts" in the definition of "capital gains" in sectionCD 33(2)(c).  <br>  <br>This clarification has been enacted in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which received the Royal Assent on 3/04/06. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 14(2) (Submission 013)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD 1(3)(b) |
| **Description:** | Section CB 14(2) of the ITA 2004 states the exclusion applies to: "…the land that has the dwelling house on it." In CD 1(3)(b) of the ITA1994 it was clear the land that was excluded was only the dwelling house itself.  <br>  <br>It is unclear if CB 14(2) restricts the exclusion to the dwelling house only as it refers to "the land that has the dwelling house on it". Does this now mean that the exclusion will apply to the dwelling house, or the dwelling house and curtilage or the dwelling house and the land in the certificate of title on which the dwelling house is situated. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers there is no unintended legislative change in this instance.  <br>  <br>However, the Panel recommended that the legislation would benefit from clarification and the submission has been referred to Inland Revenue's Policy Advice Division. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 6(1)(c) and CB 9(1) and (2) (Submission 15)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD 1(2)(d). Section CD 1(2)(d) |
| **Description:** | The omission of the minor nature clause from CB 6(1)(c) and CB 9(1) and (2) results in an unintended change. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers there is no unintended legislative change under sections CB 6(1)(c) and CB 9(1) and (2) of the ITA 2004. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CE 1 (Submission 016)** |
| **Section 1994:** | OB 1 definition of monetary remuneration |
| **Description:** | The definition of monetary remuneration in relation to the provision of accommodation has been narrowed from including "board or lodging, or the use of a house or quarters.." to "the market value of board...". The normal definition of board is much narrower than the words in the old section and would not incorporate the provision of a house. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers no unintended legislative change arises in this instance. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **DB 36 (Submission 21)** |
| **Section 1994:** | Section DJ 22 |
| **Description:** | Under the 1994 Act deductions are denied for bribes paid to all public officials (whether the official is a New Zealand or a foreign public official). Under the 2004 Act deductions are denied for bribes paid to New Zealand officials. However, deduction are only denied for bribes paid to foreign public officials where it is an offence under the laws of the foreign country. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers no unintended legislative change arises in this instance. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **FE 6(5) and (6) and FE 7(1) and (2) (Submission 025)** |
| **Section 1994:** | Sections FE 6 and FE 7 |
| **Description:** | tax year and income year |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there is no unintended legislative change in this instance.  <br>  <br>The Panel recommends that the terms "tax year" and "income year" be reviewed to ensure that they give the appropriate outcomes in all places where they are used in the Act. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **BB 2, LD 7, MB 2, OB 1 ("provisional taxpayer") (Submission 030)** |
| **Section 1994:** | BB 2(2), section LD 7, subpart MB and the definition of "provisional taxpayer" in section OB 1 |
| **Description:** | The ITA 2004's reference to "tax year" in section BB 2(3), section LD 7, subpart MB and in the definition of "provisional taxpayer" in section OB 1 results in an unintended change. The sections should refer to "income year". |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there has not been an unintended legislative change in this instance.  <br>  <br>Please note, the use of the terms, "tax year" and "income year" in the Income Tax Act 2004 are being reviewed by Inland Revenue's Policy Advice Division. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 11(1) (Submission 33)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD 1(2)(g) |
| **Description:** | The issue described in submission number 008 also arises in relation to major projects involving the development of land that is to be retained after the completion of the development as a long-term rental investment. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that no unintended legislative change arises in this instance. CIR to provide a statement of how he will apply the law. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004** | **Section CE2 has been omitted (Submission 034)** |
| **Section 1994:** | Section CE2 was omitted from the ITA 1994. The equivalent section in the 1974 Act was section 74(2)(a). |
| **Description:** | Section CE2 has been omitted. From 1916 this has been the main assessment section for farmers.  <br>  <br>It is not correct to classify farming as a business. The prime objective of the farmer is to maintain the land and the associated assets. A large proportion of a farmer's costs are not directly matched with the specific amounts of income earned each day or period, but apply to future income. It is a very extended argument to accurately arrive at a valid income figure for the farming sector because the 12-month period of assessment does not coincide with most farming cycles.  <br>  <br>There are many examples of land use which are quasi-business or not a business, or are of a pioneering nature that today could fail to be classified as a business if this omission is not corrected and such classification is left to the discretion of IRD staff. It is important to note that the technical rulings which IRD staff operate under ie "clause 51.4 BUSINESS CRITERIA" are flawed as it ignored Section CE2 and does not recognise the 1983 Court of Appeal decision Grieve v CIR which clearly set out the operation of the various Acts in this area. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there is no unintended legislative change arising in respect of the omission of section CE 2 from the ITA 2004 Act in respect of the taxation of farming. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **DC 9(2) (Submission 036)** |
| **Section 1994:** | DF 10(2) |
| **Description:** | Section DC 9(2) of the ITA 2004 provides that, if the seller and buyer are not associated persons at the time of the sale, (a) the seller is allowed a deduction, in the income year of the sale, for any part of the amount that remains contingent on the employee continuing in employment or any similar factor; and (b) the seller is treated under section EA 4(4) as having paid the amount at the time of sale. This is a more onerous requirement than that which is set under the 1994 Act. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there has not been an unintended legislative change in this instance. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 11(1)(iv) (Submission 038)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD 1 (2)(g) |
| **Description:** | The last item in the list of Section CB 11(1)(iv), "roading", contains a trailing comma unlike previous legislation where the comma on the last list item is absent. The effect of this extra comma is that the nexus with major projects is severed and each list item is now independent of the requirement to be contained within the definition of work customarily undertaken in major projects. Thus for example significant expenditure on earthworks alone is enough to be caught by this section. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there has not been an unintended legislative change in this instance. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CG 4 (Submission 039)** |
| **Section 1994:** | DJ 1 |
| **Description:** | Section CG 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004 treats as income amounts recovered when "the person recovers some or all of the expenditure or loss, whether through insurance, indemnity, or otherwise". |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there is no unintended legislative change arising in respect of section CG 4(1) of the ITA 2004. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **CB 5, CB 6, CB 7, CB 8, CB 9, CB 10, OD 8(4) (Submission 040)** |
| **Section 1994:** | CD1(2)(b) to (g), OD 8(4) |
| **Description:** | The taxing provisions of CB make reference to the gross income of a person such as CB 6(1)(a)(i) "at the time person A acquired the land they…"  <br>  <br>The definitions of taxpayer and person remain the same as those of the 1994 Act.  <br>  <br>A taxpayer is defined in OB 1 as "a person who is, or may be liable to perform or comply with an obligation imposed by this Act".  <br>  <br>A person is undefined for the purposes of the 2004 Act. |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there was no unintended legislative change arising in respect of section CB 6(1)(a) of the ITA 2004. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Section 2004:** | **LD (Submission 041)** |
| **Section 1994:** | OB 1"income year", and Part LD |
| **Description:** | References to "income year" have been replaced with "tax year" which have different defined meanings. In Part LD this results in unintended changes (and may lead to withholding of credits by the Commissioner). |
| **Outcome:** | The Panel considers that there has not been an unintended legislative change in this instance.  <br>  <br>The Panel recommended that the points raised in the submission be referred to Inland Revenue's Policy Advice Division to consider as part of their review of the terms "tax year" and "income year". |

1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] High-Wealth Individuals Research Project Supplemental Financial Statement Guide August 2022 Project purpose 1. The high-wealth individuals research project is a statistical research project that seeks to fill a gap in our knowledge of economic measures of income and effective tax rates of high-wealth New Zealanders. The project will improve the evidence base regarding how the tax system is currently operating, which is the first step in policy development, that of problem identification. A final report on the project’s findings will be made public in 2023. 2. No-one’s tax liability will be reassessed as part of this project; information provided for the project will not be used for any tax compliance or assessment purposes. The final report will not identify any individual or entity. Income and effective tax rate measures 3. An output from the project will be the calculation of average effective tax rates for the 2016 – 2021 income years. An effective tax rate (a measure of tax paid divided by a measure of income) helps us understand how much tax is paid by this group, relative to their income. 4. This collection seeks further information to allow us to estimate unrealised (accrued) capital gains from unlisted entities. These gains are a component of economic income, which is a broader measure of income than taxable income and will form the basis of effective tax rate calculations. 5. The unrealised capital gains will be estimated using information on net earnings, debt and cash of the entity. While in most cases we can rely on tax administration data to undertake this calculation, for some entities we have insufficient data. Supplemental Financial Statement 6. You are receiving the Supplemental Financial Statement as we do not have sufficient or adequate financial statement information in relation to some or all of the entities you disclosed or for some consolidated tax groups. 7. Both you and your partner may have disclosed the entity as part of the Entity Collection. However, only the person who has received the Supplemental Financial Statement needs to provide the information we have requested about the relevant entities identified. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8. This information is sought under section 17GB(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 17GB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect information considered relevant for a purpose relating to the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system. Each person who has received a notice is legally required to provide this information. You must use reasonable endeavours to provide the information. You may request a tax agent or other representative to complete the form on your behalf although you remain ultimately responsible. 9. You are required to provide this information by 5pm on 16 September 2022. What is covered by the Supplemental Financial Statement? 10. The Financial Collection questionnaire issued in June 2022 sought a range of financial information on your investments, and trusts, to enable estimation of the income measures, the attribution of some sources of income to individuals and the calculation of the effective tax rates. 11. The Supplemental Financial Statement is aimed at the estimation of unrealised capital gains from your interest in disclosed entities for the 2016 to 2021 income years. An entity may be a company, trust or partnership. We are also asking for consolidated tax group information in some cases. We will need to make assumptions to make estimates of unrealised capital gains income based on information on the net earnings, debt and cash position of the entity. This information will only be used for this research project. 12. The questions we ask may not be for all the entities you disclosed. This is because we will use information available to us internally where reasonably practicable. This is to minimise the compliance costs on you as much as possible, while still obtaining the data we require. How to complete the Supplemental Financial Statement 13. The required information is to be provided in the Supplemental Financial Statement that has been distributed with this guide. The Detailed Instructions in this guide set out the information that is required and tell you how to complete the Supplemental Financial Statement. 14. The Supplemental Financial Statement is pre-populated with the entity name(s) or consolidated group name (if applicable), the entity’s unique identifier (if previously provided), and the financial year(s) for which the financial information is sought. You do not need to provide the unique identifier if missing. Answers to the questions should only be provided in the light blue boxes within the workbook. 15. We recommend using Office 365 (desktop application or Excel online). Alternatively, uploading to Google Sheets will allow you to complete the workbook. 16. Information sought is in New Zealand dollars. 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] More information 17. If you have any questions about the Supplemental Financial Statement or require assistance in completing the workbook, please contact us at: entity.collection@ird.govt.nz. Please indicate if you would like a call back. 18. For assistance in uploading the Supplemental Financial Statement to the secure online platform (including if you need to resubmit the workbook), please contact us at: etrproject@ird.govt.nz. 19. Further information on the project can be found at: High-wealth individuals research project (ird.govt.nz) How to submit 20. Submit the completed Supplemental Financial Statement through the secure online platform by following the file upload instructions in the box below. 21. If you are unable to submit the Supplemental Financial Statement through the secure online platform, you may email it, encrypted, to entity.collection@ird.govt.nz. 22. We recommend you retain a copy of the completed Supplemental Financial Statement. File upload instructions for Supplemental Financial Statement 1) Please go to: www.hwiresearch3B.ird.govt.nz 2) If you are submitting the Supplemental Financial Statement yourself, you will be asked to enter your personal IRD number, so we can authenticate your submission (no initial ‘0’, numeric characters only, no spaces or special characters (including hyphens)). • If you are a tax agent and completing the submission for your client, please enter your client’s personal IRD number. 3) Once you have logged in, follow the instructions to the page where you can upload your submission. 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Detailed Instructions Scope 23. The Supplemental Financial Statement must be completed for each entity that is specified in the workbook. You are only required to provide financial information for the entity for the financial years that are specified, as our internal data is sufficient for other years. 24. The Supplemental Financial Statement will have certain pre-populated information, such as the entity’s name (as previously disclosed) or the consolidated group name (if applicable), and the unique identifier (if previously provided). 25. By “entity” we also mean partnerships or trusts with business income over a certain threshold, for which we do not hold sufficient internal data. Where a partnership or trust is required to provide financial statement information, provide answers related to the business enterprise only. We are also asking for information for some consolidated tax groups. In those cases, provide total amounts for all of the companies in the consolidated tax group. 26. The financial information being requested is part of the same information that is found in the IR10 that is submitted together with the entity’s relevant income tax return. Questions Section A: Financial Details The following information is only required for each financial year (tax year) that is specified in the Supplemental Financial Statement. Where you have an approved non-standard balance date, please ensure the supplemental financial information supplied relates to the tax return filed for the specified tax year. Sales 27. Provide the gross income from the sale of goods or services (turnover as recorded in the profit and loss statement). Include management fees and commissions if this is the main source of business income. Gross profit 28. Provide the total amount of gross profit as shown in the profit and loss statement. The gross profit figure is determined by taking sales and/or services and then deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS). The COGS is calculated by adding opening stock and purchases (including other direct costs) and then deducting closing stock. If the gross profit figure is a loss, enter the figure as a negative number. 29. Where there is no COGS attributable to sales, we would expect the sales and gross profit figure to be the same. Interest received 30. Provide the amount of interest income/finance income of the business, as recorded in the relevant year’s profit and loss statement. Include interest income from finance leases. 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Dividends received 31. Provide the amount of dividends received by the entity as shown in the relevant year’s profit and loss statement, including intragroup dividends. Gross up the dividends to the extent that they are taxable and the imputation credits are available to satisfy the business’ income or tax liability. If the business is required to prepare general purpose financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), you may account for imputation credits on a net basis as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Accounting depreciation and amortisation 32. Provide the total amount of accounting depreciation and amortisation as shown in the relevant year’s profit and loss statement. Interest expense 33. Provide the total amount of interest expense/finance expense as shown in the relevant year’s profit and loss statement. Net profit/loss before tax 34. Provide the net profit/loss before tax. This should be the same as the net profit/loss before tax shown in the profit and loss statement for the relevant year. Cash & deposits 35. Provide the total amount of all funds held in bank accounts or otherwise, as shown on the balance sheet for the relevant year. Include all funds on short-term deposit (i.e., less than one year), cash on hand, funds with building societies, stock firms and other financiers. Term deposits 36. Provide the total amount of all long-term interest-bearing deposits (one year or longer) as shown on the balance sheet for the relevant year. Include bank term deposits and bonds. Do not include loans and mortgages. Current loans 37. Provide the amount of loans outstanding that are re-payable or will have to be re-financed within one year as shown on the balance sheet for the relevant year. Include interest-free loans, loans from the owners of the business, bank overdrafts and amounts owing to stock firms. Non-current liabilities 38. Provide the total amount of liabilities with a term of more than one year as shown on the balance sheet for the relevant year. Include loans, mortgages or other term borrowing. Do not include the owners’ current account balances. Owners' equity 39. Provide the total equity or interest that the owners have in the business. With a company it will be the sum of paid-up capital, reserves and retained profits/accumulated losses. With a partnership, it will be the sum of capital that has been contributed and retained profits/accumulated losses. With a trust, it will be the sum of amounts settled and undistributed profits/accumulated losses. The owners’ equity should be the amount shown in the balance sheet for the entity. 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Why we need this information 40. An estimated market value for unlisted businesses will be derived from internally held financial information within the tax system (using filed IR10s of entities that meet the threshold for the project). The change in the entity’s estimated market value will be used to approximate an accrued capital gain. 41. We do not have complete IR10 information for the entities and financial years identified in the Supplemental Financial Statement. Asking for the specific information in the Supplemental Financial Statement means we can estimate market values for these years and so calculate accrued capital gains.

Supplies of accommodation
=========================

2010 changes to the GST rules on supplies of accommodation include changes to the definition of 'dwelling' 'and commercial dwelling'.

Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons is generally taxable unless it is expressly treated as an exempt supply. The GST Act exempts the supply of accommodation in a "dwelling", but not accommodation that is in a "commercial dwelling". The main reason for exempting the supply of accommodation in a dwelling from GST, as described in the 1985 _White Paper on Goods and Services Tax_, was to ensure that those in rental accommodation were not disadvantaged compared with owner-occupiers. For this reason, the definition was intended to apply to situations when there was a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This goal was arguably not being achieved because of the potentially wide interpretation of the definition of "dwelling".

In addition, the boundary between the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" could have resulted in different suppliers of essentially the same type of accommodation having their supplies treated differently for GST purposes, depending on whether particular aspects of the definitions were satisfied.

The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 amends the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" to provide a clearer boundary between the definitions.

### Key features

The amendments narrow the definition of "dwelling" and update the list of accommodation that is treated as being in a "commercial dwelling".

For accommodation to be in a "dwelling" the relevant premises must be occupied by the recipient as their principal place of residence or it must be reasonably foreseeable that this will be the case. The recipient must also be entitled to quiet enjoyment of the property. Accommodation supplied to boarders will also be treated as a supply of accommodation in a "dwelling".

The current definition of "commercial dwelling" has been amended by expanding the list of types of accommodation that are to be treated as such to include homestays, farmstays, bed-and-breakfast accommodation and certain serviced apartments.

### Application date

The new definitions apply for supplies of accommodation made on or after 1 April 2011.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Definition of "dwelling"_

The definition of "dwelling" in section 2(1) of the GST Act has been amended to include premises that the person occupies, or that it can reasonably be foreseen that the person will occupy, as their principal place of residence (paragraph (a)(i)), and of which the person has "quiet enjoyment" (paragraph (a)(ii)).

The term "premises" is defined by reference to section 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, and therefore includes:

*   any part of any premises; and
*   any land and appurtenances, other than facilities; and
*   any mobile home, caravan, or other means of shelter placed or erected upon any land and intended for occupation on that land.

A definition of a "principal place of residence" is included in the GST Act and means a place that a person occupies as their main residence for the period to which the agreement for the supply of accommodation relates. For example, if accommodation is supplied for six months, to be considered as being in a "dwelling", the accommodation must be the recipient’s principal place of residence, or be reasonably foreseen as being so, for that period.

For a supply to be a supply of accommodation in a "dwelling", the person must also have "quiet enjoyment" of the premises as the term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. This means the person must be entitled to enjoyment of the premises without interruption by the landlord or any person claiming by, through, or under the landlord or having superior title to that of the landlord. Moreover, the landlord must not cause or permit any interference with the reasonable peace, comfort, or privacy of the tenant in their use of the premises.

Paragraph (b) of the definition of "dwelling" extends the definition to include accommodation provided to a person who is occupying the same premises, or part of the same premises, as the supplier of the accommodation and who occupies the premises as their principal place of residence. The intention of this paragraph is to include supplies of accommodation to boarders who reside in the same premises as their landlords and who may not meet the "quiet enjoyment" test.

Finally, a supply will not be a supply of accommodation in a "dwelling" if it is a supply of accommodation in a "commercial dwelling".

#### _Definition of "commercial dwelling"_

The definition of "commercial dwelling" in the GST Act provides a list of types of accommodation covered. The amended list adds supplies of the following types of accommodation:

*   homestays;
*   farmstays;
*   bed and breakfast establishments; and
*   a serviced apartment managed or operated by a third party for which services, in addition to the supply of accommodation, are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment.

The last inclusion ensures that all managed serviced apartments are treated in the same manner, irrespective of the structure adopted to provide the accommodation. This position was previously uncertain.

An introduction to GST, supplies.

When you’re registered for GST, there’s important information you should know about how different transactions are treated.

What are supplies?

Goods or services you provide while carrying on your business

*   Taxable

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Supplies are goods or services you provide while carrying on your business.

For GST purposes, supplies are dealt with differently, depending on the type of supply.

There are 4 types that we’ll discuss here.

Supplies – Taxable

Supplies are goods or services you provide while carrying on your business

Taxable supplies are the normal goods and services provided by most businesses.

GST is charged at 15%

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Taxable supplies are your regular sales and expenses, and include GST at 15 percent.

* * *

#### Visual

Supplies – Exempt

*   Exempt supplies do not have GST
*   Finance charges like eftpos fees, bank fees and interest
*   Residential Rent

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Exempt supplies are transactions that don’t have GST, and therefore are not included in your GST returns.

Common examples are finance charges, like EFTPOS fees, bank fees, and interest.

Residential rent is also an exempt supply.

If your business claims for a home office, you don’t include your rent or your mortgage interest in your GST return.

* * *

#### Visual

Supplies – Zero-rated

*   Zero-rated supplies have 0% GST
*   Exports / sales to overseas customers
*   Sale of a business as a going concern

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Zero-rated supplies are transactions that include GST, but the GST rate is 0 percent.

A common example of zero-rated supply is exports.

If you make a sale to an overseas customer, then that sale is most likely zero-rated, and the GST will be recorded as 0 percent.

There are some exports that do incur GST. Check the details on our website for examples.

If you make sales to overseas customers, it’s a good idea to have 2 sales columns in with your records, 1 for New Zealand customers with 15 percent GST, and 1 for overseas customers with 0 percent GST.

When you complete your return, you’ll need both of these figures, so, it’ll save you time by having 2 separate columns in your cashbook.

Another example of a zero-rated transaction, is the sale of a business where both parties are GST registered.

The full criteria for zero-rating the sale of a going concern is on our website.

Supplies – Special

*   Hire purchases
*   Lay-bys
*   Second-hand goods

*   Description of goods
*   Date of purchase
*   Cost
*   Name and address

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Special supplies are different to your normal business sales and expenses. GST is claimed as follows.

For hire purchases, claim the full GST at the time you sign the hire purchase agreement. This is regardless of your accounting basis.

Claim the GST amount as a credit adjustment in your return.

Don’t claim GST again on the instalments.

Another special supply is lay-buys.

If you purchase a business item using lay-by, you’ll claim the expense when you take ownership of the goods.

This’ll be at the time of the final payment.

Second-hand goods are also classed as a special supply.

If the seller isn’t registered for GST, or the goods are being purchased privately, there won’t be any GST charged.

However, you will still claim GST on the purchase price, under the second-hand goods rule.

You’ll need to keep a record of the description of the goods, the amount you paid, the date of the purchase, and the name and address of who you bought the goods from.

Supplies – Associated persons

*   Close family members like a spouse, sibling, parent or grandparent
*   GST is limited to the lesser of GST on the:

*   Purchase price
*   Market value
*   Original GST paid

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Be aware there are special rules that apply for purchases between associated persons.

Associated persons are close family members, such as a spouse, sibling, parent, or grandparent.

In these cases, the GST claimed may be limited, or even nil.

Purchases of second-hand goods between associated persons are limited to the lesser of the GST on the purchase price, the GST on the market value, or the GST originally paid by the seller.

For example.

If a GST registered person buys a second-hand car from their sister, and the sister brought the car from a dealer, the purchaser can claim the GST on their purchase price, the market value, or the price their sister paid for the car, whichever is smaller.

If the sister brought the car privately, no GST can be claimed by the purchaser.

This is because the lesser amount is 0 GST paid by the sister.

### Facts

The National Tax Service of the Republic of Korea ("NTS") made a request under art 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA to obtain information relating to certain New Zealand taxpayer companies associated with a Korean national.

In order to obtain the requested information, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") issued 15 notices under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), now section 17B, requiring Chatfield & Co Ltd and Chatfield & Co (collectively "Chatfield") to furnish documents held on behalf of the companies.

Chatfield applied for judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision to issue the s 17 notices. Chatfield succeeded in the High Court and the notices were quashed (_Chatfield & Co Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 3289, \[2018\] 2 NZLR 835). Chatfield also succeeded in the Court of Appeal where the Commissioner’s appeal was dismissed. (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chatfield & Co Ltd_ \[2019\] NZCA 73, (2019) 29 NZTC 24-007).

### Issues

The Commissioner applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on a number of issues which she argued were matters of general or public importance and necessary in the interests of justice for the Court to hear and determine the proposed appeal:

1.  Was the decision to issue the s 17 notices justiciable?
2.  Alternatively, whether any review by the Courts should be “circumscribed” reflecting:
    1.  the dual nature of the NZ-Korea DTA as both domestic legislation and a treaty subject to international law; and
    2.  the difficulty that the availability of judicial review would pose for the Commissioner responding in a timely way to requests for information under double tax agreements **("DTAs")**.
3.  Whether the Courts below had erred in their interpretation of art 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA and interpreted “necessary” too narrowly?
4.  Whether the Court of Appeal erred in identifying what the Competent Authority is required to do in responding to a request for information under the NZ-Korea DTA?
5.  Whether the High Court erred in its insistence on disclosure of the NTS request in order to properly evaluate the existence or otherwise of proper grounds for the s 17 notices?

### Supreme Court Decision

The Supreme Court dismissed the Commissioner’s application for leave to appeal. The Court was satisfied that it was not in the interests of justice to grant leave.

_Justiciability and whether any review by the Court should be “circumscribed”?_

The Supreme Court was not satisfied that the Commissioner’s justiciability argument, nor her alternative argument that any review should be “circumscribed”, met the test for the grant of leave.

_Principles of treaty interpretation_

The Supreme Court accepted that the interpretation of the NZ-Korea DTA may give rise to points of public importance given its international and domestic law status.

The Commissioner had argued that the Courts below interpreted the reference in art 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA to “necessary” too narrowly and that properly interpreted there was little difference between “necessary”, “necessary and relevant” and “foreseeably relevant” (the formulation used in the current model bilateral tax convention published by the OECD, _Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and on Capital_ (OECD Publishing, 2017) at 45, art 26(1) and the _Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters_, as amended by 2010 Protocol (opened for signature 1 June 2011, entered into force 1 March 2014). See _Double Tax Agreements (Mutual Administrative Assistance)_ Order 2013).

However, the Supreme Court did not consider the interpretation issues as capable of altering the outcome on the facts and for that reason did not consider leave for a further appeal to be justified.

_What the Competent Authority is required to do in responding to a request for information under the NZ-Korea DTA?_

The Supreme Court stated that the Court of Appeal had largely accepted the Commissioner’s position on this issue and its finding against the Commissioner was based on the actual wording of Mr Nash’s affidavit, which made the point specific to the facts of the case and no matter of public importance or commercial significance arose.

_Disclosure in order to properly evaluate the existence or otherwise of proper grounds for the s 17 notices_

The Supreme Court accepted that a number of issues of public importance potentially arise from a consideration of the High Court’s insistence on disclosure of the request received from the NTS to the Court, and possibly to Chatfield or its counsel or to an amicus curiae in order to properly evaluate the existence or otherwise of proper grounds for the s 17 notices. The NTS did not authorise the Commissioner to disclose the letter to anyone other than the Court. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court considered the argument (in essence that the Court should resolve the concerns raised by Chatfield against it without being able to refer to the key document which was in the Commissioner’s possession) as having an insufficient prospect of success.

### Case Impact Statement

The Court of Appeal decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Chatfield & Co Ltd_ \[2019\] NZCA 73, (2019) 29 NZTC 24-007, accepted much of the Commissioner’s position and its findings against the Commissioner were largely specific to the facts of the case. However, it does also set out the current law relating to decisions to issue s 17 notices to comply with exchange of information requests by a foreign state under the NZ-Korea DTA and other similarly worded DTAs.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the New Zealand Competent Authority’s assessment of the NTS’s request was not lawful by reference to the requirements of art 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA. Since 2016 the Commissioner has had updated processes in place for assessing inward exchange of information requests. Those processes were reviewed by the Peer Review Assessment team as part of the Global Forum Exchange of Information on Request Peer Review and the feedback was positive. The Commissioner is committed to balancing the timely exchange of information between revenue authorities and the rights of individual taxpayers to test the validity of a request for information to be exchanged under a DTA.

The Court of Appeal decision confirms that s 17 notices are an available mechanism for the Commissioner to request and obtain information in order to fulfil New Zealand’s obligations under DTAs. However, the Commissioner must be satisfied by the relevant requirements of s 17 and the relevant terms of the DTA before issuing the s 17 request.

The Court of Appeal decision confirms that each bilateral treaty must be construed in accordance with its own individual terms. In this respect the Court of Appeal endorsed its approach in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Lin_ \[2018\] NZCA 38, (2018) 28 NZTC 23-052.

The Court of Appeal’s decision further confirms that:

1.  The Commissioner’s decisions under s 17 of the TAA are justiciable and reviewable, the fact that the Commissioner seeks the information to further a foreign state’s request does not alter the position.
2.  Such a review requires determinations only about whether, before making her decision to issue s 17 notices, the Commissioner has satisfied herself about all relevant requirements of s 17 of the TAA and arts 2 and 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA.
3.  It is appropriate for the courts to decline to receive and review documents not disclosed to a taxpayer even in a redacted form. However, to the extent that documents contain confidential information, there is no reason why recourse cannot be made to the Court alone review process in r 8.25(2) of the High Court Rules 2016 to enable the inspection of documents in order to determine claims of privilege or confidentiality.
4.  Neither the Competent Authority nor the Court on review can be expected to inquire into the factual assertions underlying a foreign state’s request nor as to the law in the foreign state. Where the Competent Authority does not consider there to be any lack of clarity or the presence of doubt raising a question about the validity of the request, prior to a decision on a request, it is sufficient for the validity of the request to be determined on its face.
5.  The Competent Authority’s assessment of the NTS request was not lawful by reference to the requirements of art 25 of the NZ-Korea DTA which used the language “necessary” and not “necessary or relevant” nor “foreseeably relevant”.

Since these proceedings began the Commissioner has taken, and continues to take, steps to update New Zealand’s bilateral DTAs.

Supreme Court awards indemnity costs
====================================

2015 case note - Supreme Court awards indemnity costs in relation to Trinity Scheme - provable debt, indemnity costs, collateral attack, abuse of process.

Case

Bradbury Peebles and Anors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue and Anors

Legislative References

Insolvency Act 2006

### Summary

This is a costs judgment following the Supreme Court's earlier decision on 2 December 2014 to dismiss three related applications for leave to appeal. The appellants in each appeal were investors in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") (and others) applied for indemnity costs. Those applications were complicated by the bankruptcy and liquidation of a number of the appellants.

The Supreme Court noted that the established position in New Zealand is that costs made after adjudication in bankruptcy in respect of proceedings which had been commenced before adjudication were not provable in bankruptcy. The Supreme Court (following a recent English authority) reversed that position and held that costs awards following adjudication can be provable as a contingent liability. The judgment is also notable for the fact that the Supreme Court took the unusual step of awarding indemnity against the appellants.

### Impact

The impacts of the decision are as follows:

1.  For Trinity investors, bringing litigation that is an abuse of process or a collateral attack on the Supreme Court judgment(s) in Trinity will likely lead to an award of indemnity costs in favour of the Commissioner.
2.  For an individual, court costs awarded after bankruptcy, where the proceedings commenced prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, are a debt provable in the bankruptcy.
3.  For a company, court costs awarded after being placed into liquidation, where the proceedings commenced prior to the appointment of a liquidator, are a debt provable in the liquidation.

### Facts

This case concerned the judgment of the Supreme Court delivered on 2 December 2014 dismissing three related applications for leave to appeal. All the appellants were investors in the Trinity tax avoidance scheme.

The Judicial Conduct Commissioner, Justice Venning and the Commissioner subsequently applied for indemnity costs. Complicating the determination of those applications was the bankruptcy and liquidation of a number of the appellants.

### Decision

#### _Costs in respect of SC 90/2014 - Accent Management Ltd_

Both the High Court and Court of Appeal awarded indemnity costs against the appellant. The Supreme Court considered that for the same reasons given by those courts, and by the Supreme Court in refusing leave, an award of indemnity costs is warranted in favour of the Commissioner.

#### _Costs in respect of SC 87/2014 and SC 103/2014 - Messrs Bradbury and Peebles_

_Debts provable in the bankruptcy_

A series of English cases had held that an order for costs made after adjudication in bankruptcy in respect of proceedings that had been commenced before adjudication were not provable in bankruptcy.

These English cases were recently overruled by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in _Re Nortel GmbH_ (\[2013\] UKSC 52, \[2014\] AC 209) ("_Nortel_"). That judgment focused primarily on a rule that the New Zealand Supreme Court considered very similar in expression to s 232(1) of the Insolvency Act 2006. It was found in _Nortel_ that an order for costs made against a company in liquidation, made in proceedings begun before it went into liquidation, is provable as a contingent liability.

The New Zealand cases proceeded on the basis that costs awarded after adjudication in bankruptcy are not provable in the bankruptcy. This has been so in relation to both s 232 of the Insolvency Act 2006 and (on a historical note) s 87 of the Insolvency Act 1967. The New Zealand courts simply followed, directly or indirectly, the English cases which have now been overruled by _Nortel._

The Official Assignee accepted that _Nortel_ should be regarded as the controlling authority and the Supreme Court was satisfied that the approach in _Nortel_ should now be followed in New Zealand.

#### _SC 87/2014_

The Court held that indemnity costs are appropriate given what was proposed was a collateral attack on its judgment in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289).

#### _SC 103/2014_

The Court held that the proceedings were an abuse of process and an order for indemnity costs was appropriate.

Supreme Court considers the application of sections 52(1) and (2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985
========================================================================================================

2012 case note – Supreme Court held that rental income following sales showed an on-going supply and de-registration dates must be according to CIR's assessments.

Case

Lewis Gaire Herdman Thompson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Upon an appeal from the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court was required to consider the dates of deregistration following three sale transactions; the _Lopas_ decision; and the wording of section 52 of the Goods and Services Tax 1985 ("GST Act").

The Court held that the rental income following the sales showed an on-going supply and therefore the de-registration dates must be according to the Commissioner's assessments. The Court further looked at the _Lopas_ decision of relevance and confirmed that the statutory language must govern any other interpretation. The Court further provided a test under section 52 that deregistration depends on the Commissioner being "satisfied" that taxable supplies for the following 12-month period were not going to exceed the threshold.

### Impact of decision

The _Lopas_ decision is reaffirmed. Proceeds from sales which were planned or contemplated as likely to occur at the time of deregistration should be allowed for in the section 52(2) assessment, which gives effect to the statutory language of section 52.

The Supreme Court has provided some helpful guidelines regarding the proper approach to deregistration for GST, and these are intended to assist in the future application of section 52.

### Facts

This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal.

Mr Thompson owned just over 200 hectares of land near Rolleston that he acquired in 1979. It was leased out as a rental, which, because the rent included rates, was in excess of $30,000 per annum.

Mr Thompson was registered for goods and services tax (GST) purposes but applied to de-register on the premise that his taxable supplies would not exceed $30,000 within the 12 months following de-registration. The Commissioner accepted Mr Thompson's application to de-register and Mr Thompson's de-registration was effective from 30 November 1999.

After his de-registration, Mr Thompson disposed of the Rolleston land in three sale transactions, which occurred in December 1999, March 2000 and September 2000. The two latter sales were to an associated party. Mr Thompson did not account for output tax on any of the land sales given his de-registered status.

Despite his de-registration, up until mid-June 2000 (when the first land sale was finalised), Mr Thompson continued to recover the same amount of rent and GST. Following an investigation, the Commissioner cancelled the November 1999 de-registration and reinstated Mr Thompson's registration until 31 January 2001.

Mr Thompson challenged the Commissioner on the new de-registration date and was successful in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") where it was concluded that the proceeds of future sales were irrelevant to the section 52(2) assessment, but given that such sales were going to occur, his future rental receipts as at 30 November 1999 were going to be under the threshold.

Subsequent to the TRA decision, the Court of Appeal released _Lopas v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,726 (CA) where the Court of Appeal held that a proposed disposal of assets, which in that case had been "planned" at the de-registration date, was relevant to the section 52(2) assessment. They therefore rejected the approach to section 52(1)(c) which had been taken by the TRA in _Lopas_ and which the TRA had applied in Mr Thompson's challenge. The Supreme Court subsequently declined leave to appeal in _Lopas_.

The Commissioner appealed the TRA decision given the result in _Lopas_. Millar J allowed the Commissioner's appeal and directed that a rehearing, which was necessary, should be in the High Court. Mr Thompson appealed to the Court of Appeal.

The Commissioner was partially successful in the High Court, which upheld the assessments of output tax on the first two sales but not the third, and completely successful in the Court of Appeal, which upheld all three assessments.

Both the High Court and Court of Appeal considered _Lopas_ and, in particular, the significance of the word "planned". The Court of Appeal took the view that the High Court was wrong to focus on the words used in _Lopas_ (and in particular the word "planned") rather than the text of the statute.

### Issues

The Supreme Court granted leave on the following grounds:

1.  When did the appellant become entitled to be de-registered for GST purposes?
2.  In light of that determination, and the circumstances in which they took place, did the second and third sales of land attract GST?

The most important issue in the case was whether at the two possible de-registration dates proposed by Mr Thompson (namely 9 February and 31 July 2000), the proceeds of the second and third land sales were required to be taken into account in assessing prospective turnover.

Given that the case was dealt with differently in the High Court and Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court addressed the significance of the rental turnover, which involved considering whether the prospective rental income alone would have surpassed the threshold at the two possible de-registration dates proposed by Mr Thompson, before addressing the significance of the proceeds of future land sales.   

### Decision

#### _Rental income_

The Supreme Court considered that by 31 July 2000, Mr Thompson had resolved the problem that the rent he had been receiving included GST and as the first two sales had occurred, the rental turnover for the following 12 months would be under the threshold.

However, the Supreme Court considered the earlier date problematic. As at 9 February 2000, Mr Thompson was in the course of the "unsatisfactory implementation of a doubtful tax plan" and therefore was not a promising candidate for the favourable exercise of a discretionary judgment to move his de-registration date. In any event, Mr Thompson had continued to collect GST from his tenant until June 2000, which meant that he could not obtain a de-registration date that preceded the time of supply in relation to the second sale.

#### _Relevance of the proceeds of future land sales_

The Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court's interpretation of "planned" in the _Lopas_ case. Although the _Lopas_ judgment used the word "planned" in the context of a sale being planned at the time of deregistration, it also used the words "in contemplation", which in that context suggested that proceeds from sales that were contemplated at the time of deregistration should be allowed for in the section 52(2) assessment. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the _Lopas_ decision although making it clear that the statutory language must govern.

The Supreme Court held that on any possible approach to section 52(2), it could not be predicated as at 30 November 1999, 9 February 2000 or 31 July 2000 that there would not be a sale of the balance of the land within the next 12 months.

#### _Application of the test under sections 52(1) and (2)_

The Supreme Court stated that de-registration depends on the Commissioner being "satisfied" that taxable supplies for the following 12-month period were not going to exceed the threshold.

The Supreme Court provided the following advice to assist in the application of section 52:

1.  The section means what it says and there is not much point in trying to paraphrase it.
2.  The section requires the Commissioner to be satisfied that turnover will not exceed the threshold. This involves an objective, forward looking assessment, not one controlled by hindsight.
3.  The test will not be satisfied when transactions which would result in the turnover being exceeded are either:
    1.   being implemented at the proposed de-registration date, or
    2.  planned to occur (or contemplated as likely to occur) in the course of the following 12 months.
4.  The test will probably only be satisfied where a taxpayer can show a settled intention that such transactions will not take place.

Both grounds on appeal were dismissed.

Supreme Court dismisses application for leave to appeal
=======================================================

2006 case note – application for leave to appeal dismissed by Supreme Court – GST, deregistration.

Case

Jeffrey George Lopas and Lorraine Elizabeth McHerron v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue SC 2/2006 \[2006\] NZSC 56

Legislative References

Supreme Court Act 2003

### Summary

The applicants were unsuccessful in their appeal to the Court of Appeal, and sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The first issue in dispute was whether the proviso to s. 51(1) of the GST Act 1986 is incorporated into s. 52(1). The Court examined all the submissions for the hearings below and concluded the applicant's argument on this ground was too weak to be the basis of a second appeal. The second issue was whether the Commissioner's second argument in the Court of Appeal that the applicants were not eligible for deregistration was recorded in the Statement of Position. The Court was satisfied that the argument was so recorded in general terms.

### Facts

The applicants were the partners in the Jeffrey George Lopas and Lorraine Elizabeth McHerron Partnership, which was registered for GST from 1 October 1992 with a taxable activity of forestry. By subsequent deeds of trust dated 20 September 1999, a family trusts partnership was created, which was registered for GST from 1 October 1999.

On 4 October 1999, the applicants applied to cancel the original partnership's GST registration effective from 30 September 1999, on the basis that its taxable supplies for the 12 months following 30 September would be less than $30,000. The standard deregistration form was completed, stating that the applicants would be keeping business assets when registration ceased, including land with a cost price of $115,000. The Commissioner cancelled the registration with effect from 30 September 1999. The applicants took the view that s. 5(3) of the GST Act deemed the land to be an asset of the taxable activity supplied at a time immediately before deregistration, and paid GST on the cost price of the property, being the lesser of cost or open market value under s. 10(8).

On 8 October 1999, the applicants entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the land at a price of $375,000, inclusive of GST (if any) to the family trusts partnership. It was clear from the surrounding circumstances that the sale was contemplated before the GST deregistration of the applicants. The Commissioner subsequently amended the GST deregistration date from 30 September 1999 to 30 November 1999, resulting in output tax being payable on the sale price of $375,000, rather than the $115,000 previously envisaged. The applicants disputed the Commissioner's decision amending the effective date of deregistration from 30 September 1999 to 30 November 1999.

#### Decisions below

The Taxation Review Authority found in favour of the applicants, holding they were entitled to deregister for GST when they did.

The Commissioner appealed to the High Court. Panckhurst J held the sale of the property was not a cessation supply under s. 5(3) but a termination supply under s. 6(2), because there was an undoubted connection between the cessation of the taxable activity and the sale of the land. At the point of deregistration, beneficial ownership in the property had passed, and tax was payable under the general supply provisions rather than as a deemed deregistration supply.

The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that at the date of deregistration, beneficial ownership had not passed. They submitted that they had done what the legislation both expressed and contemplated, and if the Commissioner had wanted to argue there was a transfer of beneficial ownership, the argument should have been put to the Authority, but it was not.

The Commissioner responded that the original decision was made on the basis of incomplete disclosure by the taxpayer, and if the Commissioner had been in possession of all the relevant facts at the outset, deregistration would always have taken effect from 30 November 1999. Further, a scheme to sell the land was already on foot to sell the land and cease all taxable activities within four days, so the application to deregister should have been made under s. 52(3), not s. 52(1).

The Commissioner also cross appealed on the correct interpretation of the statutory provisions in question, submitting that the “amount” referred to in s. 52(1) refers to the figure of $30,000 in s. 51(1), rather than the whole of that subsection, including the proviso. The applicants argued that the proviso was to be included as a matter of interpretation, and no inconsistency within the Act would be created by inclusion of the proviso in that way.

The Court of Appeal accepted the Commissioner's arguments on the cross appeal, finding the reference to “amount” included only the figure of $30,000, not any exclusions to be found within the provisos to s. 51(1). The court also found the applicants should have applied to be deregistered for GST under s. 52(3), not s. 52(1). The Commissioner was acting under a misapprehension when the applicants were deregistered the first time and was entitled under s. 13 of the Interpretation Act to re-exercise his discretion and to set a new GST deregistration date.

#### Decision of Supreme Court

The Supreme Court noted the dispute focused on two grounds. The first is whether the proviso to s. 51(1) is incorporated into s. 52(1). The applicants said the sale proceeds of the land were excluded from the calculation of the threshold for GST. The Commissioner said the proviso to s. 51(1) did not apply and the sale proceeds should be included. The other point was whether s. 52(1) or s. 52(3) applies to deregistration in this case. The applicants contended the Court of Appeal was wrong to accept the Commissioner's arguments on the second point, because they were raised for the first time in that Court, and were not contained in the Commissioner's Statement of Position.

The Supreme Court regarded the merit of the applicant's argument on the first ground as too weak to be the basis of a second appeal. In coming to this conclusion, it directed the parties to file all submissions that were before the Authority and the courts below. The Supreme Court was also satisfied that the Commissioner's argument in the Court of Appeal that the applicants were not eligible for deregistration was recorded in general terms in the Commissioner's Statement of Position, and in the circumstances there was no miscarriage of justice. The Court also noted the Commissioner had consistently maintained that the applicants should have disclosed their intention to on-sell the land in question and, if they had done so, they would not have been eligible to be deregistered on 30 September 1999. In the circumstances the court concluded a matter of general commercial significance did not arise, and the application was dismissed.

Supreme Court dismisses application for leave to appeal
=======================================================

This was an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the Court of Appeal did not apply principles set out in CIR v Diamond \[2015\] NZCA 613 (“Diamond”) to Mr van Uden’s case.

Case

Gerardus Peter van Uden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZSC 29

Legal terms

General or public importance, Commercial importance, Miscarriage of justice, Permanent place of abode

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994  
Income Tax Act 2004  
Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This was an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the Court of Appeal did not apply the principles set out in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Diamond_ \[2015\] NZCA 613 ("_Diamond_") to Mr van Uden's case. In addition, Mr van Uden challenged decisions about taxation of his employer's superannuation fund; whether the reassessment was properly made given the position of the officer who made it; and, as to the penalties imposed. The Supreme Court dismissed the application as there was no matter of general or public importance or general commercial significance or miscarriage of justice.

### Impact

The decision confirms that the Supreme Court will not give leave to appeal unless it is satisfied it is necessary in the interests of justice to hear and determine the appeal.

### Facts

Mr van Uden is a sea captain employed by a foreign shipping company. He has worked at sea for over 40 years. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") assessed Mr van Uden as liable for New Zealand Income tax for the 2005 to 2009 tax years on the basis Mr van Uden had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand for those tax years and was liable to pay tax in New Zealand on his worldwide income. In addition, a 10 percent penalty was imposed because Mr van Uden, in not returning his income on that basis, had taken an unacceptable tax position.

In upholding the decisions of the High Court and the Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") on the question of Mr van Uden's permanent place of abode, the Court of Appeal concluded that Mr van Uden had made the relevant property his home. The Court considered the "individual factors listed in _Diamond_ support this conclusion". These included matters such as household expenditure.

The Court of Appeal then dealt with whether Mr van Uden's interest in his employer's non-contributory superannuation fund ("the Provident Fund") would constitute an interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") which was accordingly taxable on the basis of the accrual rules. The Court rejected the argument made on behalf of Mr van Uden that because the contributions to the Provident Fund were paid by his employer there was no "cost or expenditure incurred by or on behalf of Mr van Uden" as regards that Fund. The Court of Appeal concluded the employer was acting on Mr van Uden's behalf in making the contributions.

The Court of Appeal also rejected the challenge made to the process followed by the Commissioner in removing the time bar that applied to the assessment for the 2005 to 2008 tax years. The issue was whether the relevant officer acting under delegated power had made the necessary factual reassessment. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the High Court that the delegate had expressly exercised the delegated power.

Finally, the Court of Appeal rejected Mr van Uden's submission he should not have been liable for shortfall penalties under s 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Decision

The Supreme Court found that at some point the Court may wish to revisit the _Diamond_ test, but the present case, where no issues as to that test arise, does not provide an appropriate opportunity for that. The proposed ground of appeal raises no point of general or public importance, nor any matter of general commercial significance. Nor is there an appearance of a miscarriage of justice. Rather, Mr van Uden in this respect would seek to revisit concurrent findings in the TRA, the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Further, the _Diamond_ factors were seen as simply supporting the Court of Appeal's conclusion, not determining it.

The Court found that the other three proposed grounds raise no questions of general or public importance or of general commercial importance. The outcome on these matters rested on the particular factual circumstances.

Taking first the proposed ground relating to the FIF rules, the Court found that the applicant's concern arises from the Court's assessment of the particular facts in light of the direction in s CG 15(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("ITA 1994") that the cost be incurred "by or on behalf of the person". The second question, whether the person with the delegated powers undertook the reassessment so that the time bar was lifted is similarly fact- specific. Finally, the Court of Appeal in concluding shortfall penalties were payable applied the relevant principles from this Court's decision in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 2289 at \[181\]-\[203\].

The Court found no appearance of a miscarriage of justice arising from the Court of Appeal's approach to these matters. In terms of the first proposed ground of appeal, s CG 15(2)(d) of the ITA 1994 provides that expenditure incurred by "or on behalf of" the person is covered. Nothing raised by the applicant in relation to the proposed second ground calls into question the approach taken in the Courts below. On the last of the proposed grounds, nothing raised by Mr van Uden indicates there is a risk of a miscarriage of justice arising from the application of the principles in _Ben Nevis_.

In relation to Mr van Uden's submission that he has not had access to justice, the Court found the matters he wishes to raise have all been considered by the Courts below. The Court concluded it is not necessary in the interests of justice to hear and determine the proposed appeal.

Supreme Court found that PAYE trust ceases upon liquidation
===========================================================

2014 case note - Supreme Court held that any s 167(1) trust ceases upon liquidation of a company if the employer has failed to deal with PAYE deductions.

Case

Jennings Roadfreight Ltd (in liquidation) & Anors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Companies Act 1993

### Summary

The Supreme Court held that any s 167(1) trust ceases upon liquidation of a company if the employer has failed to deal with PAYE deducted in the manner required by s 167(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") or in accordance with the PAYE rules.

### Facts

Jennings Roadfreight Ltd ("Jennings") was placed into liquidation on 24 March 2011. At the time, it owed approximately $50,000 in PAYE for the month ended 28 February 2011.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") issued a notice pursuant to s 157 of the TAA requiring the Bank of New Zealand to deduct funds from Jennings' bank account. Jennings was placed into liquidation and the appeal concerns $14,076.38 held in the Jennings' bank account when Jennings was placed into liquidation but placed into a suspense account.

The High Court held that the $14,076.38 was refundable by the Commissioner to the liquidator. The Court of Appeal, by majority decision, held that the $14,076.38 was held in trust for the Commissioner, did not form part of Jennings' estate in liquidation and did not need to be refunded.

The liquidators were granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.

### Decision

The Court first considered the relationship between ss 167(1) and 167(2) of the TAA.

Jennings submitted that any s 167(1) trust is extinguished if the PAYE rules have not been complied with and, in any event, upon liquidation by virtue of s 167(2) of TAA. The Commissioner submitted that s 167(1) creates a statutory trust to protect the amount of any PAYE deduction (or deemed deduction) and if at liquidation, there is any credit balance in a company's bank accounts, then the Commissioner is entitled to it because of the statutory trust.

The Court considered the wording of ss 167(1) and (2) and found that s 167(2) must be read as a specific qualification on s 167(1) where s 167(2) applies. This means that where it applies, s 167(2) prevails over s 167(1).

Section 167(2) of the TAA applies on the liquidation of a company to unpaid PAYE in two situations:

*   where an amount of PAYE has been deducted and the employer has failed to deal with the amount deducted in the manner required by s 167(1); or
*   the employer has failed to deal with the amount deducted as required by the PAYE rules.

The Court saw no reason to depart from the long-established reading of s 167(1) of the TAA to construe it as requiring funds to be segregated. It is unlikely that many businesses would in practice segregate the funds. It may be that s 167(2) does not apply to PAYE that has been deducted where, despite there being no obligation to do so, it has been held separately from other funds. Although the Supreme Court left this question open as the funds in this case were not held in a separate account.

The Court saw the second situation in s 167(2) of the TAA as straightforward. The PAYE rules require amounts deducted to be paid to the Commissioner on a due date. In this case, payments were not made to the Commissioner on the due dates and the amounts remained outstanding as at the date of liquidation. Accordingly, the employer failed to deal with the amounts as required by the PAYE rules and the priorities in s 167(2) apply to Jennings' overdue but unpaid PAYE deductions.

The Court went on to consider the case law and the scheme of the statutory provisions, finding that both supported that s 167(2) of the TAA is a qualification on the general nature of s 167(1). The Court noted that if the Commissioner's interpretation was correct, then the Commissioner would have first access to the credit balance in bank accounts for PAYE deductions by virtue of it being trust property and this would reverse the order of priorities in schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 (which ranks items deducted from an employee such as child support obligations and student loan repayment obligations above PAYE).

The Court set out the legislative history of PAYE and, in drawing together the various threads, found that s 167(2) applies on liquidation where one of two conditions are met: the employer has failed to deal with the amount deducted as required by s 167(1); or failed to deal with the amount in accordance with the PAYE rules. This means that in the event of liquidation, s 167(2) and the priorities set out in that subsection apply to all amounts of PAYE deducted that fell due before liquidation but not paid before liquidation to the Commissioner. Section 167(1) does not apply to such amounts, unless (possibly) unpaid PAYE has been segregated by the employer in a separate account.

As the PAYE in this case had been deducted but not paid to the Commissioner on its due date, remained unpaid at the time of liquidation and was not held in a separate account, all of the PAYE unpaid at the date of liquidation (including the $14,076.38) was to be dealt with under s 167(2) of the TAA and thus distributed in accordance with the priorities set out in schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993.

The Court went on to consider the nature of the trust under s 167(1) of the TAA. Jennings submitted the trust only applied to funds set aside in a separate account at the time of deduction. The Commissioner submitted it was a statutory notional trust in the nature of a floating charge.

The Court noted that as a matter of construction between ss 167(1) and (2), it had already rejected the Commissioner's interpretation of s 167(1) continuing to apply to any credit balance held in a company's accounts at liquidation. It was therefore not strictly necessary to come to a definitive view of the nature of the s 167(1) trust but the Court made five general observations:

1.  Jennings' submission that s 167(1) only applies to funds set aside in a separate account is consistent with the interpretation of similar provisions in Canada.
2.  In the context of deemed or notional deductions of PAYE, the notional statutory trust in s 167(1) is not limited to funds held in bank accounts.
3.  The Court did not accept that the Commissioner's interpretation in part protects employees from being pursued for unpaid PAYE in the event of liquidation. An employee is not liable for PAYE on liquidation unless the employee has received the gross amount of his/her salary or wages or has received from the employer a benefit in cash or equal kind to the PAYE that should have been deducted.
4.  The s 167(1) trust is not brought to an end where there is a failure to pay PAYE on the due date. On liquidation, any trust is bought to an end not by any action of the company but by virtue of the legislation under s 167(2).
5.  A notional trust protects the Commissioner from claw-back amounts actually paid (whether late or not) to the Commissioner before liquidation.

The Court upheld Jennings' appeal, the unpaid and overdue PAYE fell subject to schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 by virtue of s 167(2)(b) of the TAA and the Commissioner must repay the $14,076.38.

Supreme Court ruling on "Trinity"
=================================

2008 case note – Trinity Scheme – decision clearly directs that the CIR ought to advance a matter on the basis that there is a sham, or avoidance, but not both.

Case

Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited and Ors v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, sections BG 1, DL 1, EF 1, EG 1, EH 2, FE 4, GB 1, OB 1, schedule 17; Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 141B and 141D; Income Tax Act 1976, section 99; Land and Income Tax Act 1954, section 108; Income Tax Act 2004, section EZ 45

### Summary

Having regard to the various features of the Trinity investment arrangement, the Court concluded that the taxpayers' use of the specific provisions was not within Parliament's purpose and contemplation when it authorised deductions for the licence premiums and insurance premiums under the depreciation provisions. The taxpayers altered the incidence of income tax by means of a tax avoidance arrangement which the Commissioner correctly treated as void against him. Further, the taxpayers had taken an abusive tax position because their position was an unacceptable interpretation of tax law; and therefore they were liable for the 100 percent penalty imposed by the legislation.

### Impact of decision

This decision will have significant and lasting implications for matters engaging section BG 1, and clearly directs that the Commissioner ought to advance a matter on the basis that there is a sham, or avoidance, but not both.

### Background

This was an appeal to the Supreme Court by nine investors, or loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) of the investors, in a syndicate that had been involved in the development of a Douglas Fir forest project as part of what is known as the Trinity scheme.

The essence of the case is the long-standing search for clarity over where formal compliance with specific provisions ends and tax avoidance begins. The taxpayers had invested in a genuine forestry investment (a forest was planted) which had been structured to take advantage of specific taxation provisions authorising deductions and depreciation allowances; the Commissioner took the view that strict compliance with those provisions did not immunise the arrangement from being categorised as tax avoidance.

### Facts

The appellants were investors in a syndicate that had been involved in the development of a Douglas Fir forest project as part of what is known as the Trinity scheme. The forest was planted in Southland and is due to be harvested by 2048.

The land on which the forest was planted was purchased and held by Trinity Foundation (Services No 3) Limited ("Trinity 3"), which was a subsidiary of Trinity Foundation Ltd, which in turn was owned by the Trinity Foundation Charitable Trust. The investors did not at any stage acquire ownership of the land.

Investors in Trinity 3 became members of a syndicate called Southern Lakes Joint Venture, which then formed a company, Southern Lakes Forestry Limited, to act as the joint venture's agent. That company entered into various contracts on behalf of the joint venture, which constituted the scheme.

Trinity 3 and Southern Lakes Forestry entered into an agreement for an occupation licence, and later a licence agreement. The occupation licence (for carrying on the forestry business) was stipulated to be at $2,050,518 multiplied by the plantable hectares in the land (ultimately 484 ha). The second agreement provided that the licence term commenced on 24 March 1997 and expired on 31 December 2048, and also required the syndicate to establish, manage and protect a Douglas Fir forest on the land. The forest was also required to be arranged for sale on the basis that cutting and extraction should be completed during the period 31 December 2044 to 31 December 2048, and specified the order in which the proceeds from that sale would be applied.

The investors were also required to pay Trinity 3, on 21 March 1997, $1,250 per plantable hectare ("/p ha") for the establishment of the forest, $1,946/p ha for an option to purchase the licensed land in 2048, and $1,000 per investor for a lease option. There was an additional $50 annual licence fee during the licence term.

The result was that the investors effectively met the initial costs of buying the land, planting the forest, and the continuing costs of its future maintenance and management, but did not at any point become the owner of the land or the trees. The net proceeds from the sale of the trees (in 2044-2048) would pay the licence premium. On its face there was a risk that the sale would be insufficient to meet the premium, for which insurance was to be taken out by individual syndicate members through Southern Lakes Forestry and Trinity 3.

To provide that insurance, Dr Muir had CSI Insurance Group (BVI) Limited ("CSI") incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The insurance would be triggered if an event occurred which prevented the market value at sale from reaching $2,050,518/p ha between the event and 31 December 2048, with the insured being the members of the syndicate and Trinity 3. The insurance premiums were $1,307/p ha in 1997, and $32,791/p ha payable on or before 31 December 2047 for the syndicate, and $410,104/p ha on or before 31 December 2047 for Trinity 3. The premium for Trinity 3 was to scale dollar for dollar up to a maximum of $1,230,311/p ha to the extent that the market value of stumpage at 13 December 2047 would be less than $2,050,518/p ha.

The result was CSI insured Trinity 3 and the investors up to $2,050,518/p ha, but due to the scaling premium Trinity 3 was subject to, and the premiums to be paid, the maximum CSI would have to pay would be $787,416/p ha (if net stumpage was zero), and if fewer than 300 trees matured, CSI would not have to pay anything.

Syndicate members provided promissory notes to cover their obligations to pay the licence premium of $2,050,518/p ha in 2048 and to meet their liability to pay the insurance premium in 2047. Trinity 3 provided a promissory note for its 2047 insurance premium liability. Debentures secured the money payable under the promissory notes, the overall effect being to give CSI first rights over the forest until its value exceeded the deferred portion of the insurance premium.

Investors took up proportionate shares in the syndicate by reference to a number of plantable hectares, and in the 1997 claimed deductions from assessable income for:

1.  $34,098/p ha for the insurance premiums ($1,307 paid in March 1997 and $32,791 to be paid in cash terms in 2047)
2.  A small proportion of the licence premium of $2,050,518/p ha to be paid in 2048 as a depreciation allowance.

In their 1998 returns, the investors claimed the amortised licence premium figure of about $41,000/p ha.

No issue arose over the actual costs of planting and tending trees. Those costs aside, in cash terms investors spent a little under $5,000/p ha in 1997 and $50/p ha in 1998 to qualify for the above deductions.

### Decision

**Sham**  
It had not been shown that the parties to the relevant documents were intending to deceive the Commissioner as to the nature of their arrangements in respect of insurance or as to their intention to implement the insurance arrangements according to their tenor \[38\] (the insurer, the contracts, the forest, and payment of initial premium all having been found by the Courts below, as matters of fact, to exist \[36\]-\[38\]).

**Deductibility - licence**  
The licence premium is deductible if it is for a "right to use land", which requires an analysis of the nature of the arrangements actually entered into \[46\]. The majority held that when considering the application of a specific tax provision, before reaching any question of avoidance, the Court was concerned primarily with the legal structures and obligations the parties had created and not with conducting an analysis in terms of their economic substance and consequences, or of alternative means that were available for achieving the substantive result \[47\].

In the circumstances in which the transaction had been set up, the licence provided the syndicate with the necessary access to Trinity 3's land to perform its forestry obligations, for which it incurred the licence premium as a cost. The licence gave a 'right to use land' within the meaning of the specific provision and deductible as depreciation on depreciable property, subject to the issue of avoidance \[54\].

**Deductibility - insurance**  
The present insurance contract is outside the reach of the definition of 'accrual expenditure' and the spreading rules do not apply to it as it was entered into as part of a wider financial arrangement, so the premium did not have to be spread \[60\]-\[64\].

**Avoidance**  
Specific tax provisions and the general anti-avoidance provision are meant to work in tandem; each provides a context which assists in determining the meaning and the scope of the other \[103\]. The purpose of specific provisions must be distinguished from that of the general anti-avoidance provision \[103\].

Ascertaining when the way a specific provision was deployed crossed the line and turned what might otherwise have been a permissible arrangement into a tax avoidance arrangement should be firmly grounded in the statutory language of the provisions themselves, rather than seizing on past Judicial glosses and elaborations on the statutory language \[104\].

Where the case involves reliance by the taxpayer on specific provisions, the taxpayer must satisfy the Court that the use made of the specific provision is within its intended scope. If that is shown, then the use of the specific provision by the taxpayer is also to be viewed in the light of the arrangement as a whole. Viewing the transaction as a whole, if the use of the specific provision alters the incidence of income tax in a way which cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provision, the arrangement will be a tax avoidance arrangement \[107\]. Here the licence premium was within the specific provision as "a right to use land", but viewing the arrangement as a whole, had additional features which caused it to represent and be part of a tax avoidance arrangement \[107\].

In considering whether a tax avoidance arrangement exists, the general anti-avoidance provision does not confine the Court as to the matters which may be taken into account, and the significance of relevant factors will depend on the particular facts \[108\].

A classic indicator of a use that is outside Parliamentary contemplation is the structuring of an arrangement so that the taxpayer gains the benefits of the specific provision in an artificial or contrived way \[108\].

The ultimate question is whether the impugned arrangement, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the specific provision in a manner that is consistent with Parliament's purpose \[109\].

**Evaluation of avoidance - licence premium**  
The Court proceeded on the basis that the expenditure on the licence premium was incurred when the promissory notes were executed \[119\]; however, that was a jurisprudential rather than commercial meaning of "incurred" \[118\] The Court considered that the giving of the promissory notes before expenditure had been incurred introduced an artificial element into the arrangement \[119\].

The amounts paid in comparison to the licence premium raised questions over whether the transaction would be profitable in business terms \[121\].

The clarity of the tax advantage was in marked contrast to the obscurity of the prospect of any ultimate commercial profit. This led to the conclusion that the primary, if not sole purpose of the promissory note, was to generate a tax deduction for the licence premium \[122\].

The other feature supporting the conclusion of tax avoidance was the timing difference between the incurring and the commercial payment of the licence premium, such that under the arrangement the appellants would receive the benefits of tax deductions but probably never incur the real expenditure \[127\].

**Evaluation of avoidance - insurance**  
The formation of a special, single purpose company to undertake the insurance risk in a tax haven, gives rise to immediate issues about the true purpose of what is being done \[132\]. The evidence suggested that CSI was not intended to be anything more than a pro forma vehicle for obtaining the anticipated tax benefits \[138\].

Dr Muir was also at pains to try to avoid disclosing the true substance of what CSI did \[145\].

The letter of comfort given to CSI by the Trinity Foundation Charitable Trust (the ultimate beneficial owner of the Trinity Foundation), led to a substantial element of circularity in the whole insurance arrangement, which fact alone led to a strong inference that the insurance was simply a method whereby substantial tax benefits could be obtained by deducting one lump sum in 1997, a premium not payable in commercial terms until 2047 \[146\].

The plaintiffs' argument that the execution of the promissory note was done to give CSI a readier means of enforcing payment than if it had simply been left to sue in contract was not accepted as being the principal purpose of the promissory note, there being no transfer of real value to the creditor by substituting one form of obligation for another. The promissory note did not pay the second premium in any real sense. CSI undertook no real risk and was simply a vehicle to achieve the deductibility of a premium which was not truly paid \[147\].

The Court viewed the insurance dimension of the Trinity scheme as both artificial and contrived, and the insurance arrangements, as constructed, could not have been within the contemplation of Parliament when it enacted section DL 1(3). The insurance dimension was a material contributor to making the whole Trinity scheme a tax avoidance arrangement.

**Avoidance - conclusion**  
The appellants' use of the specific provisions was not within Parliament's purpose and contemplation when it authorised deductions of the kinds in question. The appellants altered the incidence of income tax by means of a tax avoidance arrangement which the Commissioner correctly treated as void against him \[156\].

**Novel point**  
The Court declined to allow the new point raised by Accent Management Limited to be taken, giving as reasons that leave had not been granted to raise that point, nor would it have been appropriate to grant leave at the hearing in the face of opposition by the Commissioner \[151\].

**Participation**  
All appellants entered into a tax avoidance arrangement simply by becoming members of the syndicate and parties to the agreements with Trinity 3 \[159\]. On the ordinary meaning of the "any person affected by that arrangement" and "that person" in section GB 1, once the existence of a tax avoidance arrangement has been established, all those taxpayers who have benefited from it may be subject to corrective adjustments by the Commissioner; the taxpayer need not even be aware of the tax avoidance aspect \[164\] or directly involved \[168\]. A taxpayer who claims a deduction in terms of a tax avoidance arrangement can hardly claim not to be affected by the arrangement \[168\].

**Reconstruction**  
The appellants had not established that the Commissioner adopted a reconstruction which was outside the scope of his powers \[170\]. It is settled law that the onus is on the taxpayers to demonstrate not only that the reconstruction is wrong, but also by how much it is wrong, and in this case the appellants had done neither. In particular, the appellants had not submitted any particular reconstruction of their own which the Court could then have evaluated \[171\].

**Penalties**  
While the expenditure for the licence premium and insurance premium satisfied the ordinary meaning of the specific provisions relied on for claiming the deductions this was not enough on its own. Features of the arrangement led the Court to conclude that the arrangement was clearly a tax avoidance arrangement, with the effect under section 141D(6) that the appellants in their returns took an incorrect tax position under a general anti-avoidance tax law \[182\]. The appellants' tax position failed to meet the required standard of "about as likely as not to be correct" \[203\].  
  
Due to the wording of the statute (the qualification in section 141D(7)(b) reinforced by section 141D(7)(b)(ii)), the dominant purpose to be considered was the dominant purpose of the arrangement itself, not the dominant purpose in the mind of each taxpayer.

It followed that the appellants each took an abusive tax position, and subject to particular further arguments from three appellants, were liable for the 100 percent penalty imposed by the legislation.

**Double penalties**  
The argument advanced by Ben Nevis and Greenmass was not accepted, with the Court sharing the view of the Court of Appeal that the language of the definition of "tax shortfall" covered the position of each LAQC, and nothing in the Act enabled the Court to read down the words of the definition \[214\]. The Court observed that the double penalty issue had been subsequently addressed by the enactment of section 141FC of the TAA \[215\].

The argument advanced by Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited that its own ultimate position was not to claim a loss was not in point, and viewed as a whole Redcliffe's return involved taking a tax position in relation to the Trinity scheme which resulted in too little tax being paid by Redcliffe's shareholders. This was a tax shortfall and Redcliffe was correctly held liable to a shortfall penalty \[218\].

Appeals dismissed and costs to the respondent.

Survey shows businesses spending less time on tax
=================================================

**16 November 2016**

Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse and Small Business Minister Craig Foss today welcomed a survey showing small businesses are continuing to spend less time on tax compliance.

“Inland Revenue’s emphasis on providing customer-centric services that enable businesses to spend less time on compliance and more on growth is paying dividends,” Mr Woodhouse says.

A recent Inland Revenue (IR) survey shows the median time SMEs spent within their business on tax compliance was 27 hours, 25% less than in 2013, while the cost of doing the work had reduced from $2076 three years ago to $1573, down by 24%.

“This follows similar reductions in the 2013 survey, when compared with the 2009 survey and is a great validation of the work IR continues to do to make tax obligations easier for businesses,” Mr Woodhouse says.

The survey also found the most time consuming part of tax compliance work for SMEs was recording information, which accounted for just under half the amount of time. The most time-consuming tax type was GST, which required a median of 14 hours’ work (down from 24 hours in 2013).

“While we have seen a decrease in the median number of hours businesses spend on GST, further improvements in the area are expected once a range of digital enhancements to GST filing are introduced early next year,” Mr Woodhouse says.

“The Government also recently announced changes which will streamline how businesses and payroll providers file PAYE information and I am confident these changes will see an even greater decrease in the time and cost being spent on tax compliance.”

Mr Foss says the Government is committed to delivering services and systems that make compliance easier and less costly for businesses.

“The tax system is a key issue for New Zealand’s small businesses — it’s consistently raised with me by business owners, local chambers and business associations up and down the country,” Mr Foss says.

“The Government continuously works to improve the economic and regulatory environment so business owners spend less time on things like tax and more time focussed on the business of being in business.

“This survey shows we’re heading in the right direction.”

====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

What

How a savings suspension affects employee deductions and employer contributions for KiwiSaver

Who

Employers

When

You're given an approved savings suspension notice.

*   Your KiwiSaver employees can apply for a temporary break from paying into their KiwiSaver account. It’s called a ‘savings suspension’.
*   An approved savings suspension means you stop employee deductions and your contributions.
*   Employees apply for the suspension in myIR.

[Apply for a savings suspension (employees)](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/making-changes-to-my-kiwisaver/taking-a-savings--break)

Savings suspension notices
--------------------------

We approve your employee’s savings suspension. Once we have, we send a savings suspension notice to you and your employee.

The notice has dates showing how long the suspension is for. The suspension applies from your employee’s next payment of salary or wages.

When you have a copy of the notice stop:

*   deducting KiwiSaver contributions from their pay
*   compulsory employer contributions (CEC) and ESCT payments.

Suspension notices and your employer contributions
--------------------------------------------------

On the dates shown in the savings suspension notice you can stop:

*   making compulsory employer contributions (CEC)
*   paying employer superannuation contributions tax (ESCT). 

You can still make employer contributions to your employee’s KiwiSaver scheme. It's your choice. If you do, you pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on the contributions.

When a suspension notice is ending
----------------------------------

Employees can ask you to re-start their KiwiSaver deductions. They can do this before the end date on their suspension notice.

Sometimes employees apply for another savings suspension towards the end of their current notice. We’ll let you know if they do.

Close to the end of your employee’s savings suspension, we’ll notify you of the date you re-start:

*   KiwiSaver deductions from your employee’s pay
*   compulsory employer contributions (CEC) and ESCT payments.

Your employee cannot suspend or start their KiwiSaver deductions too often. The minimum period before they can ask for changes, unless you agree otherwise, is 3 months.

New employees with a savings suspension
---------------------------------------

New employees who tell you they're on a savings suspension must give you their approved savings suspension notice.

If they cannot give you a valid savings suspension notice, you’ll have to:

*   deduct KiwiSaver contributions from their pay
*   pay compulsory employer contributions and employer superannuation contributions tax (ESCT).

When your new employee gives you a valid savings suspension notice after they've started:

*   refund them any deductions you’ve yet to pass on to us
*   let your employee know they'll need to ask us for a refund of deductions you’ve passed on to us
*   we’ll refund your compulsory employer contributions, you do not have to do anything to tell us.

You'll need to apply for a refund from us of any employer superannuation contribution tax you’ve paid. You can do this by either:

*   filling in an Employment information amendments - IR344 form
*   contacting us.

The Government will consider all feedback and make decisions about future information-sharing. Further information, when available, will be published on Inland Revenue's tax policy website. Home Kia ora, welcome! The Government want to hear your views about a proposal for government agencies to share information that may help tackle serious crime. Currently, Inland Revenue is allowed to provide resources and expertise to certain enforcement agencies to help detect and prevent organised crime. However, taxpayer secrecy rules prevent Inland Revenue from sharing the information it holds with other enforcement agencies. Sharing information between Inland Revenue and other enforcement agencies might be an advantage in dealing with serious crime. All agencies would still need to ensure safeguards are in place to protect people’s privacy.

The Government will consider all feedback and make decisions about future information-sharing. Further information, when available, will be published on Inland Revenue's tax policy website. Overview Inland Revenue currently provides resources and expertise to certain enforcement agencies to help prevent and detect organised crime. However, taxpayer secrecy rules prevent Inland Revenue from sharing information with other enforcement agencies. One of the aims of the Government’s Better Public Services reforms is to ensure the public sector works better together across agencies to support New Zealanders, and is much more efficient. Last year, the Prime Minister set 10 challenging results for departments to work together to achieve over the next three to five years. Two of these are about reducing crime rates and reducing reoffending. Making better use of information gathered, and sharing information between government agencies, while still protecting people’s privacy, is an important contributor to cross- agency co-operation and the Government’s goals of reducing crime. The Government proposes that Inland Revenue may share information with other enforcement agencies where it might be an advantage in dealing with serious crime. Strict processes would be required to protect taxpayers’ privacy. While Inland Revenue does not often come across serious crimes in its day-to-day business, it may sometimes Join the discussion Latest Comments Beware of frauds people! It Beware of frauds people!

Expanding the information Inland Revenue shares with other government agencies raises several issues. Confidentiality is an important aspect of how comfortable taxpayers feel about providing information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue also needs to focus on its core tax role. The Government is therefore considering information-sharing only if there are clear benefits to society. Under this proposal that means limiting information- sharing to situations that support law enforcement tackling cases of serious crime, such as: when the offence is committed by an individual and is punishable by imprisonment of four years or more; or if a similarly serious offence is committed by a body corporate which would be punishable by imprisonment of four years or more if it had been committed by an individual when there are reasonable grounds for the agency identifying the possible offence to suspect that a serious offence has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed when there are reasonable grounds for Inland Revenue to suspect the information it has is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence of, a serious offence that has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed when Inland Revenue is satisfied that: –the information is readily available within Inland Revenue –it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information –it is in the public interest to communicate the information.

Forums Scenario 1: Investor Fraud GST refund audit identifies possible investor fraud During a routine GST refund audit, it becomes apparent to investigators that an entity is lending funds on very unfavourable terms (for example very high interest rates) to borrowers who are less likely to be able to repay the loan. Investors therefore may not have a true idea of the risk level of their investment in the company. Under the current rules, Inland Revenue cannot share this information. Under the proposed rules, Inland Revenue would be able to provide information on the entity and its transactions, (and associated parties to the transaction) to the Police and the Financial Markets Authority because there are reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud is being committed.

Under the current rules, Inland Revenue cannot share this information. Under the proposed rules, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment could request relevant wage and salary information held by Inland Revenue for these workers.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim. There needs to be a suitable framework or specialist (i.e. trained) area in Inland Revenue to identify the fraud risk. Also, the hit rate should be reviewed by another agency / external auditor. Submitted by uchiacon on Wed, 10/04/2013 - 11:32am. It is not the IRD's It is not the IRD's responsibility to stop investor fraud. It is the responsibility of the investors and the appropriate authorities. We cannot have incompetent IRD staff digging into every entities' records on the grounds they satisfy some kind of lending irregularities, regardless of whether or not they're legal. Submitted by oldk1w1 on Mon, 06/05/2013 - 2:00pm. Investor Fraud It may well be, uchiacon, that IRD is the only place where a particular fraud or type of fraud can be identified. Investor fraud hurt by publicity - we're talking animals, reptiles and insects here, not humans. Aren't the banks a main source of alerts of suspicion? I would have expected the banks rather than the IRD would be able to spot cash frauds (the purchaser who takes out $20k in cash could well be avoiding GST/income tax) but the problem is how the IRD No sense your comment doenst make any sense at all, first of all New Zealand doesnt have a problem of "ilegal migration" and if they exist ird shouldnt be puting any resources in place to solve that, other Businesses and Companies should allow IRD to Businesses and Companies should openly offer work related information to the IRD with regard to Missing Person Information Requests When Inland Revenue identifies possible investor fraud, it should notify the appropriate authorities | Targeting Serious Crime https://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz/comment/151\[24/10/2013 10:48:02\] Submitted by kd700 on Tue, 07/05/2013 - 4:16pm. People who cheat and defraud others need to be caught. IRD has skilled and competent auditors who deal with tax cheats all the time. I agree that additional good training is necessary to make sure IRD is using the limited resources it has on correctly identifying investor fraud and being able to pass that info on the SFO and other authorities..

I would have expected the banks rather than the IRD would be able to spot cash frauds (the purchaser who takes out $20k in cash could well be avoiding GST/income tax) but the problem is how the IRD deal with it - innocent until proven guilty may not apply in the public's eyes, and with the additional fear of payments mis-allocated in the IRD (it happens a lot!) I wonder if the data they are relying on for their suspicions can be assumed to be accurate. Submitted by heidianderson on Sat, 22/06/2013 - 12:11am. Beware of frauds people!

Law enforcement officials and the Better Business Bureau are reporting increased activity nationwide in the number of complaints about people who sell things door-to-door and never deliver the promised goods, among other things. Intimidating sales tactics are employed by some of the perpetrators to get people to shell out for whatever good or service they’re selling.Some of which are scamming people out of hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars, leaving them at risk of needing to get cash assistance to survive.

Cross-government information- sharing might occur between only two government departments, a group of related departments, or between all of them. Information This term describes the material and data that a government department or agency holds about a citizen or taxpayer. This information might be supplied by the citizen or taxpayer or collected or generated by the government department or agency during the course of its duties. This term can also describe the material a government department or agency holds about the operational aspects of its business. Integrity of the tax system The integrity of the tax system is a concept that describes the key qualities of how the tax system operates and is perceived to operate. The integrity of the tax system is described in Section 6 of The Tax Administration Act 1994 as being the equal responsibility of all taxpayers and all government staff and its representatives. Further, Section 6 advises the integrity of the tax system includes: taxpayers’ perceptions of the system’s integrity; taxpayers’ compliance with the tax system; taxpayers’ rights to confidentiality and fairness; and the responsibility of those administering the law to ensure confidentiality and fairness. Non-compliance Term used to describe the actions of a specific taxpayer or business. Non-compliance is when taxpayers do not fulfil their obligations to file returns and pay tax, or wrongly claim refunds or entitlements. Non-compliance can be deliberate – for instance, failing to pay tax - or accidental, for example, filing a GST return late so the response can differ. The term can also be used to describe the proportion of such activities within a given population. For example, New Zealanders have low levels of non-compliance. Serious crime This term refers to the types of crime for which offenders can be punished by four or more years in prison. These types of crimes range from the bribery and corruption of officials, to forging cheques and other documents, to money laundering, to importing and distributing drugs, to interpersonal violence and murder. Tax secrecy This term refers to the way Inland Revenue treats the information it holds. Information that Inland Revenue holds is currently treated as ‘tax secret’ under Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Although there are specific exceptions, this means Inland Revenue does not share the information it holds with any other government department, agency, or other organisations.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim.

The financial marketing authority was set up with investor protection. I ask why prospectuses issued by the debt issuer lodged with the companies office were no policied by the FMA afterall alot of funding by way of company registertrations go there way. I also call to account the registered auditors of the debt issuer...can this scenerio develop in the real world post 2013 legistaion? Submitted by No Way on Wed, 10/04/2013 - 3:03pm. The sole purpose of the IRD The sole purpose of the IRD should remain as tax collector not crime fighter. Allowing IRD to share taxpayer information with other agencies is likely to have a long term detrimental effect on society's interests as it will erode public confidence in the integrity of the tax system and cause those businesses already acting illegally to not pay tax, which I believe some currently do. This government was meant to reduce the intrusion of government into business instead it appears to be seeking to be more intrusive - using society interests as the scapegoat. Submitted by dufuss on Thu, 11/04/2013 - 6:38pm. What a bunch of awful ideas All these ideas are a great way to undermine the integrity of both the tax system and trust in government in general. People will want to hide their affairs from IRD on the presumption that IRD can be trusted even less than they can be today. And if IRD, the bastion of confidentiality/privacy that it is supposed to be, wants to spread your hurt by publicity - we're talking animals, reptiles and insects here, not humans. Aren't the banks a main source of alerts of suspicion? I would have expected the banks rather than the IRD would be able to spot cash frauds (the purchaser who takes out $20k in cash could well be avoiding GST/income tax) but the problem is how the IRD No sense your comment doenst make any sense at all, first of all New Zealand doesnt have a problem of "ilegal migration" and if they exist ird shouldnt be puting any resources in place to solve that, other Businesses and Companies should allow IRD to Businesses and Companies should openly offer work related information to the IRD with regard to Missing Person Information Requests Sharing Inland Revenue's information to address investor fraud is in society's interests | Targeting Serious Crime https://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz/investor-fraud-forum3\[24/10/2013 10:49:35\] About this site Discussion document General questions Conditions of use Your privacy Contact us Glossary Keep up to date RSS feeds View the list For more information on government services go to info around then odds are every other department is thinking about it too.

Immigration The Department of labour inspectors, if they had resources to do their job at all, would be better placed to do this.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim. There needs to be a suitable framework or specialist (i.e. trained) area in Inland Revenue to identify the fraud risk. Also, the hit rate should be reviewed by another agency / external auditor.

People who cheat and defraud others need to be caught. IRD has skilled and competent auditors who deal with tax cheats all the time.

One of the biggest issues here is the education, skills and ability for Inland Revenue to correctly identify a liklihood of a fraud risk existing. The example provided sounds more legitimate than fraudulent - there are lots of businesses that lend to companies and individuals where their creditworthiness is not good (i.e. there is a high chance the principal will nto be repaid) which justifies the high interest rates. This would require Inland Revenue to have a good understanding of the business first (which while is improving, has a long way to go). By asserting that a taxpayer is conducting fraud which turns out to be incorrect can be very damaging and costly (time consuming) to a taxpayer in defending the claim. There needs to be a suitable framework or specialist (i.e. trained) area in Inland Revenue to identify the fraud risk. Also, the hit rate should be reviewed by another agency / external auditor. Submitted by uchiacon on Wed, 10/04/2013 - 11:32am. It is not the IRD's It is not the IRD's responsibility to stop investor fraud. It is the responsibility of the investors and the appropriate authorities. We cannot have incompetent IRD staff digging into every entities' records on the grounds they satisfy some kind of lending irregularities, regardless of whether or not they're legal. Submitted by oldk1w1 on Mon, 06/05/2013 - 2:00pm. Investor Fraud It may well be, uchiacon, that IRD is the only place where a particular fraud or type of fraud can be identified. Investor fraud hurt by publicity - we're talking animals, reptiles and insects here, not humans. Aren't the banks a main source of alerts of suspicion? I would have expected the banks rather than the IRD would be able to spot cash frauds (the purchaser who takes out $20k in cash could well be avoiding GST/income tax) but the problem is how the IRD No sense your comment doenst make any sense at all, first of all New Zealand doesnt have a problem of "ilegal migration" and if they exist ird shouldnt be puting any resources in place to solve that, other Businesses and Companies should allow IRD to Businesses and Companies should openly offer work related information to the IRD with regard to Missing Person Information Requests When Inland Revenue identifies possible investor fraud, it should notify the appropriate authorities | Targeting Serious Crime https://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz/comment/145\[24/10/2013 10:51:47\] Submitted by kd700 on Tue, 07/05/2013 - 4:16pm. People who cheat and defraud others need to be caught. IRD has skilled and competent auditors who deal with tax cheats all the time. I agree that additional good training is necessary to make sure IRD is using the limited resources it has on correctly identifying investor fraud and being able to pass that info on the SFO and other authorities.. Submitted by kedge on Thu, 30/05/2013 - 1:37pm. Aren't the banks a main source of alerts of suspicion? I would have expected the banks rather than the IRD would be able to spot cash frauds (the purchaser who takes out $20k in cash could well be avoiding GST/income tax) but the problem is how the IRD deal with it - innocent until proven guilty may not apply in the public's eyes, and with the additional fear of payments mis-allocated in the IRD (it happens a lot!) I wonder if the data they are relying on for their suspicions can be assumed to be accurate. Submitted by heidianderson on Sat, 22/06/2013 - 12:11am. Beware of frauds people!

Tauranga woman gets 3 years 7 months in jail for elaborate tax fraud
====================================================================

**31 August 2017**

A Tauranga woman who created an elaborate scheme to defraud taxpayers of nearly $3 million has been sentenced to prison for three years and seven months.

Karina Charmaine Knedler, 31, was sentenced today in Tauranga District Court on 19 charges of using a document, and using forged documents. The charges mostly related to false GST refund claims for several fictitious businesses which never actually traded. These offences resulted in her receiving more than $1.1 million in refunds.

Inland Revenue Group Manager Investigations and Advice Patrick Goggin said Knedler created an extremely complex scheme to rip-off taxpayers. During 2015 and 2016, Knedler filed numerous faIse GST returns on behalf of Fitonez Limited, claiming a refund was due.

In total, 21 fraudulent GST returns were filed, and the defendant provided forged invoices and bank statements to support the claims. Some of the refund claims related to fictitious property transactions in the millions of dollars.

“Knedler was calculating, devious, and quite relentless in her pursuit of money to which she wasn’t entitled,” Mr Goggin said. “Even when returns were being questioned, she produced numerous forged documents and conflicting explanations to back what became an increasingly elaborate web of deceit.”

Even while Knedler was being investigated in respect of Fitonez Limited, she commenced a series of new fraudulent offending relating to other fictitious companies set up using different personal identities.

“This defendant’s behaviour clearly showed brazen disregard for the tax system. She thought it was fine to repeatedly try to rip off millions in taxpayers’ money that goes towards funding vital social services.

“She used the money she received to fund overseas travel, construction of a residential property and costs associated with setting up her business activities, among other things. In short, she showed utter contempt for honest New Zealanders who do the right thing and pay their fair share of tax.”

In addition to the GST offences, Knedler also committed fraud by making false Working for Families tax credits claims, involving the use of a forged birth certificate, while married to and living with her children’s father. This meant she received nearly $70,000 she wasn’t entitled to for children that were in her care since 2010.

Inland Revenue will be exploring every available action to recover money Knedler had stolen from taxpayers, Mr Goggin said.

Knedler had her sentence reduced by four months on appeal. However, she subsequently pleaded guilty to new charges for which she was sentenced to a further 12 months in prison.
